Nor do DAWN estimates take into account the increases in the population or in ED use between 2004 and 2006.|$|E

50|$|Another troubling {{issue was}} that the patents had two years to run, so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{unlikely}} that the final judgment could occur during {{the life of the}} patents. Some justices wondered whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to decide the case in light of this factor.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to {{consider}} {{that the degree of}} ion suppression may be dependent on the concentration of the analyte being monitored. A higher analyte/matrix ratio can give a reduced effect of ion suppression.|$|E
25|$|Experts in pain {{management}} attribute the under-distribution of morphine to an unwarranted {{fear of the}} drug's potential for addiction and abuse. While morphine is clearly addictive, Western doctors believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to use the drug and then wean the patient off when the treatment is over.|$|E
25|$|India has {{to decide}} whether it wants to keep the tiger or not. It {{has to decide}} if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to keep its National Symbol, its icon, {{representing}} wildlife. It has to decide {{if it wants to}} keep its natural heritage for future generations, a heritage more important than the cultural one, whether we speak of its temples, the Taj Mahal, or others, because once destroyed it cannot be replaced.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the {{photoelectric}} effect {{is associated with}} Albert Einstein, who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905, an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons {{is proportional to the}} frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of quanta, for the first time.|$|E
25|$|IT security: Sometimes {{referred}} to as computer security, information technology security (IT security) is information security applied to technology (most often some form of computer system). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to note that a computer {{does not necessarily mean}} a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach into critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.|$|E
25|$|Dorothy Robinson {{reviewed}} {{data from}} jurisdictions where helmet use increased following legislation, {{and concluded that}} helmet laws did not demonstrably reduce cyclists' head injuries. Mayer Hillman, a transport and road safety analyst from the UK, {{does not support the}} use of helmets, reasoning that they are of very limited value {{in the event of a}} collision with a car, that risk compensation negates their protective effect and because he feels their promotion implicitly shifts responsibility of care to the cyclist. He also cautions against placing the recommendations of surgeons above other expert opinion in the debate, comparing it to drawing conclusions on whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to buy lottery tickets by sampling only a group of prizewinners. The prominent UK-based cycling activist John Franklin is skeptical of the merits of helmets, regarding proactive measures including bike maintenance and riding skills as being more important. Cyclists' representative groups complain that focus on helmets diverts attention from other issues which are much more important for improving bicycle safety, such as road danger reduction, training, roadcraft, and bicycle maintenance.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead thus sees God and {{the world}} as {{fulfilling}} one another. [...] He sees entities {{in the world as}} fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time. [...] On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities, and requires the world to actualize them. [...] God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change. [...] Here <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to quote Whitehead at length: ...|$|E
500|$|One {{can define}} other number systems using {{different}} rules or new objects; in some such number systems, the above proofs {{would need to}} be reinterpreted and one might find that, in a given number system, 0.999... and 1 might not be identical. However, many number systems are extensions of —rather than independent alternatives to— the real number system, so 0.999... = 1 continues to hold. Even in such number systems, though, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to examine alternative number systems, not only for how 0.999... behaves (if, indeed, a number expressed as [...] "0.999..." [...] is both meaningful and unambiguous), but also for the behavior of related phenomena. If such phenomena differ from those in the real number system, then {{at least one of the}} assumptions built into the system must break down.|$|E
500|$|To the Griffins' (mainly Lois') surprise, {{many people}} turn {{up for the}} first worship service, much to the {{annoyance}} of Brian, who dislikes the idea that Peter is a religious leader (likely due to Brian being an atheist). In order to stop Peter from continuing his new religion, Brian joins forces with Francis {{to find a way to}} deter people from worshiping the Fonz. Three representatives from other religions show up to the services of the Church of the Fonz. The first informs people that he has formed the Church of George Jefferson (from All in the Family) and a good portion of the congregation leaves with him. The second claims to have created the Church of Captain Stubing (from The Love Boat) and another chunk of the congregation leaves with him. The third person is Kirk Cameron and Peter assumes that Cameron is there to announce the formation of the Church of Mike Seaver (Cameron's character on Growing Pains), but Cameron lets him know that he's only here to convert people back to Christianity and the remainder of the congregation leaves with him. Back at home, Lois comforts Peter, who is upset at the failure of his Church, by telling him that if his church embraced the Fonz's values of friendship, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile,</b> but Peter highly doubts it and Peter converts back to Christianity, however the scene shifts and Francis is shown looking at a picture of the Fonz, puts it down on a table, gets on his knees as if to pray, and claps to the beat of [...] "Rock Around the Clock" [...] as the episode ends.|$|E

2500|$|Editorially, Raymond {{sought a}} niche between Greeley's open {{partisanship}} and Bennett's party-neutrality. In {{the first issue}} of the Times Raymond announced his purpose to write in temperate and measured language and to get into a passion as rarely as possible. [...] "There are few things in this world which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to get angry about; and they are just the things anger will not improve." [...] In controversy he meant to avoid abusive language. His editorials were generally cautious, impersonal, and finished in form.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} first letter Eabhadh, the forfeda do not appear often in {{orthodox}} ogham inscriptions. Eabhadh was in fact frequently used {{as part of the}} formula word KOI ᚕᚑᚔ, but with the value /k/ or /x/. KOI means something like 'here' and is the ogham equivalent of the Latin HIC IACIT (McManus §5.3, 1991). It also appears with its vocalic value in later orthodox inscriptions however. Of the other forfeda the next three appear only a few times, and the last letter Eamhancholl does not appear at all. So rare are the other forfeda in inscriptions that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> detailing the individual examples (numbering as given by Macalister): ...|$|E
