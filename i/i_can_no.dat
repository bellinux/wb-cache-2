25|$|Timothy Hutton plays Archie Goodwin, and I can't see {{how anyone}} could do a better job. Not only does he catch Archie's snap-brim Thirties tone with sharp-eared precision, but he also bears an uncanny {{physical}} resemblance to the dapper detective-narrator I've been envisioning all these years. No sooner did Hutton make his first entrance in The Golden Spiders than he melded completely with the Archie of my mind's eye. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer read a Stout novel without seeing him, or hearing his voice.|$|E
25|$|In his Florentine {{tax return}} of August 1469, Uccello declared, “I find myself old and ailing, {{my wife is}} ill, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer work.” In {{the last years of}} his life, Paolo was a lonesome and {{forgotten}} man who was afraid of hardship in life. His last known work is The Hunt, c. 1470. He made his testament on 11 November 1475 and died shortly afterwards on 10 December 1475 at the hospital of Florence, at the age of 78. He was buried in his father’s tomb in the Florentine church of Santo Spirito.|$|E

25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
500|$|A {{landmark}} event during Mendelssohn's Leipzig {{years was}} {{the premiere of}} his oratorio St. Paul, given at the Lower Rhenish Festival in Düsseldorf in 1836, shortly {{after the death of}} the composer's father, which much affected him; Felix wrote that he would [...] "never cease to endeavour to gain his approval although <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer enjoy it". St. Paul seemed to many of Mendelssohn's contemporaries to be his finest work, and sealed his European reputation.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} Stiffelio (attributable not {{least to the}} censors of the time taking offence at the taboo subject of the {{supposed}} adultery of a clergyman's wife and interfering with the text and roles) incited Verdi to take pains to rework it, although even in the completely recycled version of Aroldo (1857) it still failed to please. Rigoletto, with its intended murder of royalty, and its sordid attributes, also upset the censors. Verdi would not compromise: What does the sack matter to the police? Are they worried about the effect it will produce?...Do they think they know better than I?...I see the hero has been made no longer ugly and hunchbacked!! Why? [...] A singing hunchback...why not?...I think it splendid to show this character as outwardly deformed and ridiculous, and inwardly passionate and full of love. I chose the subject for these very qualities...if they are removed <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer set it to music.|$|E

Chamberlin subsequently stated that his departure from the band is [...] "a positive move forward for me. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer commit all of my energy into something that I don't fully possess." [...] Chamberlin stressed that the split was amicable, commenting, [...] "I am glad [...] has chosen to continue under the name. It is his right." [...] Chamberlin soon formed the band Skysaw, which has released an album and toured in support of Minus the Bear. In July 2009, Billy Corgan formed a new group called Spirits in the Sky, initially as a tribute band to Sky Saxon of The Seeds, who had recently died. The following month Corgan confirmed on the band's website that 19-year-old Spirits in the Sky drummer Mike Byrne had replaced Chamberlin and that the pair was working on new Pumpkins recordings.|$|E
500|$|Mouton's 1982 season {{started with}} a big {{accident}} at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve {{in the small town}} Briançonnet in Provence, she missed a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110km/h (70mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair's injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when she slid into a snow bank, and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota's Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she tried to think of the large crowds right {{by the side of the}} route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter Röhrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader Röhrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: [...] "I'm afraid that something might break in my car and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer avoid hitting a spectator." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bradstreet {{challenged}} Puritan beliefs {{by announcing}} her complete infatuation with her husband, Simon Bradstreet. In a Puritan society it was improper to glorify romantic love.

[...] Her deep passions {{can be found}} again in [...] "A Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment."

2500|$|Film {{producer}} and [...] "old-fashioned mogul" [...] Allan Carr used his networking abilities to promote The Deer Hunter. [...] "Exactly how Allan Carr came into The Deer Hunters orbit <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer remember," [...] recalled producer Deeley, [...] "but the picture became a crusade to him. He nagged, charmed, threw parties, he created word-of-mouth– {{everything that could}} be done in Hollywood to promote a project. Because he had no apparent motive for this promotion, it had an added power and legitimacy and it finally did start to penetrate the minds of the Universal's sales people that they actually had in their hands something a bit more significant than the usual." [...] Deeley added that Carr's promotion of the film was influential in positioning The Deer Hunter for Oscar nominations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{result was}} never {{likely in the}} 4th Supertest at Bourda. When the Australians landed at Guyana they {{discovered}} it had been raining for days. On the scheduled first day play was abandoned before the players had even left for the ground. That evening the pitch was still underwater. On the second day {{the rain had stopped}} and it was hot and sunny. Yet the two captains, Chappell and Lloyd, decided the condition of the outfield was unfit for play, Greg Chappell describing it as a [...] "quagmire". Unfortunately for the cricketers and officials at Bourda, thousands of spectators had been allowed into the ground that morning. Ian Chappell recalls how he was visited in the dressing-rooms by the local Chief of Police and told, [...] "If there is no play today, I am afraid to tell you that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>no</b> longer guarantee your safety at the ground." [...] The consensus was that there must, therefore, be some sort of play. The captains and umpires agreed to start play at 4pm and play for roughly an hour until the light faded. However a misinformed PA announced to the crowd that play would begin at 3pm. This enraged the volatile Chappell who then reneged on the deal and refused to play. The crowd, many of whom had been drinking rum and partying all day, sensed no play and began a riot. Both teams and the officials were locked in their dressing rooms. The Australians donned their new batting helmets and took guard with their bats, behind the bolted door. The rioters attacked the pavilion causing major damage and a couple of unnamed West Indian cricketers suffered minor injuries from broken glass. Chappell recalls a conversation after the event with West Indian wicketkeeper Deryck Murray. Murray insisted that the riot was a result of growing unhappiness at the Guyanan president Arthur Chung and that they used the abandoned cricket as an excuse. He believed that the rioters would never have intentionally harmed any of the cricketers. The words reassured some of the Australians, but many wanted to leave Guyana immediately and head to the next island, while some (about eight, which is half the squad) were considering returning to Australia. Chappell demanded his players stay and play, making a statement to the West Indian fans that they are not intimidated and will play to win. Play proceeded on the third morning as if nothing had happened. The ground was cleared of broken glass and the game played out to a draw with a century from Greg Chappell confirming his status as the outstanding batsman of the series.|$|E
