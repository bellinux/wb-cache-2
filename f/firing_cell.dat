Changes in temperature {{of up to}} several degrees {{have been reported in}} different brain regions during various behaviors or in response to environmental stimuli. We investigated temperature {{sensitivity of}} dopaminergic neurons of the rat substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), an area important for motor and emotional control, using a combination of electrophysiological techniques, microfluorometry, and RT-PCR in brain slices. Spontaneous neuron <b>firing,</b> <b>cell</b> membrane potential/currents, and intracellular Ca 2 level ([Ca 2]i) were measured during cooling by 10 ° and warming by 5 ° from 34 °C. Cooling evoked slowing of <b>firing,</b> <b>cell</b> membrane hyperpolarization, increase in cell input resistance, an outward current under voltage clamp, and a decrease of [Ca 2]i. Warming induced an increase in firing frequency, a decrease in input resistance, an inward current, and a rise in [Ca 2]i.

Computational models argue that such cell assemblies are a feature of a minimal network architecture of the striatum [3]. This suggests that cell assemblies can be a potential candidate for representation of the ‘system states ’ in the framework of reinforcement learning. Spike patterns associated with cells assemblies can be identified by clustering the spectrum of zero-lag crosscorrelation between all pairs of neurons in a network [3]. Other methods based on the dimensionality reduction of the similarity matrix of the spike trains have also been used [2, 4].

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{perceived}} {{that there is}} a problem in giving a naturalistic account of mental representation that deals adequately with meaning, interpretation or significance (semantic content). It is suggested here that this problem may arise partly from the conflation of two vernacular senses of representation: representation-as-origin and representation-as-input. The flash of a neon sign may in one sense represent a popular drink, but to function as representation it must provide an input to a ‘consumer’ in the street. The arguments presented draw on two principles – the neuron doctrine and the need for a venue for ‘presentation’ or ‘reception’ of a representation at a specified site, consistent with the locality principle. It is also argued that domains of representation cannot be defined by signal traffic, since they can be expected to include ‘null’ elements based on non-firing cells. In this analysis, mental representations-as-origin are distributed patterns of cell firing. Each <b>firing</b> <b>cell</b> is given semantic value in its own right - some form of atomic propositional significance – since different axonal branches may contribute to integration with different populations of signals at different downstream sites. Representations-as-input are patterns of local co-arrival of signals in the form of synaptic potentials in dendrites. Meaning then draws on the relationships between active and null inputs, forming ‘scenarios’ comprising a molecular combination of ‘premises’ from which a new output with atomic propositional significance is generated. In both types of representation, meaning, interpretation or significance pivots on events in an individual cell. (This analysis only applies to ‘occurrent’ representations based on current neural activity.) The concept of representations-as-input emphasises the need for a ‘consumer’ of a representation and the dependence of meaning on the co-relationships involved in an input interaction between signals and consumer. The acceptance of this necessity provides a basis for resolving the problem that representations appear both as distributed (representation-as-origin) and local (representation-as-input). The key implications are that representations in brain are massively multiple both in series and in parallel, and that individual cells play specific semantic roles. These roles are discussed in relation to traditional concepts of ‘gnostic’ cell types...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a silicon {{photomultiplier}} (SiPM), {{also referred}} to as multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC), many Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (GM-APDs) are connected in parallel so as to com-bine the photon counting capabilities of each of these so-called mi-crocells into a proportional light sensor. The discharge of a single microcell is relatively well understood and electronic models exist to simulate this process. In this paper we introduce an extended model that is able to simulate the simultaneous discharge of mul-tiple cells. This model is used to predict the SiPM signal in re-sponse to fast light pulses {{as a function of the}} number of <b>fired</b> <b>cells,</b> taking into account the influence of the input impedance of the SiPM preamplifier. The model predicts that the electronic signal is not proportional to the number of <b>fired</b> <b>cells</b> if the preamplifier input impedance is not zero. This effect becomes more important for SiPMs with lower parasitic capacitance (which otherwise is a favorable property). The model is validated by comparing its pre-dictions to experimental data obtained with two different SiPMs (Hamamatsu S 10362 - 11 - 25 u and Hamamatsu S 10362 - 33 - 25 c) illu-minated with ps laser pulses.

40|$|Screen-printing {{technique}} is used since 1970 ’s, but {{the understanding of}} screen printed contacts is quite poor. Several different models of contact formation exist. Two mechanisms of current transport from bulk semiconductor to bulk metal are proposed but not experimentally proved. Metal/semiconductor (Ag/Si) interface {{is the most important}} part of screen-printed contact and reduction of series resistance between the bulk Ag and the Si wafer has a large potential for solar cell performance improvement. Composition of the silver paste together with firing parameters is the most important players in formation of well conducting metal/semiconductor interface. Commercially available silver pastes which are used for front contacts consist of silver powder, lead-glass frit powder and an organic vehicle. A crucial condition which determines the quality of the contact is firing temperature. During firing, the glass frit plays a critical role as it forms a glassy layer between the Si wafer and the bulk Ag, works as a medium for diffusion of Ag and Pb particles and is responsible for etching the SiN layer. In order to enhance solar cells’ performance it is important to explain how contact formation depends on firing temperature and to improve understanding of electron transport between the Si wafer and the silver contact. In this work, an Ag-Pb based paste was used and peak firing temperature (PFT) was varied in order to get optimally fired (best performance), under fired and over <b>fired</b> (lower performance) <b>cells.</b> Electronic properties of the cells were investigated using a solar simulator and a series resistance mapping technique. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging, Selected Area Diffraction (SAD) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) techniques were used to study the structure and chemistry of the metal/semiconductor interfaces. The results show that in under <b>fired</b> <b>cells</b> the PFT was too low to etch away the SiN layer which works as an insulating layer and impedes current collection. In optimally <b>fired</b> <b>cells</b> the PFT was high enough to partly etch away the SiN layer. In areas with no SiN, glassy layer with many Ag and Pb precipitates is in direct contact with the Si wafer. Distances between precipitates are < 3 nm and current is efficiently collected through tunneling. In over <b>fired</b> <b>cells</b> SiN is completely etched away. Larger Ag crystallites are found on the Si interface. In the vicinity of these crystallites, the number of Ag and Pb precipitates in the glassy phase decreases and particles increase in size.
