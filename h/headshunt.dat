5|$|The railway has two tracks (partly {{located in}} Rome, outside the gateway), {{but only one}} is served by a station platform. Two {{terminal}} load tracks, for freight wagons, are situated on the northeast side of the building. They {{are linked to the}} main track that ends in a <b>headshunt</b> in a tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Bridgnorth {{also has}} a ground frame at the {{northern}} end of the layout allowing movements from the Hollybush siding (which also serves as the <b>headshunt</b> for locomotives running round their trains) {{into and out of the}} Boiler Shop. An Annett's key which unlocks the frame may be obtained by a member of staff when released by a lever in Bridgnorth 'box.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} three platforms. Platforms 1 and 2, which share an island platform, are for {{northbound}} trains: platform 1 is used mainly by trains terminating at Finchley Central (and trains reverse using a <b>headshunt)</b> {{or going to}} Mill Hill East; platform 2 is mainly used by trains going to High Barnet. Platform 3, a side platform, is for southbound trains. All platforms have canopies at {{the northern end of}} the platforms and digital departure boards are also in place (as seen in the first picture).|$|E

50|$|Ieyama Station is a {{manned station}} {{with a single}} island platform, with two <b>headshunts</b> on either side. The rustic wooden station {{building}} is popular with photographers who come to shoot the steam locomotives on the line. It was also used {{as a location for}} a number of movies, including Otoko wa Tsurai yo.|$|R
25|$|For {{most people}} Lyttelton was an {{important}} transfer point for their inter-island journeys. From 1895, and nightly from 1905, an inter-island ferry service operated between Wellington and Lyttelton, providing the main means by which people travelled between the two islands. At Lyttelton, passengers were required to transfer their own luggage between the ferries on the No. 2 wharf and the trains at Lyttelton station. Beginning in 1902, the express trains pulled up beside the ferries on the wharf enabling the direct transfer of passengers and their luggage between the ferries and the trains. To do this, the trains were hauled past Lyttelton station into a <b>headshunt,</b> from which they were moved by a different locomotive around a sharp curve onto the wharf.|$|E

One crane, with its match truck, was kept in the long <b>headshunt</b> at Pilton, the other was put to use in Lynton goods yard.|$|E
2500|$|Compactness: A tank {{locomotive}} is {{shorter than}} the equivalent tender locomotive. [...] This is important in environments with limited space for locomotives, such as the <b>headshunt</b> of a run-round loop.|$|E
5000|$|JR Kanaya Station has a two {{opposing}} side platforms serving Track 1 and Track 2 which are on <b>headshunts,</b> allowing for tracks for express trains {{to pass in}} between. The platforms {{are connected to the}} station building by an underpass. The station building has automated ticket machines, TOICA automated turnstiles and a manned [...] "Green Window" [...] service counter.|$|R
50|$|Dufftown is {{the main}} centre of {{operation}} of the railway {{where there is a}} booking office, waiting room and licensed cafe called the Buffer Stop, which is open during operating season. There are two <b>headshunts</b> and a loop, work is being undertaken to install a new loop at Dufftown so that there can be two tracks going into the new engine shed.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} four non-passenger tracks. Three {{of these are}} <b>headshunts,</b> created in the Northern trainshed to turn {{locomotives}} around: Track A, in between platforms 1 and 2; track B, serving platforms 3 and 4; and track D, for platforms 5 and 6. There is also a platform with no passenger service between platforms 6 and 7, known as platform E, or sometimes affectionately as platform 6¾.|$|R
2500|$|Some GPL's and post-mounted {{shunting}} {{signals are}} fitted with yellow and white lights, instead {{of red and}} white lights. [...] These signals, usually found at the exits of marshaling yards and sidings, display the same aspects with the same meanings as their red and white light equivalents, however these signals can be passed at caution even when not showing an aspect permitting movement, provided that the movement is in a direction for which the signal cannot be cleared (e.g. into a <b>headshunt</b> rather than onto the main line). This arrangement exists to prevent the signals having to be cleared every time a movement to and from a <b>headshunt</b> is made.|$|E
2500|$|Following closure BR {{removed the}} single siding and the <b>headshunt</b> along the old up line formation. [...] The signals were {{recovered}} or scrapped, {{as was the}} lever frame in the signal box. [...] The point rodding, still NER / LNER standard round steel tube coated with tar was simply cut up into short lengths and left where it fell. [...] This presumably helped to support BR's claim {{that the cost of}} reinstating the signalling made re-opening the line too uneconomic.|$|E
2500|$|At {{terminal}} stations trains {{reverse direction}} in the platforms except at Bank {{where there is a}} reversing <b>headshunt</b> in the tunnel beyond the station. Many peak-hour trains on the Lewisham route from Stratford turn back at Canary Wharf. During service disruption or planned engineering work, trains can also turn back at [...] and [...] Trains serve every station on the route, but trains from Bank to Lewisham do not call at West India Quay because they are routed along the diveunder track to avoid junction conflicts. During long-term works for extension projects, other routes may be operated at weekends, such as Beckton to Lewisham if the Bank branch is closed.|$|E
50|$|Milton of Crathes {{station is}} the {{headquarters}} of the Royal Deeside Railway Preservation Society. The station is the start of the rebuilt Royal Deeside Railway which will eventually run for over two miles west into the town of Banchory. The station itself consists of a single platform and two tracks (which form a locomotive run-round loop and <b>headshunts).</b> At the east end of the station, the former Oldmeldrum station building is being re-erected and restored by the volunteers of the Royal Deeside Railway Preservation Society.|$|R
50|$|The {{central point}} of the depot is the rail lines, which are {{embedded}} in the tarmac - similar to a tramway. Road transport enters the depot from a road and can park next to waiting railway wagons. Forklift Trucks and a single railway shunter deal with logistics. The yard benefits {{from a number of}} sidings and <b>headshunts,</b> including a number of tracks that run beneath an overbridge carrying the main line to Chillington Wharf, an old interchange that allowed transfer between rail and barge back {{in the days of the}} industrial canal system in the Midlands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} three platforms. Platform 3 sees only {{occasional}} passenger use, but {{is used for}} stock storage. Platforms 1 and 2 are in regular use. Both are linked to a central locomotive release road. These two platforms and the central release road are all supplied with terminal <b>headshunts,</b> {{all of which are}} linked via a complex tri-directional set of points. Platforms 1 and 2, and the release road, are all protected by an overall station roof. (These platforms were originally numbered 2, 3, and 4, but were re-numbered as 1, 2, and 3 as the original platform 1 had been subsumed into the new Aylsham locomotive depot.) ...|$|R
2500|$|To {{the north}} of the station, a large goods yard was laid out between the station and the River Thames at ground level. [...] Since the station was built {{somewhat}} higher up, the yard had to be reached by a steep incline built {{against the side of the}} viaduct. It sloped down towards a short <b>headshunt,</b> near the river bridge, which allowed switchback access to the yard sidings. This arrangement limited the number of wagons that could be transferred to and from the sidings in one go. In addition to serving the populace of Windsor and surrounding area, the yard provided a depot for Windsor gas works, receiving loads of coal and removing coke and tar.|$|E

5000|$|In 2001 the new {{operator}} embarked upon {{a process}} of restoration of operating facilities at Capel Bangor. The passing loop was restored, as was a single carriage siding, accessed 'out and back' via a lengthy <b>headshunt.</b> Subsequently, the 1980s waiting shelter was demolished, but the single carriage siding was joined by a second, parallel line (accessed via the same <b>headshunt),</b> and a large modern train shed was constructed.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} reopened on 11 February 1925, for goods traffic only, {{and was the}} {{terminus}} of the reopened section of the Outer Circle line from Deepdene railway station. Three loop sidings were provided, along with a <b>headshunt,</b> {{and there was a}} dead end extension at the Riversdale end. The <b>headshunt,</b> which crossed Normanby Road, was abolished in about 1935 to eliminate the level crossing, and the sidings became dead-end. Goods services were withdrawn on 6 September 1943, and the line back to Riversdale closed.|$|E
50|$|Found {{primarily}} on metro systems, rapid transit light rail networks, and tramways, a reversing <b>headshunt</b> allows certain trains or trams to change direction, even on lines with high traffic flow, whilst others continue through the station. Typically {{there will be}} two running lines, one for each direction of travel, and the <b>headshunt</b> will be positioned between the two running lines, linked to both by points. Although most trains will pass through the station and continue in the same direction, an individual train may be directed into the reversing <b>headshunt,</b> before exiting onto the other running line, in the opposite direction of travel. This procedure allows a greater frequency of trains on a city-centre section of the line, and reduced frequency on the suburban sections, by allowing certain trains to shuttle back and forth only on the city centre part, using the reversing headshunts to change direction within the flow of trains.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, the WHHR began {{construction}} of the WHR main line, {{under the terms of}} their 1998 agreement with the Festiniog Railway Company. This included clearing, preparing the track bed, tracklaying and ballasting. The northern end of the WHHR line was also re-modelled and, in 2002, the existing <b>headshunt</b> was replaced with a full crossover so it could connect with the FR owned WHR main line. A new <b>headshunt</b> loading spur was also constructed. They also helped construct the mainline between Pen-y-Mount and the Porthmadog Cross Town Link.|$|E
