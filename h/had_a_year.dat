25|$|In 1995, Riley {{resigned}} from the Knicks via fax to become the head coach and team president of the Miami Heat. The move caused some controversy, as the Heat were accused by the Knicks of tampering by pursuing Riley while he still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> remaining on his contract with the Knicks. The matter was settled after the Heat sent their 1996 first-round pick (which the Knicks would use to draft Walter McCarty) and $1 million in cash to the Knicks on September 1, 1995. Riley's coaching of the Heat to playoff contention would later make them bitter rivals with his former team.|$|E

He returned to London {{in the autumn of}} 1834 to take up this post. Thomas Trollope died the following year.|$|E

25|$|With the July move, {{many of the}} {{previously}} devoted viewers began abandoning the program. Jeopardy! became the seventh show since 1968 to fail at 1:30p.m. EST (12:30p.m. CST), and a cancellation notice was issued by November 1974. Its replacement was the expansion of Another World to a full hour, the first daytime serial to expand to that duration; in April 1975, another serial, Days of Our Lives began occupying that time slot and eventually brought success to NBC there. Jeopardy! broadcast the 2,753rd and final episode of its original network run on January 3, 1975. Some affiliates, including KNBC in Los Angeles, aired reruns in various other time slots through {{the first quarter of}} that year. To compensate Griffin for canceling the program, which still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> left on its contract, NBC purchased Wheel of Fortune, another creation of his, which premiered on January 6, 1975 at 10:30a.m. Eastern (9:30 Central).|$|E
25|$|In December 1968, Imlach {{was asked}} by Stafford Smythe to give the {{coaching}} job to John McLellan, but Imlach refused and told Smythe to fire him or leave him alone. During the season, Mike Walton walked out on the team, saying he wouldn't play for Imlach again. He returned about a week later. On April 6, 1969, minutes after an early and embarrassing playoff elimination {{at the hands of}} the Boston Bruins, Imlach was fired by the Leafs. He still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> remaining on his contract, which paid him about $35,000 a year. In the dressing room after the announcement was made, veteran Leafs Johnny Bower and Tim Horton both said they would leave with Imlach (they both returned the following season, although neither would remain with the Leafs for long). Imlach's assistant, Clancy, had previously said that he would walk away if Imlach was fired, but he was persuaded to stay with the team. Jim Gregory was immediately announced as Imlach's replacement as general manager.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, 1999, Page {{lost and}} regained his {{title in the}} span of two hours. Sting {{challenged}} him to defend his title in the first hour of that night's Nitro and defeated him to regain the title he had lost <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> earlier. This ended Page's reign at 15 days, but he gained an opportunity to get the title back ninety minutes later. Nash came to the ring and made a challenge for a four-way match for the title, and the just-dethroned Page joined defending champion Sting and Goldberg in the match. Page regained the world title by using a foreign object to hit Nash and take the win and regain the title without actually defeating the reigning champion. Nash became the number one contender shortly after and vowed to get revenge on Page for his friend Hogan, culminating in a match at Slamboree in May. Page originally retained the world championship after Savage interfered and hit Nash, but the match was ordered to continue by Eric Bischoff and Nash pinned Page to win the title after a powerbomb. Page dropped out of the title picture shortly thereafter.|$|E

500|$|ABT dancer Sarah Lane {{served as}} a [...] "dance double" [...] for Portman in the film. In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine, {{editor-in-chief}} Wendy Perron asked: [...] "Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that {{many people believe that}} Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan." [...] This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky, who both defended Portman as well as a response from Lane on the subject.|$|E
500|$|The win set up {{a rematch}} with the Broncos in the AFC Championship in Denver. The Broncos held a 21–3 lead at halftime, but a pair of rushing touchdowns and another by {{receiver}} Reggie Langhorne brought Cleveland to within seven points. Cleveland scored again in the fourth quarter, but the Broncos went ahead again by seven points on a touchdown with four minutes left. After Denver's kickoff, Kosar and the offense reached the Broncos' eight-yard line with 1:12 remaining. Kosar handed the ball to Earnest Byner on a second down. Byner ran left and broke inside with a clear path to the end zone, but was stripped by Denver's Jeremiah Castille just before crossing the goal line. The Broncos ran down the clock before intentionally taking a safety and winning 38–33. [...] "The Fumble" [...] quickly entered the lexicon of the Browns' modern-era disappointment, just as The Drive <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before.|$|E
500|$|While {{the trailer}} did not confirm that a Tron sequel was in production, {{it showed that}} Disney was serious about a sequel.

On July 23, 2009, Disney revealed film's title at their panel at Comic-Con. Bridges explained that the title is in reference to the story's theme: [...] "It's basically a story about a son's search for his father." [...] They also showed a trailer similar to the one shown at Comic-Con 2009, with updated visuals. At the time, the film had just wrapped production and they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of post production ahead of them. Because none of the footage from inside the computer world was finished, they premiered concept images from the production. Art included the Recognizer, which has been updated from the original film. Concept photos were also shown of Disc Wars, which has also been revised from the original film into a 16-game tournament. The arena is set up so that the game court organically changes, and all 16 games are going on at the same time. The boards also combine in real time until the last two Disc warriors are connected.|$|E

500|$|However, Auerbach {{could not}} prevent the Celtics from {{going into a}} slump {{at the end of}} the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary {{increases}} that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. [...] While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family. Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, [...] "I'm not going anywhere. [...] We're going to sign Larry Bird, and we're going to be on top again." [...] Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.|$|E
