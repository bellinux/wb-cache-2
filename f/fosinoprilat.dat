50|$|<b>Fosinoprilat</b> {{proved to}} have the same problem as {{enalaprilat}} and the other carboxylate-containing ACE inhibitors (namely poor oral bioavailability). Addition of a hydrophobic side-chain modulated the ionisation characteristics of the molecule, making it more bioavailable. Fosinopril is administered as a prodrug and is converted in vivo to the active form <b>fosinoprilat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fosinopril is de-esterified by {{the liver}} or {{gastrointestinal}} mucosa and {{is converted to}} its active form, <b>fosinoprilat.</b> <b>Fosinoprilat</b> competitively binds to ACE, preventing ACE from binding to and converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibiting the production of AII lowers peripheral vascular resistance, decreases afterload, and decreases blood pressure, thus helping to alleviate {{the negative effects of}} AII on cardiac performance. In heart failure patients, fosinopril increases exercise tolerance and lowers the frequency of events associated with worsening heart failure, such as dyspnea, the need for supplemental diuretics, fatigue, and hospitalizations. In a study examining the effects of fosinopril on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein serum concentrations in high cardiovascular risk patients, a six-month treatment of fosinopril was associated with an elevation in IGF-1. Since a decline in IGF-1 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease, fosinopril may reduce ischemic risk.|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{mosquitoes}} {{is threatened by}} the appearance of insecticide resistance and therefore new control chemicals are urgently required. Here we show that inhibitors of mosquito peptidyl dipeptidase, a peptidase related to mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), are insecticidal to larvae of the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. ACE inhibitors (captopril, fosinopril and <b>fosinoprilat)</b> and two peptides (trypsin-modulating oostatic factor/TMOF and a bradykinin-potentiating peptide, BPP- 12 b) were all inhibitors of the larval ACE activity of both mosquitoes. Two inhibitors, captopril and fosinopril (a pro-drug ester of <b>fosinoprilat),</b> were tested for larvicidal activity. Within 24 [*]h captopril had killed > 90 % of the early instars of both species with 3 (rd) instars showing greater resistance. Mortality was also high within 24 [*]h of exposure of 1 (st), 2 (nd) and 3 (rd) instars of An. gambiae to fosinopril. Fosinopril was also toxic to Ae. aegypti larvae, although the 1 (st) instars appeared to be less susceptible to this pro-drug even after 72 [*]h exposure. Homology models of the larval An. gambiae ACE proteins (AnoACE 2 and AnoACE 3) reveal structural differences compared to human ACE, suggesting that structure-based drug design offers a fruitful approach to the development of selective inhibitors of mosquito ACE enzymes as novel larvicides...|$|E
40|$|A soluble 67 kDa angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{has been}} {{purified}} by lisinopril-Sepharose affinity column chromatography from adult houseflies, Musca domestica. The dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity towards benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu was inhibited by captopril (IC 50 50 nM) and <b>fosinoprilat</b> (IC 50 251 nM), two inhibitors of mammalian ACE, and was activated by Cl- (optimal Cl- concentration 600 mM). Musca ACE removed C-terminal dipeptides from angiotensin I, bradykinin [Leu 5]enkephalin and [Met 5]enkephalin and also functioned as an endopeptidase by hydrolysing dipeptideamides from [Leu 5]enkephalinamide and [Met 5]enkephalinamide, and a dipeptideamide and a tripeptideamide from substance P. Musca ACE was {{also able to}} cleave a tripeptide from both the N-terminus and C-terminus of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, with C-terminal hydrolysis predominating. Maximal N-terminal tripeptidase activity occurred at 150 mM NaCl, whereas the C-terminal tripeptidase activity continued to rise with increasing concentration of Cl- (0 - 0. 5 M). Musca ACE displays properties of both the N- and C-domains of human ACE, indicating {{a high degree of}} conservation during evolution of the substrate specificity of ACE and its response to Cl-...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that inhibition of tissue {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) {{is important for the}} pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. Radioligand inhibitor binding methods using 125 I- 351 A and either tissue homogenates or in vitro autoradiography have allowed in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of tissue ACE inhibition by a variety of ACE inhibitors. The rank order of potency against plasma as well as lung, kidney, and cardiac homogenates was quinaprilat = benazeprilat greater than perindoprilat greater than lisinopril greater than enalaprilat greater than <b>fosinoprilat.</b> The highest concentration of ACE in the heart was found in the cardiac valves followed by the right and left atria, then the right and left ventricles. Ex vivo studies showed that after oral administration of quinapril, ACE was inhibited dose-dependently in the lung, kidney, aorta and heart for more than 24 h. Tissue bioavailability of the inhibitor is also an important determinant of tissue ACE inhibition. Perindopril crossed the blood-brain barrier and inhibited brain ACE at high doses, but after equivalent doses of quinapril no brain ACE inhibition could be demonstrated. These results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} design ACE inhibitors to have specific effects on ACE in different tissues...|$|E
40|$|Several inhibitors of {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme were also found to inhibit aminopeptidase P, whereas inhibitors of other mammalian aminopeptidases were ineffective. Aminopeptidase P purified from pig kidney cortex was found to contain one atom of zinc per polypeptide chain, confirming its metalloenzyme nature. The concentrations of converting enzyme inhibitors required to cause 50 % inhibition (I 50) of aminopeptidase P were in the low micromolar range. The most potent converting enzyme inhibitors toward aminopeptidase P were the carboxylalkyl compounds, cilazaprilat, enalaprilat, and ramiprilat (I 50 values of 3 - 12 /iM). The sulfydryl compounds captopril (l 50 110 /iM) and YS 980 (I 50 20 /iM) were slightly less potent at inhibiting aminopeptidase P. In contrast, the carboxylalkyl compounds benazeprilat, lisinopril, and pentoprilat; the sulfydryl compound rentiapril; and the phosphoryl compounds ceranopril and <b>fosinoprilat</b> had no inhibitory effect against aminopeptidase P. This compares with I 50 values in the 1 - 6 nM range for these inhibitors with {{angiotensin converting}} enzyme. Inhibition of aminopeptidase P may account {{for some of the}} effects or side effects noted with the clinical use of converting enzyme inhibitors. These results may provide the basis for the design of more selective inhibitors of {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} or mixed inhibitors of aminopeptidase P and angiotensin converting enzyme, or both.

40|$|Combined {{inhibition}} of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) produces cardiovascular effects greater than those elicited by selective {{inhibition of}} either enzyme alone. Dual metalloprotease inhibitors are single molecules that inhibit both NEP and ACE and produce cardiovascular effects in animal models similar to those elicited by the combination of NEP and ACE inhibitors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determined the duration of antihypertensive activity of the dual metalloprotease inhibitor omapatrilat in rodent models of hypertension. Omapatrilat inhibited NEP (Ki 5 9 nmol/L) and ACE (Ki 5 6 nmol/L) activities in vitro and inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin I in rats after intravenous administration with a potency and duration of action similar to those of the long acting ACE inhibitor <b>fosinoprilat.</b> After single dose administration, omapatrilat lowered mean arterial blood pressure (aortic catheter) in sodium depleted spontaneously hypertensive rats (high renin model) from 148 6 5 to 106 6 3 mm Hg (baseline to 24 h), in deoxycorticosterone acetateâ€“salt hypertensive rats (low renin) from 167 6 4 to 141 6 5 mm Hg and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (normal renin) from 162 6 4 to 138 6 3 mm Hg (P <. 05 at 24 h v vehicle in all models). After oral administration, omapatrilat (100 mmol/kg/day) persistently lowered systolic blood pressure (tail cuff) in spontaneously hypertensive rats during 11 days of treatment; at 24 h after dosing on day 12, mean arterial pressure (aortic catheter) was lower (P <. 05) in the group receiving omapatrilat (133 6 5 mm Hg) than in the group receiving vehicle (149 6 2 mm Hg). The results indicate that omapatrilat is a potent dual metalloprotease inhibitor of NEP and ACE with long lasting, oral antihypertensive effects in low, normal, and high renin models of hypertension. Omapatrilat has the potential to be an effective, broad spectrum antihypertensive agent. Am...|$|E
40|$|D-Ala 2,Leu 5]Enkephalin was readily metabolized by {{membranes}} (40, 000 g pellet) prepared from {{heads of}} the housefly, Musca domestica, with Gly 3 -Phe 4 being the major site of cleavage. This hydrolysis was only partially inhibited (40 %) by 10 microM phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of endopeptidase- 24. 11, but was almost totally abolished {{in the presence of}} a mixture of 10 microM phosphoramidon and 10 microM captopril, a potent inhibitor of mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). An assay for ACE employing Bz-Gly-His-Leu as the substrate was used to confirm the presence of an ACE-like peptidyl dipeptidase activity in fly head membranes. The peptidase had a Km of 1. 91 mM for Bz-Gly-His-Leu and a pH optimum of 8. 2. The activity was inhibited by 100 microM EDTA and was greatly activated by ZnCl 2 but not other bivalent metal ions. Captopril, lisinopril, <b>fosinoprilat</b> and enalaprilat, all selective inhibitors of mammalian ACE, were also good inhibitors of the insect enzyme with IC 50 values of 400 nM, 130 nM, 16 nM and 290 nM respectively. An M(r) value of around 87, 000 was obtained for this enzyme from gel-filtration chromatography, indicating that the insect enzyme is similar in size to mammalian testicular ACE (M(r) = 90, 000 - 110, 000) and not the larger form of the enzyme (M(r) = 150, 000 - 180, 000) found in mammalian somatic tissues. The fly peptidyl dipeptidase was released from membranes into a soluble fraction by incubating the head membranes at 37 degrees C but not at 0 degree C, suggesting that the insect ACE-like enzyme can be solubilized from cell surfaces through the activity of a membrane-bound enzyme activity. In conclusion, we have shown the existence of a peptidyl dipeptidase in membranes from the heads of M. domestica, which has similar properties to those of mammalian ACE...|$|E
