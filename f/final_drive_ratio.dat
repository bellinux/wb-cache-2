25|$|All four-speed manual {{transmissions}} {{were built}} at the Muncie, Indiana Allison plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model {{and part of the}} 1986 production year came with a four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 four-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|In North America, the Spark {{was first}} {{delivered}} to GM dealerships in Mexico for the 2012 model year, {{but did not}} replace the Chevrolet Matiz (formerly Pontiac G2 Matiz) which is still sold (as of 2014). The United States version of the 2013 Chevrolet Spark went into production on April 16, 2012, and arrived in dealerships in August 2012. For 2014 in North America, the automatic transmission is a Jatco M4M-CVT7 Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> lowered to 3.75. The CVT gives better fuel mileage overall than the previous 4 speed automatic, and changing the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> from its previous 4.145 reduces engine noise and increases fuel economy on the highway while increasing noise and reducing fuel mileage in the city. Industry sources have commented on the ongoing reliability issues with the Jatco CVT transmissions.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio).</b> Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|E
50|$|The {{top speed}} listed was 105 km/h (65 mph) or 112 km/h (70 mph) {{according}} to {{which of the two}} offered <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> was fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "MN8" [...] 4L85-E is able {{to handle}} {{vehicles}} with up to 460 ft·lbf (624 N·m) of torque. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.42, 3.73, and 4.10.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "MT1" [...] 4L80-E is able {{to handle}} engines with up to 440 ft·lbf (597 N·m) of torque. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.42, 3.73, and 4.10.|$|R
25|$|Rambler's {{emphasis}} on economy over performance {{can be observed}} through the example of automatic transmission use in a Rambler American where the 1959 owner's handbook describes leaving the gear selector in the D-2 position (1.47:1 gear ratio) blocks access to low gear (2.40 ratio) when starting out from a stop; therefore, given the car's 3.31 axle, this yields an initial 4.86:1 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> reducing crankshaft revolutions for maximum fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|Power is {{transferred}} from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transaxle with an integrated spool differential. The individual gear ratios and the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> are fixed with drop gears {{at the front of}} the transaxle allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits. The cars use a triple plate clutch. The cars run on E85 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of 112 litres.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded with a 43mm Kayaba inverted fork with sliders {{having a}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The rear shock {{is also a}} Kayaba, and the overall suspension is firmer than the previous model. The swingarm is similar in design to the old one, but was strengthened. Front and rear remain fully adjustable. The transmission was given a heavier-duty, slipper clutch. The <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> was slightly lower, and gears 5-6 were spaced farther apart, and gear ratios 1-2 moved closer together.|$|E
50|$|At present, <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> {{higher than}} 3.20 (3.2 engine {{rotations}} to one rear axle rotation) are prohibited, {{in an effort}} to limit top speed potential, thus reducing the perceived level of danger.|$|R
50|$|The 5L50 is {{engineered}} {{to handle the}} stresses from vehicles weighing up to 5000 lb (2268 kg) GVWR. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 2.93:1 and 3.23:1. The 5L50 can handle up to 311 ft·lbf (422 N·m) of torque.|$|R
5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{had been}} used over their power and speed ratings until 2004. Delayed trains were [...] "force-fit" [...] into the timetable by overspeeding up to 10% over timetable speeds. This required both overspeeding the prime mover and modifying the traction motors' <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios.</b> This practice was banned after the Pamukova train derailment.|$|R
500|$|In 1960, McCormack {{noticed that}} one Honda dealer in Boise, Idaho was selling more Honda 50s than the {{combined}} total of all six dealers in Los Angeles. He {{found out that}} the Idaho dealer, Herb Uhl, was selling the CA100s as a trail bike by adding knobby tires for off-road traction and a [...] "cheater sprocket," [...] that is, increasing the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> by using a larger rear sprocket with more teeth, which increased the effective torque of the rear wheel, trading off lower top speed as a result. Uhl said the advantages of light weight and the automatic clutch allowed unskilled riders to enjoy off-road riding, in comparison to traditional big trail bikes that could be difficult to handle. McCormack shipped a version of Uhl's customized CA100 to Japan and requested Honda put it into production, and by March 1961 the Trail 50 was available to US dealers. Cycle World praised the simple pleasure of trail riding on the new bike, and it was a US sales success.|$|E
2500|$|Front {{and rear}} axle {{differentials}} are conventional [...] "open" [...] types, with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4.111.|$|E
2500|$|A {{six-speed}} {{manual transmission}} (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: FDP) (gear ratios—1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.806, 6th: 0.684), cooled by a NACA duct {{in the engine}} undertray, and Audi's Torsen-based quattro system, using the Torsen T-1 [...] "automatic torque biasing" [...] (ATB) center differential, with a 50:50 default bias were standard. [...] <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> was 4.111.|$|E
50|$|The {{front axle}} {{was an unusual}} triple {{reduction}} type which did not need universal joints on the outer ends and allowed a tighter turning radius. The two rear axles were a double reduction type. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> were 9.02:1 for gas powered trucks and 10.11:1 for diesels. All drivelines of both manufacturers were built by Mack.|$|R
50|$|The engine’s {{power is}} {{transferred}} via a sequential six-speed sport gearbox, which is operated pneumatically using shift paddles {{mounted on the}} steering wheel. The gearbox {{is one of the}} standard components, which are used by all the DTM manufacturers. It has 11 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios,</b> which allow the engineers and drivers to react to the respective circuit and engine characteristics when setting the car up.|$|R
50|$|The 4T60-E {{featured}} a 245mm torque converter with varying stall speed and gear ratios. For example, a '95 Beretta features a 1650 rpm stall converter {{as opposed to}} '99 Century converter with a stall of 2095 rpm. In the 4T60 family of transmissions, the combination of drive-chain sprocket ratios and the differential gear ratio together offer up to 12 different possible <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> to allow the transmission family to cover various engine and vehicle applications.|$|R
2500|$|A new Plus Sport System is standard. If {{the battery}} {{is more than}} 30 percent charged and the CR-Z is {{traveling}} over 18mph, the driver can press the [...] "S+" [...] button {{on the steering wheel}} to deliver increased acceleration for up to five seconds. Manual-transmission versions also receive both a larger clutch and a new lower <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b> EPA-rated fuel economy figures increased by 1 mpg city for CVT equipped models, and 1 mpg highway for those with the six-speed manual transmission.|$|E
2500|$|The E-body coupes were {{converted}} to unibody construction and further downsized for 1986, to a [...] wheelbase shared with the Buick Regal. The V6 was now the only engine, rated initially at [...] SAE and [...] of torque. It used the Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4 automatic with a 2.84:1 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b> [...] This generation was noted for advanced electronic instrumentation displayed on a dash-mounted [...] CRT. The CRT controlled the vehicle's climate control system and stereo, and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer and maintenance reminder feature. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard. With a choice of three suspension packages available, up to the performance oriented FE3 setting, handling was notably improved. The Riviera placed fourth for Motor Trends 1986 Car of the Year contest.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{development}} of the V8 engine was introduced at the 1955 Frankfurt Motor Show. This had a [...] bore, giving a capacity of [...] The engine made its debut in four new cars at the show, the 507 two-seat convertible, the 503 coupe, the 505 limousine prototype, and the BMW 3.2, a development of the 502 {{that did not have}} a model number and was identified simply by its displacement in litres. As used in the 3.2 and the 505, the engine had a compression ratio of 7.2:1, up from the 7.0:1 of the original 2.6 L V8 engine. In this tune, the engine yielded [...] The <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> was raised from 4.225:1 on the smaller-engined sedans to 3.89:1 on the 3.2 to reduce the fuel consumption of the larger engine.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "MN5" [...] 4T45E is able {{to handle}} {{vehicles}} up to 4,500 lb (2,041 kg) GVWR. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.63, 3.29, 3.05, and 3.91. This same transmission {{is used in the}} Saturn Vue Green Line hybrid vehicle with the addition of an auxiliary oil pump and hybrid-aware electronics. It is designed for 3.0-3.5 L engines producing up to 205 ft·lbf (278 N·m) of torque, but was also commonly mated to some versions of GM's 4-cylinder Ecotec line.|$|R
50|$|On the {{mechanical}} side, the S4 25quattro {{was the second}} Audi, after the B7 RS4 to be fitted with the latest Torsen T-3 asymmetric ATB centre differential for its quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. Under normal grip conditions, this is set with a default rearwards torque distribution bias of 40:60 front to rear, and a maximum of 100% torque can automatically be apportioned to the rear axle (and up to 80% to the front) as conditions warrant. The <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> are 3.889.|$|R
5000|$|GMC {{created an}} upscale {{version of its}} Sierra 1500 in 2000 called the Sierra C3. It used all-wheel drive with a 3.73 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> gear <b>ratio</b> and {{included}} the 6.0 L Vortec 6000 LQ4 V8 rated at [...] at 5000 rpm and 370 lb•ft (502 N·m) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L60E-HD four speed automatic transmission along with other upscale equipment. For 2002, the name was changed to Sierra Denali, but the specifications remained essentially the same except for the addition of Quadrasteer and GM changed from the 4L60E-HD to the 4L65E {{in conjunction with a}} 4.10 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> gear <b>ratio.</b>|$|R
2500|$|All-aluminum 8.4 L V10 rated [...] and at , Tremec TR6060 {{six-speed}} {{manual transmission}} with <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> 3.55, 50 percent improvement in torsional stiffness over previous model, electronic stability control, traction control, 4-channel {{anti-lock brake system}} (ABS), carbon fiber and aluminum skin with [...]364 drag coefficient (Cd), Pirelli P Zero Z-rated tires, 4-piston Brembo brakes with fixed-aluminum calipers with vented 355x32mm diameter rotors, 20mm lower seating position, 7-inch full-color customizable instrument cluster, Uconnect RA3 or RA4 Access in-vehicle connectivity system with optional SiriusXM Travel Link, Harman Kardon audio system, bi-xenon projector headlamps with white light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lamps and LED turn signals, LED taillamps with integrating stop-and-turn illumination and snakeskin texture lens, five-spoke forged aluminum [...] "Rattler" [...] wheel with fully polished (standard), fully painted Hyper Black or fully painted low-gloss black finishes.

2500|$|The Mustang GT {{featured}} an all-aluminum 4.6L 3-valve SOHC Modular V8 with {{variable camshaft}} timing {{and a more}} rugged Tremec TR-3650 transmission. The engine produces 300hp (224kW) @ 5750rpm and 320lb·ft (433N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The GT model was capable of performing a quarter-mile test in 13.8 seconds @ 99 MPH, with acceleration from zero to 60 MPH in 5.6 seconds. The Mustang GT also came equipped with a limited slip differential complete with the same carbon-fiber clutch discs used in the 2003 to 2004 SVT Cobra and the 2007 Shelby GT500. The differential uses the 31-spline axles and the [...] ring gear. The standard <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2005 and 2006 Mustang GTs with a manual transmission was 3.55:1. Since the 2007 model year, a 3.31:1 ratio final drive was standard with the 3.55:1 gearing available as a factory installed option. Automatic transmission-equipped models of all years come with 3.31:1 ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{start-up}} for the 2005 Mustang was on September 7, 2004, {{with the}} first 2005 model rolling off Flat Rock Assembly on September 27, 2004. U.S. market launch and customer delivery began {{at the end of}} October 2004, with production ending in late 2008 for the 2009 model. The 2005–2009 base Mustang was powered by Ford's cast iron block 4.0L Cologne SOHC V6, replacing the 3.8L Essex OHV V6 used in 2004 and older models. It produces 210hp (157kW) at 5300rpm and 240lb·ft (325N·m) of torque at 3500rpm and was mated to a standard Tremec T-5 5-speed manual transmission with Ford's 5R55S 5-speed automatic transmission available as an option. A 3.31:1 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> is standard with either transmission. In a comparison test with a Pontiac G6 Convertible conducted by Motor Trend magazine, a Mustang V6 convertible equipped with an automatic transmission was able to accelerate from zero to [...] in 7.3 seconds; 1.4 seconds better than the 2006 Pontiac G6 convertible.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{designer}} was theoretically {{free to choose}} any ratio for the gearbox and <b>final</b> <b>drive,</b> there is one additional consideration which meant that the top gear of most gearboxes was 1:1 or [...] "direct drive". This is chosen for efficiency, as {{it does not require}} any gears to transmit power and so reduces the power lost by them. This was particularly important {{in the early days of}} cars, as their straight-cut gears were poorly finished, noisy and inefficient. The <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> then took this output and adjusted it in a fixed-ratio transmission arrangement that was much simpler to build. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> of 4:1 were common, meaning that the wheels would turn at one fourth the rate they would if directly connected to the engine.|$|R
50|$|The car {{employed}} {{rack and}} pinion steering. At the front it had disc brakes, with drum brakes controlled via a dual-line hydraulic system at the rear. Suspension was independent, employing MacPherson struts at the front and an unusual combination of full-width swing axles and half-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The front suspension was substantially modified after the car's initial presentation: production cars incorporated modified front suspension geometry, a lowered steering ratio and a steering damper, intended to reduce the unusually strong self-centring propensity which was {{a feature of the}} pre-production cars originally presented to journalists. The cars as sold also incorporated an updated gear-box and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> along with re-sized wheels.|$|R
50|$|The 4T65-E was {{introduced}} to replace the 4T60-E in 1997. The 4T65-E included a larger 258 mm torque converter for some models and many other changes to improve reliability. It is able to handle vehicles up to 6500 lb (2948 kg) GVWR with up to 280 ft·lbf (380 N·m) of torque. A number of <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> are available, with many distinct models. Starting in mid year 2000 models, all 4T65-E models received an upgraded valve body. Starting in 2003 the internal electronics were changed, hardened 4th gear shaft, ratcheting sprags for input and third gear were added. The last application was the 2011 Chevrolet Impala as GM has transitioned to the 6T70 family transmissions for 2012.|$|R
2500|$|The ACR Neon, {{available}} with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter [...]81 fifth gear and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter {{was removed from}} 1995 ACR models (limited to [...] on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights {{and a lack of}} side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name [...] "ACR" [...] was initially the internal ordering code for the [...] "Competition Package", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The backronym [...] "American Club Racer" [...] was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.|$|E
2500|$|The Ford Taurus SHO (which {{stands for}} Super High Output), {{released}} in August 2009, is the high-performance {{version of the}} Ford Taurus. The SHO is powered by Ford's new EcoBoost 3.5L V6 engine. The twin-turbocharged, gasoline direct injection power plant has [...] and [...] of torque. The EcoBoost V6 achieves 17/25 miles per gallon in AWD. The Taurus SHO base price is $37,995 which includes the EcoBoost V6, all wheel drive, upgraded 6-speed automatic transmission and numerous exterior and interior trim upgrades. A fully loaded SHO will be $45,000. There is also an available performance package on the new SHO, which includes upgraded brake pads, a 3.16:1 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> (compared to the standard 2.77:1), recalibrated electronic power steering, further suspension tuning, a re-calibrated AdvanceTrac system (Ford's combined Traction Control System and Electronic Stability Control) with sport mode and [...] "true off", summer compound Goodyear Eagle F1 245/45ZR20 tires, and an electric air pump with fix-a-flat {{in lieu of a}} spare tire. [...] Most options for the SHO remain available with the Performance Package including options such as Power Moonroof, Heated/Cooled Seats, Multi-Contour Seats, Auto-Sensing Lights and Wipers, Automatic High-Beams, Adjustable Pedals, Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), and Satellite Navigation.

5000|$|The 5L40-E was {{designated}} in either [...] "M82" [...] (rear-wheel drive) or [...] "MX5" [...] (all-wheel drive) versions for service in BMW vehicles from 2000 model year until the design was superseded by (for BMW) the 6L45E and (for all others) the 6L50E series electronic automatic transmissions in 2007 [...] It {{is designed for}} service in vehicles up to 4000 lb (1814 kg) GVWR and in service was mated to a selection of <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> 3.42:1, 3.73:1, or 3.91:1 depending on the carline. The 5L40-E had been designed for 1.8-3.6 L engines with a maximum of 250 ft·lbf (340 N·m) of torque. It was underrated when used in combination of M57D30 engines. As the M57D30 rated torque output of 390/410Nm.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} 32-valve {{cylinder}} heads, the V8 engine was essentially {{of the same}} design as that used in the 308 GTSi model. Total displacement was , with a bore and stroke of 81 mm x 71 mm. Output on European specification cars was [...] at 7000 rpm, and [...] at 6800 rpm for US specification variants. The gear and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> were altered to suit the revised characteristics of the four valves per cylinder engine. One other significant benefit of the QV four valve heads was {{the replacement of the}} non-QV models sodium valves which have been known to fail at the joint between the head and the stem. Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and Marelli Digiplex electronic ignition were carried over from the GTBi/GTSi. All US market examples were fitted with catalytic converters.|$|R
2500|$|This model {{introduced}} the Type S straight-4 water-cooled engine, conventionally {{mounted in the}} front of the car and driving through the rear wheels.
