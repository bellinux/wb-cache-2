50|$|Exterior Foundation Drain - Installing an {{exterior}} foundation drain {{that will}} drain away by gravity {{is the most}} effective means to waterproof a basement. An exterior system allows water to flow away from the basement without using pumps or electricity. An <b>exterior</b> <b>drain</b> also allows for the installation of a waterproof membrane to the foundation walls.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between morphology and surficial geology {{is used to}} quantify the denudation that has occurred across southwestern Africa sicne the fragmentation of Gondwana during the Early Mesozoic. Two main points emerge. Signficant denudation, {{of the order of}} kilometers, is widespread except in the Kalahari region of the continental interior. The denudation is systematically distributed so that the continental <b>exterior</b> catchment, <b>draining</b> directly to the Cape basin, is denuded to a greater depth than the interior catchment inland of the Great Escarpment. The analysis also implies tha the majority of the denudation occurred before the beginning of the Cenozoic for both teh exerior and interior catchments. Existing models of landscape development are reviewed, and implications of the denudation chronology are incorporated into a revised conceptual model. This revision implies tha thte primary effect of rifting on the subsequent landscape evolution is that it generates two distinct drainage regimes. A marginal upwarp, or rift flank uplift, separates rejuvenated rivers that drain into the subsiding rift from rivers in the continetal interior that are deflected but not rejuvenated. The two catchments evolve independently unless they are integrated by breaching of hte marginal upwarp. If this occurs, the exterior baselevel is communicated to the interior catchment that is denuded accordingly. Denudation rates generally decrease as the margin evolves, and this decrease is reinforced by the exposure of substrate that is resistant to denudation and/or a change to a more arid climate. The observations do not reveal a particular style of smaller-scale landscape evolution, sucha s escarpment retreat, that is responsible for the differential denudation across the region. It is proposed that numerical model experiments, which reflect the observational insights at the large scale, may identify the smaller-scale controls on escarpment development if the model and natural systems are analogous. Four numerical experiments are presented in which the roles of antecedent topography, resistant substrate, climte change, and lowering the baselevel of the interior catchment are investigated for an initially high elevation margin bordered by an escarpment. The model results suggest several styles of landscape evolution that are compatible with the observations. Escarpments may retreat in a regular manner, but they also degrade and are destroyed, only to reform at the drainage divide between exterior and interior catchments...|$|R
