50|$|The Kine Exakta {{controls}} are somewhat {{different from those}} found on most later 35mm SLR film cameras: The finder hood in its collapsed state automatically blocks the shutter release. The film is transported towards the left, leaving the exposed frames {{the other way round}} on the filmstrip. The wind-on lever on the left-hand top plate is operated by the left hand thumb and it requires a single 300-degree movement. It advances the film one frame, cocks the shutter, and increments the manual reset frame counter. The lift, turn and set shutter speed dial on the left-hand top plate provides exposure times from 1/25 to 1/1000 second, plus B and Z (time). For double exposures, the shutter may be cocked again by turning the shutter speed dial itself. On the right-hand top plate sits a separately wound dual purpose dial, featuring long time exposure and <b>delayed</b> <b>action</b> shutter <b>release.</b> It works at the shutter setting B and is only settable after the shutter is cocked. Slow speeds are selected by the lift, turn and set procedure against a small index dot. The long exposures times, without delay, are marked in black numerals all the way to 12 seconds, while slow speeds with <b>delayed</b> <b>action</b> are in red numerals to 6 seconds. This is the extent of self-timer release available. All functions are activated by the left-hand front located threaded shutter release button. A film-cutting device is located inside the camera. It enables a partially exposed film to be removed from the camera in daylight for processing provided the left-hand take-up spool was placed in a cassette. A small milled knob at the base is unscrewed and pulled out to cut the film close to the unexposed film cassette.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} on the {{synthesis}} of SiO 2 hollow spheres using carbon nanospheres as the sacrificial template by hydrothermal method. The synthesized substrates are in a spherical morphology and uniform size distribution. The effects of hydrothermal process, concentration and the reaction temperature were optimized during synthesis of carbon nanospheres. Infrared spectroscopy (IR), and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) methods were used for identification of the synthesized products. The synthesized SiO 2 nanospheres were used as drug carrier to investigate in vitro release behavior of monoterpenic phenol isomers, carvacrol and thymol, in simulated body fluid (SBF). Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) method was carried out to determine the amount of the drugs entrapped in the carrier. The results indicated that SiO 2 nanospheres have high ability to adsorb the drugs and {{there is no need for}} adjusting the pH during the adsorption process. The drug release profile shows a three stages pattern and indicates a <b>delayed</b> <b>release</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R

We conjecture that the estimated cost of <b>delayed</b> <b>action</b> (ECDA) model in cost problems can be used in this scenario. We survey some existing methods on making the model less dependent on the formulation of utility and probability function. We also expose an open problem on determining the right time for a certain action to be executed...|$|R
