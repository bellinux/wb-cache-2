500|$|In {{his review}} of Bloch's biography, Murray writes: [...] "Jeremy Thorpe had hoped {{to be remembered as}} a great {{political}} leader. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> all do. And perhaps he will be remembered longer than many other politicians of his age or ours. But it will always be for the same thing. Jeremy, Jeremy, bang, bang, woof, woof." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bright {{attributed}} {{his poor}} form {{in part to}} his league stint in England, saying [...] "the wickets were so slow that I ended up bowling a lot quicker. It took me a long, long time to renegotiate what I needed to do in Australian conditions." [...] He added that [...] "another thing was that the batsman weren't taking any risks against me. Before that <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> had underestimated me, but after I was selected for New Zealand they took no risks and I had to really fight for my wicket." ...|$|E
60|$|WISE. So they are, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> are as true as notable.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I did--what wonder? I {{had heard}} {{much about the}} great heiress, Eliza Laurance, and the great beauty, Eliza Laurance. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> were one and the same. You have all been careful not to undeceive me.' ...|$|R
60|$|That {{seemed to}} me such obvious good sense that I {{wondered}} to myself the police hadn't thought long since of it; but <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> had some good ground of their own for holding it all this time in their own possession.|$|R
6000|$|... “If {{they are}} not on deck they must be below,—they had no chance to leave the ship,” {{answered}} Captain Hunker. “This gets me!” he went on, weakly. “I thought they acted rather strange, but <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> were nothing but a crowd of weak-minded critters hunting for pirates’ gold.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They must {{cross that}} dip {{to get at}} us--at least if they attack, which <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> will, as {{they will be the}} strongest party--and our {{artillery}} will be able to play upon them splendidly from this road. Then, too, there are two or three farmhouses nearer our side than theirs, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> will be held in force.|$|E
60|$|LIEUTENANT. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> {{really are}} rather serious (as {{if this had}} hardly {{occurred}} to him before).|$|E
60|$|English {{seems to}} be the popular {{language}} for quarrelling in, among foreigners. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> find it more expressive.|$|E
60|$|You know, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>they</b> elected {{me at the}} Athenæum? Pray thank Mr. Serjeant Storks for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No! <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> could," [...] she admitted; [...] "but I don't {{know where}} it is, and <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> they'd take me in anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But before departing, {{in common}} decency, I {{offered to take}} any wires they might write. My lodgings were nearer the post-office than the cottage and I would send them off the {{first thing in the}} morning. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> would wish to communicate, if only as to the {{disposal}} of the luggage, with the young lady's relatives..." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, if {{they would}} listen,--as <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> will not,--I would address {{a few words to}} the Southern people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe you'll get {{a chance}} on the eleven, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> give the older students the preference," [...] was the reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{nothing was}} said. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> are {{considering}} the matter also. Those deceiving spirits must be hunted out and driven away." ...|$|E
60|$|Peter was not {{the only}} one who had secret cares. Sara Ray was {{beginning}} to feel worried over her looks. I heard her and Cecily talking over their troubles one evening while I was weeding the onion bed and they were behind the hedge knitting lace. I did not mean to eavesdrop. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> knew <b>I</b> was there until Cecily overwhelmed me with indignation later on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Things {{to be done}} offer {{themselves}}, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> because <b>they</b> are {{in themselves}} desirable; {{not because it is}} desirable to have something to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{understand}} that, and I {{can assure}} you that I haven't been indifferent to your feelings. I have tried to consider them from the first, and it kept me hesitating in a way that I'm ashamed to think of; for it wasn't quite right towards--others. But your feelings and my sisters' have been in my mind, and if I couldn't yield to what <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> must be, entirely----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. No. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> {{are the men}} {{who control}} the great public businesses. Who is that {{distinguished}} looking man?" ...|$|E
60|$|WELLWYN. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> see I like them--then {{they tell}} me things. After that, of course you can't help doing what you can.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, {{but they}} are very rough. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> would do almost {{anything}} for money. They smell strongly of liquor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> ever buy books. The young ladies get novels that they hear talked {{of out of}} the {{circulating}} library." ...|$|R
6000|$|The farmer looked surprised. [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> by the row {{that was}} going on," [...] he said. [...] "Curious. I knew there were rats down to the barn, but <b>I</b> didn't <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> {{came up to the}} house. What became of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would you?" [...] cries George, and {{his cheeks}} and Theo's {{simultaneously}} flushed up with red; <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> because <b>they</b> both saw Hetty's bright young eyes watching them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder their fleet don't come across, to {{help their}} batteries. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> are afraid of the carcasses, and red hot shot.|$|E
6000|$|... "They got {{permission}} to go to town. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> went to make further arrangements about that big sleighing party," [...] remarked Randy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lemme see! One {{might say}} just 'Pre'nez'! Wish I knew the French for {{take hold of}} the rope!... <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> are French?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And these, squire, are the Greshamsbury papers:" [...] and the doctor, with {{considerable}} ceremony, withdrew the covering newspapers. [...] "Look at them; there {{they all are}} once again. When I suggested to Mr Snilam that <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> might now all {{go back to the}} Greshamsbury muniment room, I thought he would have fainted. As I cannot return them to you, you will have to wait till Frank shall give them up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it {{precisely}} that you heard people say about my brother? You {{said that they}} were surprised. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>they</b> were. Did it not seem strange to them that my brother should have failed to save himself after the most difficult part--that is, getting away from the spot--was over? Conspirators should understand these things well. There are reasons why I am very anxious to know how it is he failed to escape." ...|$|R
5000|$|The school's {{head teacher}} at the time, Ronald Keating, told BBC Radio Wales in February 2016 that he wished that the council would revert to its {{previous}} transport policy, saying: [...] "In effect, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>they</b> would scrap it." ...|$|R
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN [a little alarmed] I say, will they? <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> will. I wonder is Barnabas {{right after}} all? Ought we to allow it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are as {{handsome}} as {{they can}} be,' she returned, with haughty carelessness. 'They should be so, of' course. And <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> are.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And besides, {{the fall}} {{would have killed}} it," [...] said Kate conclusively. [...] "It's lovely. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> call you a very good shot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wrote on}} the very day I crossed the frontier, sir," [...] Jack said. [...] "Besides I wrote twice from Russia, but <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> ever got the letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> are {{any more}} than the houses in the rows, Bill. They are very small, you see, and <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> would suit workmen as well as the others; at any rate we will see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t know, sir; it {{will require}} {{a good deal of}} {{thinking}} out. <b>I</b> don’t <b>suppose</b> <b>they</b> will meddle with us at present, but of course they will sooner or later.” ...|$|R
