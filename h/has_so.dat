5|$|A {{survey of}} European {{countries}} reported in Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2) (2005), a {{judgment of the}} European Court of Human Rights, found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners {{were not allowed to}} vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein). In Hirst, the UK Government's denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government <b>has</b> <b>so</b> far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste.

The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known.

Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before its}} closure, there was {{interest}} in retaining the canal for its amenity value. The Stroudwater Canal Society, which {{later became the}} Cotswold Canals Trust, was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, {{who had not been}} stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £82 million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase <b>has</b> <b>so</b> far been funded in this way, when a grant of £11.9 million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.|$|E
