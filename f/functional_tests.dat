These run {{as part of}} the normal build process and extensively exercise the interpreter and its core modules. Perl developers rely on the <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> to ensure that changes to the interpreter do not introduce software bugs; additionally, Perl users who see that the interpreter passes its <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> on their system can have a high degree of confidence that it is working properly.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their wake}} up, the Atlantis crew set {{right to work}} {{preparing}} for the second spacewalk of the mission, with Massimino and Good suiting up with assistance from Grunsfeld and Feustel. As they were preparing for the EVA, the team on the ground informed the crew that the WFC3 had passed all the overnight <b>functional</b> <b>tests,</b> indicating it was in good working order.|$|E
500|$|No written {{specification}} or {{standard for}} the Perl language exists for Perl versions through Perl 5, {{and there are no}} plans to create one for the current version of Perl. There has been only one implementation of the interpreter, and the language has evolved along with it. That interpreter, together with its <b>functional</b> <b>tests,</b> stands as a de facto specification of the language. [...] Perl 6, however, started with a specification, and several projects aim to implement {{some or all of the}} specification.|$|E

500|$|People with nontraumatic {{causes of}} SCI {{have been found}} to be less likely to suffer {{complete}} injuries and some complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis, and to have shorter hospital stays. Their scores on <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> were better than those of people with traumatic SCI upon hospital admission, but when they were tested upon discharge, those with traumatic SCI had improved such that both groups' results were the same. In addition to the completeness and level of the injury, age and concurrent health problems affect the extent to which a person with SCI will be able to live independently and to walk. [...] However, in general people with injuries to L3 or below will likely be able to walk functionally, T10 and below to walk around the house with bracing, and C7 and below to live independently.|$|E
500|$|After {{the initial}} aliveness testing, the ACS was put through its <b>functional</b> <b>tests.</b> Managers and {{engineers}} had {{noted that the}} repairs were designed for {{only one of the}} three photo channels, the wide-field channel, and that the issues with the high-resolution channel may not be resolved by the designed fix. During the functional testing, the wide-field channel passed, but issues were seen with the high-resolution channel, indicating that the power issue may be farther upstream in the electronic circuits than the spacewalk repair addressed. Additional testing would be performed, but Hubble Program Manager Preston Burch noted that the fix was designed to [...] "back power" [...] the high-resolution channel through the paths connected to the wide-field channel, and while feasible, it was a possibility that the short circuit damage was in an area not corrected with the planned repair. Even if the high-resolution channel is unable to be restored, it was considered to be less important, since the bulk of the ACS science output is undertaken by the wide-field channel. The third channel, the solar-blind channel, passed overnight functional testing without issues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The goal of <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> is {{to prove}} that the {{software}} performs in conformance with its specification. <b>Functional</b> <b>testing</b> emphasizes the behavioral characteristics of objects by focusing on the interface that is the public, and defining, feature of a class. There are <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> cases for each individual method and <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> cases that treat the class as a unified component. An algorithm that guides the construction of <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> cases for a class is presented. That algorithm can easily be modified to produce test cases at a greater level of coverage. The input to the algorithm will be portions of the class specification that is produced to guide the design process as much as for the testing process...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>tests</b> [...] {{may include}} {{electroretinogram}} and visual field testing. [...] Diagnostic confirmation and an estimation of disease severity may involve imaging tests such as retinography, fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography, {{optical coherence tomography}} and ultrasound. For example, indocyanine green angiography may detect continuing choroidal inflammation in the eyes without clinical symptoms or signs. Ocular MRI may be helpful and auditory symptoms should undergo audiologic testing. Histopathology findings from eye and skin are discussed by Walton.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 October 2013, Sikorsky {{issued an}} $8.5 million {{contract}} to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions {{for the design}} and development of maintenance training systems for the CH-53K. [...] The contract includes a full-fidelity Maintenance Training Device Suite (MTDS) and a Helicopter Emulation Maintenance Trainer (HEMT) for the Marine Corps. [...] The full-fidelity MTDS provides a true-to-life environment for training and evaluating the maintainers of multiple subsystems on the CH-53K platform. It supports maintenance training as well as remove-and-replace training for avionics systems, electrical systems, hydraulic systems, and other mechanical subsystems. [...] The HEMT uses a 3D virtual environment to support maintenance training scenarios. It will provide Marine CH-53K Enlisted Aircrew and maintainers with an accurate environment to train <b>functional</b> <b>tests,</b> fault isolation, troubleshooting, and remove and installation for 27 subsystems.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the idea}} that newly {{isolated}} human genes of unknown function could prove useful for drug development was widely criticized. Haseltine's experience with HIV taught him that knowledge of the genome without prior knowledge of function was useful and had led {{to the discovery of}} new and useful drug targets and new and effective drugs. Haseltine argued that if one new human gene were discovered, the techniques of modern biology would allow its natural function and potential medical use identified. If that were true for one gene, then why not all the human genes? New tools had been developed that allowed what had been tedious hard work of gene isolation and characterization to be replaced by highly automated instruments and the data regarding the structure, tissue and cell location and the results of <b>functional</b> <b>tests</b> to be stored and easily accessed using advanced computer technologies. He summarized these views [...] with the statement [...] "Genomics is not necessarily Genetics". It was not until the Human Genome Science approach was validated by its own work and [...] the work of its partners that it was ultimately adopted by the scientific community. Today, the approach pioneered by Human Genome Sciences is one of the principal tools used today for the discovery and characterization of novel human genes and as well as the genes of other species.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} work-related {{limitations}} assessed using self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> {{in patients with}} chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHODS: Work-related limitations of 92 patients were assessed using self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing.</b> To obtain the assessed limitations the patient (self-report), the physician (clinical examination) and a trained evaluator (<b>functional</b> <b>testing)</b> completed a scorings form about the work-related limitations of the patient. The Isernhagen Work Systems Functional Capacity Evaluation (IWS FCE) was used to obtain the <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> results. A kappa value of more than 0. 60, absolute agreement of more than 80 % and ICC of more than 0. 75 were considered as acceptable. RESULTS: Little agreement and correlation among self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> were found {{for the assessment of}} work-related limitations. Self-reported limitations were considerably higher than from those derived from clinical examination or <b>functional</b> <b>testing.</b> Additionally, the limitations derived from the clinical examination were higher than those derived from the IWS FCE. CONCLUSION: Comparing self-report, clinical examination and <b>functional</b> <b>testing</b> for assessing work-related limitations in CLBP patients showed large considerable differences in limitations. Professional health care workers should be aware of these differences when using them in daily practice...|$|R
