50|$|Crowley Foods (legal name Crowley Foods LLC) is an American dairy company {{formerly}} {{based in}} Binghamton, New York. It {{has been a}} subsidiary of HP Hood LLC since being purchased by the company in 2004, which is headquartered in Lynnfield, Massachusetts. Products provided by the company include milk, <b>half</b> and <b>half,</b> <b>cream,</b> cottage <b>cheese,</b> sour <b>cream</b> and yogurt. The original plant located on Conklin Avenue in Binghamton manufactured these dairy products until the acquisition by HP Hood, when certain Crowley Foods items began to be made at facilities elsewhere which were better equipped. Production at the plant ceased altogether in 2012, but the warehouse and distribution center continued to be used until 2014.|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} for {{producing}} cold filled <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> was developed. Fresh milk was fermented to pH 4. 8 {{and allowed to}} drain in a cotton bag over night. The obtained <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> base was processed by heating, homogenization, and filling into beakers (hot filled) or alternatively by cooling to 40 °C after homogenization and subsequently filled in beakers (cold filled). The rheological properties of hot and cold filled <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> were characterized, after two days storage at 4 °C, using a penetration test as well as flow curves. Results showed that the peak force of cold filled <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> was only ~ 25 % of the hot filled <b>cream</b> <b>cheese,</b> as was the area to peak. The hot filled <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> exhibited higher Young’s Modulus compared to the cold filled <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> as well whereas the latter had a higher initial shear stress and apparent viscosity. Cooling using a scraped surface heat exchanger (SSHE) prior to packaging thus reduced the firmness and modified the texture profile of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{combination}} of a bagel with <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> has been promoted to American consumers in the past by American food manufacturers and publishers. In the early 1950s, Kraft Foods launched an [...] "aggressive advertising campaign" [...] that depicted Philadelphia-brand <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> with bagels. In 1977, Better Homes and Family Circle magazines published a bagel and <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> recipe booklet that was distributed in the magazines and also placed in supermarket dairy cases.|$|R
50|$|Another popular flan is flancocho, usually piña colada {{flavored with}} a layer of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> and Puerto Rican style sponge cake underneath. The flancocho can also be made with <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> and cake batter worked into the flan mix.|$|R

50|$|Typical {{ingredients}} include grated carrot, flour, {{sugar or}} brown sugar, cooking oil, spices and baking soda. Additional ingredients may include shredded coconut, raisins, molasses and nuts. Many variations exist, such as carrot cake whoopie pies, cookie sandwiches, and those prepared {{in the style}} of an energy bar. <b>Cream</b> <b>cheese</b> is sometimes used as a topping or a filling in cookie sandwich varieties. Vegan versions may use vegan <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> as a substitute for dairy-based <b>cream</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> first {{appeared}} in the United States, {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century, it was produced in small batches by many farmers (in New York State, not Pennsylvania). Because of the quality of the <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> produced in and around Philadelphia, the town name became associated with the product, although <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> as a manufactured product, in larger batches, came from elsewhere in New York State. The Philadelphia brand is currently owned by Kraft.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cream</b> <b>cheese</b> can be {{used for}} many {{purposes}} in sweet and savoury cookery, and is in the same family of ingredients as other milk products, such as cream, milk, butter, and yogurt. It {{can be used}} in cooking to make cheesecake and to thicken sauces and make them creamy. <b>Cream</b> <b>cheese</b> is sometimes used in place of or with butter (typically two parts <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> to one part butter) when making cakes or cookies, and <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> frosting. It is the main ingredient in the filling of crab rangoon, an appetizer commonly served at U.S. Chinese restaurants. It can also be used instead of or with butter or olive oil in mashed potatoes, and in some westernized sushi rolls.|$|R
5000|$|In American Jewish {{culture and}} American Jewish cuisine, a bagel and <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> is {{sometimes}} called a [...] "whole schmear" [...] or [...] "whole schmeer", indicating a toasted bagel with <b>cream</b> <b>cheese.</b> A [...] "slab" [...] is a bagel served with a slab of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> atop it. [...] A [...] "lox and a schmear" [...] refers to a bagel with <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> and lox, a brined and smoked salmon product. Tomato, red onion, capers and chopped hard-boiled egg are additional ingredients that are sometimes used on the lox and schmear. All of these terms are used at some delicatessens in New York City, particularly at Jewish delicatessens and older, more traditional delicatessens.|$|R
50|$|In 1872, William Lawrence, a New York dairyman of the {{township}} of Chester, {{created the first}} American <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> {{as the result of}} adding cream to the recipe for Neufchâtel. This American Neufchâtel is softer than regular <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> due to its approximately 33% lower fat and higher moisture content. Due to this reduced fat content, it is found in most grocery stores as a reduced-fat option to <b>cream</b> <b>cheese.</b> In the United States, this Neufchâtel is sometimes called farmers' cheese.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Philly roll" [...] {{derives from}} the Philadelphia <b>Cream</b> <b>Cheese</b> brand.

40|$|The {{naked eye}} {{observation}} of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> confocal scanning laser microscopy images only provides qualitative information about its microstructure. Because {{those products are}} dense dairy gels, confocal scanning laser microscopy images of 2 different <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> may appear close. Quantitative image analysis is then necessary to compensate for human eye deficiency (e. g., lack of precision, subjectivity). Two kinds of quantitative image analysis were performed in this study: high-order statistical methods and grayscale mathematical morphology. They were applied to study the microstructure of 3 different <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> (same manufacturing process, same dry matter content, but different fat and protein contents). Advantages and drawbacks of both methods are reviewed. The way they {{may be used to}} describe <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> microstructure is also presented...|$|R
50|$|Creole <b>cream</b> <b>cheese's</b> {{popularity}} declined {{during the}} second half of the 20th century and it became difficult to find. Several dairies in South Louisiana have offered creole <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> in the past, including Borden's, Gold Seal and Barbe's. In 1998 it was still available at Dorignac's Food Center on Veterans Boulevard in Metairie. The Gold Seal Creamery that was the last Creole <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> factory in New Orleans operated from about 1920 to 1986 and its blond-brick building constructed in 1954 is being converted into loft apartments.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} which product attributes the consumers liked and consider important, to analyze the characteristics of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese's</b> consumers, to evaluate the suitability of the marketing strategy to the consumers' behavior and to make suggestion for improving the marketing strategy. The data when? collected from 50 respondents in the Bogor area who ware both consumer and no consumers of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> using a convenient sampling method. Cross tabulations, Fishbein and biplot were used to analyze the data. The results of this study showed that the most important product attribute is taste and the type of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> that most of the consumers prefer is the plain <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> due to its usage versatility. The most potential consumers of <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> according to the gender are women due to their nature as the person in the house who decided the meals. However, people who are between 30 - 39 years old and those who have monthly income more than 4 million rupiah are also potential consumers. According to consumer's behavior analysis, <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> products have a good marketing potential. Therefore PT. YUMMY FOOD UTAMA might need to review some of the strategies such as the strategy for product, promotion and distribution in order to expand their market. ...|$|R
5000|$|Bagel sandwiches: Due {{to their}} Jewish connection, bagels {{generally}} do not contain pork, but other foods associated with the community, such as deli meats, lox or other smoked fish, and <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> are used.

40|$|<b>Cream</b> <b>cheese</b> {{is a good}} {{model for}} {{studying}} the effect of process and formulation changes on the modification of product texture. In this study, the intensity of heat treatment (72 degrees C/ 20 s or 94 degrees C/ 40 s), the final pH of acidification (pH 5. 2 or 4. 9) and the homogenization pressure (0, 5, 20, or 60 MPa) were studied. Special {{attention was paid to}} the whey protein denaturation, casein micelle dissociation, fat globule size and their relations with structural, rheological, and sensory characteristics of the <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> model. Rheological properties of final <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> mainly depended on homogenization pressure. Increasing the homogenization pressure led to a decrease in fat globule size and consequently in an increase in the <b>cream</b> <b>cheese</b> firmness. This result was modulated by heat treatment temperature and the subsequent whey protein denaturation. <b>Cream</b> <b>cheese</b> final pH between 5. 2 and 4. 9 had a low impact on rheological properties but was the most discriminating factor for sensory perception by strongly affecting product appearance especially its brightness and its shade...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the differences in the oxidative stability during storage of fish oil enriched <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> when fish oil was added either as neat oil or pre-emulsified oil with sodium caseinate, whey protein isolate, or a combination of milk proteins and phospholipids as emulsifier. Results showed that the addition of fish oil decreased the oxidative stability of <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> regardless of the addition method, especially when the cheese was stored longer than five weeks. The oxidative stability of fish oil enriched <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> was highest when fish oil was added as neat oil or in a delivery emulsion prepared with a combination of milk proteins and phospholipids. Adding the fish oil in a delivery emulsion prepared with whey protein or caseinate resulted in a less oxidative stable product. It was furthermore shown that the microstructure of the <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses</b> was affected by fish oil addition, and it was suggested that the change in microstructure was partly responsible for the oxidative stability of the <b>cream</b> <b>cheeses...</b>|$|R
