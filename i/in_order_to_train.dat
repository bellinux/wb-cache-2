5|$|Initial {{efforts in}} 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers {{to raise the}} warship's {{propeller}} were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off Cape Hatteras. Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons {{as well as the}} inability to bring up the wreck intact, NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship, namely her engine, propeller, guns, and turret. It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years. The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $14.5 million. The Navy divers, mainly from its two Mobile Diving and Salvage Units, would perform the bulk of the work necessary <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>train</b> in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>train</b> the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E

5|$|While Hudah {{was located}} in the Mozambique Channel, the cyclone was {{expected}} to cause flood conditions in the Mozambican provinces of Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and potentially Zambezia. Even prior to Hudah, Mozambique was already facing a widespread flood and resultant humanitarian crisis; conditions which were further exacerbated by three tropical cyclones which impacted the country within the previous four months. The Instituto Nacional de Gestão de Calamidades(INGC) warned residents in potentially affected areas to take precautionary measures and secure fishing boats. The South African National Defense Force(SANDF) maintained 50soldiers and other military personnel {{and a number of}} aircraft to monitor the ongoing floods in Mozambique and potential impacts from Hudah. An Australian contingency held operations for a hospital and water purification plant in Chibuto to assist potentially affected populations. Multiple other relief organizations began to supply Mozambique with relief supplies due to the threat of the impending storm. The UN World Food Programme(WFP) sent 1,000tonnes (1,100short tons) of food to Nampula Province and 500tonnes (550short tons) of food to Quelimane Province. The WFP also placed relief aircraft on standby. The Mozambican Ministry of Health sent 30tents and 10rolls of plastic to Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia provinces. The United States Agency for International Development(USAID) dispatched a group of 12-member search and rescue team to Maputo <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>train</b> local relief crews.|$|E
