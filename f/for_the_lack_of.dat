5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest are responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters {{and that it is}} too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To {{compensate}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> his own children, he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in the home. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

This article simulated {{the relationships of}} surface reflectance between HJ- 1 CCD blue band and MODIS SWIR channel using typical object spectra from ASTER spectral library. A new surface reflectance determining model at HJ- 1 CCD blue band was constructed by introducing MODIS SWIR channel as support, and was used in HJ- 1 A/B CCD aerosol optical depth retrieval. The validation using AERONET ground measurements indicated that the proposed aerosol retrieval method has preferable accuracy and stability...|$|R
5|$|However, it {{was more}} {{difficult}} in practice. The French were still a vacillating ally until the spring/summer, 1940, but the Command was still stretched by German naval forces operating from Germany, and then Norway. The Germans used surface vessels and U-boats to breakout into the Atlantic by using periods of dark, in winter, and weather conditions unfavourable to aircraft that were still without radar. Tiger Moth biplanes were used, as were civil pilots, to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> Hudsons. These machines were also without armament to defend from enemy fighters. It could carry 250lb DCs, {{but there was no}} sufficient stock. Only 100lb bombs could be used by the Anson, and they were ineffective. Crew were also insufficiently trained.|$|E
5|$|In Maine, on {{the other}} side of the Atlantic, {{shifting}} fish populations due to changes in sea temperature are being blamed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> availability of the herring which is the staple diet of the puffins in the area. Some adult birds have become emaciated and died. Others have been provisioning the nest with butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) but these are often too large and deep-bodied for the chick to swallow, causing it to die from starvation. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird's breeding range and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the motivating reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of}} the Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E

5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5|$|One reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sales, and for {{the poor}} {{condition}} of many surviving specimens, was that while the fair was open, the economic Panic of 1893 began, {{one of the worst}} depressions in the nation's history—fifty cents could make the difference between a family eating or starving {{at a time when the}} average visitor to the fair spent $1.18. Fairgoers were disinclined to exchange a dollar for a fifty-cent piece, and those who had bought Columbian half dollars before the crash often spent their souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Agent is {{autonomous}} {{software that}} mediates e-service <b>for</b> human on <b>the</b> Internet. The acceptance of agent-mediated e-service (AMES) is very slow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> security management infrastructure for multi-agent system. Therefore we proposed an agent-oriented {{public key infrastructure}} (APKI) for multi-agent e-service. In this APKI, a taxonomy of digital certificates are generated, stored, verified, and revoked to satisfy different access and delegation control purposes. Agent identity certificate was designed for agent’s authentication whereas attributed and agent authorization certificates were proposed for agent’s authorization and delegation. Using these digital certificates, we establish agent trust relationships on the cyberspace. A trusted agent-mediated e-service scenario will be shown to demonstrate the feasibility of our APKI. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not {{be compared to the}} Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E
