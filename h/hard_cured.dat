5000|$|Munster, {{being the}} most {{significant}} dairying region of Ireland, {{was also one of}} the most important areas for pork production as buttermilk made an excellent feed for pigs. Irish pork producers embraced innovation in the course of the late 19th century. In 1862, when a new method of curing bacon was developed it was immediately employed by Irish pork processors. Similar advances were made in breeding. In 1887, the Bacon Curers’ Pig Improvement Association was established and played a central role in popularising the Large White Ulster breed across Munster.In 1820, Henry Denny began business as a provisions merchant in Waterford and, over the following decades, patented a number of production methods of bacon as well as establishing of the Denny ‘star’ brand in Britain., In 1880s, Henry's son Edward established pork processing plants in Germany, Denmark and America with Denny technological expertise in particular helping the Danish bacon industry to develop. Another large Irish pork processor of the era, O'Mara's, meanwhile set up bacon curing facilities in Russia in 1891.The famous Limerick cured ham was also developed around this era. According to a 1902 document from the Department of Agriculture, it came about largely by accident: ‘1880… Limerick producers were short of money…they produced what was considered meat in a half cured condition. The unintentional cure proved extremely popular and others followed suit.’ [...] The decreasing use of salt was additionally supported by advances in technology and transport which meant pork did not need to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period of time. Recognising the change in tastes that favoured mild cure, Alexander Shaw commented in 1902 that ‘the <b>hard</b> <b>cured</b> bacon of former days would today be looked on as akin to Lot's wife.'One of the by-products of an export-oriented commercial pork industry was the plentiful availability of cheaper cuts to the local populace. In the major Irish production centres such as Limerick, Waterford and particularly Cork, crubeens (pigs totters), drisheen (blood pudding) and tripe were staples of the local diet throughout the 19th and much of the 20th centuries as a result of their plentiful availability.Key brands established in the 19th and early 20th century such as Denny, Galtee, Roscrea and Shaw's remain today among the leading pork, bacon and sausage brands in Ireland. All are owed by Irish food company Kerry Group, which also owns the UK sausage brand Richmond. Richmond Irish sausages Have the largest number of sausages sold by any company in the UK. Denny's sausages receive a mention in James Joyce's Ulysses. 'And a pound and a half of Denny's sausages…The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausage pink' and the company also claims to have invented the skinless sausage in 1941.|$|E

Besides, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of BCB is studied with the main goals of smoothing surface topography of substrate after BCB filling and removing excess BCB coating which may be necessary in some applications. Removal rate for BCB, V RR, of about 0. 24 μm/min has been achieved for <b>hard</b> <b>cured</b> BCB films using acid slurry.

40|$|The {{complete}} dentures {{are currently}} made using different technologies. In {{order to avoid}} deficiencies of the prostheses made using the classical technique, several alternative systems and procedures were imagined, {{directly related to the}} material used and also to the manufacturing technology. Thus, at the present time, there are several injecting systems and technologies on the market, that use chemoplastic materials, which are heat cured (90 - 100 Â°C), in dry or wet environment, or cold cured (below 60 Â°C). There are also technologies that plasticize a <b>hard</b> <b>cured</b> material by thermoplastic processing (without any chemical changes) and then inject it into a mold. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the existence of possible defects in several dental prostheses using a non invasive method, before their insertion in the mouth. Different dental prostheses, fabricated from various materials were investigated using en-face optical coherence tomography. In order to discover the defects, the scanning was made in three planes, obtaining images at different depths, from 0, 01 Î¼m to 2 mm. In several of the investigated prostheses we found defects which may cause their fracture. These defects are totally included in the prostheses material and can not be vizualised with other imagistic methods. In conclusion, en-face OCT is an important investigative tool for the dental practice. ...|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{performed}} {{on the relationship between}} <b>hard</b> <b>cured</b> gastric ulcers and fungi in rats. Experimental gastric ulcers were prepared by the use of the Clamping-Cortisone method. Rats with experimental gastric ulcers were divided into 3 groups, A, B and C. Group A was neither administered drugs nor fungi. Group B was given Candida albicans. Group C was dosed chlorhexidine. The results were as follows: 1. Experimental gastric ulcers with fungi in their bottom were found in 4 rats out of 13 belonging to group B. 2. The defection of fungi on the crate surface of the experimental gastric ulcers revealed that positive results were obtained in all cases of group A or B and in 3 cases out of 11 of group C. As to the species of the fungi, in group a Torulopsis famata, in group B Candida albicans and in group C. Torulopsis famata were identified respectively. 3. The normal fungous flora in the intact stomachs of experimental animals was identified as Torulopsis famata. 4. The fungous form in the bottom of experimental gastric ulcers was yeastlike in the cases that were sacrificed 3 weeks later making ulcers. In case the heading of experimental gastric ulcers was protracted, there were seen mycerial fungi increasing in quantity. 5. The crater surface of the gastric ulcers of group B where fungi grew abundantly was dirty histlogically and the recovery of gastric ulcers was delaye l. The scar formation of gastric ulcers of group B was weaker than group A and C. These results apparently indicate that the course of the gastric ulcers with fungi in their bottom will be delayed in group B. 6. The recovery of experimental gastric ulcers in group C was most remarkable among 3 groups. It may be posible that the application of chlorhexidine as the gastric ulcer agent will contribute to the purification of the surface of gastric ulcers and promote the healing of them...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple measurement method to estimate water solubility and diffusivity in dielectric polymers which have low sorption rates and high diffusivities. The polymer dielectric is sandwiched between electrodes {{to create a}} specific capacitive structure. It is then exposed to step-like humid air stimuli.

The extraction model is derived from the theory of gas diffusion in polymer coatings. After experimental validation on Cyclotene 4024 processed with <b>hard</b> <b>cure,</b> the method is used to compare the impact of different cure methods on the solubility and the diffusivity of this material and of Aqueous Developable PhotoBCB. Hence good candidates are determined for microelectronic, packaging and humidity sensor applications...|$|R

50|$|MCL, {{like most}} malignancies, {{results from the}} {{acquisition}} {{of a combination of}} (non-inherited) genetic mutations in somatic cells. This leads to a clonal expansion of malignant B lymphocytes. The factors that initiate the genetic alterations are typically not identifiable, and usually occur in people with no particular risk factors for lymphoma development. Because it is an acquired genetic disorder, MCL is neither communicable nor inheritable. A defining characteristic of MCL is mutation and overexpression of cyclin D1, a cell cycle gene, that contributes to the abnormal proliferation of the malignant cells. MCL cells may also be resistant to drug-induced apoptosis, making them <b>harder</b> to <b>cure</b> with chemotherapy or radiation. Cells affected by MCL proliferate in a nodular or diffuse pattern with two main cytologic variants, typical or blastic. Typical cases are small to intermediate-sized cells with irregular nuclei. Blastic (aka blastoid) variants have intermediate to large-sized cells with finely dispersed chromatin, and are more aggressive in nature. The tumor cells accumulate in the lymphoid system, including lymph nodes and the spleen, with non-useful cells eventually rendering the system dysfunctional. MCL may also replace normal cells in the bone marrow, which impairs normal blood cell production.|$|R
