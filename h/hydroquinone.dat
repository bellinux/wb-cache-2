5|$|<b>Hydroquinone</b> lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, <b>hydroquinone</b> leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. <b>Hydroquinone</b> is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using <b>hydroquinone.</b> Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. <b>Hydroquinone</b> is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose <b>hydroquinone</b> has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} are {{disturbed}} {{by the appearance of}} lentigines, cryosurgery may be beneficial. Due to the large number of lentigines this may prove time consuming. An alternative treatment with tretinoin or <b>hydroquinone</b> creams may help.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical <b>hydroquinone</b> are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
40|$|Recently found {{experimental}} evidence has provided {{strong support for}} an alternative photoyellowing mechanism that suggests that pulp-photoyellowing occurs due to direct photooxidation of <b>hydroquinones</b> (present in mechanical pulps) top-quinones. Because <b>hydroquinones</b> {{were found to be}} present in pulps, {{it may be possible to}} quantify them. Quantification of mechanical-pulp <b>hydroquinones</b> is important because it would provide information on a pulp's potential for photoyellowing. One of the ways to accomplish this is to use the method that successfully detected <b>hydroquinones,</b> namely the method of "oxygensensitivity of laser-induced-fluorescence (LIF) ". Preliminary findings of this work will be discussed in the presentation...|$|R
5|$|SnCl2 also reduces quinones to <b>hydroquinones.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, <b>hydroquinone,</b> resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with <b>hydroquinone,</b> but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and catalase enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of <b>hydroquinone</b> to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
2500|$|The {{peroxidase}} enzymes {{facilitate the}} oxidation of the <b>hydroquinones</b> into p-quinone, {{as shown in}} the reaction below: ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2-Butyne, {{along with}} propyne, {{is used to}} {{synthesize}} alkylated <b>hydroquinones</b> in the total synthesis of Vitamin E.|$|R
50|$|Propyne, {{along with}} 2-butyne, {{is also used}} to {{synthesize}} alkylated <b>hydroquinones</b> in the total synthesis of vitamin E.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also one}} of the two chief chemicals in the defence system of the bombardier beetle, reacting with <b>hydroquinone</b> to discourage predators.|$|E
25|$|The spray is {{produced}} from a reaction between two chemical compounds, <b>hydroquinone</b> and hydrogen peroxide, which {{are stored in}} two reservoirs in the beetle's abdomen. When the aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide reaches the vestibule, catalysts facilitate the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation of the <b>hydroquinone.</b> Heat from the reaction brings the mixture to near the boiling point of water and produces gas that drives the ejection. The damage caused can be fatal to attacking insects. Some bombardier beetles can direct the spray {{over a wide range}} of directions.|$|E
25|$|FAD {{can exist}} in four {{different}} redox states, {{which are the}} flavin-N(5)-oxide, quinone, semiquinone, and <b>hydroquinone.</b> FAD is converted between these states by accepting or donating electrons. FAD, in its fully oxidized form, or quinone form, accepts two electrons and two protons to become FADH2 (<b>hydroquinone</b> form). The semiquinone (FADH·) can be formed by either reduction of FAD or oxidation of FADH2 by accepting or donating one electron and one proton, respectively. Some proteins, however, generate and maintain a superoxidized form of the flavin cofactor, the flavin-N(5)-oxide. See the mechanism section below for details.|$|E
40|$|Ascidians of {{the genus}} Aplidium are {{recognized}} as {{an important source of}} chemical diversity and bioactive natural products. Among the compounds produced by this genus are non-nitrogenous metabolites, mainly prenylated quinones and <b>hydroquinones.</b> This review discusses the isolation, structural elucidation, and biological activities of quinones, <b>hydroquinones,</b> rossinones, longithorones, longithorols, floresolides, scabellones, conicaquinones, aplidinones, thiaplidiaquinones, and conithiaquinones. A compilation of the 13 C-NMR spectral data of these compounds is also presented...|$|R
50|$|Some {{constituents}} {{such as the}} <b>hydroquinones</b> are hepatotoxic and {{in cases}} of urinary tract infections, other treatment options are recommended.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two large}} glands that {{open at the}} tip of the abdomen. Each gland is {{composed}} of a thick walled vestibule which contains a mixture of catalases and peroxidases produced by the secretory cells that line the vestibule. Both glands are also made up of a thin-walled and compressible reservoir which contains an aqueous solution of <b>hydroquinones</b> and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide and <b>hydroquinones</b> do not react in the reservoir because the environment of the reservoir does not give sufficient energy to fuel the reaction.|$|R
25|$|Because COT is {{unstable}} and easily forms explosive organic peroxides, {{a small amount}} of <b>hydroquinone</b> is usually added to commercially available material. Testing for peroxides is advised when using a previously opened bottle; white crystals around the neck of the bottle may be composed of the peroxide, which may explode when mechanically disturbed.|$|E
25|$|Skin {{lightening}} {{products are}} also prevalent {{in countries where}} non-white ethnicities are the majority, and the industry makes billions of dollars every year. In India alone, whitening products make up 45% of the skin care market. Plenty of these whitening cosmetics {{are known to have}} dangerous side effects due to the ingredients in them; <b>hydroquinone,</b> for instance, is known to cause irritation and leukemia while mercury is known to cause rashes and pigmentation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for vitiligo. For those with light skin, {{sunscreen}} and makeup {{are all that}} is typically recommended. Other treatment options may include steroid creams or phototherapy to darken the light patches. Alternatively, efforts to lighten the unaffected skin, such as with <b>hydroquinone,</b> may be tried. A number of surgical options are available {{for those who do}} not improve with other measures. A combination of treatments generally has better outcomes. Counselling to provide emotional support may be useful.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large scale}} {{industrial}} application of quinones {{is for the}} production of hydrogen peroxide. 2-Alkylanthraquinones are hydrogenated to the corresponding <b>hydroquinones</b> (quinizarins), which then transfer [...] to oxygen: ...|$|R
50|$|The plant {{contains}} diverse phytochemicals, including ursolic acid, tannic acid, gallic acid, some {{essential oils}} and resin, <b>hydroquinones</b> (mainly arbutin, up to 17%), tannins (up to 15%), phenolic glycosides and flavonoids.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydroquinones</b> {{are one of}} the {{two primary}} {{reagents}} in the defensive glands of bombardier beetles, along with hydrogen peroxide (and perhaps other compounds, depending on the species), which collect in a reservoir. The reservoir opens through a muscle-controlled valve onto a thick-walled reaction chamber. This chamber is lined with cells that secrete catalases and peroxidases. When the contents of the reservoir are forced into the reaction chamber, the catalases and peroxidases rapidly break down the hydrogen peroxide and catalyze the oxidation of the <b>hydroquinones</b> into p-quinones. These reactions release free oxygen and generate enough heat to bring the mixture to the boiling point and vaporize about a fifth of it, producing a hot spray from the beetle's abdomen.|$|R
25|$|During film {{development}} {{the latent}} image is intensified by {{addition of a}} chemical, typically <b>hydroquinone,</b> that selectivity reduces those grains which contain atoms of silver. The process, which is sensitive to temperature and concentration, will completely reduce grains to silver metal, intensifying the latent image {{on the order of}} 1010 to 1011. This step demonstrates the advantage and superiority of silver halides over other systems: the latent image, which takes only milliseconds to form and is invisible, is sufficient to produce a full image from it.|$|E
25|$|Warfarin {{and other}} 4-hydroxycoumarins block {{the action of}} VKOR. This results in {{decreased}} concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K <b>hydroquinone</b> in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results {{in the production of}} clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and <b>hydroquinone</b> bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel peroxidase, {{oxidizing}} Mn 2 + {{and different}} aromatic compounds, was isolated. <b>Hydroquinones,</b> substituted phenols, dyes, other aromatic compounds and Mn 2 + were compared as reducing substrates, and conclusions {{presented in the}} light of a molecular model built by homology modeling. The enzymes showed the fastest reaction rates with Mn 2 +, but the highest affinity corresponded to <b>hydroquinones</b> and dyes. Oxidation of Reactive Black 5 (an azo-dye not oxidized by Mn 3 +) was non-competitively inhibited by Mn 2 +. These findings, together with identification of putative Mn-binding site (involving Glu 36, Glu 40, Asp 175 and inner heme propionate) and long-range electron transfer pathways, indicate that different sites are involved in substrate oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Photoreactions of {{aldehydes}} with quinones exhibit acylated <b>hydroquinones</b> in good yields. In {{the case}} of substituted naphthoquinones (pos. 5 - 8) two regioisomers are formed. However, lithium perchlorate as additive affords only one regioisomer. This effect is discussed {{on the basis of}} semiemperical calculations...|$|R
25|$|The large {{majority}} of known organisms use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. One unique use of catalase occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains <b>hydroquinones</b> and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes {{the contents of the}} two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the <b>hydroquinones</b> and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats the mixture to the boiling point.|$|R
25|$|DNA damage {{can also}} cause {{epigenetic}} changes. DNA damage is very frequent, occurring on average about 60,000 times a day per cell {{of the human body}} (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain. In particular, a double strand break in DNA can initiate unprogrammed epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section). In addition, the enzyme Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a repair process. This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause nucleosome remodeling. Nucleosome remodeling has been found to cause, for instance, epigenetic silencing of DNA repair gene MLH1. DNA damaging chemicals, such as benzene, <b>hydroquinone,</b> styrene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene, cause considerable hypomethylation of DNA, some through the activation of oxidative stress pathways.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{number of}} species have {{developed}} special glands that produce chemicals for deterring predators (see Defense and predation). The Ground beetle's (of Carabidae) defensive glands, located at the posterior, produce a variety of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. While African carabid beetles (e.g., Anthia some of which used to comprise the genus Thermophilum) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. While Bombardier beetles have well developed, like other carabid beetles, pygidial glands that empty from the lateral edges of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers. The first holds hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, with the second holding just hydrogen peroxide plus catalases. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, forming temperatures of around 100 C, with the breakdown of <b>hydroquinone</b> to H2 + O2 + quinone, with the O2 propelling the excretion.|$|E
25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{determine}} exposure to benzene. Benzene {{itself can be}} measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid, phenylmercapturic acid, phenol, catechol, <b>hydroquinone</b> and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 μg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 μg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} free radical -scavenging and antioxidant activities of various structurally related <b>hydroquinones</b> including hydroxynaplithalenones and dihydroxyanthracenones. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy and spin trapping techniques were {{used to evaluate the}} ability of <b>hydroquinones</b> to scavenge hydroxyl, diphenylpicrylhydrazyl. and galvinoxyl radicals. In addition, the oxygen radical absorbing capacity assay using fluorescein (ORAC-FL) was used to obtain the relative antioxidant capacity of these radicals. The rate constants of the first H atom abstraction by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (k(2)), were obtained tinder pseudo-first-order conditions. The free radical-scavenging activities and k(2), values discriminate well between hydroxynaphthalenones and dihydroxyanthracenones, showing that the latter have better antioxidant properties. The aforementioned experimental data agree with quanturn-chemical results demonstrating the relevance of intramolecular H bonding to radical-scavenging activities...|$|R

25|$|In organic synthesis, CAN {{is useful}} as an oxidant for many {{functional}} groups (alcohols, phenols, and ethers) {{as well as}} C–H bonds, especially those that are benzylic. Alkenes undergo dinitroxylation, although the outcome is solvent-dependent. Quinones are produced from catechols and <b>hydroquinones</b> and even nitroalkanes are oxidized.|$|R
