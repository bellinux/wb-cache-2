40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{framework}} for answering queries over inconsistent ontologies by using contrastive reasoning, the reasoning of contrasts which are expressed as contrary conjunctions like the word “but ” in natural language. We argue that contrastive answers are more informative for reasoning <b>with</b> <b>inconsistent</b> ontologies, {{as compared with the}} usual simple boolean answer, i. e., either “yes ” or “no”. We propose a general framework for contrastive reasoning <b>with</b> <b>inconsistent</b> ontologies. The proposed approach has been implemented in the system CRION (Contrastive Reasoning <b>with</b> <b>Inconsistent</b> ONtologies) as a reasoning plug-in in the LarKC (Large Knowledge Collider) platform. We report several experiments in which we apply the CRION system to some realistic ontologies. This evaluation shows that contrastive reasoning is a useful extension to the existing approaches of reasoning <b>with</b> <b>inconsistent</b> ontologies.

40|$|Knowledge {{of female}} sex workers' (FSW) condom use {{behaviors}} in Vietnam {{is important for}} predicting the epidemic and designing interventions. Four hundred FSWs in Hanoi were studied in 2002. Consistent condom use {{in the past month}} was higher with irregular clients (62 %), less with regular clients (41 %), and lowest with "love mates" (5 %). Reasons for not using condoms were partner objection, condom unavailability, and belief of partner's disease-free status. Twenty-seven percent reported not always having a condom available. Thirty-five percent reported increasing condom use in the previous 6 months. Reluctance to ask clients to use condoms and condom unavailability were independently associated <b>with</b> <b>inconsistent</b> condom use <b>with</b> both irregular and regular clients. Older age was also associated <b>with</b> <b>inconsistent</b> condom use <b>with</b> irregular clients. Condom promotion should focus on FSWs and their partners. Negative attitudes toward FSWs and condom promotion need to be changed to reduce stigmatization of FSWs and to make condom use a norm in the society...|$|R

5|$|Gandhi's {{experiment}} with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai.
