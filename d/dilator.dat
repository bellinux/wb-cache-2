5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed <b>dilator</b> muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E

50|$|Hegar <b>dilators</b> were {{developed}} and introduced by Alfred Hegar in 1879. Typically, <b>dilators</b> are {{a set of}} metal rods of increasing diameters, from a few millimeters up to 26 millimeters. The rods are round, slightly curved, and have a conal tip. Some sets have conal tips at both ends, while others have one end flattened for handling. Hegar <b>dilators</b> are marked with a Hegar number equivalent to 0.5 millimeters.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{systematically}} {{review the}} international literature for studies evaluating internal (NoZovent) and external (Breathe Right Strips) nasal <b>dilators</b> as treatment for {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA). Study Design. Systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods. Four databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, were searched through September 29, 2016. Results. One-hundred twelve studies were screened, fifty-eight studies were reviewed, and fourteen studies met criteria. In 147 patients, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was reported, {{and there was an}} improvement from a mean ± standard deviation (M ± SD) of 28. 7 ± 24. 0 to 27. 4 ± 23. 3 events/hr, p value 0. 64. There was no significant change in AHI, lowest oxygen saturation, or snoring index in OSA patients when using nasal <b>dilators.</b> However, a subanalysis demonstrated a slight reduction in apnea index (AI) with internal nasal <b>dilators</b> (decrease by 4. 87 events/hr) versus minimal change for external nasal <b>dilators</b> (increase by 0. 64 events/hr). Conclusion. Although nasal <b>dilators</b> have demonstrated improved nasal breathing, they have not shown improvement in obstructive sleep apnea outcomes, with the exception of mild improvement in apnea index when internal nasal <b>dilators</b> were used...|$|R
25|$|The frons is {{that part}} of the head capsule that lies ventrad or anteriad of the vertex. The frons varies in size {{relative}} to the insect, and in many species the definition of its borders is arbitrary, even in some insect taxa that have well-defined head capsules. In most species, though, the frons is bordered at its anterior by the frontoclypeal or epistomal sulcus above the clypeus. Laterally it is limited by the fronto-genal sulcus, if present, and the boundary with the vertex, by the ecdysial cleavage line, if it is visible. If there is a median ocellus, it generally is on the frons, though in some insects such as many Hymenoptera, all three ocelli appear on the vertex. A more formal definition is that it is the sclerite from which the pharyngeal <b>dilator</b> muscles arise, but in many contexts that too, is not helpful. In the anatomy of some taxa, such as many Cicadomorpha, the front of the head is fairly clearly distinguished and tends to be broad and sub-vertical; that median area commonly is taken to be the frons.|$|E
25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris <b>dilator</b> muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E

2500|$|In the eye, {{atropine}} induces mydriasis {{by blocking}} contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillary <b>dilator</b> muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma.|$|E
2500|$|Often, {{when faced}} with a person {{experiencing}} painful intercourse, a gynecologist will recommend Kegel exercises and provide some additional lubricants. Strengthening the muscles that unconsciously tighten during vaginismus may be extremely counter-intuitive for some people. Although vaginismus has not been shown to affect a person's ability to produce lubrication, providing additional lubricant can be helpful in achieving successful penetration. This {{is due to the fact}} that women may not produce natural lubrication if anxious or in pain. Treatment of vaginismus may involve the use Hegar dilators, (sometimes called vaginal trainers) [...] progressively increasing the size of the <b>dilator</b> inserted into the vagina.|$|E

50|$|The {{expression}} <b>dilator</b> pupillae muscle, {{as used in}} {{the list}} of English equivalents of the Terminologia Anatomica, is actually partly Latin, i.e. <b>dilator</b> pupillae, with pupillae (=of the pupil), a noun in the genitive case modifying <b>dilator,</b> a noun in the nominative case, and partly English, i.e. muscle. In previous editions (Nomina Anatomica) this muscle was officially called the musculus <b>dilator</b> pupillae, The Nomina Anatomica as authorized in 1895 in Basle and in 1935 in Jena used the full Latin expression.|$|E

50|$|Apraclonidine may {{be useful}} in the {{diagnosis}} of Horner's syndrome. In Horner's syndrome, the sympathetic innervation to the pupillary <b>dilator</b> muscle is lost. The affected pupil is thus miotic and the pupillary <b>dilator</b> responds to denervation by increasing α1 receptors. Apraclonidine is useful in this case due to its weak α1-adrenergic properties. When applied to the denervated (and thus hyper-sensitive) pupillary <b>dilator</b> muscle, a super-normal dilatory response is generated in which the pupil dilates to a degree greater than that which would be seen in a non-denervated muscle. This causes the reversal of anisocoria that is characteristic of Horner's.|$|E

The reverse is true, so control of pupil size is controlled by differences in contraction intensity of each muscle.|$|E
