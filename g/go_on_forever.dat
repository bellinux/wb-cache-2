5|$|The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, {{which lasted}} {{as long as}} the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, {{providing}} them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, then landed a part in the play Women <b>Go</b> <b>On</b> <b>Forever,</b> directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever.</b> But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E

[...] Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as [...] "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses– simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{had built}} a {{reputation}} as an innovative teacher, so when he was cast as the lead in Grand Street Follies of 1928, he was also appointed the choreographer. The show received rave reviews and was followed by Grand Street Follies of 1929. These roles led to a part in George Kelly's Maggie the Magnificent, a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney's performance. Cagney saw this role (and Women <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> <b>Forever)</b> as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned [...] "...what a director was for and what a director could do. They were directors who could play all the parts in the play better than the actors cast for them." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Sophie Bruce of BBC Music, Michael Wood of Los Angeles Times, {{and a writer}} for Rap-Up named the song one of the album's highlights. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters was positive, writing that the song and [...] "Slow Dance" [...] "tend to provide better matches between the vocals and the music, since the backdrop keeps things simple and the lyrics don’t always fall into slang and unintentional irony". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the album's problem is the slow numbers, including [...] "Make Love". Cinquemani said that the song requires a [...] "much more talented vocalist to elevate it above mere filler". Steve Jones of USA Today named it a track to skip, and Glenn Gamboa of Newsday also dismissed the song, writing that it [...] "seems to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> especially following the similarly too-long, too-drawn-out 'Slow Dance". Tracy Garraud of Vibe wrote that its chords [...] "sound more like a Disney princess' cue than a royal highness' arrival and Hilson's fairy-dusted vocals sound more platonic than carnal".|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever.</b> You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E

That puts this proposal squarely in the category of more-harm-than-good." ...|$|E

[...] He cannot be directly held responsible for the mechanization of the Panzers movement, for his social idealism was grounded in Rousseau's Great Enlightenment Path. [...] Pure mechanization would have to transmogrify psychological mutation, risk tragedy, and plunging into the abyss. [...] Rathenau was assimilated by a love for St Francis Assisi, a message of service dedicated to the community that restricted his ambitions. [...] A modified or applied mysticism Rathenau's idea always expressed work as [...] "a joy", alike to Schopenhauer he rejected materialism; recognised its pitfalls, using a deep knowledge of technology to simultaneously warn of its dangers. [...] This distinction with Soviet working methods of dialectical materialism were unwelcome in Germany seeking to rearm. [...] Thus he rallied ideas for management and control as Head of Raw Materials and efficacy of science.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{years after}} the premiere of the {{original}} production of Peter Pan, Barrie wrote an additional scene entitled When Wendy Grew Up. An Afterthought, later {{included in the final}} chapter of Peter and Wendy. In this scene, Peter returns for Wendy years later. But she is now grown up with a daughter of her own named Jane. It is also revealed Wendy married one of the Lost Boys, although this is not mentioned in the novel, and it is never revealed which one she did marry (in the original draft of the play, it is mentioned that she married Tootles, although Barrie omitted this before publication). [...] When Peter learns that Wendy has [...] "betrayed" [...] him by growing up, he is heartbroken until Jane agrees to come to Neverland as Peter's new mother. In the novel's last few sentences, Barrie mentions that Jane has grown up as well and that Peter now takes her daughter Margaret to Neverland. Barrie says this cycle will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever</b> as long as children are [...] "gay and innocent and heartless".|$|E

2500|$|The Hunter × Hunter manga has {{received}} much praise for its plot and characters. Jason Thompson, author of , described its storyline as [...] "an almost random collection of psych-outs, battles, puzzles, and trickery" [...] that works on both a chapter-by-chapter basis {{and a larger}} scale. Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots {{of each of the}} main characters, the story could seemingly <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>forever,</b> despite being unpredictable enough to hold reader interest. Charles Solomon, a writer for The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, praised the moral seriousness of Gon, a quality that gives the protagonist [...] "an appeal his relentlessly upbeat counterparts lack". Publishers Weekly gave a positive review to the first volume of the manga, stating that Togashi [...] "shows a deft touch" [...] with its standard story, calling his artwork [...] "clear and graceful", and mentioning that his characters are [...] "endearing and complex". While Rika Takahashi of EX.org and Claude J. Pelletier of Protoculture Addicts found the art style in Hunter × Hunter to be much simpler than Togashi's two previous serializations, Level E and YuYu Hakusho, both reviewers appreciated the intricate narrative and characters.|$|E
