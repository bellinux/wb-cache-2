Each <b>form</b> <b>features</b> unique abilities: Deku Link can perform a spin attack, shoot bubbles from his mouth, skip on water, and fly {{for a short}} time by launching from Deku Flowers; Goron Link can roll at high speeds (and grow spikes at higher speeds), punch with deadly force, stomp the ground with his massive, rock-like body, walk in lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim rapidly, throw boomerang-like fins from his arms, generate a force field, and walk on the bottoms of bodies of water. Many areas can be accessed only by use of these abilities.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's <b>form</b> <b>features</b> setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a knowledge-based process selection system for cold formed components with rotationally symmetric and rotationally non-symmetric geometries. The process knowledge base requires information and data related to formable geometric shapes, available cold forming operations, and formability rules and forming limits relating to material types. A <b>forming</b> <b>feature</b> representation has been developed to connect formable geometries with available forming operations. A conceptual classification of single and combined <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> has also been developed to represent both rotationally symmetric and rotationally non-symmetric components. A link between operations capable of producing single <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> and combined <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> are obtained using reasoning based on geometric considerations. Formability of <b>forming</b> <b>features</b> is assessed by formability rules and forming limits as a function of material type. Two case studies are used to demonstrate the capabilities of this system for forming process selection for two different component shapes...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "feature" [...] implies {{different}} meanings in different engineering disciplines. This {{has resulted in}} many ambiguous definitions for feature. A feature, in computer-aided design (CAD), usually refers to a region of a part with some interesting geometric or topological properties. These are more precisely called <b>form</b> <b>features.</b> <b>Form</b> <b>features</b> contain both shape information and parametric information of a region of interest. They are now ubiquitous in most current CAD software, where they are used as the primary means of creating 3D geometric models. Examples of <b>form</b> <b>features</b> are extruded boss, loft, etc. Form feature {{is not the only}} type of feature that is discussed in CAD literature. Sometimes a part's functional or manufacturing features of the subject of attention. Although it is quite possible to see <b>form</b> <b>features</b> and manufacturing features are called by the same name, they are not exactly the same concepts. For example, one may either use the name [...] "pocket" [...] to refer to a swept cut on the boundary of a part model, or to refer to a trace left on the part boundary by a specific machining operation. The former is exclusively concerned with a geometric shape whereas the latter is concerned with both the geometric shape and a manufacturing operation, needing more parameters in its definition. As such, a manufacturing feature can be minimally defined as a form feature (if it has a form that can uniquely represent it), but not necessarily vice versa (forms can be interpreted differently in different manufacturing domains). Machining features are an important subset of manufacturing features. A machining feature can be regarded as the volume swept by a [...] "cutting" [...] tool, which is always a negative (subtracted) volume. Finally, there is also the concept of assembly feature, which encodes the assembly method between connected components.|$|E

40|$|When {{developing}} new products, {{it is important}} for a designer to understand users’ perceptions and develop product form with the corresponding perceptions. In order to establish the mapping between users’ perceptions and product design features effectively, in this study, we presented a regression-based Kansei engineering system based on <b>form</b> <b>feature</b> lines for product form design. First according to the characteristics of design concept representation, product <b>form</b> features–product <b>form</b> <b>feature</b> lines were defined. Second, Kansei words were chosen to describe image perceptions toward product samples. Then, multiple linear regression and support vector regression were used to construct the models, respectively, that predicted users’ image perceptions. Using mobile phones as experimental samples, Kansei prediction models were established based on the front view <b>form</b> <b>feature</b> lines of the samples. From the experimental results, these two predict models were of good adaptability. But in contrast to multiple linear regression, the predict performance of support vector regression model was better, and support vector regression is more suitable for form regression prediction. The results of the case showed that the proposed method provided an effective means for designers to manipulate product features as a whole, and it can optimize Kansei model and improve practical values...|$|R
