40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a line of}} research in genetic algorithms (GAs), called building-block identification. The building blocks (BBs) are common structures inferred from a set of solutions. In simple GA, crossover operator {{plays an important role}} in mixing BBs. However, the crossover probably disrupts the BBs because the cut point is chosen at random. Therefore the BBs need to be identified explicitly so that the solutions are efficiently mixed. We propose an approach for identifying BBs. The approach is based on an observation of the compact GA. We observe that the vector elements that correspond to the bits in the same BB are simultaneously updated with a high probability. We formulate the observation to the simultaneity matrix – an ℓ×ℓ matrix of numbers constructed from a set of ℓ-bit solutions. The matrix element in row i and column j is denoted by mij. The larger the mij is, the higher the dependency is between <b>bit</b> <b>i</b> and <b>bit</b> j. If mij is high, <b>bit</b> <b>i</b> and <b>bit</b> j should be passed together to prevent BB disruption. ...|$|R

50|$|The cache in HUVC in {{managed by}} LRU policy, with each VC storing 32-bit values. For {{incoming}} data, it is simultaneously checked with the VC on each level, with the uppermost VC hit getting encoded. Each hit at the ¡th {{level of the}} HUVC incurs <b>i</b> <b>bits</b> switching activity. By switching any bit of 32-bit data bus, we can get (32!)/((32-i)!i!) numbers. That is, we could have (32!)/((32-i)!i!) entries. However, it would require complicated logic to map VC indexes to bus values. For easy VC index encoding, we partition the data bus into i segments and switch one bit in each segment.|$|R
