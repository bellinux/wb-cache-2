Acids derived from linolenic acid were increased in some diabetic tissues from diabetic animals although the linolenic content was normal, indicating less impairment in the desaturation of the omega 3 series of fatty acids. Diabetes suppressed all polyunsaturated acids in the whole animal, but the competition between omega 3 and omega 6 acids favored the excessive suppression of long-chain omega 6 acids and an increase in the proportion of omega 3 acids in lipids of vital tissues. These changes in fatty acid composition of the phospholipids may have significant effects on cellular functions and vasoregulatory control mechanisms in diabetes...|$|R
25|$|There are {{multiple}} subfamilies of eicosanoids, including most prominently the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, lipoxins, resolvins, and eoxins but also others {{as noted in}} the following Nomenclature section. For each subfamily, there is the potential to have at least 5 separate series of metabolites, two series derived from ω-6 PUFAs (arachidonic and <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> <b>acids),</b> one series derived from the ω-3 PUFA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and one series derived from the ω-9 PUFA (mead acid). This subfamily distinction is important. Mammals, including humans, are unable to convert ω-6 into ω-3 PUFA. In consequence, tissue levels of the ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs and their corresponding eicosanoid metabolites link directly to the amount of dietary ω-6 versus ω-3 PUFAs consumed. Since certain of the ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA series of metabolites have almost diametrically opposing physiological and pathological activities, it has often been suggested that the deleterious consequences associated with the consumption of ω-6 PUFA-rich diets reflects excessive production and activities of ω-6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids while the beneficial effects associated with the consumption of ω-3 PUFA-rich diets reflect the excessive production and activities of ω-3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids. In this view, the opposing effects of ω-6 PUFA-derived and ω-3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids on key target cells underlie the detrimental and beneficial effects of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA-rich diets on inflammation and allergy reactions, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cancer growth, {{and a host of other}} processes.|$|R

The goal of our study was to test associations between six common FADS polymorphisms (rs 174556, rs 3834458, rs 174570, rs 2524299, rs 174589, rs 174627), adipose tissue fatty acids, intermediate cardiovascular risk factors, and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) in a matched population based case-control study of Costa Rican adults (n= 1756). Generalized linear models and multiple conditional logistic regression models {{were used to assess}} the associations of interest. Analyses involving intermediate cardiovascular risk factors and MI were also conducted in two replication cohorts, The Nurses’ Health Study (n= 1200) and The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (n= 1295). In the Costa Rica Study, genetic {{variation in}} the FADS cluster was associated with a robust linear decrease in adipose gamma-linolenic, arachidonic, and eicosapentaenoic fatty acids, and significant or borderline significant increases in the eicosadienoic, eicosatrienoic, and <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> fatty <b>acids.</b> However, the associations with adipose tissue fatty acids did not translate into changes in inflammatory biomarkers, blood lipids, or the risk of MI in the discovery or the replication cohorts. In conclusion, fatty acid desaturase polymorphisms impact long-chain PUFA biosynthesis, but their overall effect on cardiovascular health likely involves multiple pathways and merits further investigation...|$|R

However, the processes that control the events and mediators involved in the activation of monocytes {{and their impact on}} the phagocytosis of bacteria are poorly understood. The effect of bacterial endotoxin, interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), fatty acids and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) on the phagocytosis of fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled Escherichia coli (O 157) by human blood monocytes and U 937 cells was studied by flow cytometry. Endotoxin increased the phagocytosis of labelled bacteria by both monocytes and U 937 cells. IL- 1 beta and the polyunsaturated fatty acids; <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> and arachidonic <b>acids</b> also increased the phagocytic activity of both monocytes and U 937 cells. In contrast, PGE 2 suppressed phagocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ketoprofen, further enhanced the increased phagocytic activity in the presence of endotoxin and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) indicating suppression by endogenous prostaglandins. This was confirmed by the data which showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL- 1 increased PGE 2 release and ketoprofen inhibited release. Endotoxin and fatty acids increased IL- 1 beta release also, whereas PGE 2 inhibited release. The data suggest that phagocytic activity may be linked to changes in IL- 1 levels. The data presented in this study also suggest that monocyte phagocytosis in the course of bacterial infection would be altered during pathophysiological events which result in elevation of extracellular fatty acids...|$|R

The proportion of linoleic acid in adipose tissue was lowest in men from north Karelia, Finland, where mortality from coronary heart disease is highest, and highest in men from Italy, where mortality is lowest, with intermediate proportions in men from Scotland and south west Finland. Similar gradients were observed for the desaturation and elongation products <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> and arachidonic <b>acid.</b> The proportion of saturated fatty acids in adipose tissue was highest in Finland, intermediate in Scotland, and lowest in Italy.

Serum cholesterol concentration was higher in north Karelia and south west Finland than in Scotland or Italy. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations reflected the regional differences in serum cholesterol, being higher in Finland and lower in Italy. The ratios of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol, however, did not differ. The regional differences in linoleic acid in adipose tissue remained highly significant when the observed differences in other known risk factors for coronary heart disease among the four areas were taken into account by multivariate analysis.

40|$|The {{administration}} of arachidonic acid (AA) to the isolated perfused {{heart of the}} rat usually produced biphasic coronary responses characterized by initial vasoconstriction followed by prolonged vasodilatation. However, some responses were predominantly vasoconstrictor or vasodilator. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAA) indomethacin (1 - 5 mg/l) and naproxen (12. 5 - 25 mg/ 1) reversibly inhibited both phases of the response induced by AA. Pretreatment of animals with indomethacin (5 mg/kg) or naproxen (25 mg/kg) daily, resulted in unaltered coronary response to AA. Subsequent addition of NSAA to the perfusate produced inhibition of the AA effect. Short infusions of acetylsalicylic acid at low concentrations (2. 9 micrograms/ml), dipyridamole (0. 6 micrograms/ml) and sulphinpyrazone (28. 7 micrograms/ml) selectively inhibited the vasoconstrictor phase of the response to AA. It was confirmed that metabolic coronary dilatation induced by cardiostimulation was inhibited by prolonged AA administration; this effect was prevented by NSAA pretreatment. Reactive hyperaemic responses to short lasting occlusions of coronary inflow were unaffected by NSAA. Linolenic, linoleic, <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> and oleic <b>acid</b> usually produced decreases in coronary flow which were unaffected by NSAA, dipyridamole or sulphinpyrazone. Intra-aortic injections of AA, prostacyclin (PGI 2) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in the intact rat produced a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure with the AA response inhibited by indomethacin. PGI 2 and PGE 2 produced long lasting coronary vasodilatation in the isolated heart. The coronary actions of AA appear {{to be due to}} its transformation, within the easily accessible vascular wall, into prostaglandin and thromboxane-like substances.

Both omega 6 derivatives examined, arachidonic acid (C 20 : 4, omega 6) and <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 20 : 3, omega 6), when added at concentrations up to 1 microM, stimulated the rate of protein synthesis {{and the release of}} prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha). Metabolites of the omega 6 series, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (C 20 : 5, omega 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6, omega 3), were without effect on the rate of protein synthesis and resulted in a decrease in the release of PGF 2 alpha. None of the fatty acids had a significant effect on the rate of protein degradation. Although insulin (100 mu units/ml) also stimulated rates of protein synthesis when added alone, none of the omega 3 or omega 6 fatty acids, when added with insulin at concentrations of 0. 2 microM, potentiated the effect of the hormone...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Cardioprotective {{effect of}} high density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) is, in part, dependent on its related enzyme, paraoxonase 1 (PON 1). Fatty acid composition of HDL could affect {{its size and}} structure. On the other hand, PON 1 activity {{is directly related to}} the structure of HDL. This study was designed to investigate the association between serum PON 1 activity and fatty acid composition of HDL in healthy men. Methods. One hundred and forty healthy men participated in this research. HDL was separated by sequential ultracentrifugation, and its fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography. PON 1 activity was measured spectrophotometrically using paraxon as substrate. Results. Serum PON 1 activity was directly correlated with the amount of stearic acid and <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> <b>acid</b> (DGLA). PON 1 /HDL-C was directly correlated with the amount of miristic acid, stearic acid, and DGLA and was inversely correlated with total amount of ω 6 fatty acids of HDL. Conclusion. The fatty acid composition of HDL could affect the activity of its associated enzyme, PON 1. As dietary fats are the major determinants of serum lipids and lipoprotein composition, consuming some special dietary fatty acids may improve the activity of PON 1 and thereby have beneficial effects on health...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{has been}} related to a deficiency of delta- 6 -desaturase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Evening primrose oil (EPO) contains high amounts of GLA. Therefore, this study investigated whether EPO supplementation results {{in an increase in}} plasma GLA and its metabolite <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> <b>acid</b> (DGLA) correlating with clinical improvement of AD, assessed by the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. METHODS: The open study included 21 patients with AD. EPO (4 - 6  g) was administered daily for 12  weeks. Before treatment, and 4 and 12  weeks after initiation of EPO supplementation, objective SCORAD was assessed and plasma concentrations of GLA and DGLA were determined by gas chromatography. RESULTS: A significant increase in plasma GLA and DGLA levels and a decrease in the objective SCORAD were observed 4 and 12  weeks after initiation of EPO treatment. In the per-protocol population (n =  14), a significant inverse correlation between the changes in plasma GLA levels and SCORAD was found (P =  0. 008). CONCLUSION: The clinical disease activity under EPO treatment correlates with the individual increase in plasma GLA levels. Thus, the results of this pilot study indicate that an increase in plasma GLA might be used as predictive parameter for responsiveness of AD to EPO therapy...|$|E
40|$|Individuals with {{metabolic}} syndrome (n = 15) were fed two hypocaloric diets, ~ 500 kcal below energy requirements, of individually prepared foods for 21 days. The diets {{consisted of a}} low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) (% carbohydrate:fat:protein = 7 : 74 : 20) and a low-fat diet (LFD) (55 : 28 : 20) reflective of the current US dietary recommendations. The LCD diet resulted in a net weekly intake of 2. 69 g of arachidonic acid (ARA) {{in comparison to the}} 1. 27 g/wk consumed during the LFD. The LCD significantly increased plasma ARA and decreased <b>dihomo-gamma-linolenic</b> <b>acid</b> (DGLA) in all three circulating lipid fractions as well as buccal cells in comparison to the LFD. Correlational analysis of plasma lipids with HOMA 2 scores showed plasma ARA to be positively associated with insulin sensitivity in all three lipoprotein fractions during both diet phases. Total buccal cell ARA did not correlate to measures of insulin sensitivity in either diet phase, but DGLA was negatively correlated to insulin sensitivity during the LCD. The highly significant and consistent increase in circulating ARA after feeding a low-carbohydrate diet could be a result of multiple factors including better preservation of the existing ARA pool, increased dietary intake, greater endogenous synthesis and greate...|$|E
