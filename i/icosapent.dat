Methods: Four healthy subject groups received IPE for 28 days: three received 2 g/day (1 1, 000 mg BID, 2 1, 000 mg QD, or 2 500 mg BID); one received 4 g/day (2 1, 000 mg BID) administered with meals. Blood sampling {{was before the}} morning dose on days 1, 14, 26, 28, and at specified intervals during an 18 ‐day pharmacokinetic period. EPA was measured in plasma (total and unesterified) and red blood cells (RBCs) by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Mean plasma total EPA increased from 19 mg/mL to a peak (Cmax) of 366 mg/mL at 5 hours postdosing 4 g/day IPE on Day 28. Mean RBC EPA Cmax after 4 g/day was 89 mg/mL (baseline, 12 mg/mL). Mean steady state (SD) for half‐ life, clearance, and volume of distribution of total EPA were 79 (47) hours, 757 (283) mL/h, and 82 (56) L, respectively. Steady state for total and unesterified plasma EPA was reached by Day 28, whereas RBC levels were still increasing.

Prescription products containing the long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids (OM 3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are an effective strategy for reducing TG levels. This article {{provides an overview of}} prescription OM 3 FAs, including relevant clinical data in patients with T 2 DM and/or metabolic syndrome. Prescription OM 3 FAs contain either combinations of DHA and EPA (omega- 3 -acid ethyl esters, omega- 3 -carboxylic acids, omega- 3 -acid ethyl esters A) or EPA alone (<b>icosapent</b> ethyl). These products are well tolerated and can be used safely with statins. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that all prescription OM 3 FAs produce statistically significant reductions in TG levels compared with placebo; however, differential effects on LDL-C levels have been reported. Products containing DHA may increase LDL-C levels, whereas the EPA-only product did not increase LDL-C levels compared with placebo. Because increases in LDL-C levels may be unwanted in patients with T 2 DM and/or dyslipidemia, the EPA-only product should not be replaced with products containing DHA. Available data on the effects of OM 3 FAs in patients with diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome support that these products can be used safely in patients with T 2 DM and have beneficial effects on atherogenic parameters; in particular, the EPA-only prescription product significantly reduced TG, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Apo B, remnant lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity CRP levels without increasing LDL-C levels compared with placebo. Ongoing studies of the effects of prescription OM 3 FAs on cardiovascular outcomes will help determine whether these products will emerge as effective add-on options to statin therapy for reduction of residual cardiovascular disease risk.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is incorporated into membrane phospholipids and atherosclerotic plaques and exerts beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic cascade from onset of plaque formation through rupture. Specific salutary actions have been reported relating to endothelial function, oxidative stress, foam cell formation, inflammation, plaque formation/progression, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. EPA also improves atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by reduction of triglycerides without raising low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Other beneficial effects of EPA include vasodilation, resulting in blood pressure reductions, as well as improved membrane fluidity. EPA's effects are at least additive to those of statins when given as adjunctive therapy.

This review discusses the need for alternative adjunct treatment options and the potential place for omega- 3 fatty acids as such. The cardiovascular benefits of fish consumption are attributed to the omega- 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and a variety of omega- 3 fatty acid products are available with varied amounts of EPA and DHA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Icosapent</b> ethyl (IPE; {{formerly}} AMR 101) is a high-purity prescription form of {{eicosapentaenoic acid}} ethyl ester. In the MARINE study we evaluated the efficacy {{and safety of}} IPE in patients with very high triglycerides (TG; >= 500 mg/dL) and previously demonstrated significant reductions in TG levels with no significant increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. OBJECTIVES: In this follow-up, exploratory analysis, we report the effects of IPE on lipoprotein particle concentration and size. METHODS: MARINE was a phase 3, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 12 -week study. Hypertriglyceridemic patients (N = 229) were randomized to three treatment groups: IPE 4 g/day, IPE 2 g/day, or placebo. Lipoprotein particle concentrations and sizes were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, IPE 4 g/day significantly reduced median concentrations of large very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL; - 27. 9 %; P =. 0211), total LDL (- 16. 3 %; P =. 0006), small LDL (- 25. 6 %; P = 500 mg/dL, IPE did not significantly change the overall sizes of LDL or HDL particles. CONCLUSION: IPE 4 g/day significantly reduced large VLDL, total LDL, small LDL, and total HDL particle concentrations and VLDL particle size in patients with TG >= 500 mg/dL. Changes in VLDL particle concentration and size reflect the TG-lowering effects of eicosapentaenoic acid.

ANCHOR was a 12 -week, phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of IPE in patients (N[*]=[*] 702) with residual high fasting TG levels (≥ 200 and < 500 mg/dL) despite having optimized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (≥ 40 and < 100 mg/dL) on statin therapy. Among patients randomized to IPE (4 g/day or 2 g/day) or placebo, 514 (73 %) had diabetes mellitus. A post hoc subgroup analysis of the ANCHOR study was conducted to assess the effects of IPE on median placebo-adjusted percent change from baseline in efficacy end point parameters in 3 subgroups: total (all subjects with diabetes-overall median baseline glycosylated hemoglobin A₁c [A₁c][*]=[*] 6. 8 %), better-controlled diabetes (below median baseline A 1 c), and less-controlled diabetes (above median baseline A 1 c). Baseline efficacy parameters were similar among all groups except high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), which was higher in the total and less-controlled diabetes groups. Compared with placebo, IPE 4 g/day significantly reduced TG, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, VLDL-TG, oxidized LDL, and remnant-like particle cholesterol in all 3 diabetes groups, LDL-C in the total diabetes group, and hsCRP in the total and less-controlled diabetes groups. Decreases in hsCRP and Apo B were much greater in patients with less-controlled diabetes. There were no significant increases in fasting plasma glucose, A 1 c, insulin, or homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance in any group. IPE 4 g/day significantly improved lipid and lipid-related parameters without worsening glycemic control in patients with diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia, with possibly greater effects among those with less-controlled diabetes.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the shared genetic etiology of {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we conducted a genome-wide, multi-ancestry study of genetic variation for both diseases in up to 265, 678 subjects for T 2 D and 260, 365 subjects for CHD. We identify 16 previously unreported loci for T 2 D and 1 locus for CHD, including a new T 2 D association at a missense variant in HLA-DRB 5 (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 29). We show that genetically mediated increase in T 2 D risk also confers higher CHD risk. Joint T 2 D–CHD analysis identified eight variants—two of which are coding—where T 2 D and CHD associations appear to colocalize, including a new joint T 2 D–CHD association at the CCDC 92 locus that also replicated for T 2 D. The variants associated with both outcomes implicate new pathways as well as targets of existing drugs, including <b>icosapent</b> ethyl and adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein. D.
