5|$|Blame for {{the loss}} of Blücher was not placed on <b>Hipper,</b> but on his {{superior}} Admiral von Ingenohl, who was removed from his post on 4 February. Also on the 4th, <b>Hipper</b> met with the Kaiser on an inspection of the fleet in Wilhelmshaven. That same day, <b>Hipper</b> was awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser; on the 23rd he was presented with the Friedrich August Cross, First and Second Classes, by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg. Three days later, <b>Hipper</b> was informed that his hometown had named its main street Hipperstrasse (<b>Hipper</b> Street).|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1911, <b>Hipper</b> took {{command of}} the armored cruiser , along with the {{position}} {{as chief of staff}} for Rear Admiral Gustav von Bachmann, the Deputy Flag Officer, Reconnaissance Forces. In January 1912, Rear Admiral von Bachmann was promoted out of his position; on the 26th <b>Hipper</b> succeeded him as the deputy commander. The following day, he was promoted to Rear Admiral. After serving as the deputy commander for over a year and a half, <b>Hipper</b> again followed Admiral von Bachmann. Admiral von Bachmann was promoted to Chief of the Baltic Station and <b>Hipper</b> took over as the commanding officer of the I Scouting Group on 1 October 1913. Erich Raeder was appointed as Hipper's deputy.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 1918, <b>Hipper</b> was {{promoted}} to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced <b>Hipper</b> as {{the commander of the}} IScouting Group; he raised his flag on Hindenburg the following day.|$|E

5|$|Various naval {{warships}} and shore installations {{were named}} for Hipper: heavy cruiser Admiral <b>Hipper</b> of the Kriegsmarine, the training frigate <b>Hipper</b> of the Bundesmarine and a {{building of the}} German Naval Operations School in Bremerhaven.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his education, <b>Hipper</b> signed up {{as a volunteer}} reserve officer (Einjährig-Freiwilliger), a one-year volunteer position in the German military. After basic officer training in 1879, <b>Hipper</b> decided to join the navy. He went to Kiel, where he took the Pressen, courses designed to prepare officers for the naval entrance examination, which he successfully passed. On 12 April 1881, {{at the age of}} 18, Franz <b>Hipper</b> became an officer of the Imperial German Navy. Among the fellow cadets of the 1881 class was Wilhelm Souchon, who went on to command the Mediterranean Division at the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{defeat in}} World War I, <b>Hipper</b> retired on 13 December 1918 from {{the navy and}} lived a quiet life; he {{received}} a full war pension. During {{the chaos of the}} German Revolution of 1918–1919, <b>Hipper</b> hid from radical revolutionaries by assuming a false name and moving frequently. He wrote a letter to Adolf von Trotha, the new fleet commander, expressing his approval of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919. After the revolution was over, <b>Hipper</b> moved to a house in Altona near Hamburg.|$|E

500|$|At 18:21, {{with both}} Beatty and the Grand Fleet {{converging}} on him, Hood turned south to lead Beatty's battlecruisers. <b>Hipper's</b> battlecruisers were [...] {{away and the}} Invincibles almost immediately opened fire on <b>Hipper's</b> flagship [...] and [...] Indomitable hit Derfflinger three times and [...] once, while the [...] quickly took 10 hits from , Inflexible and Invincible, including two hits below the waterline forward by Invincible that would ultimately doom <b>Hipper's</b> flagship. But at 18:30, Invincible abruptly appeared as a clear target before Lützow and Derfflinger. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at Invincible, and sank her in 90 seconds. A 305mm (12-inch) shell from the third salvo struck the roof of Invincibles midships 'Q' turret, flash detonated the magazines below, and the ship blew up and broke in two, killing all but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood.|$|R
5|$|Less {{than two}} weeks later, on 2 December, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> {{submitted}} his request {{to be placed on}} the inactive list. He retired on 13 December with a full pension; at the age of 55, <b>Hipper</b> spent almost 37 years on active duty in the Imperial Navy. The German fleet in Scapa Flow, meanwhile, was scuttled by its crew on 21 June 1919.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1941, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> {{embarked}} on her second Atlantic sortie. The Kriegsmarine had initially sought {{to send the}} battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to operate in concert with Admiral <b>Hipper,</b> but Gneisenau suffered storm damage in December that prevented {{the participation of the}} two ships. Repairs were effected quickly, however, and the two battleships broke out into the Atlantic in early February. Admiral <b>Hipper</b> rendezvoused with a tanker off the Azores to top up her fuel tanks. On 11 February, the ship encountered and sank an isolated transport from convoy HG 53, which had been dispersed by U-boat and Luftwaffe attacks. That evening, she picked up the unescorted convoy SLS 64, which contained nineteen merchant ships. The following morning, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> closed in and sank several of the ships. The British reported only seven ships were lost, totaling , along with damage to two more. The Germans claimed Admiral <b>Hipper</b> had sunk thirteen of the nineteen freighters, while some survivors reported fourteen ships of the convoy were sunk.|$|E
5|$|Admiral <b>Hipper</b> hove to {{in order}} to rescue her man {{overboard}} and Glowworms survivors. The German sailor was not found, but 40 British sailors were recovered, although at least six later died of their wounds. Lieutenant Ramsay, the senior surviving officer, told his rescuers that neither the helm nor the emergency rudder were manned when the ships collided so the destroyer's turn towards <b>Hipper</b> was probably accidental. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by Glowworm, but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing all of her torpedo tubes empty.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral Hipper-class {{ships were}} powered by {{three sets of}} geared steam {{turbines}}. Admiral <b>Hippers</b> and Blüchers engines were built by Blohm & Voss, while Prinz Eugens turbines were built by Germaniawerft. The turbines installed on Seydlitzs and Lützows engines were manufactured by Deschimag. Steam was provided {{in the first three}} ships by twelve ultra-high-pressure boilers. Seydlitz and Lützow were equipped with nine double-ended high-pressure boilers.

5|$|Admiral Marschall {{organized}} {{a mission to}} seize Harstad in early June 1940; Admiral <b>Hipper,</b> the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and four destroyers were tasked with the operation. The ships departed on 4 June, and while en route, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> encountered and sank the empty troopship Orama on 9 June. Before they reached Harstad, the Germans learned that the Allies had already abandoned the port. Marschall's squadron was then tasked with intercepting an Allied convoy that {{was reported to be}} in the area. The ships failed to find the convoy, and returned to Trondheim to refuel.|$|E
5|$|Admiral <b>Hipper</b> {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral <b>Hipper</b> motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral <b>Hipper</b> {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E

5|$|Enraged by {{the defeat}} at the battle, Adolf Hitler ordered the {{majority}} of the surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged Admiral <b>Hipper</b> while she was in Kiel. Her crew scuttled the ship at her moorings, and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952; her bell resides in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on convoy SLS 64, Admiral Hippers fuel stocks were running low. She {{therefore}} returned to Brest on 15 February. British bombers were regularly attacking the port, however, and the Kriegsmarine therefore decided Admiral <b>Hipper</b> should return to Germany, where she could be better protected. Before the ship could leave, damage caused to the ship's hull by wrecks in the harbor had to be repaired. On 15 March, the ship slipped out of Brest, unobserved, and passed through the Denmark Strait eight days later. While en route, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> stopped to refuel in Bergen. By 28 March, the cruiser was docked in Kiel, having made the entire journey without being detected by the British. Upon arrival, the ship went into the Deutsche Werke shipyard for an extensive overhaul, which lasted for seven months. After completion of the refit, Admiral <b>Hipper</b> conducted sea trials in the Baltic before putting into Gotenhafen on 21 December for some minor refitting. In January 1942, the ship had her steam turbines overhauled at the Blohm & Voss shipyard; a degaussing coil was fitted to the ship's hull during this overhaul. By March, the ship was again fully operational.|$|E

Friedrich Carl was the flagship of Rear Admiral Schmidt, the commander of the Cruiser Division. A second subdivision, composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers was attached to the II Squadron. On 20 September 1906, Franz von <b>Hipper</b> took command of the ship. Under his leadership, the gunners aboard Friedrich Carl won the Kaiser's Prize for best shooting in the fleet in 1907. <b>Hipper</b> remained in the position until March 1908.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Eckoldt was {{allocated}} to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment (138. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) to seize Trondheim together with Admiral <b>Hipper.</b> The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Eckoldts port propeller shaft began to overheat shortly after passing {{the mouth of the}} Elbe River and she had to slow down. The ship managed to repair the problem and joined the main body later in the day. The ship escorted Admiral <b>Hipper</b> as they entered Trondheim Fjord and both ships disembarked their troops once they reached Trondheim harbor. All of the German ships proved to be very low on fuel after their journey and fuel oil was transferred to Eckoldt from Theodor Riedel and Heinemann. Admiral <b>Hipper</b> and Eckoldt attempted to leave on the night of 10 April, but the smaller ship proved to be unable to match Admiral Hippers speed in the heavy seas encountered and was forced to turn back. After some fuel was discovered in Trondheim on 12 April, the ship and Heinemann sailed for Germany two days later.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg was {{the last}} battlecruiser {{completed}} for the Imperial German Navy, and as such had a very short career. She was commissioned 10 May 1917, and was fully operational by 20 October 1917, too late to see any major action in World War I. On 17 November Hindenburg and Moltke, along with the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group, were acting as distant support for German minesweepers off the German coast when they were attacked by British battlecruisers. The raid was brief; by the time Hindenburg and Moltke arrived on the scene, the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn. Six days later, Hindenburg replaced Seydlitz as flagship of the IScouting Group. On 23 April 1918, the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea that attempted to intercept an Allied convoy. Moltke sustained mechanical damage while en route, and as a result, Vice Admiral <b>Hipper</b> decided to cancel the operation. On 11 August, <b>Hipper</b> was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced <b>Hipper</b> as {{the commander of the}} IScouting Group; he raised his flag on Hindenburg the following day.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with almost all German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited. However, she did participate in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz <b>Hipper.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some of Jellicoe's {{supporters}} condemned {{the actions of}} Beatty for the British failure to achieve a complete victory. Although Beatty was undeniably brave, his mismanagement of the initial encounter with <b>Hipper's</b> squadron and the High Seas Fleet cost considerable advantage in the first hours of the battle. His most glaring failure was in not providing Jellicoe with periodic information on the position, course, and speed of the High Seas Fleet. Beatty, aboard the battlecruiser Lion, left behind the four fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron – the most powerful warships {{in the world at}} the time – engaging with six ships when better control would have given him 10 against <b>Hipper's</b> five. Though Beatty's larger [...] guns out-ranged <b>Hipper's</b> [...] guns by thousands of yards, Beatty held his fire for 10 minutes and closed the German squadron until within range of the Germans' superior gunnery, under lighting conditions that favoured the Germans. Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty's force.|$|R
500|$|Admiral <b>Hippers</b> primary {{armament}} {{was eight}} [...] SK L/60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets, placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Her anti-aircraft battery {{was to have}} consisted of twelve [...] L/65 guns, twelve [...] guns, and eight [...] guns. The ship also would have carried a pair of triple [...] torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure. The ship {{was to have been}} equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult. Admiral <b>Hippers</b> armored belt was [...] thick; her upper deck was [...] thick while the main armored deck was [...] thick. The main battery turrets had [...] thick faces and 70mm thick sides.|$|R
