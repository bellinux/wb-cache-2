Fuel flow is initiated just prior to ignition of the detonation tube to understand the interaction between the <b>fluidic</b> <b>valves</b> and the wave. Parametric studies have been conducted with the type of fuel injected, the orifice diameter, and the plenum cavity pressure. Results indicate that the detonation wave pressure temporarily shuts off the fluidic valve supply, but the wave products can be quickly expelled by the fresh fuel supply to allow for refueling.

The primary objective was to develop the technical principles for the realization of silicon microactuators with emphasis both on the investigation of various drive principles for actuators and on the realization of prototypes. Work was focused on hydraulic and pneumatic applications. Of great importance to the production of complex silicon structures, such as valves, are the techniques for the production of a large-surface joint of two silicon substrates. Activities under this project were centered primarily on the investigation and development of processes based on silicon direct bonding. Other investigations related to the application of combinations of different masking layers for anisotropic etching and to the selection of suitable structures for corner compensation.

40|$|A hybrid {{hydraulic}} {{actuation system}} is proposed {{as an active}} pitch link for rotorcraft applications. Such an active pitch link {{can be used to}} implement Individual Blade Control (IBC) techniques for vibration and noise reduction, in addition to providing primary control for the helicopter. Conventional technologies like electric motors and hydraulic actuators have major disadvantages when it come to applications on a rotating environment. Centralized hydraulic system require the use of mechanically complex hydraulic slip rings and electric motors have high precision mechanical moving parts that make them unattractive in application with high centrifugal load. The high energy density of smart materials can be used to design hydraulic actuators in a compact package. MagnetoRheological (MR) fluids can be used as the working fluid in such a hybrid hydraulic actuation system to implement a valving system with no moving parts. Thus, such an actuation system can be theoretically well-suited for application in a rotating environment. To develop an actuation system based on an active material stack and MR <b>fluidic</b> <b>valves,</b> a fundamental understanding of the hydraulic circuit is essential. In order to address this issue, a theoretical model was developed to understand the effect of pumping chamber geometry on the pressure losses in the pumping chamber. Three dimensional analytical models were developed for steady and unsteady flow and the results were correlated to results obtained from Computation Fluid Dynamic simulation of fluid flow inside the pumping chamber. Fundamental understanding regarding the pressure losses in a pumping chamber are obtained from the modeling process. Vortices that form in the pumping chamber (during intake) and the discharge tube (during discharge) are identified as a major cause of pressure loss in the chamber. The role of vortices during dynamic operation is also captured through a frequency domain model. Extensive experimental studies were conducted on a hybrid hydraulic system driven by a pump (actuated by a 2 " long and 1 / 4 " diameter Terfenol-D rod) and a Wheatstone bridge network of MR <b>fluidic</b> <b>valves.</b> The Wheatstone bridge network is used to provide bi-directionality to the load. Through a variety of experimental studies, the main performance metrics of the actuation system, like output power, blocked force, maximum no-load velocity and efficiency, are obtained. The actuation system exhibits a blocked force of 30 N and a maximum no-load velocity of 50 mm/s. Extensive bi-directional tests were also done for cases of no-load, inertial load and spring load to establish the frequency bandwidth of the actuator. The actuation system can output a stroke of 9 mm at an output actuator frequency of 4 Hz. An analytical model was developed to predict the performance of the hybrid hydraulic actuation system. A state space representation of the system was derived using equations derived from the control volume considerations. The results of the analytical model show that the model predicts the frequency peak of the system to within 20 Hz of the actual resonance frequency. In the third part of this dissertation, the effectiveness of the hybrid hydraulic actuation system is evaluated in a rotating environment. A piezoelectric stack that is driven by three PI- 804. 10 stacks was attached {{at the end of a}} spin bar. After balancing the spin bar using a counterweight, the spin bar is spun to an RPM of 300. This simulates a centrifugal loading of 400 g, which is slightly higher than the full-scale centrifugal loads experienced by a pitch link on a UH- 60. The performance of the actuator was measured in terms of velocity of an output cylinder shaft. Since some deterioration of performance was expected at 300 RPM, the output cylinder was redesigned to include roller bearings to support the excess force. Through no load and load tests, the effectiveness of the current hybrid actuation system design was shown as the performance of the system did not deteriorate in performance with greater centrifugal acceleration...|$|E

40|$|Photoresponsive systems {{based on}} self-assembled {{nanostructures}} have received considerable attention recently. There {{is a wide}} range of applications for these fluids such as in drug delivery, coatings, sensors, or microfluidic valves and dampers. Current photoresponsive systems have typically required the use of specialized molecules with various chemical modifications. However, the requirement of complicated chemical synthesis prevents these systems from being used widely for practical applications. In this study, we focus on creating photoresponsive systems using only commercially available photoresponsive molecules and structure-forming components. In our first study, we describe simple reversible photorheological (PR) fluids, i. e., fluids whose rheological properties can be tuned by light. Our PR fluids are created by combining an azobenzene derivative, 4 -azobenzene carboxylic acid (ACA), into micelles of the cationic surfactant erucyl bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) methyl ammonium chloride (EHAC). We show that certain aqueous mixtures of EHAC and ACA, which are low-viscosity solutions at the outset, undergo nearly a million-fold increase in viscosity when irradiated with UV light. The same solutions revert to their initial viscosity when subsequently exposed to visible light. The above changes in viscosity are repeatable, and the sample can be reversibly cycled back and forth between low and high viscosity states. In our second study, we report a class of photoresponsive vesicles composed of inexpensive and commercially available cationic and anionic surfactants. The mixture of these amphiphiles forms vesicles due to ionic interactions between the cationic and anionic headgroups. When irradiated by UV light, the cationic surfactant loses its charge and, in turn, the vesicles are converted into micelles due to the loss of ionic interactions. In addition, a mixture of these photoresponsive vesicles and a hydrophobically modified biopolymer gives a photoresponsive vesicle-gel that can undergo a gel-to-sol transition with UV light. In our final study, we demonstrate practical applications of PR fluids as a light-activated <b>fluidic</b> <b>valve</b> in microchannels. Current PR fluid formulations are not suitable for this application. Here, we report a PR fluid composed of alginate, a photoacid generator (PAG) as a photo-trigger, and a chelated complex of divalent strontium (Sr 2 +) (Sr-EGTA). Upon exposure to UV, free Sr 2 + ions are released, which self-assemble with the alginate chains to give a nanostructured gel with a high gel modulus (~ 2000 Pa). We flow our PR fluid in a microchannel and expose a specific point to UV light. At this point, alginate is converted into a gel, which blocks the flow. When the UV light is removed, the gel is gradually dissolved by the flow and the channel reopens. The above concept relies entirely on physical (non-covalent) bonds, i. e., on self-assembly, rather than on covalent crosslinking of dissolved monomers or polymers...|$|R

Digital Clay is a novel haptics device the purpose which is to form a continuously variable surface {{that can be used}} to display shape data or accept shape input. It will be composed of a large number of small fluidic actuators and an array of MEMS micro-valves. Teams are investigating the kinematic architecture, the human interface, the control, the <b>fluidics,</b> and the <b>valve</b> design for this device. This paper describes the development of a computer model to simulate the device as well as human interaction with it via a simulated fmgertip. The model is developed for a conceptual architecture design that could be used in a future prototype wherein the surface is defined by a close-packed array of slender fluidic actuators, however other architectures are also discussed. A key element of controlling this device will be interpreting user input. Therefore the simulations presented attempt to validate algorithms for tracking the user's finger and producing variable height bosses and creases in the surface...|$|R
40|$|Miniaturized {{fuel cell}} systems have the {{potential}} to outperform batteries in powering a variety of portable electronics. The key to this technology is the ability to efficiently process an easily-stored, energy-dense fuel. In many cases, use of these fuels requires a fuel processor-a high temperature chemical reactor that generates a hydrogen-rich stream for use by the fuel cell. In high-temperature microfluidic systems, where heat transfer rates are often very high, thermal management is a major challenge. This thesis investigates the use of silicon microfabrication technology to fabricate high-temperature submillimeter-scale fuel processors designed to maximize thermal efficiency. A prototype MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) chemical reactor/heat exchanger for fuel processing has been designed and fabricated. The fuel processor, measuring 8 x 10 x 1. 5 mm, consists of thin-walled silicon nitride tubes and a suspended silicon reaction zone. This structure couples the energy between catalytic combustion and decomposition or steam reforming reactions to produce hydrogen. The design enables a high level of thermal isolation of the reaction zone while allowing heat exchange between process streams. Thermal management in the fuel processors has been characterized up to 825 ⁰C through experimental testing using integrated resistive heaters and temperature sensors and through finite element modeling. Catalyst localization, for controlled catalytic combustion of premixed fuels in the reaction zone, has been achieved using passive <b>fluidic</b> stop <b>valves.</b> Ammonia decomposition (cracking) and combustion of various fuels over washcoated supported-metal catalysts have been investigated. (cont.) Using the energy provided by the integrated heater to drive the reaction, up to 1. 6 WLHV (based on the lower heating value) of hydrogen has been produced by catalytic ammonia decomposition at temperatures exceeding 800 ⁰C. Hydrogen burns stably in stoichiometric mixtures with air to > 99 % conversion for flow rates of hydrogen between 2 and 12 ml-min- 1 and steady-state reactor temperatures between 400 and 930 ⁰C. At higher hydrogen flow rates and reactor temperatures, homogeneous combustion has been observed. Self-sustained (autothermal) combustion of butane at atmospheric pressure and ammonia under reduced ambient pressure (down to 4 Pa) have also been demonstrated. Hydrogen has been produced via ammonia decomposition using energy from hydrogen, butane, and ammonia combustion to drive the reaction. by Leonel R. Arana. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Microfluidic-based {{cell culture}} systems {{are getting more}} and more {{important}} in biotechnology especially for the recently developed “organ-on-a-chip“ [1] systems with several human tissues in one branched microvascular system [2]. Due to the high complexity of those systems flow and nutrient adjustment is essential. Hereby presented is an approach which uses a mathematical model of the microfluidic system to calculate how <b>fluidic</b> actuators like <b>valves</b> and pumps have to be set to ensure specific nutrient and growth factor gradients. The oxygen content in a branched multilayer cell culture device [3] with integrated micro pumps, valves and tissue chambers was measured in two parallel fluidic paths. By operating the oxygenator with different process gases (nitrogen, air) the amount of dissolved oxygen can be varied. Furthermore the perfusion of each cell culture chamber was regulated with the help of closing valves positioned in each fluidic branch. Due to permeation processes the oxygen content in the fluidic system could be slightly reduced within several minutes by applying nitrogen to the included membrane oxygenator. The flow directing valves are sequentially actuated so that repeatedly n pump cycles are pumped in chamber A and k cycles are flowing in chamber B. By varying the n/k ratio one can influence the deoxygenation curve or keep the cell culture at a certain oxygen level. The last operating mode can be used for repeated hypoxia assays which are currently performed in animals [4]. By dying the cells for example with CYTO-® ID one can observe the oxidative stress for the cultivated cells under different hypoxic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{microfluidic}} devices transport fluids by {{a variety}} of physical means. Among them, pump-based and capillary-based fluid delivery systems are commonly adapted to move fluids. The pump-based systems intrinsically require sub systems consisting of mechanical and/or electrical instruments, which poses tremendous difficulties to system-level miniaturization. Herein, the investigations of two capillary-based microfluidic platforms are described. The first platform encapsulates biological reagents by capillary force in carefully designed microchannels, and detects biomolecules by moving magnetic beads in it. The second platform provides functional microfluidic devices made of paper—a fabric and abundant material that autonomously wicks fluids. Chapter 1 describes the development of the polymer-based platform, whereas Chapter 2 and 3 present the paper-based platform. ^ Specifically, Chapter 1 reports a the polymer-based microfluidic device for immuno-diagnostics. Rather than handling fluid reagents against a stationary solid phase, the platform manipulates analyte-coated magnetic beads through stationary plugs of fluid reagents to detect an antigenic analyte. These isolated but accessible plugs are pre-encapsulated in a microchannel by capillary force. We call this platform microfluidic inverse phase enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (μIPELISA). μIPELISA has distinctive advantages in the family of microfluidic immunoassay. In particular, it avoids pumping and valving fluid reagents during assaying, thus leading to a lab-on-a-chip format that is free of instrumentation for fluid actuation and control. We use μIPELISA to detect digoxigenin-labeled DNA segments amplified from E. Coli O 157 :H 7 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and compare its detection capability with that of microplate ELISA. For 0. 259 ng per 2 ̆ 6 mgr;L− 1 of digoxigenin-labeled amplicon, μIPELISA is as responsive as the microplate ELISA. Also, we simultaneously conduct μIPELISA in two parallel microchannels. ^ Chapter 2 reports a <b>fluidic</b> diode, <b>valves</b> and a circuit fabricated entirely on a single layer of paper to control wicking of fluids. Our fluidic diode is a two-terminal component that promotes or stops wicking along a paper channel. We further constructed a trigger valve and a delay valve based on the fluidic diode. Furthermore, we demonstrate a high-level functional circuit, consisted of a diode and a delay valve, to manipulate two fluids in a sequential manner. Our study provides new, transformative tools to manipulate fluid for microfluidic paper-based devices. ^ Chapter 3 reports the 3 D counterparts of the fluidic components described in the previous chapter. By using printing, stacking and taping, we create channels defined by wax contours in multilayer of paper to further reduce the footprints of microfluidic paper-based devices. This fabrication method is simple with a high yield: the channels are ready for assembling in minutes, and the typical turn-round time from a design to an end assembly is less than an hour. We believe these features are attractive for rapid prototyping of microfluidic paper-based devices. ...|$|R
