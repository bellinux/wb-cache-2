40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} and clinical studies proved efficiency of treatment with lipoic acid-containing drugs in diseases, in which pro- and antioxidant balance is disrupted (diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrom</b> (AIDS), tumors, etc.). Efficiency of lipoate has {{been attributed to}} unique antioxidant properties of lipoate/dihydrolipoate system, its reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability and significant effect on the tissue concentrations of reduced forms of other antioxidants, including one of the most powerful, glutathione (thus lipoate is called an antioxidant of antioxidants). Moreover, analysis of literature data suggests participation of lipoic acid in processes of cell growth and differentiation. This fact can be crucial to clinical practice, however, this problem requires further studies. Key words: lipoic acid, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, signal transductio...|$|E
40|$|During {{the years}} from 1979 until 1983, 40 cases of CDC-defined AIDS were seen in Belgium. Only two {{patients}} were Belgian male homosexuals. The other patients were Central Africans who lived in Belgium or who had travelled to Belgium for medical care. There {{was no evidence of}} an underlying immunosuppressive disease, and no history of homosexuality or intravenous drug abuse. The male:female ratio was 1. 5. All patients had opportunistic infections. Five of them also had Kaposi's sarcoma. All patients tested had immunologic features of severe T-cell depression. The overall mortality was 42. 5 percent. It is likely that AIDS is endemic now in Central Africa, and that the cases seen in Belgium represent only the tip of the iceberg.

A modelofattributed responsibility is proposedthat classifies socialjudgments ofanother person's behaviorthat take into accountthe {{extent to which the}} behavior caused the situation, the personknew or shouldhave known the potential consequences ofthe behavior, the personintendedto engage in the behavior, and factors over which the personhad little or no control might have influenced the behavior. Research has shown that attributions of responsibility lead to increased anger, decreased empathy, and a diminished willingness to offer help to others in need.

40|$|Abstract. We study a {{mathematical}} model for the viral dynamics of HIV in an infected individual {{in the presence of}} HAART. The paper starts with a literature review and then formulates the basic mathematical model. An expression for R 0, the basic reproduction number of the virus under steady state application of HAART, is derived followed by an equilibrium and stability analysis. There is always a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is globally asymptotically stable for R 0 1 then some simulations will die out whereas others will not. Stochastic simulations suggest that if R 0 > 1 those which do not die out approach a stochastic quasi-equilibrium consisting of random fluctuations about the non-trivial deterministic equilibrium levels, but the amplitude of these fluctuations is so small that practically the system is at the non-trivial equilibrium. A brief discussion concludes the paper. 1. Introduction. AIDS, or Acquired Immune <b>Deficiency</b> <b>Syndrom...</b>|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 147 - 161. A semi-structured {{interview}} {{was used to}} obtain illness narrative data from 10 Chronic Fatigue and Immune <b>Deficiency</b> <b>Syndrom</b> (CFIDS) patients. A qualitative narrative analysis was completed and the findings were discussed {{in relation to the}} patients' subjective understanding of the illness process. This was related to current CFIDS research findings, and more especially to the four theoretical paradigms that underpin this research - namely, Medical Illness Model, Lifeworld Illness Model, Mindbody Medicine, and Psychodynamic Theory. Each one of these illness theories highlighted an aspect of the healing influence on CFIDS patients' illness course and meaning. The analysis confirms the importance of all these healing influences. Thus it was concluded that the medical treatment, arising from the Cartesian dualistic understanding of mind and body, proved inadequate on its own as an effective intervention to bring release from CFIDS symptoms and enable the patients to engage a new meaningful life-process. The four paradigms together represent the mindbody reality and indicate the importance of patients receiving interventions at all levels of their lived experience. This intervention approach was shown to be most effective. It is therefore suggested that the Health System work towards such collaborative, integrated health care for chronically ill sufferers...|$|E
40|$|Background: Accute Immune <b>Deficiency</b> <b>Syndrom</b> (AIDS) is {{a serious}} and lethal disease {{in many parts of}} the world, {{rendering}} a patient sensitive to all opportunistic pathogens that can cause death as the disease progresses. Many patients suffer from intestinal opportunistic infections by parasites. Objectives: The aim of present study was to examine parasitic intestinal infections in AIDS patients in Razi Hospital, Ahvaz. Patients and Methods: We collected 100 stool samples from 60 HIV (+) patients who were referred to Razi Hospital, Ahvaz. The samples were examined by direct and MIF (merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde) method. All samples were stained with Ziehl-Neelsen (acid fast staining) and trichrome. General data, such as clinical signs, duration of disease, route of infection, and habitat of patient, were obtained by questionnaire. Results: Thirty percent of HIV (+) patients were infected with intestinal protozoan parasites. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of parasite infections between sex or age. The prevalence of parasitic infections was as follows: Blastocystis hominis, 16. 7 %; Cryptosporidium parvum, 8. 3 %; Endolimax nana, 5 %; Entamoeba coli, 5 %; Giardia intestinalis, 3. 3 %; E. histolytica cyst, 1. 7 %, and Dientamoeba fragilis, 1. 7 %. Conclusions: This study shows that the prevalence of parasitic infections is not high in HIV (+) patient in Ahvaz compared with other studies, but it is recommended that fecal examination be performed every 3 months to detect serious parasitic infections and that parasitic infections should be treated after laboratory diagnosis and in the presence of the gastrointestinal symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Common {{variable}} immunodeficiency (CVID) is an antibody deficiency with {{an equal}} sex distribution and a high variability in clinical presentation. The main features include respiratory tract infections and their associated complications, enteropathy, autoimmunity, and lymphoproliferative disorders. This study analyzes the clinical presentation, association between clinical features, and differences and effects of immunoglobulin treatment in Europe. Data on 2212 patients with CVID from 28 medical centers contributing to the European Society for Immunodeficiencies Database were analyzed retrospectively. Early disease onset (< 10 years) was very frequent in our cohort (33. 7 %), especially in male subjects (39. 8 %). Male subjects with early-onset CVID were more prone to pneumonia and less prone to other complications suggesting a distinct disease entity. The diagnostic delay of CVID ranges between 4 and 5 years in many countries and is particularly high in subjects with early-onset CVID. Enteropathy, autoimmunity, granulomas, and splenomegaly formed a set of interrelated features, whereas bronchiectasis {{was not associated with}} any other clinical feature. Patient survival in this cohort was associated with age at onset and age at diagnosis only. There were different treatment strategies in Europe, with considerable differences in immunoglobulin dosing, ranging from 130 up to 750 mg/kg/mo. Patients with very low trough levels of less than 4 g/L had poor clinical outcomes, whereas higher trough levels were associated with a reduced frequency of serious bacterial infections. Patients with CVID are being managed differently throughout Europe, affecting various outcome measures. Clinically, CVID is a truly variable antibody <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrom...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Androgen {{administration}} for hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausalwomen {{has recently been}} involved in many panels and investigations. The objective forthe introduction of androgen replacement in postmenopausal women was the opinionthat impaired libido and well-being in women with normal estrogen concentration (withHRT or in reproductive period) is the consequence of androgen deficiency. Physiology of female androgen production in women emphasizes the production ofdehydroepiandrosteron (DHEA) as crucial precursor of human sex steroid biosynthesistogether with its sulphate ester (DHEAS). DHEA and DHEAS do not have androgen activityunless they are converted to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, which can both bind and activate androgen receptor. The ability of ovarian theca cells to synthesize androgenspersists also after menopause, the fact being illustrated by finding that bilateral oophorectomy in postmenopausal women leads to {{a significant decrease in}} circulating levels ofandrogen. The definition of female androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrom</b> (FADS) was presentedas Princeton’s consensus meeting three criteria: impaired libido and well-being with normal estrogen values (established estrogen replacement) and serum androgen concentrations below or within the lower quartile of the female normal range. The criticism of Princeton’s consensus is focused mainly on loose definition of impaired libido. The similar critical estimation followed new diagnostic term »hypoactive sexual desire disorder« (HSDD). The task force of endocrine societies from Canada, USA and Australia has provided recentguidelines for therapeutic use of androgens in women. They recommended againstmaking a diagnosis of androgen deficiency in women because this clinical syndrome hasnot been defined properly. In spite of some data of clinical effectiveness of androgen replacement in selected population of women, there are no adequate indications andevidence of safety in long term administration. They recommend well designed and focused studies of androgen action in the population of women after surgical castration, inwomen with hypopituitarrism and adrenal insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS Scientific studies and clinical experiences have not provided until now the answers to thequestion: »Whom to treat, when, why and for how long should androgens be used for HRTin postmenopausal women?...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} Changjishu soft elastic capsule, a new Chinese herbal medicine for smoothing liver, invigorating spleen and regulating qi activity, on diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS) patients with liver-qi stagnation and spleen deficiency syndrome. Methods: A randomized, double-blinded, and positive control method was adopted. One hundred and four cases of D-IBS conforming to the inclusive criteria were randomly divided into treatment group (78 cases) and control group (26 cases). Patients in the treatment group were treated with Changjishu soft elastic capsule, four capsules once daily and three times a day. Patients {{in the control group}} were treated with glutamine compound enteric capsule, three capsules once daily and three times a day. After 21 -day treatment, the efficacy of Changjishu soft elastic capsule was evaluated by the changes of single symptom such as abdominal pain or discomfort, defecation frequency, and stool characteristics. The safety of Changjishu elastic capsule was assessed by laboratory data and adverse events. Results: Abdominal pain or discomfort scores at days 7, 14, 21 and the declined score at day 21 in the treatment group significantly decreased as compared with the control group (P< 0. 05). Defecation frequency score at day 14 and the declined score at day 21 in the treatment group significantly decreased as compared with the control group (P< 0. 05). Stool characteristics score and the declined score at day 21 in the treatment group significantly decreased as compared with those of the control group (P< 0. 05). Rugitus scores and the declined scores at days 14 and 21 significantly decreased as compared with the control group (P< 0. 05). The total response rates in the treatment and control groups were 71. 62 % and 40. 91 %, and the recovery rates were 20. 27 % and 13. 64 %, respectively. There existed {{significant differences between the two}} groups in therapeutic effect (P< 0. 01). The therapeutic effect of Changjishu elastic capsule was better than that of glutamine compound enteric capsule. Side effects and adverse events were not found in the two groups. Conclusion: Changjishu soft elastic capsule is effective and safe for treatment of D-IBS patients with liver-qi stagnation and spleen <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrom...</b>|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{particularly}} {{in areas with}} no treatment availability or antenatal programs, approximately 1600 children are diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) every day,(5) and over 300, 000 deaths from acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrom</b> (AIDS) among children occur annually worldwide. (6) The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) estimated a total of 142 children less than 13 years old were infected with HIV perinatally in 2005,(7) while the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 2 million children (0 - 14 years) globally living with HIV (1. 8 million living in Sub-Saharan Africa alone). (8) Epidemiologists and biostatisticians are actively trying to estimate the causal effects of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) in order to establish which treatments are best and when to they should be initiated. This proves to be a challenging task for several reasons including the unique dynamics of pediatric HIV populations and the lack of randomized evidence. However, with an abundance of observational data, analytical approaches designed to help researchers establish causal effects from observational studies have been developed [...] referred to within the present studies as causal inference techniques. In this dissertation, I performed a systematic review of studies that used so-called causal inference methods (i. e. propensity scores, instrumental variables, marginal structural models, and structural equation models) in the context of HIV/AIDS research and assessed the interpretability and content of the identified studies. I use empirical examples from a marginal structural model (MSM) analysis and instrumental variable (IV) analysis using Pediatric Spectrum of Disease (PSD) surveillance program data. Specifically, I estimate the causal effect of triple therapy (e. g. HAART) on time to C diagnosis, and time to C diagnosis/death among HIV-infected children and perform an adapted instrumental variable analysis in order to estimate the causal effect of HAART on the hazard of AIDS events or death. The systematic review revealed that approximately 43 % of all studies using causal inference methods on HIV/AIDS data were published in 2007 and 2008. Studies using MSMs were less likely to discuss specific model selection than studies using any other causal inference method (OR= 0. 26; 95 % CI 0. 08 - 0. 72). Using a g-comp approach, where I define &# 936; 1 (p 0) (tk) &# 8801;P(Ta > tk) as all treated and &# 936; 0 (p 0) (tk) &# 8801;P(Ta > tk) as all untreated, the causal effect of HAART suggested that among children who initiated therapy within 6 months of birth the effect in delaying a C diagnosis, &# 936;HZ(p 0) (tk) = - 0. 466 (95 % CI - 1. 20 - 0. 565), is seemingly stronger than children who initiated therapy within 12 months of birth (&# 936;HZ(p 0) (tk) = - 0. 321 (95 % CI - 1. 151 - 0. 300)). Additionally, though not statistically significant, the effect of triple therapy initiated within the first 12 months of life on time to C diagnosis is potentially greater among symptomatic children (12 Months: &# 936;HZsymptomatic (p 0) (t 36) : - 0. 587 (95 % CI - 1. 217 - 0. 480)) than among asymptomatic children (12 Months: &# 936;HZasymptomatic (p 0) (t 36) : - 0. 106 (95 % CI - 1. 054 - 0. 739)). The instrumental variable analysis yielded the naïve rate ratio comparing an early-defined IV (1997 cut-off) non-HAART era with the HAART era [...] estimated at RRITT= 2. 17 (95 % CI: 1. 34 - 3. 52). As a result of HAART use misclassification by calendar era, an instrumental variable estimator was used, yielding a RRIV = 3. 91 (95 % CI 2. 41, 6. 34), 80 % higher than the naïve result. Regardless of year of publication, all HIV studies are deficient by varying degrees in all assessed areas. Researchers using causal inference methods should describe their methods in a more transparent and interpretable way so that the results may reach a wider audience. Together Chapter 3 and 4 use causal inference methods to not only help establish the effectiveness of HAART on preventing advanced disease and/or mortality, but they also attempt to address the need to establish optimal timing of treatment for treatment guidelines. The overarching benefits of these methods are that they define a parameter of interest not dependent on a particular model assumption (semi-parametric), and they define explicit identifiability assumptions under which these estimators produce estimates of so-called causal association, which are related to distributions of counterfactuals...|$|E
