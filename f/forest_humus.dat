The {{study of this}} natural process has largely involved laboratory investigations, focused primarily on the biodegradation and recycling of agricultural by-products, generally using basidiomycetes species. In order to collect super white rot fungi and evaluate its ability to degrade lingo-cellulosic material, 35 fungal strains, collected from <b>forests,</b> <b>humus</b> soil, livestock manure, and dead trees, were screened for enzyme activities and their potential to decolorize the commercially used Poly-R 478 dye. In the laccase enzy-matic analysis chemical test, 33 white rot fungi and 2 brown rot fungi were identified. The degradation ability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) according to the utilized environmental conditions was higher in the mushrooms grown in dead trees and fallen leaves than in the mushrooms grown in humus soil and livestock manure. Using Poly-R 478 dye to assess the PAH-degradation activity of the identified strains, four strains, including Agrocybe pediades, were selected. The activities of laccase, MnP, and Lip of the four strains with PAH-degrading ability were highest in Pleurotus incarnates. 87 fungal strains, collected from <b>forests,</b> <b>humus</b> soil, livestock manure, and dead trees, were screened for enzyme activities and their potential to decolorize the commercially used Poly-R 478 dye on solid media.

The study was carried out at four sites of different age-classes in the Tharandter forest, Germany. The composition of the deeper humus layers (OH, A) was stable. Herbaceous litter, recent spruce litter, fragmented spruce litter, decomposed litter and faeces and fungi, which contributed to the organic layer (OL and OH horizon), significantly changed during the forestry cycle, especially with the shift from the early stage to intermediate stages.
