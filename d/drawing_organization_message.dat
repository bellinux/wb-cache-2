50|$|The {{utilization}} {{of a natural}} metaphor, the concept of rooms devoted to topics, marked Citadel's main advancement over previous BBS packages {{in the area of}} <b>organization.</b> <b>Messages</b> are associated with rooms, to which the user moves in order to participate in discussions; similarly, a room could optionally give access to the underlying file system, permitting the organization of available files in an organic manner. Most installations permitted any user to create a room, resulting in a dynamic ebb and flow closer to true conversation than most other BBS packages achieved. Certain versions of Citadel extend the metaphor of rooms with “hallways” and/or “floors,” organizing groups of rooms according to system requirement. By contrast, previous bulletin board software emphasized the availability of files, with a single uncoupled message area that could only be read linearly, forward or backward.|$|R

However, SIMUL8 implements a two-way interface with Visual Basic, which leaves space for creation of advanced model features, which cannot be modeled using only the graphical interface. SIMUL8 also provides its own simulation language based on Visual Basic called Visual Logic, which allows the user to implement detailed logic of the simulation. The design of SIMUL8 also facilitates communication with other software packages such as Microsoft Access, Excel and Visio. The support of XML and OLE automation allows working with external sources of data and exporting internal data to other systems. SIMUL8 also supports communication with databases using SQL.|$|R

40|$|The {{transformation}} of actual societies <b>draws</b> <b>organizations</b> characterised {{more than ever}} by diverse workforces. Under this new circumstance, strategic human resource management models must be reconsidered, to break the classic assumption that employees constitute a generic and homogeneous category. In this sense, this paper defines diversity as a multidimensional construct, and analyse its effects on organizations, through the introduction of group dynamics as a variable that mediates the relationship between diversity and performance. Drawing on this explanation, this paper explores {{the role played by}} strategic human resource management in this process, applying the classical configurational model that distinguishes between control and commitment human resource patterns. From this analysis, we conclude that the strategic human resource system moderates the diversity-performance relationship. Therefore, positive or negative effect of diversity will depend on how human resource strategy, policies and practices are developed...|$|R

In addition, some religious <b>organizations</b> use <b>messages</b> based on religious teachings to promote water conservation. Because approximately 70 % of the U.

I report the results of an experiment that examines how scientifically- and religiously-framed messages influence attitudes about water use restrictions. I found that Christians were no more or less likely to agree with a policy calling for water use restrictions than non-Christians and non-religious people. However, a Christian religious message negatively influenced agreement with water use restrictions in the entire sample—and in a Christian subsample. Results suggest that religiously framed messages may not increase environmental concern...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{case study}} approach, I show how {{transnational}} civil society networks both help and hinder community-based HIV/AIDS organizations by providing opportunities for community-state partnerships that favor some local organizations over others, and (re) produce intra-organizational stratification at the local level. In the case of Mexico City, transnational ties encourage community-based AIDS organizations to develop formal organizational forms and strategies (negotiating fronts) which often enhance organizational sustainability and <b>draw</b> <b>organizations</b> into a closer relationship with the state institutionalized sphere. However, such ties also create divisions (political fronts) between outsider and insider organizations that compromise local inter-organizational collaboration and service delivery. As a result, transnational networks and resources solidify outsider-insider conflicts and balkanize service provision along political lines. The conclusions of this research are helpful to international health practitioners and social scientists seeking to understand how transnational networks and resources shape global civil society, and can both challenge and reproduce existing community-state power regimes and health inequities at local and transnational levels...|$|R

30|$|The {{questionnaire}} therefore {{asked whether}} the relationship between organizations {{and other members of}} the network rests on a history of good relations. Near 65  % of the respondents agree or agree completely with the statements. Very few respondents (10  %), the majority of them work at private organizations, think that this relationship is not built on a harmonious history. Respondents from the private sector (19  %) claim that relations with organizations in their network do not rest on good relations. But there might be a link between the cases where this relationship is not based on a history of good relations and the level of proximity between organizations. The World Economic Forum (2013, p. 20) has pointed out that public sectors in North America and Europe were striving for preferential treatment during crisis and placed priorities on retaining partnerships, whereas within private sectors worldwide prevention of loss of market share and competitiveness <b>draw</b> <b>organizations</b> to search for diversity of supply chains and distrust in governmental actions because of potential negative side effects of government regulation on market profitability.|$|R
