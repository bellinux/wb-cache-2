500|$|The {{campaign}} for which <b>Gage</b> <b>went</b> to Albany {{culminated in the}} disastrous Battle of Carillon, in which 16,000 British forces were defeated by barely 4,000 French forces. [...] Gage, whose regiment was in the British vanguard, was again wounded in that battle, in which the British suffered more than 2,000 casualties. [...] Gage, who had been brevetted a brigadier general for the 1758 campaign, received in 1759 a full promotion to the position, largely through the political manoeuvring of his brother, Lord Gage.|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} of the 18th, Dr. Warren sent off two {{messengers}} by different routes to give the alarm that the king's troops were actually sallying forth. The messengers got out of Boston just before the order of General <b>Gage</b> <b>went</b> into effect, to prevent any one from leaving the town. About the same time a lantern was hung out of an upper window of the north church, in the direction of Charlestown. This was a preconcerted signal to the patriots of that place, who instantly despatched swift messengers to rouse the country.|$|R
40|$|During normal {{assembly}} and disassembly of bolted-joint components, thread damage and/or deformation may occur. If threads are overloaded, thread damage/deformation {{can also be}} anticipated. Typical inspection techniques (e. g. using GO-NO <b>GO</b> <b>gages)</b> may not provide adequate visibility {{of the extent of}} thread damage. More detailed inspection techniques have provided actual pitch-diameter profiles of damaged-hardware holes. A method to predict the reduction in thread shear-out capacity of damaged threaded holes has been developed. This method was based on testing and analytical modeling. Test samples were machined to simulate damaged holes in the hardware of interest. Test samples containing pristine parent-holes were also manufactured from the same bar-stock material to provide baseline results for comparison purposes. After the particular parent-hole thread profile was machined into each sample a helical insert was installed into the threaded hole. These samples were tested in a specially designed fixture to determine the maximum load required to shear out the parent threads. It was determined from the pristine-hole samples that, for the specific material tested, each individual thread could resist an average load of 3980 pounds. The shear-out loads of the holes having modified pitch diameters were compared to the ultimate loads of the specimens with pristine holes. An equivalent number of missing helical coil threads was then determined based on the ratio of shear-out loads for each thread configuration. These data were compared with the results from a finite element model (FEM). The model gave insights into the ability of the thread loads to redistribute for both pristine and simulated damage configurations. In this case, it was determined that the overall potential reduction in thread load-carrying capability in the hardware of interest was equal to having up to three fewer threads in the hole that bolt threads could engage. One- half of this potential reduction was due to local pitch-diameter variations and the other half was due to overall pitch-diameter enlargement beyond Class 2 fit. This result was important in that the thread shear capacity for this particular hardware design was the limiting structural capability. The details of the method development, including the supporting testing, data reduction and analytical model results comparison will be discussed hereafter...|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{willingness}} to train the new paramedics, Brackett is firmly against the program itself, preferring highly skilled medical help in the field rather than [...] "hose jockeys" [...] running {{the risk of losing}} a life due to inexperience or ineptitude. His attitude toward the program does not <b>go</b> unnoticed by <b>Gage,</b> who passes the paramedic course and is reassigned and partnered with DeSoto at the new Station 51. With the paramedic program not yet authorized, any emergency involving injury requires Gage and DeSoto to stop at Rampart en route and pick up a nurse, namely McCall, to administer authorized medical help.|$|R
5000|$|Nina Diadamia Gage {{was born}} in Brooklyn on 9 June 1883 {{and grew up in}} New York. In 1905 she {{graduated}} from Wellesley College where {{she was a member of}} the missionary committee. She then went to the Roosevelt Hospital School of Nursing in New York, became a fully qualified registered nurse in 1908, and gained some experience as a night supervisor there. Her older brother Brownell (later Rev. Brownell Gage) and his wife Helen Howe Gage (who later qualified as a doctor) had been at the Yale-in-China mission in Changsha, Hunan since about 1904. Nina <b>Gage</b> <b>went</b> there in 1909 and began work as a dispensary nurse.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Future of Hardcore" [...] {{would cross}} paths with Thumbtack Jack once more {{before the end}} of the year, as they faced one another for Jack's Ultraviolent Underground Championship, in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Match at Cage of Death XI. Jack would come out the victor in the contest, only to be {{attacked}} by a returning, J.C. Bailey. In May 2010, <b>Gage</b> <b>went</b> to Japan and wrestled for Big Japan Pro Wrestling after an interval of nearly 10 years. Gage, as a member of the stable CZW Japan originally created around 2000, competed at the event BJW 15th Anniversary Show, teaming with Jun Kasai and DJ Hyde.Nick Gage won the CZW Underground title from Adam Polak in Germany.|$|R
5000|$|The {{making of}} the album was a {{difficult}} experience for Gage. He had been hired by Mike Stone, an American promoter, who was then acting as Armatrading's manager. Stone described Armatrading as being [...] "very difficult" [...] following the departure of Pam Nestor, but nevertheless having [...] "immense talent". Gage himself was struck by Armatrading's musical ability, describing her as [...] "having {{a huge amount of}} natural talent". Armatrading found it difficult to make the album, partly because of her reluctance to perform and partly because she was unhappy during this time, later saying that she had [...] "been going through a bad period". <b>Gage</b> <b>went</b> {{out of his way to}} recruit musicians for the album who would be [...] "sympathetic" [...] and [...] "patient".|$|R
5000|$|During 2004, {{the band}} {{returned}} to the recording studio to record two tracks for the next album, {{with the intention of}} producing a video for one of them to coincide with a major tour in October and November 2004. The two tracks were [...] "Backstabber" [...] and [...] "One More Go". A video was commissioned through Goblin Pictures for [...] "One More Go" [...] and was sent out to several television stations in the hope of getting it played on air. Spunge also decided to put on an all-day gig at Cheltenham Town Hall. Hosted by Dent'All Records and Spunge, this became Extraction Fest 2004. The show was a success, but the video did not get aired, but their planned autumnal tour with Whitmore and Phinius <b>Gage</b> <b>went</b> ahead.|$|R
500|$|As {{the captain}} and {{instigator}} of the 1888–89 Nativesthe first New Zealand team to tour the British IslesWarbrick had a lasting impact {{on the development of}} rugby in his homeland. When the Natives returned from tour they introduced a style of rugby as good as any ever seen in the country. According to Ryan, [...] "their brand of sensational running style and combined forward play had never been seen in New Zealand." [...] The speculative nature of the tour, which was outside the control of an official authority, concerned many of the provincial unions and gave further momentum to efforts to form a national body. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was founded which would, among other things, organise any representative tours. Many of the Natives went on to contribute to rugby as representative players, administrators, or referees. Two players, Ellison and <b>Gage,</b> <b>went</b> on to captain New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Nick {{has broken}} into Gadger's apartment, where {{he finds out}} that Gadger is the same man as Gage's stalker and Casey's killer. He {{immediately}} sets out to the abandoned house, where Gage {{at the moment is}} being scared by Gadger's behavior. As Nick enters the house, Gadger feels betrayed by Gage and shoots Nick. He then orders Gage {{to take care of his}} bloody clothes, and check into a motel. Back in present time, the detectives work with Gage to locate Badger. They retrieve his location, where she finds out that Nick, Casey and Gadger worked together as con artists who planned everything. The detectives and Gage decide to take revenge by conning them themselves. <b>Gage</b> <b>goes</b> over to Gadger's place, claiming that she received photographs of Nick's murder. As she learns through listening wire that the three con artists are turning on each other, she meets with Gadger again, telling him that the person who took pictures of Nick's murder, is demanding $250.000.|$|R
60|$|The {{measures}} of General Gage {{had not been}} shrouded in all the secrecy he imagined. Dr. Joseph Warren, one of the committee of safety, had observed the preparatory disposition of the boats and troops, and surmised some sinister intention. He sent notice of these movements to John Hancock and Samuel Adams, both members of the provincial Congress, {{but at that time}} privately sojourning with a friend at Lexington. A design on the magazine at Concord was suspected, and the committee of safety ordered that the cannon collected there should be secreted and part of the stores removed. On the night of the 18th, Dr. Warren sent off two messengers by different routes to give the alarm that the king's troops were actually sallying forth. The messengers got out of Boston just before the order of General <b>Gage</b> <b>went</b> into effect, to prevent any one from leaving the town.

5000|$|Ellen tells Chelsea to set {{the birds}} free to avoid infection, and says that a sample she took of the {{infected}} koala's blood revealed that an unknown enzyme infected the animal's cerebral cortex. Infected birds soon begin trying to escape the highly protected aviary by breaking the glass. AJ, Lizzy and Gage use an unfinished zip line {{to get to the}} Watchtower, but the cable breaks in the process, and AJ falls to his death. In the Watchtower, they join Ellen and Thea, and prepare to set fire to the aviary by using flammable gas cans from the tower's basement. After Chelsea does not respond on the walkie-talkie, Lizzy and <b>Gage</b> <b>go</b> to the aviary to check on her. Lizzy tells Ellen to destroy the aviary if they do not come back. Lizzy and Gage find Chelsea and Ricky dying in the aviary, with an infected parrot building a nest in Chelsea's intestines. Ellen sets the aviary on fire. Lizzy and Gage manage to escape before Ellen leaves in the truck. When they realize the fire won't reach some of the birds, they blow up the truck to cause an additional, quicker fire.|$|R
