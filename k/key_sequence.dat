5|$|Following the {{successful}} release of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately {{set to work}} on producing a sequel. In July of that same year Theroux was hired to write the script, and Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey, Paltrow and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from Iron Man, while Cheadle {{was brought in to}} replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In the early months of 2009, Rourke, Rockwell and Johansson filled out the supporting cast, and filming took place from April to July of that year. Like its predecessor the film was shot mostly in California, except for a <b>key</b> <b>sequence</b> in Monaco.|$|E

Many of the exteriors were set to be shot in New Orleans, including a <b>key</b> <b>sequence</b> involving the Canal Street Ferry across the Mississippi River. After the city was reopened, the cast and crew returned to New Orleans to continue filming. Some scenes of the post-Katrina devastation were worked into the plot, including those in the Lower 9th Ward; additionally, evidence of Katrina's impact on the city was worked into the script.Deja Vu starts production in New Orleans|work= USA Today|date= February 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-19|quote= |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-02-02-deja-vu_x.htm}} The filming crew spent two weeks filming a scene at the Four Mile Bayou in Morgan City, Louisiana.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Music.j-total.net, {{the song is}} written in the key of F minor. During {{the first and second}} verse and pre-chorus, the song follows a <b>key</b> <b>sequence</b> of F minor. Through the first, second and third chorus, the song has a sequence of A#m7–D#m7–E–D#m7. During the bridge section, the <b>key</b> <b>sequence</b> changes to A#m7–C7–F minor. It opens with a percussion section that includes a drum machine and cymbals; it then carries on with Palm Products GmbH synthesizers and keyboards, as described by a member at Selective Hearing. In an interview with MSN Hotmail in 2008, Utada said about the song; [...] "I wanted to write quite a lively song and after writing it, I still feel that this has the most energetic feeling to it and that it’s probably the most polished song too." [...] She personally enjoyed the end result of the song, as she described the arrangement and lyrical content, and cited it one of her favorite songs form the album. A reviewer from Selective Hearing said that the song [...] "sound like throw backs to her R days."

[...] Mikey O'Connell from Zap2it likened Pullman's performance {{to that of}} John Lithgow as The Trinity Killer in Dexter, both having the sense of [...] "the familiar, comforting actor you've watched for decades" [...] being [...] "hijacked by someone else."

[...] Reviewing the fifth episode of the series The Independents Neela Debnath said of Pullman that [...] "thus far he has given an extraordinary turn as Danes, which at times has veered towards hammy territory but has never entered it." [...] However, Debnath felt that with a <b>key</b> <b>sequence</b> where Danes makes a public speech [...] "the line was finally crossed", believing the sequence [...] "clichéd" [...] and that it was [...] "improbable that he could instantaneously win over an angry lynch mob in moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Mega-City One and {{its high}} rise towers {{were created in}} Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a {{suitable}} set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers {{did not want to}} build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A <b>key</b> <b>sequence</b> involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: [...] "I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange." [...] Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.|$|E

In the present study participants practiced two discrete 6 -key sequences. In the ensuing test phase, participants were prevented from using the chunking mode by including two deviant stimuli in most sequences. The results from the remaining – unchanged – familiar sequences confirmed that participants no longer used the chunking mode, but as predicted by associative learning these sequences were executed faster than unfamiliar sequence...|$|R

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} (base) {{sequence of}} the genome might reflect biological information beyond the coding sequences.

Based on the appearance frequency of the <b>key</b> <b>sequences</b> of the genome, any DNA sequences on the genome could be expressed as a sequence spectrum with the adjoining base sequences, {{which could be used}} to study the corresponding biological phenomena. In this paper, we used 64 successive three- base sequences (triplets) as the <b>key</b> <b>sequences,</b> and determined and compared the spectra of specific genes to the chromosome, or specific genes to tRNA genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Escherichia coli. Based on these analyses, a gene and its corresponding position on the chromosome showed highly similar spectra with the same fold enlargement (approximately 400 -fold) in the S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and E. coli genomes. In addition, the homologous structure of genes that encode proteins was also observed with appropriate tRNA gene(s) in the genome. This analytical method might faithfully reflect the encoded biological information, that is, the conservation of the base sequences was to make sense the conservation of the translated amino acids sequence in the coding region, and might be universally applicable to other genomes, even those that consisted of multiple chromosomes...|$|R
