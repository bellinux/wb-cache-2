2500|$|Ras is {{attached}} to the cell membrane owing to its prenylation and palmitoylation (HRAS and NRAS) or the combination of prenylation and a polybasic sequence adjacent to the prenylation site (KRAS). The C-terminal CaaX box of Ras first gets farnesylated at its Cys residue in the cytosol, allowing Ras to loosely insert into the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum and other cellular membranes. The Tripeptide (aaX) is then cleaved from the C-terminus by a specific prenyl-protein specific <b>endoprotease</b> and the new C-terminus is methylated by a methyltransferase. KRas processing is completed at this stage. [...] Dynamic electrostatic interactions between its positively charged basic sequence with negative charges at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane account for its predominant localization at the cell surface at steady-state. NRAS and HRAS are further processed {{on the surface of the}} Golgi apparatus by palmitoylation of one or two Cys residues, respectively, adjacent to the CaaX box. The proteins thereby become stably membrane anchored (lipid-rafts) and are transported to the plasma membrane on vesicles of the secretory pathway. Depalmitoylation eventually releases the proteins from the membrane, allowing them to enter another cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation. This cycle is believed to prevent the leakage of NRAS and HRAS to other membranes over time and to maintain their steady-state localization along the Golgi apparatus, secretory pathway, plasma membrane and inter-linked endocytosis pathway.|$|E

50|$|Several {{proteins}} {{have been}} found to be prenylated and methylated at their carboxyl-terminal ends. Prenylation was initially believed to be important only for membrane attachment. However, another role for prenylation appears to be its importance in protein-protein interactions.

Prelamin A is farnesylated and carboxymethylated on the cysteine residue of a carboxyl-terminal CaaX motif. This post-translationally modified cysteine residue is removed from prelamin A when it is endoproteolytically processed into mature lamin A. The protein encoded by this gene binds to the prenylated prelamin A carboxyl-terminal tail domain. It may be a component of a prelamin A <b>endoprotease</b> complex.

40|$|Proinsulin {{conversion}} to insulin occurs in secretory granules of pancreatic beta-cells. This processing {{has been suggested}} to require both the <b>endoproteases</b> PC 2 and PC 3 with each cleaving at {{only one of the}} two sites linking the insulin A- and B-chains with C-peptide. To evaluate this in an appropriate cellular setting, conversion of human proinsulin was followed in GH 3 (rat pituitary) cells normally unable to convert this prohormone but equipped with the regulated secretory pathway. For this purpose, human proinsulin was expressed in GH 3 cells, alone or in combination with PC 2 and/or PC 3, using recombinant adenoviruses. Cells were infected with the given adenoviruses and 24 h later were pulse-chased. Kinetics of proinsulin conversion were monitored by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. It was observed that while the two <b>endoproteases</b> do display a preference for a single site of cleavage (PC 2 at the A-chain/C-peptide junction; PC 3 at the B-chain/C-peptide junction) and act in a synergistic manner to promote proinsulin conversion, either PC 2 or PC 3 alone can cleave at both sites to fully convert proinsulin to insulin.

40|$|The {{entry of}} enveloped viruses into its host cells {{is a crucial}} step for the {{propagation}} of viral infection. The envelope glycoprotein complex controls viral tropism and promotes the membrane fusion process. The surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses are synthesized as inactive precursors and sorted through the constitutive secretory pathway of the infected cells. To be infectious, most of the viruses require viral envelope glycoprotein maturation by host cell <b>endoproteases.</b> In spite of the strong variability of primary sequences observed within different viral envelope glycoproteins, the endoproteolytical cleavage occurs mainly in a highly conserved domain at the carboxy terminus of the basic consensus sequence (Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg↓). The same consensus sequence is recognized by the kexin/subtilisin-like serine proteinases (so called convertases) in many cellular substrates such as prohormones, proprotein of receptors, plasma proteins, growth factors and bacterial toxins. Therefore, several groups of investigators have evaluated the implication of convertases in viral envelope glycoprotein cleavage. Using the vaccinia virus overexpression system, furin was first shown to mediate the proteolytic maturation of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) and influenza virus envelope glycoproteins. In vitro studies demonstrated that purified convertases directly and specifically cleave viral envelope glycoproteins. Although these studies suggested the participation of several enzymes belonging to the convertases family, recent data suggest that other protease families may also participate in the HIV envelope glycoprotein processing. Their role in the physiological maturation process is still hypothetical and the molecular mechanism of the cleavage is not well documented. Crystallization of the hemagglutinin precursor (HA 0) of influenza virus allowed further understanding of the molecular interaction between viral precursors and the cellular <b>endoproteases.</b> Furthermore, relationships between differential pathogenicity of influenza strains and their susceptibility to cleavage are molecularly funded.

Chromogranin A immunoblots revealed chromogranin A processing, from both the NH 2 and COOH termini, in both wild-type AtT- 20 and AtT- 20 antisense PC 1 cells.

[35 S]Methionine/cysteine pulse-chase metabolic labeling in AtT- 20 antisense PC 1 and antisense furin cells revealed reciprocal changes in secreted chromogranin A COOH-terminal fragments (increased approximately 82 kD and decreased approximately 74 kD forms, as compared with wild-type AtT- 20 cells) indicating decreased cleavage, while AtT- 20 cells overexpressing PC 2 showed increased processing to and secretion of approximately 71 and approximately 27 kD NH 2 -terminal chromogranin A fragments. Antisense PC 1 specifically abolished regulated secretion of both chromogranin A and beta-endorphin in response to the usual secretagogue, corticotropin-releasing hormone. Moreover, immunocytochemistry demonstrated a relative decrease of chromogranin A in processes (where regulated secretory vesicles accumulate) of AtT- 20 cells overexpressing either PC 1 or PC 2. These results demonstrate that chromogranin A is a substrate for the endogenous <b>endoproteases</b> PC 1 and furin in vivo, and that such processing influences its trafficking into the regulated secretory pathway; furthermore, lack of change in chromogranin B and secretogranin II cleavage after diminution of PCl suggests that the action of PC 1 on chromogranin A may be specific within the chromogranin/secretogranin protein family...|$|R
