The potential to pack two LUTs into a space that could accommodate only one LUT in traditional architectures complicates FPGA technology mapping’s resource minimization objective. Previous works introduced edge recovery techniques {{and the concept of}} LUT balancing, both of which produce mappings that pack into fewer <b>fracturable</b> LUTs. We combine these two ideas and evaluate their effectiveness for one commercial and four academic FPGA architectures, all of which contain <b>fracturable</b> LUTs. When combined, edge-recovery and LUT balancing yield a 9. 0 % to 16. 1 % reduction in <b>fracturable</b> LUT use, depending on the architecture.

The NATURE architecture incorporates 16 -bit reconfigurable DSP blocks for accelerating arithmetic computations, however, their fixed precision prevents efficient re-use in mixed-width arithmetic circuits. This paper presents an improved DSP block architecture for NATURE, with native support for temporal folding and run-time fracturability. The proposed DSP block can compute multiple sub-width operations in the same clock cycle and can dynamically switch between sub-width and full-width operations in different cycles. The NanoMap tool for mapping circuits onto NATURE is extended to exploit the <b>fracturable</b> multiplier unit incorporated in the DSP block. We demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} proposed dynamically <b>fracturable</b> DSP block by implementing logic-intensive and compute-intensive benchmark applications. Our results illustrate that the <b>fracturable</b> DSP block can achieve a 53. 7 % reduction in DSP block utilization and a 42. 5 % reduction in area with a 122. 5 % reduction in power-delay product without exploiting logic folding. We also observe an average reduction of 6. 43 % in power-delay product for circuits that utilize NATURE’s temporal folding compared to the existing full precision DSP block in NATURE, leading to highly compact, energy efficient designs...|$|E

This paper introduces a new adaptive logic module based on <b>fracturable</b> 6 -LUTs {{with the goal of}} fundamentally altering this relationship. This logic module can achieve the performance benefits of larger LUT sizes (up to 7) while actually decreasing area cost through sharing of input muxing resources and additional features that allow multiple functions to share the same LUT-mask.

Hydration of rocky mantle minerals by serpentinization provides a means for sustaining the measured release of chemical energy in such worlds.

40|$|Proteins {{are widely}} used for the {{physical}} stabilization of emulsions and foams. Stabilization strongly depends on the interfacial properties of the proteins. In many cases likely a kind of interfacial gel layer is formed. This paper deals with fracture properties of such interfacial gelled protein layers as studied by the overflowing cylinder technique. In {{the first part of}} the paper, equations are presented for the calculation of the fracture stress of these protein layers from experimental data. This is illustrated in the second part of this paper for ovalbumin, glycinin, β-casein, and β-lactoglobulin. Obtained fracture stresses are on the order of 2 × 105 Pa and dependent on the type of protein. Protein properties such as conformation seem to be important aspects, determining the height of the fracture stress.

40|$|A whey salts mixture {{was used}} as a partial {{substitute}} for sodium chloride to provide a modified Na:K ratio (1 : 3. 4) in the manufacture of white salted cheese using ultrafiltration. Reduction of chymosin addition from 20 to 8 mu L kg(- 1) of cheese was also investigated. Variation of salt and chymosin levels did not result in any significant differences in composition and physicochemical properties. The rates of proteolysis in terms of water-soluble nitrogen (WSN) and nitrogen soluble in 12 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA-SN) were affected by chymosin levels but not by salt treatment. Urea-PAGE electrophoretic analysis of caseins from the cheeses manufactured using three levels of chymosin and two salt types showed that the hydrolysis of alpha(s 1) -casein was higher than for beta-caseins but the differences between the cheeses were not significant (P > 0. 05). The chymosin level did not have a significant effect (P > 0. 05) on hardness and fracturability, suggesting that any variation in hardness due to the initial hydrolysis was being confounded by other variables. Cheeses including the whey salts product were harder and more <b>fracturable</b> (P 0. 05). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} VEGAS, a new soft vector architecture, {{in which}} the vector processor reads and writes directly to a scratchpad memory instead of a vector register file. The scratchpad memory is a more efficient storage medium than a vector register file, allowing up to 9 × more data elements to fit into on-chip memory. In addition, the use of <b>fracturable</b> ALUs in VEGAS allow efficient processing of bytes, halfwords and words in the same processor instance, providing up to 4 × the operations compared to existing fixedwidth soft vector ALUs. Benchmarks show the new VE-GAS architecture is 10 × to 208 × faster than Nios II and has 1. 7 × to 3. 1 × better area-delay product than previous vector work, achieving much higher throughput per unit area. To put this performance in perspective, VEGAS is faster than a leading-edge Intel processor at integer matrix multiply. To ease programming effort and provide full debug support, VEGAS uses a C macro API that outputs vector instructions as standard NIOS II/f custom instructions.

40|$|The {{development}} of future FPGA fabrics with {{more sophisticated and}} complex logic blocks requires a new CAD flow that permits the expression of that complexity {{and the ability to}} synthesize to it. In this paper, we present a new logic block description language that can depict complex intrablock interconnect, hierarchy and modes of operation. These features are necessary to support modern and future FPGA complex soft logic blocks, memory and hard blocks. The key part of the CAD flow associated with this complexity is the packer, which takes the logical atomic pieces of the complex blocks and groups them into whole physical entities. We present an area-driven generic packing tool that can pack the logical atoms into any heterogeneous FPGA described in the new language, including many different kinds of soft and hard logic blocks. We gauge its area quality by comparing the results achieved with a lower bound on the number of blocks required, and then illustrate its explorative capability in two ways: on <b>fracturable</b> LUT soft logic architectures, and on hard block memory architectures. The new infrastructure attaches to a flow that begins with a Verilog front-end, permitting the use of benchmarks that are significantly larger than the usual ones, and can target heterogenous FPGAs...|$|E
40|$|Forty eight Canarian goat cheeses were smoked using six {{different}} materials; {{shell of the}} almond (Prunus aulcis), segmented prickly pear cactus (Opuntia ficus indica), pine needles and wood of canary pine (Pinus canariensis), rose rock wood (Cistus monspeliensis) and heather wood (Erica arborea). Cheeses were smoked at two different ripening times: 4 and 10 days, samples of 20 -days-old were analyzed. Surface cheese colour was measured using a colorimeter, measuring Lightness, Croma and Hue angle, while texture characteristics were determined using the Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) obtaining five parameters for texture: fracturability, hardness, cohesiveness, adhesiveness and elasticity. Only Lightness was affected {{by the age of}} cheese at smoking process. Cheeses smoked with Erica arborea wood and Pinus canariensis wood were statistically the darkest, while the ones smoked with Pinus canariensis needle were the lightest. Almond shell and Pinus canariensis wood produced cheeses with the highest intensive colour whereas the products smoked with Erica arborea wood and Pinus canariensis needles were the least intensive. When a smoke produced a darker colour, the Croma was high and the Hue angle was far from yellow axis. For texture characteristic, in compression test, cheeses smoked with 10 -days-old were more <b>fracturable</b> and hardness and less elastic than others smoked with 4 -days-old while the material used for smoking only affected cohesiveness...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} new FPGA logic blocks, FPGA ar-chitects have traditionally needed to customize CAD tools {{to make use}} of the new features and characteristics of those blocks. The software development effort necessary to cre-ate such CAD tools can be a time-consuming process that can significantly limit the number and variety of architec-tures explored. Thus, architects want flexible CAD tools that can, with few or no software modifications, explore a diverse space. Existing flexible CAD tools suffer from im-practically long runtimes and/or fail to efficiently make use of the important new features of the logic blocks being in-vestigated. This work is a step towards addressing these concerns by enhancing the packing stage of the open-source VTR CAD flow [17] to efficiently deal with common inter-connect structures that are used to create many kinds of use-ful novel blocks. These structures include crossbars, carry chains, dedicated signals, and others. To accomplish this, we employ three techniques in this work: speculative pack-ing, pre-packing, and interconnect-aware pin counting. We show that these techniques, along with three minor modi-fications, result in improvements to runtime and quality of results across a spectrum of architectures, while simultane-ously expanding the scope of architectures that can be ex-plored. Compared with VTR 1. 0 [17], we show an average 12 -fold speedup in packing for <b>fracturable</b> LUT architectures with 20 % lower minimum channel width and 6 % lower crit-ical path delay. We obtain a 6 to 7 -fold speedup for archi-tectures with non-fracturable LUTs and architectures with depopulated crossbars. In addition, we demonstrate packing support for logic blocks with carry chains...|$|E
