50|$|A <b>ground</b> {{proximity}} <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (GPWS) is {{a system}} designed to alert pilots if their aircraft is in immediate danger of flying into the ground or an obstacle. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines GPWS {{as a type of}} terrain awareness <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (TAWS). More advanced systems, introduced in 1996, are known as enhanced <b>ground</b> proximity <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (EGPWS), although sometimes called terrain awareness <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

The FAA has approved certain installations of this type of equipment, known as the enhanced <b>ground</b> proximity <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (EGPWS). However, in the proposed final rule, the FAA is using the broader term “terrain awareness and warning system” (TAWS) because the FAA expects that a variety of systems may be developed in the near future that would meet the improved standards contained in the proposed final rule.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{installation}} of the first electronic <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> the only defenses against CFIT were pilot simulator training, traditional procedures, crew resource management (CRM) and radar surveillance by air traffic services. While those factors undoubtedly reduced the total number of CFIT accidents, they did not eliminate them entirely. To prevent the continued occurrence of CFIT accidents, manufacturers developed terrain awareness and <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (TAWS). The first generation of those systems was known as a <b>ground</b> proximity <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (GPWS), which used a radar altimeter to assist in calculating terrain closure rates. That system was further improved {{with the addition of a}} GPS terrain database and is now known as an enhanced <b>ground</b> proximity <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (EGPWS). When combined with mandatory pilot simulator training, which emphasizes proper responses to any caution or <b>warning</b> event, the <b>system</b> has proved very effective in preventing further CFIT accidents.|$|R

As a result of these studies and recommendations from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in 1974 the FAA required all Part 121 certificate holders (that is, those operating large turbine-powered airplanes) and some Part 135 certificate holders (that is, those operating large turbojet airplanes) to install TSO-approved GPWS equipment.|$|R
50|$|The pilots had {{no warning}} of the {{imminent}} impact because Air Inter had not equipped its aircraft with a <b>ground</b> proximity <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (GPWS). It is speculated that this was because Air Inter - facing ferocious competition from France's TGV high-speed trains - may have encouraged its pilots to fly fast at low level (up to 350 knots below 10,000 feet, while other airlines generally do not exceed 250 knots), and GPWS systems gave too many nuisance warnings.|$|R
5000|$|A terrain {{awareness}} and <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (TAWS) aims to prevent [...] "controlled flight into terrain" [...] (CFIT) accidents. The actual systems in current use {{are known as}} <b>ground</b> proximity <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> and enhanced GPWS. [...] The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) developed the TAWS term to encompass all current and future systems which meet the relevant FAA standards. [...] New systems, with different names than GPWS and EGPWS, may be developed which meet TAWS objectives. As well, the term TAWS is sometimes {{used to refer to}} second-generation EGPWS systems as opposed to first generation GPWS systems, although this usage can be confusing.|$|R
