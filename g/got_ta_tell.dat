5000|$|Arriving at the spa, Angel leaves Cordelia and Wesley (who {{falls down}} {{getting out of}} the car) to act as lookouts. Angel brushes past Mars and, finding Jheira with the still-somnolent girls, <b>tells</b> her that <b>Tae</b> is closer behind than she thinks. At that moment, Cordelia frantically rushes in to report Tae's approach. While Cordelia and Wesley are still rousing the girls and trying to get them moving toward the back exit, Tae and his team burst in. Cordy and Wes {{continue}} with the evacuation, while Jheira and Angel engage Tae and his men in battle. The two demons manage to hold their own until Wesley and Cordelia, returning to the fight after securing the girls, are suddenly taken hostage. When presented with Tae's ultimatum to hand over the refugees or see the humans die, Jheira, hardly hesitating, says, [...] "Then they die." [...] As she wheels for the exit, Cordelia and Wesley seize the initiative and break away from their captors, who seem momentarily stunned at the failure of their ploy. Outside, Jheira makes her way towards the cab of the truck loaded with crates of ice-packed refugee girls. She is just steps away from freedom when two of the Vigories grab her from behind and restrain her for Tae, making sure that her ko is exposed. Jheira's nemesis holds up the cutting tool and prepares to mutilate the Princess of Oden Tal to bring her under immediate control. Appearing out of nowhere, Angel grabs Tae in a headlock and, giving him a couple of demonstrative squeezes, threatens to snap their leader's neck unless the Vigories holding Jheira release her. As soon as they do, Angel tells Jheira to get the girls to safety. Giving Angel a slight nod, she climbs into the cab of the truck and drives away. As soon as Jheira is out of sight, Angel releases <b>Tae</b> and <b>tells</b> him to go back to Oden Tal, morphing into vamp face to let the Vigories know he can make good on his promise of mayhem if they continue their war in this dimension.|$|R
