25|$|Many of the Lynx's {{components}} {{had been}} derived from earlier Westland helicopters {{such as the}} Scout and Wasp. The Lynx has been substantially upgraded since originally entering service in the 1970s; improvements made to in-service aircraft have typically included strengthened airframes, new avionics and engines, improved rotor blades, additional surveillance and communications systems. Various subsystems from overseas suppliers have been incorporated into some Lynx variants; during a South Korean procurement, hulls produced in the United Kingdom were equipped with Korean-built systems, such as ISTAR, electro-optical, electronic warfare, fire-control systems, flight control actuators, and undercarriages. A glass cockpit was adopted on the Super Lynx 300, featuring fully integrated flight and mission display systems, a variety of integrated <b>display</b> <b>units</b> <b>including</b> head-up <b>displays,</b> and dual controls; AgustaWestland has commented that the new cockpit reduces aircrew workload and increases aircraft effectiveness.

40|$|Intergenic {{repeat units}} of 127 -bp (RU- 1) and 168 -bp (RU- 2), {{as well as}} a newly-found class of 103 -bp (RU- 3), {{represent}} small mobile sequences in enterobacterial genomes present in multiple intergenic regions. These repeat sequences display similarities to eukaryotic miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITE). The RU mobile elements have not been reported to encode amino acid sequences. An in silico approach was used to scan genomes for location of repeat units. RU sequences are found to have open reading frames, which are present in annotated gene loci whereby the RU amino acid sequence is maintained. Gene loci that <b>display</b> repeat <b>units</b> <b>include</b> those that encode large proteins which are part of super families that carry conserved domains and those that carry predicted motifs such as signal peptide sequences and transmembrane domains.
