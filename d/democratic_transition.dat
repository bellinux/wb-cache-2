5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} <b>democratic</b> <b>transition</b> called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E

30|$|Khan (2010) {{argues that}} <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions</b> become more likely when private sector {{production}} to GDP expands. Khan explains that entrepreneurs pay more taxes {{and thus have}} more {{at stake in the}} political system and consequently demand a greater say. This line of thought is consistent with our work: as an economy transitions to an increasing returns production structure, <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions</b> are more likely. This is unlike North et al. (2007) and their necessary conditions for <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions.</b> They posit that: (1) a rule of law for elites, (2) civil society organizations and (3) a centralized and consolidated control of violence are necessary, though not sufficient prerequisites for <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions.</b> But we have already demonstrated that the performance of conditions (1) and (2) depend on economic structures, making these less than robust conditions for <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions.</b> Also, condition (3) is a necessary factor for stability in democratic and non-democratic states, which makes this a less than interesting necessary condition for <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions</b> on {{institutional}} outcomes in a panel of 135 countries over the period 1984 - 2012, using an event study method. Our estimates suggest {{that the bulk of}} the improvement occurs during the three years following the transition. We can find no anticipation effect in average institutional outcomes. The results are robust to using alternative transition definitions and alternative codings of pre- and post-transition years, to changing the set of control variables, to excluding former socialist countries from the sample, and to dealing with endogeneity with IV regressions. When distinguishing full and partial <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions,</b> we find that both improve institutional outcomes. We find that the effect of <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions</b> is conditional on GDP per capita, education, and the regularity of the transition. When looking at specific components of institutional quality, we find that law and order, internal conflict, government stability, and ethnic tensions follow the general trend, while corruption, military in politics, bureaucratic quality, and investment profile indices are insensitive to <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{development}} {{emerged in the}} 1940s and 1950s out of the post-World War II context in which a new international economic order was established, the United States made contributions to European reconstruction, and attention to the post-colonial Third World increased. The United States included among its aims in World War I the defense of democracies, and after WWII attempted to institutionalize democratic systems in countries that had lost the war (such as Germany and Japan); meanwhile during the Cold War, democracy promotion was a distant goal, with security concerns and a centering of policy against Soviet expansion dominating. President Jimmy Carter applied limited diplomatic pressure, {{which resulted in a}} conservative backlash resistant to criticism of authoritarian allies, while President Reagan selectively supported anti-communist <b>democratic</b> <b>transition</b> in countries such as El Salvador, the Philippines, and South Korea.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, some 245 {{newspapers}} and magazines (compared to only 91 in 1987) are 90% owned by private groups and independents. The Tunisian political parties {{have the right to}} publish their own newspapers, but those of the opposition parties have very limited editions (like Al Mawkif or Mouwatinoun). Before the recent <b>democratic</b> <b>transition,</b> although freedom of the press was formally guaranteed by the constitution, almost all newspapers have in practice followed the government line report. Critical approach to the activities of the president, government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally Party (then in power) were suppressed. In essence, the media was dominated by state authorities through the Agence Tunis Afrique Presse. This has changed since, as the media censorship by the authorities have been largely abolished, and self-censorship has significantly decreased. Nonetheless, the current regulatory framework and social and political culture mean that the future of press and media freedom is still unclear.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} relationship between race and democratization. Through {{the examination of the}} case of the Dominican Republic, this study challenges mainstream explanations of <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions.</b> At its core, this dissertation aims at calling attention to the absence of race and ethnic allegiances as explanatory variables of the democratic processes and debates in the region. ^ By focusing on structural variables, the analysis shies away from elite and actor-centered explanations that fall short in predicting the developments and outcomes of transitions. The central research questions of this study are: Why is there an absence of the treatment of race and ethnic allegiances during the <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions</b> in Latin America and the Caribbean? How has the absence of ethnic identities affected the nature and depth of democratic transitions?^ Unlike previous explanations of <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions,</b> this dissertation argues that the absence of race in <b>democratic</b> <b>transitions</b> has been a deliberate attempt to perpetuate limited citizenship by political and economic elites. Findings reveal a difficulty to overcome nationalist discourses where limited citizenship has affected the quality of democracy. Original field research data for the study has been gathered through semi-structured interviews and focus groups conducted from October 2008 to December 2009 in the Dominican Republic. ...|$|R
25|$|The 1971 war and {{separation}} of East-Pakistan demoralized and shattered the nation.

With PPP's coming to power, the democratic socialists and visionaries came to the power {{for the first time}} in the country's history, under a <b>democratic</b> <b>transition.</b> Bhutto made critical decision after dismissing chiefs of army, navy and the air force while authorized home confinement orders for General Yahya Khan and several of his collaborators. He adopted the East-Pakistan Commission's recommendations and authorized large-scale court-martial of army officers tainted for their role in East Pakistan. To keep the country united, Bhutto launched a series of internal intelligence operations to crack down on the fissiparous nationalist sentiments and movements in the provinces. Proponents of socialism were supported as part of the internal policies and the PPP faced serious challenges, both on internal and foreign fronts.|$|E
25|$|American {{efforts to}} promote {{democracy}} {{in the region are}} generally characterized by top-down and bottom-up democratization strategies, which can be pursued simultaneously. The former top-down approach involves putting rhetorical and diplomatic pressure on regimes to reform and can {{go so far as to}} involve direct American military engagement installing democratic government (as is the case in Iraq following the 2003 invasion). The U.S. government generally pursues the latter bottom-up approach by funding international organizations that help strengthen the bases for gradual <b>democratic</b> <b>transition</b> (the rule of law, accountable government institutions and expanded political competition) in the MENA region by offering technical assistance and training to political parties and electoral management bodies, engaging with civil society, producing assessments and polls, and promoting female political participation. Some have criticized American democracy promotion in MENA for ineffectiveness, a lack of consistency, taking a one-size-fits-all approach and using democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Moreover, It's said that US democracy promotion had been accompanied by heavy costs for US and considerable damage to the target countries.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cold War, an American {{political}} consensus {{began to}} emerge suggesting that <b>democratic</b> <b>transition</b> should be actively supported – a consensus only more firmly established following the dissolution of the Soviet Union when the United States found itself in less of a difficult position balancing security concerns and promotion of its ideals. This was based in part on democratic peace theory, which added a security element to democracy promotion. The Middle East was not excluded from this discussion, with some calling for increased American democracy promotion as a means of encouraging more peaceful relations with Israel and moderating extremists, while not {{going so far as to}} destabilize friendly autocratic regimes. The assumption that a positive relationship exists between democratic governance and peace which was prominent in the 1990s faced some inconsistency in the Middle East, however, because regimes that engaged to some extent in the peace process with Israel (and in the case of Jordan successfully reached a peace agreement) at the same time slowly and half-heartedly pursued democratization and allowed little opening to opposition movements who resisted negotiation with Israel.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{promotion}} of free market economics also spurred new calls for democratization in the MENA region. The first democracy aid {{programs in the}} Arab world, including {{the creation of a}} modest $3 million Middle East Democracy Fund, were introduced by the George H.W. Bush administration as a means of encouraging economic liberalization via political liberalization, though the projects were primarily focused on improving management and efficiency in government institutions, as opposed to addressing contentious issues such as human rights abuses, government structures preserving authoritarian power, and laws and practices suppressive of democracy. While the Clinton administration broke with the Reagan and Bush administrations in its willingness to work with civil society organizations and promote <b>democratic</b> <b>transition</b> beyond formerly Soviet countries, democracy promotion still remained a relatively low priority and Arab regimes were largely able to resist increased pressure from foreign-funded international NGOs in the 1990s. Nonetheless, the United States spent $250 million on democracy programs in the region from 1991 to 2001, and political reform appeared as a goal in State Department and USAID literature, even if it did not figure prominently in high-level diplomatic discussions.|$|E
