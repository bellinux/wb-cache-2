5|$|Small town friends Edna (Deanna Durbin) and Judy (Judy Garland) are upset. Edna's {{grandfather}} and his orchestra, who play free Sunday concerts {{at a local}} park, have been fired by the town council because the concerts are poorly attended. The girls <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of singing at the concerts and set about promoting the next concert. The following Sunday Edna and Judy join Granddad on the bandstand. Edna's operatic style and Judy's swing bring crowds running {{from all over the}} park. The event is a huge success and Granddad's concerts are saved.|$|E
5|$|During {{the return}} from the Galápagos through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again failed to find the thick mats of Sargassum whose study {{had been one of}} the primary goals of the expedition. Searching for a way to satisfy his expedition's donors, Beebe <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same {{techniques}} to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in the Galápagos, Beebe encountered a surprising variety of sea animals, many of which had previously been thought to be exclusive to the tropics.|$|E
5|$|He {{then set}} about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the {{geometrical}} rate law and assuming an egg-shaped ovoid orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> {{the idea of}} an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked. Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus—Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova, though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.|$|E

5|$|Sri Krishna Pandaveeyam (The friendship/union of Lord Krishna and the Pandavas) is a 1966 mythological film {{directed}} by N. T. Rama Rao and produced by N. Trivikrama Rao. It depicts the adolescent {{age of the}} Pandavas and Krishna and shows the events in Mahabharatha focussing on the later chapters of Adi Parva and {{the first half of}} Sabha Parva. The film was shot at the Vauhini Studios under the N.A.T and Ramakrishna combined banner. It was a blockbuster <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> its release. It had a 100-day run in 9 centers and garnered positive critical acclaim for its direction and acting prowess. N.T.R has portrayed the roles of Duryodhana and Krishna in this movie.|$|E
5|$|A National Loan Act {{provided}} for $2 million in bonds, {{but due to}} its poor creditworthiness, the kingdom {{had been unable to}} sell them. Gibson <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of combining the two acts by appointing businessman Claus Spreckels, a close friend of the king, as government agent to contract with the United States Mint to have coins struck there, and for Spreckels to be paid in government bonds. In March 1883, the cabinet council authorized Finance Minister John M. Kapena to make the arrangement with Spreckels, who received formal authority for this role in May. H.A.P. Carter, Hawaiian envoy in Washington, acted as intermediary between the Hawaiians and the US government, and wrote to Kapena in June that the US authorities regarded the agency arrangement as peculiar, since a more usual way of proceeding would have been for the Hawaiian government to contract directly, and to pay for the coins in cash.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{task of the}} metallurgists was {{to determine}} how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium. The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300°C to 450°C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> a plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.|$|E

5|$|The {{work of the}} {{surveying}} {{team was}} greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task. To find {{the volume of the}} mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical prisms and compute the volume of each. The triangulation task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain. Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of interpolating a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only could he easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from the swirl of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented contour lines, in common use since for depicting cartographic relief.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by Bushnell and Dabney during 1970–71 to be a coin-operated version of Spacewar. After the pair were {{unable to find a}} way to economically run the game on a minicomputer such as the Data General Nova, they <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom-designed hardware created just to run that game. After they built an early proof of concept and founded Syzygy Engineering, Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. Working in partnership with Nutting, the pair ran their first location test in August 1971, a few months prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game, also based on Spacewar. After encouraging initial results, though mixed responses from distributors, Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units with the anticipation of a hit game. While the game was successful and validated Syzygy's belief in the future of arcade video games, selling over 1,000 cabinets by mid-1972 and ultimately 1,300–1,500 units, it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for. The game spawned one clone game, Star Trek (1972), and Nutting produced a two-player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from Syzygy before closing in 1976. Syzygy went on to be incorporated as Atari, with their next arcade game the successful Pong (1972). Although not as influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release marked the initial start of the commercial video game industry.|$|E

A solution was <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> to create a pontoon bridge, and in 1943, the Hobart Bridge was opened, spanning the Derwent River for the first time. To deal with the perceived problem of upriver shipping access, a lifting span was added near the western landing that allowed quite large vessels to pass through.|$|E

25|$|Still {{searching for}} a single-tube {{solution}} that was bright enough for direct viewing, in 1942 Baird <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the Telechrome concept. His solution was essentially to combine two tubes into one large spherical enclosure. In {{the center of the}} enclosure was a translucent mica sheet forming the display, covered on one side with cyan phosphor, the other with an orange-red color, producing a limited but useful color gamut. Two electron guns arranged {{on either side of the}} screen fired at it, producing the two colors. The image was viewed from one side, seeing one of the colors directly and the other being transmitted through the screen from the other side. This was the first single-tube color television system.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of growing}} {{territorial}} domain and evangelical missions, a command outpost or Commandancia in the Upper Pampanga River area was established. Then Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora (July 25, 1690 to December 8, 1701) had most likely {{spent much of}} his time in the northern outpost in Carranglan and Pantabangan and, baking in the fiercely hot climate, probably waxed nostalgic about his hometown in Ecija, Andalusia in Spain. Ecija, Andalusia was also known as la sarten or the frying pan because of its intensely hot summers. Thus the Governor-General <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the notion to name the outpost Nueva Ecija. Both the New and Old Ecija were washed by navigable rivers- the former, by Rio Grande de Pampanga and the latter, by the river Genil.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Dick Wolf {{developed}} a concept {{for a new}} television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially {{toyed with the idea}} of calling it Night & Day but then <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the title Law & Order. The first half of each episode would follow two detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime. The second half of the episode would follow the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, Law & Order would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Edwardes <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> a new {{strategy}} for the Gaiety, which was a variation from the kinds of shows that he and Carte had produced and also had elements of the Gaiety burlesques and of music hall entertainments. The earliest of these shows, taking a cue from Dorothy, had a musical style similar to the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. Into this mix, he incorporated some {{of the elements of}} the form that Harrigan & Hart had established on Broadway a decade earlier. Like Thomas German Reed and W. S. Gilbert before him, Edwardes wanted to produce musical plays that were more respectable (and would attract a more affluent, polite crowd) than risqué burlesque. But Edwardes sought pieces that integrated spoken dialogue and music in a lighter, less satiric way than Gilbert and Sullivan had, using topical songs, fashionable costumes and sassy byplay between the characters.|$|E

Here, the four mogwai Gizmo {{produces}} each possess their own distinct personalities and physical features.

Two of the mogwais were George, black without a stripe and a caricature of Edward G. Robinson, and Lenny, buck-toothed, named for the principal characters in Of Mice and Men, whom they resemble in both appearance and demeanor. Daffy was named for his manic behaviour, and the leader, Mohawk, for his mohawk hairstyle. Based on the original film's character, Stripe, Frank Welker also voices Mohawk. While both the mogwai and gremlin versions of Stripe had fur stripes, Baker <b>hit</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of giving the Mohawk mogwai a fur stripe and giving the Mohawk gremlin something scalier. Gizmo was also redesigned; the puppet was generally larger and its design was simplified. Dante commented Gizmo may look less real in Gremlins 2, but the result was that Gizmo could convey more emotion.|$|E
