40|$|White spot lesions (WSLs) or <b>decalcifications</b> {{remain a}} common {{complication}} in orthodontic patients with poor oral hygiene. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare attitudes regarding the development of WSLs among patients, parents, orthodontists and general dentists and improve prevention and treatment protocols through better communication. A survey was developed to evaluate and compare the current opinions of orthodontic patients (n= 315), parents (n= 279), orthodontists (n= 305) and general dentists (n= 191) regarding the significance, prevention and treatment of WSLs. All four groups indicated that WSLs did detract from the overall appearance of straight teeth. All four groups indicated that patients were the most responsible for the prevention of WSLs. All four groups indicated that the general dentist should be more responsible for the treatment of WSLs than the orthodontist.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to survey methods that Dutch orthodontists use to prevent {{development}} or progression of enamel <b>decalcifications</b> during orthodontic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pre-tested questionnaire was sent by post to all orthodontists in the Netherlands with a private practice (n = 189). RESULTS: The response rate was 81 %. At the start of orthodontic treatment a basic practice protocol for prevention of enamel demineralization was used by 93 % of the orthodontists. This included oral hygiene instructions (92 %) and the advice for additional use of a fluoride mouth rinse (64 %). Other preventive measures were rarely prescribed. About 85 % of those who prescribed a fluoride mouth rinse advised to rinse once a day, directly after evening tooth brushing. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the commonly used practice of fluoride mouth rinsing directly after evening tooth brushing by orthodontic patients during fixed appliance treatment ignores actual evidence of preventive advices. This study recommends mouth rinsing at another moment than after evening tooth brushing, thus increasing the frequency of fluoride intakes, which might enhance the effectiveness in preventing WSL development or progression during orthodontic treatment...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although it is {{well known}} that {{treatment}} with fixed appliances increases the risk of enamel demineralization, little information is available about preventive measures that orthodontists actually use. This study was executed to survey measures used in orthodontic practices to prevent <b>decalcifications</b> during fixed appliance treatment, and to compare these measures with the available evidence-based information. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all privately practicing orthodontists in the Netherlands who were affiliated with the Dutch Dental Association. RESULTS: Of 229 orthodontists, 178 (78 %) returned the questionnaires. Most of the orthodontists had a basic practice protocol for preventing demineralizations at the start of treatment. This protocol nearly always included oral hygiene instructions. If demineralizations occurred, 99 % of the orthodontists took extra measures. Comparing the measures applied in the orthodontic practices with the evidence from a systematic review, a number of differences became apparent. The additional use of chlorhexidine or toothpaste with a high fluoride concentration (which has been demonstrated to have an inhibitive effect) is rarely prescribed. Fluoride rinse is prescribed most often, although there is not any high-quality, long-term study that demonstrates a caries preventive effect in orthodontic patients. Sixty-eight percent of the orthodontists considered it necessary to develop a practice guideline for preventing demineralizations. CONCLUSIONS: Orthodontists do not implement the available evidence in order to prevent enamel demineralizations during fixed-appliance treatment. A practice guideline incorporating this information should be developed...|$|R
60|$|From these {{experiments}} {{it appears that}} enamel is attacked by the secretion with more difficulty than dentine, as {{might have been expected}} from its extreme hardness; and both with more difficulty than ordinary bone.

The angles or projections of the fibrous basis of the enamel and dentine (except, perhaps, in No. 4, which could not be well observed) were not in the least rounded; and Dr. Klein remarks that their microscopical structure was not altered.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{assess the}} {{available}} evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} lingual orthodontic treatment and related clinical parameters through a systematic review of relevant studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eligible clinical studies published from January 2000 to March 2015 were identified through electronic (five major databases) and hand searches. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for prospective studies and a specially designed tool for retrospective studies. RESULTS From the 3734 articles identified by the search, after application of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 papers were included in the study. Eleven studies were retrospective, four were prospective, and only one was a RCT. In detail, six studies evaluated differences of the treatment outcome from the pre-treatment set-up prediction, two studies evaluated the effect of treatment on periodontal and microbial parameters, and 10 studies assessed various clinical treatment related parameters. Despite several promising findings, the quality of evidence supporting them was found to be low in most cases. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review showed encouraging results on the clinical outcome of lingual orthodontic treatment, especially in regards to the achievement of individualized treatment goals and the reduction of <b>decalcifications</b> on the bonded surfaces of the teeth. However, additional well-designed prospective clinical trials with larger samples are needed to confirm those findings. Several aspects of lingual orthodontic treatment were difficult to be conclusively evaluated due to the study design, the heterogeneity, the small samples sizes, and the high risk of bias seen in the majority of the included studies...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of chlorhexidine and a cavity varnish in reducing the incidence of recurrent caries around amalgam restorations in vitro. This was accomplished by: (1) inserting amalgam restorations into Class V preparations to which a varnish (Copalite), a 1 percent chlorhcxidine gluconate solution, or chlorhexidine followed by the varnish were applied; (2) exposing the teeth with the restorations to a severe ciogenic challenge; and (3) measuring with the television microscope instrumentation the changes which occurred in {{the width of the}} gap between the amalgam and the cavity wall. Four groups of 12 intact bicuspids, previously extracted for orthodontic purposes and mounted in squares of self-curing resin, were used. Upon completion of the Class V Cavity preparations, the three treatments performed, and the cavity restored with amalgam, the teeth were exposed to a cariogenic challenge for six weeks, with a weekly change in the "artificial plaque" created by Streptococcus mutans. A group of teeth which received no treatment before the restoration was inserted served as controls. The television microscope measurement instrumentation which allowed a magnification of 250 X and measurements as small as one micron were used to identify and measure the width of the gap between the amalgam and the cavity wall before and after the teeth were exposed to the cariogenic challenge. The conclusions of this study were: (1) The use of chlorhexidine or a varnish or a combination of both produced a significantly smaller enlargement of the amalgam-cavity wall gap width when no treatment was performed before the insertion of the restoration. (2) Chlorhcxidine by itself or in combination with the varnish did not prove to be more effective in preventing the enlargement of the gap than the varnish. (3) The experimental model in which a cariogenic challenge was developed produced <b>decalcifications</b> that closely resembled those produced in the mouth situation. (4) The television microscope measurement instrumentation accurately measured the amalgam-cavity wall gap widths. (5) The evaluation did not permit a correlation between the increase in gap width and the carious process. It is the author's suggestion that for this purpose, future studies should be performed with histologic evaluations of enamel ground sections as one of the evaluation methods. (6) Before recommending the clinical use of chlorhcxidine as a recurrent marginal caries inhibitor, further research is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} disease afflicting approximately 28 percent {{of children in the}} U. S. under the age of 6 years (Bruce A Dye et al., 2007). ECC is a serious condition that can have profound health implications, including altered physical appearance, impaired ability to chew and speak, diminished quality of life, and increased risk for both oral and systemic health conditions (Colares and Feitosa, 2003; B. L. Edelstein, Vargas, and D, 2006; Norman Tinanoff and Reisine, 2009). Early identification of risk and prompt, targeted intervention is essential to overcoming the rising rates of ECC. The Diet and Early Childhood Caries (DECC) study was designed to evaluate a novel risk assessment tool, MySmileBuddy (MSB), in a predominantly Spanish speaking, low income, urban population. MSB serves as an interactive platform for education and goal setting for ECC prevention and a comprehensive ECC risk assessment tool that incorporates questions evaluating diet, feeding practices, general attitudes and beliefs, fluoride use, and family history. A large component of the MSB tool is devoted to the assessment of dietary risk factors related to ECC via inclusion of a modified 24 -hour dietary recall. A primary aim of the DECC study was to establish concurrent criterion validity by evaluating if MSB diet and comprehensive scores were associated with physical evidence of risk (i. e., oral mutans levels, <b>decalcifications,</b> visible plaque, and ECC status). Additionally the DECC study aimed to examine associations between physical evidence of caries risk and overall frequency of oral exposures, length of exposure time, and body mass index-for-age (BMI/age). Lastly, the DECC study was designed to assess the preliminary impact of the MSB intervention on recollection of stated goals and progress toward achievement of targeted ECC-related behavior changes one month post-intervention. In 108 parent/child (caregiver/child) dyads, the MSB diet risk scores were found to be significantly associated with early stage indicators of caries risk, specifically oral mutans levels (p less than 0. 05), and borderline associated (p less than 0. 1) with visible plaque levels. The MSB comprehensive risk score was also found to be significantly associated with both oral mutans and visible plaque (p less than 0. 05). Children with high MSB risk scores (diet and comprehensive) {{were more likely to have}} higher levels of oral mutans, and more likely to have higher levels of visible plaque compared to children with lower scores. Physical indicators of caries risk were not associated with other factors included in the DECC study (i. e., frequency of oral exposures and intake of individual food/beverage categories, length of oral exposure time, and BMI/age weight status). Preliminary data from the one-month follow-up suggests that the majority of parents/caregivers were able to recall their MSB goal and were beginning to initiate diet- and other dental-related changes at home. Overall, these findings suggest that the MSB tool may be a valid tool for predicting known physical precursors to caries and may be an effective avenue for behavior change. While these preliminary findings are encouraging, larger and longer-term studies will be necessary to determine the ultimate utility of MSB in predicting the ECC experience in children...|$|R

50|$|Bouin {{solution}} is a compound fixative used in histology. It {{is composed of}} picric acid, acetic acid and formaldehyde in an aqueous solution.

50|$|Different {{protocols}} {{are used}} {{depending on the}} field and the period. On present teeth, classical histological methods are often used and require <b>decalcification</b> of the dental tissue and staining protocol for collagen. In archaeology where collagen can be poorly preserved, tooth root is embedded in an epoxy resin and dried in a vacuum chamber. On human teeth, the crown and the upper third of the root are removed. 100-μm, non-decalcified cross sections are prepared from the middle third of the root using a Low Speed Saw fitted with a diamond-coated blade. The polishing of both faces can be performed to remove cutting marks. Each slice is washed and sections are mounted on slides. Observations are conducted using an optical microscope at ×400 magnification. Segments that showed readable cementum layers are captured with a digital camera and readings are performed on selected segments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Decalcification</b> is {{a lengthy}} procedure, as bone pieces {{have to be}} left in the decalcifying agent for several days or even weeks, {{depending}} on the size of the bone. Traditional methods of handling hard tissues, i.e. bone and teeth, usually present a problem to both the pathologist and histotechnologist. Many of the grossing and cutting-in techniques in current usage for these tissues dictate the use of gross sectioning procedures with a high-speed saw and/or long periods in a decalcifying solution, prior to reducing the specimen to a size that can be easily processed, embedded and sectioned. Frequently the poor quality thin sections obtained when these methods are employed contribute to the already difficult task of evaluating the pathology and making a correct diagnosis. With the introduction of Low Speed Saws, it is now possible to routinely and rapidly reduce undecalcified surgical specimens of hard tissue, to a thickness of 2-3 mm, without compromising the integrity of the tissue.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{common type}} of {{removable}} retainer is the vacuum formed retainer (VFR). This is a polypropylene or polyvinylchloride (PVC) material, which is more economical and faster to make, typically [...]020" [...] or [...]030" [...] thick. Essix (invented by Dr. John Sheridan) and Zendura are the brand names commonly associated with this retainer. This clear or transparent retainer fits over the entire arch of teeth or only from canine to canine (clip-on retainer) and is produced from a mold. It is similar in appearance to Invisalign trays, though the latter are not considered [...] "retainers." [...] The retainer is virtually invisible and clear when worn. Hence, it can provide aesthetics value to the patient. VFRs, if worn 24 hours per day, do not allow {{the upper and lower}} teeth to touch because plastic covers the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Some orthodontists feel that {{it is important for the}} top and bottom chewing surfaces to meet to allow for [...] "favorable settling" [...] to occur. Besides that, it is advisable to wear VFRs only at night, every night. When eating is necessary, the retainer is removed to allow natural consumption and to avoid the crushing of the VFR. Patient should be informed never to drink, especially cariogenic or fizzy drinks, with VFR in situ as it will lead to substantial loss of tooth surface and dental caries. The retainer can behave like a reservoir, enclosing the incisal edges and cuspal tips with the cariogenic drink, leading to <b>decalcification</b> of teeth. VFRs are less expensive, less visible, and easier to wear than Hawley retainers; however, for patients with disorders such as bruxism, VFRs are prone to rapid breakage and deterioration, especially if the material is PVC, a short chain molecule which breaks down far more quickly than polypropylene, a long chain molecule.|$|E
