[...] By 2007 the amount {{had been reduced to}} $2million, but the funding for the Center, whose purpose was to bring more poor and minority students into politics, was the target of criticism from Representative John B. T. Campbell III of California and other Republicans as an abuse of the earmark process and as Rangel's [...] "Monument to Me".

500|$|You Are the Apple of My Eye {{is based}} on Giddens' semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. He changed some details of the story to make the film more dramatic; for example, Ching-teng and Chia-yi's fight {{actually}} took place over the phone, not in the rain as depicted. Giddens said, [...] "although {{some of the reasons}} for the events in the film were changed, the main storyline remained unchanged". Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> pressured by whether the film is nice to watch, whether it will succeed in the box office, and whether it will become an embarrassment for me. Also, if the film is not nice, it will be a letdown to Chen-tung and Michelle, who have been working so hard".|$|E
500|$|King was {{inspired}} by Mahatma Gandhi and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as {{being one of the}} [...] "individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God". King had [...] "for a long time... wanted to take a trip to India." [...] With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959. The trip to India affected King, deepening his understanding of nonviolent resistance and his commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, [...] "Since being in India, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think maybe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E
500|$|Money was {{borrowed}} from Britain {{to fund the}} state's programs and at an unprecedented rate. Over £230 million was extended in loans from the City of London to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce's plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted. Both he and Page were [...] "conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook" [...] and sought major changes to federal-state relations in order implement their development policy. Increasingly our problems are becoming national in character... Our financial resources are curtailed {{and there is an}} immediate repercussion throughout the Commonwealth. All our problems are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> convinced that {{we have to look at}} all our problems with the eyes of a nation and not as individuals. Where a great problem confronts a State it may be solved by the cooperation of the Commonwealth for the benefit of the States, and the benefit and advancement of the whole of Australia.|$|E
500|$|Returning to the U.S., {{the newlyweds}} settled in a New York City {{house that was}} {{provided}} by Franklin's mother, {{as well as in}} a second residence at the family's estate overlooking the Hudson River in Hyde Park, New York. From the beginning, Eleanor had a contentious relationship with her controlling mother-in-law. The townhouse that Sara gave to Eleanor and Franklin was connected to her own residence by sliding doors, and Sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage. Early on, Eleanor had a breakdown in which she explained to Franklin that [...] "I did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine, one that I had done nothing about and which did not represent the way I wanted to live", but little changed. Sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren, and Eleanor reflected later that [...] "Franklin's children were more my mother-in-law's children than they were mine". Eleanor's eldest son James remembered Sara telling her grandchildren, [...] "Your mother only bore you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> your mother than your mother is." ...|$|E

500|$|Corzine {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the U.S. Senate while running for governor, which ensured that he could resign from the Senate and appoint a Democrat as his successor if he won and allowed him to retain his Senate seat if he lost. Speculation was that he would appoint a Democrat from one of the congressional districts in New Jersey, perhaps Congressmen Rob Andrews, Rush Holt, or Frank Pallone. Corzine, once he was Governor-Elect, said on November 11, 2005, that he was strongly appointing State Senator Nia Gill to fill his vacant seat in the United States Senate. Corzine said about Gill that she was [...] "an extraordinarily capable woman." [...] Gill for her part told the Associated Press [...] "I have the qualifications. If I am chosen by Jon, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> than qualified to rise to the occasion." [...] He strongly hinted he might appoint Governor Richard Codey although on November 23, 2005, Codey announced that he was not interested in pursuing the seat. On December 9, 2005, Corzine named his friend, who lived and lives in the same apartment building, U.S. Rep. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, to succeed him.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his beliefs, in 2009 Ebert {{wrote that}} he did not [...] "want to provide a {{category}} for people to apply to [...] " [...] because he [...] "would not want [...] convictions reduced to a word", and stated, [...] "I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, {{or at the very least}} a secular humanist– which I am". In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to call myself an atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable." ...|$|E
500|$|After being {{released}} from St Luke's, Smart {{was taken to a}} private madhouse. Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was [...] "committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a Mr Potter who kept a private house at Bethnal Green". She described her experience as being held in a [...] "small neat parlour". However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not [...] "homely", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: [...] "For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> unguarded than others" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: [...] "He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS." [...] It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space" [...] from being watched by outsiders.|$|E

If <b>I</b> had ten additional brains, it would be Shakespeare. Hm. Everyone seems to be English. [...] If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> Irish, it would be Beckett. (And if I had more savoir faire, it would be Molière.)" [...] He added, [...] "I think all my sources of inspiration are unconventional. It's the feeling of something unconventional that {{makes me want to}} write the play. At least for a full-length play that’s true. I think I wouldn't want to invest the time if I didn’t have that feeling." ...|$|R

500|$|Anne's father {{continued}} his diplomatic career under Henry VIII. In Europe, Thomas Boleyn's charm won many admirers, including Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. During this period, Margaret ruled the Netherlands on her nephew Charles's behalf {{and was so}} impressed with Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a place in her household. Ordinarily, a girl had to be twelve years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as the Archduchess affectionately referred to her as [...] "la petite Boulin [...] ". Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness, Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age. and told Sir Thomas Boleyn that his daughter was [...] "so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me" [...] (E.W. Ives, op.cit.). Anne stayed with Margaret from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII's sister Mary, who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514.|$|E
500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>more</b> surprised by the terrible performance of our team. The problem stemmed from the wings. I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. It will be very difficult but it is our duty to give it our best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E
