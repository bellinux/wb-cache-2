40|$|Gelatinous {{bone marrow}} {{transformation}} (GMT), {{also known as}} starvation marrow, represents a rare pathological entity of unclear etiology, in which bone marrow histopathology demonstrates hypoplasia, fat atrophy, and gelatinous infiltration. The finding of gelatinous marrow transformation lacks disease specificity; rather, it is an indicator of severe illness and a marker of poor nutritional status, found in patients with eating disorders, acute febrile illnesses, acquired immunodeficiency <b>syndrome,</b> <b>alcoholism,</b> malignancies, and congestive heart failure. We present a middle-aged woman {{with a history of}} alcoholism, depression, and anorexia nervosa who presented with failure to thrive and macrocytic anemia, with bone marrow examination demonstrative of gelatinous transformation, all of which resolved with appropriate treatment. To our knowledge, there are very few cases of GMT which have been successfully treated; thus, our case highlights the importance of proper supportive management...|$|R

However, these tasks are also sensitive to nonfrontal lesions, and cognitive processes such as the induction of rule-learning strategies also are needed in order to perform well on these tasks. Performance on DA and OA tasks was explored in 10 patients with alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder (Korsakoff&rsquo;s syndrome), 11 abstinent long-term alcoholics, and 13 healthy non-alcoholic controls under each of two rule provision conditions: Alternation Rule and Correction Rule. Results confirmed that rule knowledge is a crucial cognitive component for solving problems such as DA and OA, and therefore, that errors on these tasks are not due to defective response inhibition alone. Further, rule-induction strategies were helpful to Korsakoff patients, despite their poorer performance on the tasks. These results stress the role of multiple cognitive abilities in successful performance on rule induction tasks. Evidence that these cognitive abilities are served by diffusely distributed neural networks should be considered when interpreting behavioral impairments on these tasks.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} anterograde amnesia and atrophy of brain structures involved in memory processing in alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome.  METHODS—The volume of brain structures involved in memory processing was measured with MRI from 13 subjects with Korsakoff's syndrome, 13 subjects with chronic <b>alcoholism</b> without Korsakoff's <b>syndrome,</b> and 13 control subjects. The brain structures analysed were the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the mamillary bodies, the third ventricle, and the thalamus. Brain volumes were correlated with the delayed recall of a verbal learning test.  RESULTS—Compared with subjects with chronic alcoholism and control subjects, subjects with Korsakoff's syndrome had a reduced volume of the hippocampus, the mamillary bodies, and the thalamus, and enlargement of the third ventricle. The impairment of delayed recall correlated with {{the volume of the}} third ventricle (r=− 0. 55, p= 0. 05) in the Korsakoff group.  CONCLUSIONS—Anterograde amnesia in alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome is associated with atrophy of the nuclei in the midline of the thalamus, but not with atrophy of the mamillary bodies, the hippocampus, or the parahippocampal gyrus. ...|$|R
40|$|Steatosis or {{fatty liver}} disease (FLD) is {{characterized}} by the abnormal retention of large vacuoles of neutral fat in the liver cells, either due to <b>alcoholism</b> or metabolic <b>syndrome.</b> Succession of FLD can lead to severe liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis and hepatic inflammation but it is a reversible disease if diagnosed early. Thus, computer-aided diagnostic tools play a very important role in the automated diagnosis of FLD. This paper focuses on the detection of steatosis and classification of steatotic livers from the normal using ultrasound images. The significant information from the image is extracted using GIST descriptor models. Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) integrated with Wilcoxon signed-rank test helps to eliminate the trivial features and provides the distinctive features for qualitative classification. Finally the clinically significant features are fused using classifiers such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), adaBoost, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), naïve Bayes (NB), fuzzy Sugeno (FS), linear and quadratic discriminant analysis classification of normal and abnormal liver images. Results portray that PNN classifier can diagnose FLD with an average classification accuracy of 98 %, 96 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0. 9674 correctl...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveAlcoholism {{has been}} {{associated}} with a widespread pattern of gray matter atrophy. This study sought to investigate the spectrum of volume alterations in a population of alcoholics with only alcohol dependence, polysubstance abusing alcoholics, and a comparison population of healthy controls. MethodThirty-seven ‘pure’ alcoholics, 93 polysubstance abusing alcoholics, and 69 healthy controls underwent structural T 1 MRI scans. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to investigate gray matter alterations. ResultsAlcoholic dependent inpatients (both with and without a history of DSM-IV substance abuse/dependence diagnosis) displayed significant gray matter differences in the mesial region of the frontal lobe and right temporal lobe. ‘Pure’ alcoholics exhibited a pattern of subcortical changes similar to that seen in Wernicke–Korsakoff Syndrome when compared to polysubstance abusing alcoholics. ‘Pure’ alcoholics and polysubstance abusing alcoholics did not differ significantly in measures of cortical gray matter, liver function, or nutrition. ConclusionsThese findings reinforce the accepted literature in regards to frontal lobe gray matter atrophy in alcohol dependence. This study calls for additional research in order to investigate the spectrum from uncomplicated <b>alcoholism</b> to Wernicke–Korsakoff <b>Syndrome.</b> Further research is needed to elucidate the exact cause of this pattern of differences and to determine what factors are responsible for the patterns of gray matter reduction or difference in ‘pure’ and polysubstance abusing alcoholics...|$|R
40|$|Diet {{analysis}} and advice {{for patients with}} tooth wear is potentially the most logical intervention to arrest attrition, erosion and abrasion. It is saliva that protects the teeth against corrosion by the acids which soften enamel and make it susceptible to wear. Thus the lifestyles and diet of patients at risk need to be analysed for sources of acid and reasons for lost salivary protection. Medical conditions which put patients at risk of tooth wear are principally: asthma, bulimia nervosa, caffeine addiction, diabetes mellitus, exercise dehydration, functional depression, gastroesophageal reflux in <b>alcoholism,</b> hypertension and <b>syndromes</b> with salivary hypofunction. The sources of acid are various, but loss of salivary protection is the common theme. In healthy young Australians, soft drinks are {{the main source of}} acid, and exercise dehydration the main reason for loss of salivary protection. In the medically compromised, diet acids and gastroesophageal reflux are the sources, but medications are the main reasons for lost salivary protection. Diet advice for patients with tooth wear must: promote a healthy lifestyle and diet strategy that conserves the teeth by natural means of salivary stimulation; and address the specific needs of the patients 2 ̆ 7 oral and medical conditions. Individualised, patient-empowering erosion WATCH strategies; on Water, Acid, Taste, Calcium and Health, are urgently required to combat the emerging epidemic of tooth wear currently being experienced in westernised societies...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol {{drinking}} is highly prevalent in many cultures {{and contributes to}} the global burden of disease. In fact, it was shown that alcohol constitutes 3. 2 % of all worldwide deaths in the year 2006 and is linked to more than 60 diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis, neuropsychiatric disorders, injuries and foetal alcohol <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Alcoholism,</b> which has been proven {{to have a high}} genetic load, is one potentially fatal consequence of chronic heavy alcohol consumption, and may be {{regarded as one of the}} most prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases afflicting our society today. The aim of the integrated genome research network 'Genetics of Alcohol Addiction' [...] which is a German inter-/trans-disciplinary life science consortium consisting of molecular biologists, behavioural pharmacologists, system biologists with mathematicians, human geneticists and clinicians [...] is to better understand the genetics of alcohol addiction by identifying and validating candidate genes and molecular networks involved in the aetiology of this pathology. For comparison, addictive behaviour to other drugs of abuse (e. g. cocaine) is studied as well. Here, we present an overview of our research consortium, the current state of the art on genetic research in the alcohol field, and list finally several of our recently published research highlights. As a result of our scientific efforts, better insights into the molecular and physiological processes underlying addictive behaviour will be obtained, new targets and target networks in the addicted brain will be defined, and subsequently, novel and individualized treatment strategies for our patients will be delivered...|$|R
40|$|Since 1903, 744 {{cases of}} {{megaloblastic}} anemia {{have been reported}} in Japan: 490 cases of pernicious anemia; 95 cases associated with pregnancy; 66 cases after gastrectomy; 22 cases of megaloblastic anemia of infants; 21 cases of folic acid deficiency other than pregnancy and 19 cases of vitamin B 12 malabsorption after ileal resection. It is generally agreed among hematologists in Japan that pernicious anemia is relatively rare, as in other Asian countries. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia in Japan is usually made by stained marrow films, radioisotopic assay of serum vitamin B 12, Schilling test and good response to vitamin B 12 therapy. Serum folate level, intrinsic factor or its antibody, methylmalonic acid excretion, formiminoglutamic acid excretion and deoxyuridine suppression test are performed only at a small number of laboratories. The drugs of choice are hydroxocobalamin, deoxyadenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin. Cyanocobalamin has nearly disappeared from commercial sources in Japan. Vitamin B 12 administration is common in patients with neurological disorders. Megaloblastic anemia due to folic acid deficiency is extremely rare in Japan. Low serum folate levels are frequently observed among patients receiving anticonvulsants or in pregnant women, but in such samples megaloblastic anemia is almost never detected. The folic acid content of hospital diets indicates that satisfactory amounts of folate are taken in Japan. The intake of folic acid from rice is well over the minimum daily requirement of folate. Other factors in folic acid deficiency, such as food taboos, severe <b>alcoholism</b> and malabsorption <b>syndrome</b> are not frequently found in Japanese. The inadequate intake of folate was the critical factor in most reported cases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 46) Premenstrual Syndrome is {{a relatively}} new topic for research although it can be assumed the condition has existed since the beginning of human life on earth. Many agree it is an idea whose time has come. This paper is an attempt to contribute to the knowledge and understanding of a subject often considered beyond comprehension. Chapter 1 explains the reasons for a paper on PMS. Chapter 2 delineates the psychological, somatic, and behavioral symptoms. Research on the hormone imbalance theory is cited {{and the role of the}} female hormone progesterone is explored. Credit for research in the field is given, most notably, to British physician, Dr. Katharina Dalton. Because it was not considered a viable illness until recent years, there is little historical data on PMS. Assuming a relationship to attitudes about menstruation, Chapter 3 presents early cultural, societal, and religious dispositions on the subject. It is apparent menstruation and the females experiencing it were viewed negatively. Chapter 4 deals with current attitudes regarding PMS. American businesses lose billions of dollars a year due to <b>alcoholism</b> and premenstrual <b>syndrome,</b> yet only treatment for alcoholic employees has engendered the interest of employers. PMS has been used successfully, in England, as a defense for felonious homocide; as of 1983, however, it had not been attempted in the United States; as a defense, it does not have the support of many women who experience the symptoms. It has been unfavorably alluded to in popular literature, often by males who have little knowledge and understanding of the disease. This attitude is frequently reflected in the male-dominated medical profession as well. Fortunately, help is available for PMS sufferers. It can be treated naturally, through holistic methods, and/or hormonally depending on the severity of the symptoms. Treatment approaches are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 describes the case histories of women whose symptoms were severe enough to damage significant relationships, but who were able to find help. Because so much of what constitutes PMS is cal, the last chapter deals with the implications for mental health professionals. Is a female client more depressed or suicidal around that time of the month? In domestic violence and child abuse cases, is the client less able to cope with her anger during the two week period between ovulation and day one of her menstrual cycle, and are PMS symptoms producing problems at home or at work...|$|R
40|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis {{forms an}} {{integral}} and {{vital part of}} the stress response system. Pituitary ACTH secretion is regulated by two hypothalamic peptides, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), with CRH being the primary mediator in humans. Numerous neuronal circuits within the brain influence the activity of the CRH neurons in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, including endogenous opioid systems. Opioid receptors are widely distributed in the brain but have a particular association with three major neural networks: the sensory, limbic and neuroendocrine systems. Opioidergic agents affect HPA activity in humans and animals, al though important species differences exist. In vitro and in vivo studies provide considerable evidence for a centrally mediated effect of opioidergic agents on the HPA axis, most likely by direct action on the hypothalamus. Naloxone is a competitive antagonist at multiple opioid receptor subtypes. Clinical investigations utilizing naloxone administration in humans have had three primary aims: 1) to elucidate the role of endogenous opioid systems in the normal physiology of the HPA axis; 2) to study the pathophysiology of disorders associated with or caused by dysfunction of the HPA axis; 3) to develop new diagnostic tests. High doses of naloxone stimulate the human HPA ards causing rises in plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations. Pharmacological stud ies strongly suggest that naloxone blocks a tonic inhibitory effect of endogenous opioids on central alpha-adrenergic pathways, which in turn stimulate ACTH secretion via CRH release from the hypothalamus. Therefore, the naloxone test provides a means of evaluating hypothalamic CRH reserve and assesses the integrity of the entire HPA axis. Several disorders are associated with dysregulation of the HPA axis including major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, <b>alcoholism,</b> chronic fatigue <b>syndrome,</b> Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome, and obesity. Major depression is a condition often associated with clinical and biochemical evidence of hypercortisolism (pseudo-Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome) and may be very difficult to distinguish from patients with true Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome. Patients with pseudo-Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome are postulated to have hypersecretion of hypothalamic CRH producing an upregulation of an otherwise normal HPA axis. Patients with major depression have an ACTH hyperresponse to naloxone compared with healthy subjects and patients with Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s disease. This increased ACTH response is further exaggerated by combining naloxone administration with the direct corticotrope stimulation provided by exogenous AVP. The naloxone test also has potential diagnostic utility-when central adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Naloxone applies a specific pharmacological stimulus at the hypothalamic level, therefore a normal ACTH and cortisol response implies functional integrity of all three components of the HPA axis. Preliminary studies comparing naloxone administration with the insulin hypoglycemia and metyrapone tests are promising. The naloxone test may provide an alternative in patients with suspected central adrenal insufficiency who are unable to undergo an insulin hypoglycemia test or a metyrapone test because of safety issues...|$|R
