Amino acid analysis of the basic protein showed that the molecule {{is characterized by a}} high lysine and gluta-mate content, a low tryptophan and methionine content, and by the absence of proline, hydroxyproline, and cysteine. The molecule has a total of 326 amino acid residues and a minimal molecular weight of 37, 905. These data confirm previously published investigations by M#{ 225 }nyaiet a!. (1965) on the amino acid composition of the basic protein extracted from the seminal vesicle secretion of the rat. An analysis of the washed coagulum formed by the acetone <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> Cowper’s <b>gland</b> secretion yielded an entirely similar amino acid pattern and molecular weight when the clotted protein was compared to substrate. In a series of experiments, the secretion <b>of</b> the coagulating <b>gland</b> was shown to potentiate the coagulating reaction between Cowper’s gland secretion extract and the basic substrate from the seminal vesicles. It was concluded that (a) both Cowper’s and coagulating gland secretion clot the same seminal vesicle substrate and (b) that this substrate is the basic protein fraction of seminal vesicle secretion. In the rat, a substrate extracted from the secretion of the seminal vesicles, which co-agulates under the action of vesiculase, an enzyme secreted by the coagulating glands, has been isolated and identified chemically as a basic protein (M#{ 225 }nyai, 1964).

40|$|ABSTRACT The crude <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> venom <b>glands</b> <b>of</b> the polychaete annelid Glycera convoluta {{triggers}} a large Ca t+-dependent acetylcholine release from both frog motor nerve terminals and Torpedo electric organ synaptosomes. This extract was partially purified by Concanavalin A affinity chromatography. The biological activity was correlated in both preparations to a 300, 000 -dalton band, {{as shown by}} gel electrophoresis. This confirmed previous determinations obtained with chromatographic methods. This glycoprotein binds to presynaptic but not postsynaptic plasma membranes isolated from Torpedo electric organ. Pretreatment of intact synaptosomes by pronase abolished both the binding and the venom-induced acetylcholine release without impairing the high K+-induced acetylcholine release. Pretreatment of nerve terminal membranes by Concanavalin A similarly prevented the binding and the biological response. Binding to Torpedo membranes was still observed {{in the presence of}} EGTA. An antiserum directed to venom glycoproteins inhibited the neurotoxin so we could directly follow its binding to the presynaptic membrane.
