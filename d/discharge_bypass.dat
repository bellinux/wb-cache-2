The bypasses were located 6 inlet diameters downstream of the inlet and were designed to <b>discharge</b> the <b>bypass</b> mass flow outward from the body axis. The inlet was designed to attain a mass-flow ratio of unity at a Mach number of 2. 0. It is shown that <b>discharging</b> the <b>bypass</b> mass flow outward from the body nearly doubles the critical drag of a similar configuration but with <b>bypass</b> <b>discharge</b> in an axial direction. As {{a result of this}} greater drag, the net force on the model in the flight direction is reduced when comparison is made with the axial discharge case. The lift and pitching-moment coefficients are slightly higher than those for a configuration without bypasses. Approximately 25 % of the maximum inlet mass flow was <b>discharged</b> through the <b>bypasses,</b> and the pressure-recovery and mass-flow characteristics were in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of an investigation of a similar configuration with axial discharge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{lube oil}} {{separator}} {{is widely used}} in lube oil system of merchant vessel. The lube oil separator functions to purify the lube oil to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the oil separator will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The lube oil separator used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing elements, the separator is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out. After removing the failure, the separator finally is repaired. To prevent similar accident occurring again, some suggestions are presented. Oil Leakage from Water-outlet In {{the operation of the}} lube oil separator working for the main engine, failure warning is emitted,and then lube oil leakage from the water-outlet is found.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} hydrologic studies {{relevant}} to the works engineered {{for the protection of}} the city of Venice (Italy) from major flooding under significant climate change scenarios. Such works foresee the temporary closure of the lagoon surrounding the city to tidal exchanges with the Adriatic Sea in times of sea storm surges via the operation of a set of mobile gates. A general hydrologic model of the 2000 km 2 mainland contributing runoff to the lagoon of Venice is coupled in time and space with a 2 -D finite element model of the relevant tidal hydrodynamics to forecast maximum lagoonal surges in times of closure. We also study the impacts of run-through <b>discharges</b> <b>bypassing</b> the mobile gates and wind setups at time scales comparable to the foreseen closures (from a few to tens of hours). Climate change scenarios are recapitulated by up to + 50 cm relative sea level rises by 2100 (the projected lifetime of the current protection works). Possible flooding of the city due to residual fluxes entering the lagoon during prolonged closures is examined. A probabilistic framework is also proposed for computing the statistics of maximum lagoon rises and stage-rise durations. Our studies suggest the adequacy of the design of temporary closures with respect to flooding and provide methods for general exercises in assessing the impact of regional climate change scenarios...|$|R

A prototype structure, called the surface bypass and collector (SBC), was retrofitted on the powerhouse of Lower Granite Dam and was evaluated annually with biotelemetry and hydroacoustic techniques during the 5 -year life span of the structure (1996 - 2000) to determine the entrance configuration that maximized passage efficiency and minimized forebay residence time. The best tested entrance configuration had maximum inflow (99 m(3) /s) concentrated in a single surface entrance (5 m wide, 8. 5 m deep).

40|$|Abstract: To conciliate the {{hydroelectric}} {{production and}} the restoration and protection plans of migratory species, in particular salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta) and eel (Anguilla anguilla), and more generally the longitudinal continuity for fish species, {{it is necessary to}} avoid or at least reduce damages to fish passing through turbines. The best way to reduce fish mortality would be to install fish-friendly turbines, {{but it is not a}} cost-effective solution on existing installations and in the present state of the art their use is very limited in terms of head and discharge ranges. Transforming conventional intakes into socalled “fish-friendly” ones is therefore considered as one of the most acceptable solutions. We present here the development of criteria for the design and dimensioning of fishfriendly intakes for small hydropower plants in France (up to ≈ 100 m 3 /s until now). These criteria were established from the feedback following the evaluation of existing downstream bypasses in France and abroad, and from hydraulic studies on downscale models. Fish-friendly intakes comprise a trashrack designed to guide fish towards its downstream end and to the entrances of bypasses, through which fish safely reach the tailwater. Criteria concern (1) the clear space between bars to avoid the passage of fish through the trashrack and via turbines, (2) the inclination or angulation of the rack to guide fish towards the bypasses located at its downstream end, (3) the normal velocity through the rack to avoid fish impingement, and (4) the number, positions, dimensions, and <b>discharge</b> of <b>bypasses</b> to collect the fish.

Since the transcritical CO 2 cycle operates at much higher absolute pressures {{as compared to the}} conventional vapor compression cycles, it is necessary to develop new compressors or modify existing ones. In this paper, a novel positive-displacement oil-free CO 2 compressor will be introduced. The compressor’s mechanical linkage system will be described. In addition, preliminary compressor test results will be presented, including volumetric efficiency, overall isentropic efficiency, discharge temperature and mass flow rate. The compressor was designed and manufactured to provide cooling capacities from 10 kW to 100 kW. The novel compressor design introduces a new low-friction drive mechanism. The displacement of the compressor can be mechanically varied while keeping a small constant head clearance. A test stand was constructed to map the compressor efficiency, mass flow rate, power consumption and discharge temperature. The test stand is based on a hot gas bypass design, where parts of the <b>discharged</b> refrigerant flow <b>bypasses</b> the condenser, whereas {{the other part of the}} flow changes phase as it flows through a condenser.

The maximum turbine discharge varied from 20 to 85 m 3 /s and the width of intakes varied from 11 to 30 m depending on the plant.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Retrospective {{comparisons}} of selected patients undergoing off-pump versus conventional on-pump {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting have yielded inconsistent results and raised concerns about completeness of revascularization in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: Two hundred unselected patients referred for elective primary coronary artery bypass grafting {{were randomly assigned to}} undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with an Octopus tissue stabilizer (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) or conventional coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass by a single surgeon. Revascularization intent determined before random assignment was compared with the revascularization performed. All management followed strict, unbiased, criteria-driven protocols. Patients and nonoperative care providers were blinded to surgical group. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar. The number of grafts performed per patient (mean ± SD 3. 39 ± 1. 04 for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, 3. 40 ± 1. 08 for conventional coronary artery bypass grafting) and the index of completeness of revascularization (number of grafts performed/number of grafts intended, 1. 00 ± 0. 18 for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, 1. 01 ± 0. 09 for conventional coronary artery bypass grafting) were similar. Likewise, the index of completeness of revascularization was similar between groups for the lateral wall. Combined hospital and 30 -day mortalities and stroke rates were similar. Postoperative myocardial serum enzyme measures were significantly lower after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, suggesting less myocardial injury. Adjusted postoperative thromboelastogram indices, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio, and platelet levels all showed significantly less coagulopathy after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting received fewer units of blood, were more likely to avoid transfusion altogether, and had a higher hematocrit at <b>discharge.</b> Cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> was an independent predictor of transfusion (odds ratio 2. 42, P =. 0073) by multivariate analysis. More patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were extubated in the operating room and within 4 hours. Postoperative length of stay (in days) was shorter for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (5. 1 ± 6. 5 for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, 6. 1 ± 8. 2 for conventional coronary artery bypass grafting, P =. 005 by Wilcoxon test). One patient (in the conventional coronary artery bypass grafting group) required angioplasty for graft closure within 30 days. Conclusions: When compared with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass, off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting achieved similar completeness of revascularization, similar in-hospital and 30 -day outcomes, shorter length of stay, reduced transfusion requirement, and less myocardial injury.

Resection was performed in 491 patients (one-stage, 483; two-stage, eight), bypass operation in 97, and 23 had exploration alone. The anastomoses of 580 patients with one-stage resection and bypass operations were evaluated. Hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer of continuous absorbable monofilament suture was performed in 304 patients (221 resections and 83 bypasses). A stapled anastomosis was performed on 276 patients (262 resections and 14 bypasses). Following resection, there were 11 (5 per cent) anastomotic leaks in the hand-sewn group and ten (3. 8 per cent) in the stapled anastomosis group (P = 0. 69). Excluding anastomotic leaks, hospital mortality and anastomotic recurrence, stricture occurred in 18 of 172 hand-sewn anastomoses (10. 5 per cent) and in 57 of 195 stapled anastomoses (29. 2 per cent) (P < 0. 001). In patients who had bypass operations there were 12 anastomotic leaks, ten in the hand-sewn group (12. 0 per cent) and two in the stapled anastomosis group (14. 3 per cent). Only two of the <b>discharged</b> patients with <b>bypass</b> developed anastomotic strictures, a low incidence probably because of short survival.

The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F.

Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and <b>discharge</b> valves, a <b>bypass</b> valve around each discharge valve, pipe support hangers, piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant.

The {{goal of the}} study was to provide information on smolt passage that will inform decisions on long-term measures and operations to enhance sluiceway passage and reduce turbine passage to improve smolt survival at the dam. The study addressed one of the main programs dedicated to improving juvenile salmonid survival at The Dalles Dam: Surface Flow Bypass. The study objectives (see below) were met using a combination of hydroacoustic and hydraulic data. The study incorporated fixed-location hydroacoustic methods across the entire powerhouse, with especially intense sampling using multiple split-beam transducers at all sluiceway portals. We did not sample fish passage at the spillway in 2005. In the sluiceway nearfield, we used an acoustic camera to track fish movements. The fish data were interpreted with hydraulic data from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Fish passage data were collected in the framework of an “experiment” using a randomized block design (3 -day treatments; two treatments) to compare two sluiceway operational configurations: Sluice 2 + 5 and Sluice 2 + 19 (six gates open for each configuration). Total project outflow was 76 % of the 10 -year average for spring and 71 % of the 10 -year average for summer.

40|$|The Atlantic salmon {{depend on}} {{successful}} migration between essential habitats in freshwater and the ocean. However, during both downstream and upstream migration the fish encounter natural or manmade obstacles which can block or delay their migration and migration through hydropower turbine can cause severe mortality. This PhD-study has focused the salmon migration challenges, upstream and downstream, based on studies in Norwegian rivers, {{and the results}} are presented in four scientific papers. A study of all the 344 Atlantic salmon fishways in Norway was conducted to investigate the state and function of the fishways and to identify links between passage efficiency and physical characteristics of the construction and the river site. The results showed that 66 % of the Norwegian fishways were passing fish effectively. No correlation was found between fishway functionality and their height, length or technical design. Functional fishways were found at river sites with larger discharge than dysfunctional fishways and efficiency was better among fishways passing man-made obstacles. These findings indicate that fishways in smaller rivers and fishways without supervision and funding from hydropower companies suffer from lack of sufficient attention. While entrance design problems are reported to be a main challenge in many fish pass projects, this was not the same situation among Norwegian fishways. On the other hand, many fishways were not functional because of long time lack of maintenance or damages from physical strain. Downstream migration of juvenile Atlantic salmon past a hydropower intake in a Norwegian river was studied by use of radio tagged fish during three spring seasons. The results showed {{that it was possible to}} create models for both the smolt timing and for the route choice at the intake, where the fish could enter the intake or choose a bypass section. Route choice was controlled by both total river discharge and proportion of <b>discharge</b> in the <b>bypass.</b> Additionally, a model could be developed to describe the effect of strobe lights at the intake. This model demonstrated that more fish chose the bypass when the strobe lights were on during night, while no such effect was found during daytime. Further, a hydropower simulation model was calibrated for the same river. By use of this model, it was shown that river discharge and partition could be optimized to increase bypass migration according to the route choice model. Both reservoir manipulation and manipulation of discharge partition at the intake was simulated and showed that bypass migration could be increased from 20 to 80 % in selected years. The use of models to describe downstream migration represents a useful tool for planning of fish-friendly hydropower production and the methods are most likely applicable to other rivers and regions. In a case study of man-made weirs on a residual flow river reach the delaying impact from the weirs on upstream migration was studied. Adult Atlantic salmon were enumerated in an upstream fish ladder before and after removal of two concrete weirs. The point of time for peak migration was more than one month earlier after the removal, indicating that even small obstacles may imply significant migration delay. Additionally, the weir removal changed the physical habitat from a lake habitat to a riverine habitat. Consequently, a large increase in spawning and subsequent juvenile densities was observed immediately after restoration.
