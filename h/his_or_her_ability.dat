5|$|Sabah (together {{with its}} {{neighbour}} of Sarawak) {{has a certain}} level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary which differentiates it from the West Malaysian Peninsula states. The Yang di-Pertua Negeri sits {{at the top of the}} hierarchy followed by the state legislative assembly and the state cabinet. It is the head of state although its functions are largely ceremonial. The chief minister is the head of government as well the leader of the state cabinet. The legislature is based on the Westminster system and therefore the chief minister is appointed based on <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to command the majority of the state assembly. While local authorities being fully appointed by the state government owing to the suspension of local elections by the federal government. Legislation regarding state elections are within the powers of the federal government and not the state. The assembly meets at the state capital, Kota Kinabalu. Members of the state assembly are elected from 73 constituencies which are delineated by the Election Commission of Malaysia and may not necessarily result in constituencies of same voter population sizes. A general election representatives in the state assembly must be held every five years, when the seats are subject of universal suffrage for all citizens above 21 years of age. Sabah is also represented in the federal parliament by 25 members elected from the same number of constituencies. The present elected state and federal government posts are held by Barisan Nasional (BN), a coalition of parties which includes United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO), Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS), Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA).|$|E
25|$|The {{consequence}} or {{effects of}} one's karma {{can be described}} in two forms: phalas and samskaras. A phala (literally, fruit or result) is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, samskaras are invisible effects, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to be happy or unhappy in this life and future ones. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of samskaras.|$|E
25|$|Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory {{is another}} {{cognitive}} process theory that offers the important concept of self-efficacy for explaining employee's level of motivation relative to workplace tasks or goals. Self-efficacy is an individual's belief in <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to achieve {{results in a}} given scenario. Empirically, studies have shown {{a strong correlation between}} self-efficacy and performance. The concept has been extended to group efficacy, which is a group's belief that it can achieve success with a given task or project.|$|E

25|$|If VBA {{determines that}} a veteran suffers from service-connected PTSD, then they assign a {{disability}} rating, {{expressed as a}} percentage. This disability rating determines the amount of compensation and other disability benefits the VA will provide to the veteran. The disability rating indicates {{the extent to which}} PTSD has deprived the veteran of his or her average earnings capacity. A rating of 0% indicates that a veteran has PTSD but the disorder has not affected <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to work, whereas a 100% rating theoretically means that the veteran is not capable of working at all because of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Disciplinary {{expectations}} {{extend beyond}} the military family. Family members know that their actions and behavior can have {{a direct impact on}} the military service member's career. The consequences of misbehavior for a military brat are generally greater than for civilian children. A military person's career and social identity can be dashed in seconds by a willful or careless child. For example, when a military brat gets in trouble, the authorities may call the parent's Commanding Officer or the Base Commander before, or instead of, calling the brat's parents. If the commanding officer or base commander is contacted, the brat's behavior may {{become a part of the}} military member's record, and adversely affect <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to be promoted or the duty assignments (particularly overseas) that lead to advancement.|$|E

2500|$|Myers' {{question}} on whether employees felt pressured {{to work on}} campaigns did, White agreed, touch on a legitimate public concern. For that reason the Court had {{to determine whether the}} firing was justified nevertheless. White found Gordon's burden on Connick [...] "unduly onerous".

2500|$|Menon {{found that}} the {{resolution}} of the complaint did not hinge on the risk of any impressions made on a fair-minded observer, but on the risk that by descending into the arena the judge may have impaired <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to evaluate and weigh the arguments from both parties, thus causing the trial to be unfair. The judicial function entails judges asking whatever questions are necessary to ensure a thorough understanding of the facts and arguments in order to arrive at a just conclusion. Throughout this process, they must maintain judicial calm and detachment, without assuming the role of counsel. A judge could not take actions [...] "aimed at securing evidence to justify a finding of guilt"; to do so would be to adopt an inquisitorial role, which was at odds with the adversarial process favoured by the common law.|$|E
2500|$|A {{joint will}} {{is a single}} {{document}} executed {{by more than one}} person (typically between spouses), making which has effect in relation to each signatory's property on his or her death (unless he or she revokes (cancels) the will during his or her lifetime). [...] Although a single document, the joint will is a separate distribution of property by each executor (signatory) and will be treated as such on admission to probate. [...] Mutual wills are any two (or more) wills which are mutually binding, such that following the first death the survivor is constrained in <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to dispose of his or her property by the agreement he or she made with the deceased. [...] Historically such wills had an important role in ensuring property passed to children of a marriage rather than a widow or widower's spouse on a remarriage.|$|E

2500|$|The oral {{evaluations}} {{are intended}} to also help the evaluator improve <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to give constructive feedback to other Toastmasters. Learning to give feedback develops many skills, some of which include: effective listening; how to motivate, encourage and support other members; and how to develop and present a short evaluation with minimal preparation. Language is {{an important element of}} effective evaluation and so too is the structure. The structure of a Toastmaster Evaluation might be referred to as the [...] "feedback sandwich," [...] the [...] "PIP" [...] (praise, improve, praise) method, or the [...] "CRC" [...] (commend, recommend, commend) method. [...] One particularly effective technique is to couch a suggestion for improvement as a compliment, as in: [...] "You have an important and powerful message; it deserves to be heard {{in the back of the}} room. [...] Consider increasing your volume when you give your next speech." ...|$|E

[...] The competitor is judged on <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to fit and present the halter horse to its best advantage. [...] The horse is taken through a short pattern where the horse and handler must set up the horse correctly at a standstill and exhibit full control while at a walk, jog, turning and in more advanced classes, pivoting and backing up. [...] Clothing of the handlers tend to parallel that of western pleasure competition. [...] Halters are leather ornamented with silver. [...] Showmanship classes are popular at a wide range of levels, from children who do not yet have the skill or confidence to succeed in riding events, to large and competitive classes {{at the highest levels of}} national show competition.|$|E

To train young equestrians in halter showing techniques, horse showmanship classes (also called Showmanship in hand or youth showmanship), are offered. They are the halter equivalent of equitation, in that the handler, not the horse, is judged on <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>abilities.</b>|$|R

Low (or lowpoint) kicks generally target the thigh just above the knee joint for the purpose of weakening the leg, which serves many purposes such as limiting the opponent's mobility, potentially <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to stand on the leg altogether and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>ability</b> to use it for forceful kicks.|$|E
