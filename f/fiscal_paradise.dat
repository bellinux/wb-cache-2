40|$|Everyone {{has heard}} about {{countries}} such as Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Costa Rica, Guernsey, Cayman, Isle of Man, Vanuatu, Liechtenstein, Switzerland being tax heavens. Who {{would not want to}} pay lower taxes, if not at all? Probably it’s a dream for any person or company to take part from a jurisdiction which does not impose taxes or impose it low. They are not a recent invention of globalization, tax free zones appeared in the same time as commerce, but nowadays they play a much more important role than in the past for finance and commerce worldwide. Tax havens are not necessarily island territories.

40|$|From {{the country}} that imposes a system of trade based on an {{assumption}} of {{the efficiency of the}} markets has at last come a proposal for the regulation of the excesses of fiscal evasion to which specialised ‘dens’ have applied the euphemistic term ‘optimisation’. Will this measure be sufficient to discourage the tempting proposals of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>paradises</b> and restore the balance between the power of states and the forces of financial speculators?

40|$|The main {{advantages}} of <b>fiscal</b> <b>paradises</b> {{result from the}} fact that: some countries do not demand any incometax, on capital plus values, on wealth; other countries have established a tax demand on the related incomes of aterritorial base: if the benefits do not have their source on {{the territory of the}} respective state, there is no income; othercountries still have low taxing rates; certain countries offer specific advantages for specifi c types of companies. The fiscal policy in Romania has been revised repeatedly, having a sinuous and unsteady character and, because of thecreated uncertainties (the high number of exceptions and exemptions) it has been less propitious for the businessenvironment – and although, ironically, a lot of the operated changes and the granted exempts were supposed to havebeen destined to the stimulation of businesses...|$|R
40|$|Taxation {{system is}} a {{necessary}} evil. Almost the entire world admits its utility, but even necessary as it is, the taxation system remains an evil. Fiscal paradises had been born heavily, but they multiplied quickly. In specialization literature, {{as well as in}} juridical and economical literature there are few and modest attempts of analysis of fiscal paradises, although a circumscribing of the area that is covered is not difficult to realize. Every state can be used as fiscal paradises for certain persons on the basis of several taxation agreements that provide an auspicious system for certain types of incomes and investments performed by foreigners in the respective country. There is a multitude of possibilities for the decrease of fiscal overwhelming. A legal possibility is the fiscal scheduling using the offshore companies registered in jurisdictions with <b>fiscal</b> <b>paradise</b> status. Fiscal scheduling through offshore company means the election of that type of company that fits for the purpose and interests of the business. There is also the problem of the election of the best jurisdiction in concordance with the purpose pursued. Fiscal paradises represent the fertile ground for the manipulation of taxation basis of the benefits, through utilization of intermediate transfer prices, having as justifiable basis economical transactions, most of the times simulated transactions. The legality, but most of all the ethics of the techniques used are al least controversial...|$|E
40|$|The present {{financial}} management systems reflects only partially the economic reality {{and they are}} no longer able to act as an instrument for the management. It is absurd that an economy populated by business models based on 21 st century technology to use {{financial management}} systems based mainly on the same principles formalised by Luca Paciolli in 1494. Therefore, one of the causes of the current economic crisis could be the lack of coordination between the evolution of the business models and the development of new financial management models used by companies, state and investors. The present financial management systems facilitate the existence of grey or even black bookkeeping systems, tax evasion with the help of <b>fiscal</b> <b>paradises,</b> and financial shenanigans aiming to optimise, barely illegal, the financial situations. financial management system, information for management, economic crisis, poor coordination, business models...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we intend}} to present an {{in-depth}} comparative analysis of the trade and investment flows between the EU member states and the four strongest emerging countries: Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC), during 2004 - 2009 (1) and beyond. In the EU-BRIC equation, we include for comparison countries like the USA and Japan, and their respective relations with BRIC. The purpose of the paper is {{to contribute to the}} discussion of the integrated issues related to trade and investments, since the EU-BRIC relations represent {{one of the most important}} „pieces” in this „global puzzle”. First, relying on the statistics published by Eurostat, the WTO, the UNCTAD and the national authorities, our study highlights the main trends of the trade and investment flows between the EU and BRIC, in comparison with those of the USA and BRIC or Japan and BRIC. Second, we emphasize the principal factors that contributed to these developments and their economical consequences. For example, the global economical situation, the political decisions, the resource scarcity or the (still) existing <b>fiscal</b> <b>paradises</b> play a major role in the celerity and magnitude of the trade and investment flows. Third, on the basis of the actual data and information, our analysis outlines the perspectives of the EU-BRIC trade and investment relations in the long run. Following this rationale, the paper is structured around three main sections, followed by a summary of the conclusions of the author. trade; FDI flows; FDI stocks; EU- 27; BRIC. ...|$|R
