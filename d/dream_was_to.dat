25|$|In the 1940s, rulers such as Abdullah I of Jordan and Nuri as-Said of Iraq {{sought to}} create an {{expanded}} Arab empire constructed out of the smaller nation-states that had been created in the mandate period. Abdullah's <b>dream</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be king of a Greater Syria while as-Said's dream was for a Fertile Crescent Federation. These aspirations, however, were unpopular and met with suspicion in the countries they sought to conquer. The creation of the Arab League and its insistence on the territorial integrity and respect for sovereignty of each member state, the assassination of Abdullah, and the 14 July Revolution weakened the political feasibility of these ideas.|$|E

25|$|In 1918 Welsh was {{struggling}} with Long Hill and decided he wanted rid of it. Welsh had spent $150,000 on Long Hill, his entire life's earnings, and he {{placed it on the}} market for $20,000 cash as his business was close to collapse. He was still unable to find a buyer. Welsh's <b>dream</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> earn and run a health farm, held since his first days in America; now with his dream in tatters his life began to disintegrate. On 11 October 1919, Welsh was the only diner in a restaurant on 50th and Broadway, when by complete coincidence Harry Pollok walked in. The men became violent, and a fight ensued which ended with Pollok being rushed to the Polyclinic Hospital with half his right ear in an ice bucket. Pollok swore out a warrant against Welsh who was arrested upon complaint that he had bitten his former manager's ear in half. Welsh denied the charges and after Pollok failed to appear to press the charge for a third time, the case was dismissed.|$|E
