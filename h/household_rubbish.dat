5|$|Hyderabad {{produces}} around 4,500tonnes {{of solid}} waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of <b>household</b> <b>rubbish.</b> Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{contribution}} of roof gutters to Aedes aegypti (L.) and Ochlerotatus notoscriptus (Skuse) pupal popu-lations was quantified {{for the first}} time in Cairns, Australia. Concurrent yard and roof surveys yielded an estimated 6, 934 mosquito pupae, comprising four species. Roof gutters were an uncommon but productive source of Ae. aegypti in both wet season (n 11) and dry season (n 2) surveys, producing 52. 6 % and 39. 5 % of the respective populations. First story gutters accounted for 92. 3 % of the positive gutters. Therefore, treatment of roof gutters is a critical element in Ae. aegypti control campaigns during dengue outbreaks. In wet season yards, the largest standing crops of Ae. aegypti occurred in garden accoutrements, discarded <b>household</b> items, and <b>rubbish</b> (36. 4 %, 28. 0 %, and 20. 6 %, respectively). In dry season yards, rubbish produced 79. 6 % of the Ae. aegypti pupae. The number of Ae. aegypti pupae/person was 2. 36 and 0. 59 for the wet and dry season surveys, respectively...|$|R

50|$|There {{were once}} cottages for workmen {{along the banks}} of the Humber west of the railway bridge. Access was via a {{footpath}} that went through a gate at the north-western end of the railway bridge over the Haven or via West Marsh Lane and two wooden gates on either side of the railway line. These cottages were not provided with electricity, water or sanitation facilities. Kerosene lamps, hand pumps and earth toilets were standard. Floors were generally constructed of brick laid directly on the ground and the walls had no damp-proof courses. Cast iron fireplaces, consisting of a coal-fired open grate with a boiler box on one side and an oven on the other, were the sole means of heating and cooking. Disposal of <b>household</b> <b>rubbish</b> and night soil consisted of dumping into the Humber at any convenient tide. A shop stocked with produce through the market boat catered for the immediate needs of the local population, but more substantial purchases required travelling to Barton on Humber, or to New Holland and from there by ferry to Hull. An additional shop, run by a Mrs Dee, was on the Barrow Road; it was a lean-to attached to a house. A coal yard was next to the shop, on the Clew Bridge side of the building, which was first owned by Mr. Dee's, but in the 1930s it was owned by a Clifford Hastings. His coal was delivered by barge along the Haven. In later years he had a further coal yard just south of the station.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many places}} in Switzerland, <b>household</b> <b>rubbish</b> {{disposal}} and collection is charged for. Household refuse (except dangerous and cumbersome items, batteries, sofas, electrical appliances etc.) in theory, {{is only to}} be collected {{if it is in}} bags which either have a payment sticker attached, in official bags with the surcharge paid when the bags are purchased or weighed at central collection bins. However in practice, this is difficult to enforce, for hygiene reasons and difficulty in identifying the perpetrators. However it is a financial incentive to recycle as much as possible, for recycling is usually free of charge or cheaper, albeit not always operated through a door-to-door collection. Swiss health officials and police often open up garbage for which the disposal charge has not been paid. They search for evidence such as old bills which connect the bag to the household/person they originated from. Fines for not paying the disposal fee can now be up to CHF 10'000.- in some municipalities. Again many people are now aware of this and remove their names and details from any documentation disposed of illegally before trashing it, therefore rendering it impossible and futile for health officials to identify where the rubbish is coming from. In fact in some areas the cost of the payment stickers or official rubbish sacks has fallen slightly. However, where this has occurred, an annual taxation on refuse collection has been introduced or reintroduced as it were. In some extraordinary cases, a handful of municipalities have introduced refuse weighing machines and electronic chip-cards which need to be 'topped up' with money, thus enforcing payment for refuse elimination by weight and not volume. Again causing problems for elderly residents who would have to somehow get to the nearest refuse disposal point, possibly having to walk uphill or a significant distance. All such methods are proving unpopular Switzerland-wide, especially, as said, amongst the ageing Swiss nationals who often find it difficult {{to come to grips with}} the ever-imposing technological era. Dumping refuse and household waste inappropriately and/or illegally incurs a heavy fine.|$|E
5000|$|Structurally, the {{building}} is timber-framed and uses a mixture of reclaimed wood and plywood from various sources around Brighton. It has been constructed on foundations of ground granulated blast-furnace slag. [...] The [...] "rather unusual" [...] walls consist of a mixture of waste chalk and clay left over or reclaimed from building sites. [...] These are compressed into rammed earth-style walls using pneumatic equipment—a technique which improves {{the building}}'s energy conservation, because such walls store solar energy for a long time. [...] On the outside the walls are covered with [...] "a scaly surface of rubbery black shingles"—2,000 carpet tiles from an old office building in Brighton. Their fire-retardant, waterproof underlay faces outwards, providing weatherproof cladding and insulation. [...] Their mostly black appearance is varied in places by being laminated with plastic bags in various colours. [...] Between the carpet tiles and the walls themselves, some new material was used: DuPont supplied about 400 sqm sq ft of [...] "breathable membrane", to further weatherproof the building, and [...] "Housewrap" [...] moisture seal. [...] Inside, the walls are laid with reclaimed plasterboard coated with surplus paint from construction sites. [...] The main load-bearing wall is formed of 10 tonnes of compressed chalk spoil from a building site nearby. [...] Throughout the building, {{the space between the}} boarding and the exterior clay and chalk blocks has been filled with <b>household</b> <b>rubbish</b> which will act as insulation.

[...] The cassettes and other media came from the stock of rental shops which were closing down; an aeroplane cleaning company at nearby Gatwick Airport donated most of the toothbrushes, which were provided to First and Business Class passengers and discarded after one use, and some others were provided by Brighton schoolchildren; and the denim came from textile traders (in particular, one company which turned imported jeans into denim shorts by cutting off the legs).|$|E
5000|$|Hood is {{perceived}} to be antagonistic to the Australian Greens, in such policies as providing the right to remove dangerous, sick and dying trees, which the Greens strongly opposed. Hood endorsed weekly garbage collection, in a move the Greens disagreed with because it leads to increases in the amount of <b>household</b> <b>rubbish</b> going to landfill Hood has also been a strong opponent of euthanasia legislation introduced by Steph Key on the basis it fails to provide sufficient corroborative evidence of the desire for suicide apart from the killer as the sole witness, and that the elderly and dying could be pressured into suicide if they felt they became a burden on their family, essentially, that voluntary euthanasia, fortuitously, causes involuntary euthanasia. He also raised the issue that the Greens, who oppose capital punishment, endorse euthanasia. Hood has criticized the high abortion rate, in light of low fertility rates, and has encouraged adoption in lieu. Hood has rejected the scrapping of parliamentary prayer, saying the practice dates back to the establishment of the Westminster system, and that the brief periods were useful for silent reflection. Hood has also rejected legislation to permit the cloning of human embryos, on the basis new technology could create embryonic stem cells without using human embryos and eggs, thereby making the legislation unnecessary. Hood has opposed the decriminalisation of prostitution. which he states is consistent with his Christian feminist position. Hood has also suggested plain-packaged DVD's for content that is restricted by law. Despite being lampooned by the Chaser's War on Everything, in {{that it is necessary to}} have sexual intercourse to have families, Hood denies he has spoken with the Australian Sex Party for a preference deal. Hood has rejected the Greens call to name and shame religious schools which discriminate based on sexual orientation on their web site. Although sometimes failing to block Green legislation, Hood has provided opposition rigor necessary to challenge status quo, including public consultation. The Greens however, sometimes work cooperatively with Family First, for instance in Bob Brown's call for national changes to electoral legislation, following the issue of counterfeit how-to-vote cards by the Australian Labor Party that were passed off as Family First electoral material, in what was also called [...] "unethical, if not illegal" [...] by opposition leader Isobel Redmond. The antagonism was not evident in Hood and the Greens's advocacy of the Adelaide Oval redevelopment. In fact, Parnell has voted in the same way as Hood on several occasions, against both the government and opposition. Nevertheless, Hood has stated that he will never make a preference deal with the Greens, as their core policies are irreconcilable with the positions of Family First.|$|E

40|$|Composting of {{biodegradable}} wastes (<b>household</b> <b>rubbish,</b> organic wastes) {{for use in}} {{the field}} and garden {{is a good way to}} maintain biological activity in the soil and protect the environment. Anyone can produce good quality compost from wastes. The following method using a barrel allows the best possible combination of three key elements: air, humidity, and temperature: Paint the inside of the barrel to prevent it from rusting. Make three holes (1 cm in diameter) around the top third and the bottom third of the barrel, at a distance of 52 cm from each other. Make another hole of 1 cm in the base. Remove the top; it is used as a lid for regulating the composting process when the barrel is filled. As the compost rots, it will shrink in size, and the lid will slide down and close the barrel. Make an opening about 20 cm above the base of the barrel, 65 cm high and 20 cm wide, so that you can check on how the composting is progressing. You should normally keep this opening covered. Place the barrel on a metal tripod stand 25 cm high, so that you can put a vessel underneath to catch any fermented liquid. All that is needed now are the composting materials: 52 kg of sawdust, 1. 7 kg of poultry manure, 2. 5 kg of natural Tilemsi phosphate, and 800 ml of urine. After 45 days, the composting should be well advanced. It is best to work with two or three barrels: the first can be used for an initial compost, which is sieved and put in the second barrel for further composting. The third barrel is used to store ready-to-use compost. There is no need to make holes in the second and third barrels.

40|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence that environmental concerns currently facing {{the modern world}} are, at least partly, due to the unsustainable use of resources in developed countries. In this study, feelings of collective guilt in members of a developed nation, Australia, were investigated as a factor motivating individuals to recycle. Eighty-five participants from North Queensland (24 male, 61 female; aged 17 to 64, M = 24. 16, SD = 8. 42) completed self-report measures of collective guilt, social desirability, social norms, attitudes toward recycling and percentage of <b>household</b> <b>rubbish</b> recycled. As predicted, those accepting more collective guilt {{for the actions of}} their ingroup reported more favourable attitudes toward recycling. However, collective guilt failed to predict actual recycling behaviour. The same was found for social norms in that they predicted attitudes to recycling, but not the amount of rubbish recycled. Attitudes toward recycling were the only successful predictor of the amount of rubbish recycled. This study has demonstrated the role of the emotion of collective guilt and social norms in one environmentally relevant domain. Avenues for future research regarding the implications of collective guilt on ecological behaviour have been discussed...|$|E
