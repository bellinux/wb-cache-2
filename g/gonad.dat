5|$|Nemerteans {{often have}} {{numerous}} temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), forming a row down {{each side of}} the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per <b>gonad,</b> are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, and some of these are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located <b>gonad</b> which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} starfish are gonochorous, there being {{separate}} {{male and female}} individuals. These are usually not distinguishable externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but their sex is apparent when they spawn. Some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing eggs and sperm {{at the same time}} and in a few of these, the same <b>gonad,</b> called an ovotestis, produces both eggs and sperm. Other starfish are sequential hermaphrodites. Protandrous individuals of species like Asterina gibbosa start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older. In some species such as Nepanthia belcheri, a large female can split in half and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough they change back into females.|$|E
50|$|Nepanthia belcheri has a {{variable}} number {{of arms and}} divides by fission in a similar manner. It is a hermaphrodite, some individuals having <b>gonads</b> that function as testes and others <b>gonads</b> that function as ovaries. After fission, the <b>gonads</b> regress and individuals that previously had mature female <b>gonads</b> become masculinized, developing male-type <b>gonads.</b> Many larger individuals provide evidence from the varying lengths of their arms that they have divided by fission on several different occasions.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough sex {{determination}} {{starts in the}} <b>gonads,</b> {{this may not be}} the case for species with temperature {{sex determination}} (TSD). Since temperature affects the whole embryo, extragonadal thermosensitive cells may produce factors that induce gonadal sex determination as a secondary event. To establish if <b>gonads</b> of a species with TSD respond directly to temperature, pairs of <b>gonads</b> were cultured, one at female-promoting temperature (FPT) and the contralateral at male-promoting temperature (MPT). Histological and immunohistochemical detection of SOX 9 revealed that the response to temperature of isolated <b>gonads</b> was similar to that of the <b>gonads</b> of whole embryos. While <b>gonads</b> cultured at MPT maintained SOX 9 expression, it was downregulated in <b>gonads</b> at FPT. Downregulation of SOX 9 took longer in <b>gonads</b> cultured at stage 23 than in <b>gonads</b> cultured at stage 24, suggesting that a developmental clock was already established at the onset of culture. To find out if sex commitment occurs in vitro, <b>gonads</b> were switched from FPT to MPT at different days. Results showed that the ovarian pathway was established after 4 days of culture. The present demonstration that <b>gonads</b> have an autonomous temperature detector that regulates SOX 9 expression provides a useful starting point from which the molecular pathways underlying TSD can be elucidated...|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with <b>gonad</b> development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E
5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per <b>gonad,</b> when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which {{the fate of a}} cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Histological {{analyses}} were conducted of the annual cycle of male <b>gonads</b> of spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus Raf. Although changes in the male <b>gonads</b> throughout the year are clearly evident, they are not uniform in all males. Spiny-cheek crayfish mate mainly in the autumn from September to November. After mating, the <b>gonads</b> of male crayfish {{can be divided into}} two groups according to their histological structure. In the first group there is an abundance of sperm in the <b>gonads,</b> while the testicular tubules in the second group are either empty or contain a small amount of sperm. This division remains until May. In May, the histological picture of the <b>gonads</b> is uniform, and there are either very few or no tubules containing sperm. In June O. limosus males occur in two forms. The histological pictures of first- and second-form male <b>gonads</b> do not differ. However, beginning in July and also in August and September, the <b>gonads</b> of first- and second-form males do differ. First-form male crayfish <b>gonads</b> contain more sperm than those of second-form males. From October onwards, all of the males are first-form, and primarily spermatids and sperm are visible in the <b>gonads.</b> The possibility that the spiny-cheek crayfish mates twice annually, once in autumn and again in spring, is discussed based on changes observed in the histological picture of the <b>gonads...</b>|$|R

25|$|Sea urchins are dioecious, having {{separate}} {{male and}} female sexes, although distinguishing the two is not easy, except for their locations on the sea bottom. Males generally choose elevated and exposed locations, so their milt can be broadcast by sea currents. Females generally choose low-lying locations in sea bottom crevices, presumably so the tiny larvae can have better protection from predators. Indeed, very small sea urchins are found hiding beneath rocks. Regular sea urchins have five gonads, lying underneath the interambulacral regions of the test, while the irregular forms have only four, with the hindmost <b>gonad</b> being absent. Each <b>gonad</b> has a single duct rising from the upper pole to open at a gonopore lying {{in one of the}} genital plates surrounding the anus. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water where fertilization takes place.|$|E

2500|$|During fertilization, {{the sperm}} adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) {{chromosome}} to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic {{sex of the}} embryo. During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are [...] "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive <b>gonads</b> beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The <b>gonads,</b> in a [...] "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male <b>gonads)</b> or ovaries (the female <b>gonads),</b> depending on the consequent events.

5000|$|The {{reproductive}} system {{consists of a}} pair of <b>gonads</b> branching into each ray off a circular genital strand which is along the oral inner surface of the central disc. The <b>gonads</b> look like a feathery collection of tubules. In females there are orange <b>gonads</b> and in males they are whitish.

[...] The gonopores are too small to be seen, and can only be found when the sea stars are spawning.|$|R
25|$|The gonads (ovaries and testicles) {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to radiation. They may be unable to produce gametes following direct exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment. Infertility can be efficiently avoided by sparing at least one <b>gonad</b> from radiation.|$|E
25|$|During {{mammalian}} development, the gonads are {{at first}} capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. In humans, starting at about week 4, the gonadal rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm {{adjacent to the}} developing kidneys. At about week 6, epithelial sex cords develop within the forming testes and incorporate the germ cells as they migrate into the gonads. In males, certain Y chromosome genes, particularly SRY, control development of the male phenotype, including conversion of the early bipotential <b>gonad</b> into testes. In males, the sex cords fully invade the developing gonads.|$|E

40|$|Four {{pairs of}} XX and XY <b>gonads</b> from Nile tilapia were sequenced at four {{developmental}} stages, 5, 30, 90, and 180 days after hatching (dah) using Illumina Hiseq(TM) technology.

Of these, 259 genes {{were found to}} be specifically expressed in XY <b>gonads,</b> and 69 {{were found to be}} specific to XX <b>gonads.</b> Totally, 187 XX- and 1, 358 XY-enhanced genes were identified, and 2, 978 genes were found to be co-expressed in XX and XY <b>gonads.</b> Almost all steroidogenic enzymes, including cyp 19 a 1 a, were up-regulated in XX <b>gonads</b> at 5 dah; but in XY <b>gonads</b> these enzymes, including cyp 11 b 2, were significantly up-regulated at 90 dah, indicating that, at a time critical to sex determination, the XX fish produced estrogen and the XY fish did not produce androgens. The most pronounced expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes was observed at 30 and 90 dah for XX and XY <b>gonads,</b> corresponding to the initiation of germ cell meiosis in the female and male <b>gonads,</b> respectively. Both estrogen and androgen receptors were found to be expressed in XX <b>gonads,</b> but only estrogen receptors were expressed in XY <b>gonads</b> at 5 dah.

25|$|The testes {{begin as}} an {{immigration}} of primordial germ cells into testicular cords along the gonadal ridge in the abdomen {{of the early}} embryo. The interaction of several male genes organizes this developing <b>gonad</b> into a testis rather than an ovary by the second month of gestation. During the 3rd to 5th months, the cells in the testes differentiate into testosterone-producing Leydig cells, and anti-Müllerian hormone-producing Sertoli cells. The germ cells in this environment become fetal spermatogonia. Male external genitalia develop during the 3rd and 4th months of gestation and the fetus continues to grow, develop, and differentiate.|$|E

The pronephros disappears very early; the structural elements of the mesonephros mostly degenerate, but the <b>gonad</b> is developed in their place, with which the Wolffian duct remains as the duct in males, and the Müllerian as that of the female. Some of the tubules of the mesonephros form part of the permanent kidney.|$|E
25|$|Most {{nematode}} {{species are}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals, though some, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are androdioecious, consisting of hermaphrodites and rare males. Both sexes possess one or two tubular gonads. In males, the sperm are produced {{at the end of}} the <b>gonad</b> and migrate along its length as they mature. The testis opens into a relatively wide seminal vesicle and then during intercourse into a glandular and muscular ejaculatory duct associated with the vas deferens and cloaca. In females, the ovaries each open into an oviduct (in hermaphrodites, the eggs enter a spermatheca first) and then a glandular uterus. The uteri both open into a common vulva/ vagina, usually located in the middle of the morphologically ventral surface.|$|E
25|$|The notch {{signaling}} {{mechanism is}} an example of juxtacrine signaling (also known as contact-dependent signaling) in which two adjacent cells must make physical contact in order to communicate. This requirement for direct contact allows for very precise control of cell differentiation during embryonic development. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, two cells of the developing <b>gonad</b> each have an equal chance of terminally differentiating or becoming a uterine precursor cell that continues to divide. The choice of which cell continues to divide is controlled by competition of cell surface signals. One cell will happen to produce more of a cell surface protein that activates the Notch receptor on the adjacent cell. This activates a feedback loop or system that reduces Notch expression in the cell that will differentiate and that increases Notch {{on the surface of the}} cell that continues as a stem cell.|$|E
