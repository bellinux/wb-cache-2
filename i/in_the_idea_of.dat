He tried to {{interest}} {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom and Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing. He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.|$|E

Midway through the season, Scully is diagnosed with terminal cancer, {{a result of her}} previous abduction, and Mulder begins to lose his faith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> extraterrestrials.|$|E
5|$|In high school, Lukather met David Paich and the Porcaro {{brothers}} (Jeff, Steve, and Mike), {{all of whom}} {{eventually became}} members of Toto. Lukather, {{who had been a}} self-taught musician, began taking guitar lessons from Jimmy Wyble. With Wyble, Lukather expanded his knowledge of wider aspects of music, including orchestration. It was during this period in the early 1970s that Lukather became interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> becoming a session musician, a vocation that provided opportunities to play with a variety of famous musicians.|$|E

5|$|The {{figure of}} Hope holds a broken lyre, {{based on an}} ancient Athenian wood and {{tortoiseshell}} lyre then {{on display in the}} British Museum. Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play. She strains to listen {{to the sound of the}} single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a continuity between the visual arts and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Matt Bozon, {{who created}} the game's {{universe}} based on Erin's character, at the beginning, the game was planned for the SNES or PC. He and Erin pitched the game with help from veteran programmer Jimmy Huey, who worked with WayForward at the time. After the completion of Xtreme Sports, Voldi Way, the founder and owner of WayForward, greenlit a Game Boy Color version of the game. As Huey had already built a graphics engine for Xtreme Sports, this engine was adapted to suit Shantaes needs. This allowed the game to showcase rare effects on GBC games, like parallax scrolling and transparency effects. In {{the first four months}} of development, the team created most of the animation, and Huey programmed an art-capturing tool that allowed to take full-colored animation frames, turn them into three-colour chunks and reassemble the whole on the GBC's screen.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1942, Gollob {{was made}} Jagdfliegerführer 3, {{responsible}} for tactical fighter command over northwestern France. Jagdfliegerführer 3 was renamed Jagdfliegerführer 5 (Jafü5—5th Fighter Pilot Leader) on 6 September 1943. In this command position, {{he was promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 20 April 1943, effective as of 1 April, and to Oberst on 1 May 1944. When he became Jafü5 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the 5. Jagd-Division (5th Fighter Division) about the suitability of the Bf109 on the Western Front. He indicated that in its present state the Bf109G-3 to G-6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw190 and Bf109 were inferior to enemy aircraft. Learning about the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-powered aircraft, Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft. Hitler had become interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using the Me262 in a fighter-bomber role, which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for operational readiness as an interceptor.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E
