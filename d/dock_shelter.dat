50|$|There are two {{suspected}} {{variants of}} the Type 093. One, {{as noted above}} is the Type 093G, the cruise missile variant. This and the fast attack variant, {{might be able to}} launch the YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missile and a naval version of the DF-10 long-range land-attack cruise missile. The second variant is the Type 093A, which will be or are the third and subsequent three boats. These are stretched versions of the two original Shang-class boats: possibly in an attempt to accommodate a Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>Shelter</b> for special forces.|$|E
5000|$|... 1996: Construction of new loading <b>dock</b> <b>shelter,</b> {{disabled}} {{access ramp}} and internal refurbishment of post shop area. This work involved the reconfiguration {{of the front}} ground floor bay to provide additional post boxes and loggia/porch and new post shop area in the former mail room. This work involved {{the removal of the}} main entrances to the former postal hall, creation of a new arched entrance at the northwest corner, incorporation of the former postmaster’s office at the northwest corner into the new post shop and incorporation of the former telegraph room into the post box room. Ramps and awnings in the rear yard were also constructed at this time. A skillion roofed side canopy may date from this later period.|$|E

INKEMA specialises in providing integrated solutions for loading and unloading of goods and for access control through industrial doors and <b>dock</b> <b>shelters.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{concrete}} loading <b>dock</b> <b>sheltered</b> by a metal awning {{supported by}} metal posts {{runs along the}} north-west side of the buildings to the Macalister Street yard, from the southern corner of the main building (1929) to the northern corner of the earlier former Tiaro butter factory building. Siding railway tracks from the nearby Kilkivan/Kingaroy line run parallel to the dock.|$|R
50|$|Activities at {{the lake}} include fishing and boating. Lake Glenada RV Resort has their own boat ramp. A public boat ramp, fishing <b>dock</b> and <b>shelter</b> house is on the west side, just off US 27.|$|R
50|$|The Wilson Power and Light Company Ice Plant, later {{known as}} Delta Ice, is a {{historic}} industrial facility at 120 East Broadway in West Memphis, Arkansas. Built in 1930, it is a regionally distinctive brick structure, used for the manufacture and distribution of ice, a critical product that facilitated the shipment of perishable goods prior to the advent of refrigerated trucks. Its front facade is dominated by a loading <b>dock,</b> <b>sheltered</b> by a corrugated metal awning. The main decorative feature of the building is its parapet, formed of brick and cast stone. The interior retains original features, such as large 40-gallon vats which were used to produce 300-pound blocks of ice.|$|R
50|$|Inshore powerboat {{racing is}} a form of {{water-based}} motorsport using powerboats in sheltered or inland stretches of water, including lakes, rivers, <b>docks</b> and <b>sheltered</b> bays. It {{is often referred to as}} circuit powerboat racing because of the frequency of inshore races to use the format of a circuit loop, around which boats race for a number of pre-determined laps.|$|R
5|$|The camp {{still stands}} today, with his cabin, a guest cabin, a chickee <b>shelter,</b> <b>docks,</b> a boathouse, and {{assorted}} cages from his zoo. There are also fruit trees that he planted, including surinam cherry, Java plum and wild almond.|$|R
50|$|The Formula 1 Powerboat World Championship (also F1) is an {{international}} motorboat racing competition for powerboats organised by the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM) and promoted by H2O Racing, hence it often being referred to as F1H2O. It is the highest class of inshore powerboat racing in the world, and as such, with it sharing the title of F1, is similar to Formula One car racing. Each race lasts approximately 45 minutes following a circuit marked out in a selected stretch of water, usually a lake, river, <b>dock,</b> or <b>sheltered</b> bay.|$|R
50|$|On {{the north}} side lies a <b>sheltered</b> <b>dock</b> and beach, {{frequently}} utilized as a recreation area for the local population and tourists. The dock is accessible by water taxi from nearby Kragerø, Valle (in Bamble) or Langesund, or by private vessel. The central settlement is reachable from the dock by a dirt path.|$|R
50|$|Tidmouth Harbour (aka, Tidmouth <b>Docks)</b> is a <b>sheltered</b> {{dockyard}} harbour (and one of {{the busiest}} and prominent ports in Sodor's Industry), located close to the sea and has an extensive railway system, connecting with The Main Line. The Flying Kipper usually begins its journeys from here {{to other parts of the}} Island.|$|R
50|$|Johnsons <b>Dock</b> is a <b>sheltered</b> 500 m wide cove {{indenting}} for 900 m {{the northwest}} coast of Hurd Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. It {{is part of}} South Bay entered north of Ballester Point. Surmounted by Charrúa Ridge on the northeast. The cove was frequented by early 19th century sealers.|$|R
5000|$|Hakahau is {{the main}} village and port of the island of Ua Pou, in the Marquesas Islands, {{northeast}} of French Polynesia. It is {{the capital of the}} municipality. It is located {{at the bottom of a}} sheltered bay on the northeast side of the island, and has a <b>sheltered</b> <b>dock</b> by a jetty. The Aranui 3 stops at Hakahau.|$|R
5000|$|A pack {{station is}} {{the base of}} {{operations}} for transporting freight via pack animals in areas that do not allow for other forms transportation, either due to difficult access or use restrictions as defined in Wilderness Act. The station facilitates the transition from mechanized transportation to pack animals, and necessarily includes a corral for the animals and sometimes a stock loading ramp. In some places {{there may also be}} a barn or other structure to house feed and tack, and a loading <b>dock</b> or <b>shelter</b> for the items to be transported. In locations on private land, there may be a business office on site.|$|R
50|$|Moline New City Lake {{is located}} in the scenic Osage Questas region in {{southeast}} Kansas just one mile north of Moline. Native tall grass prairie comprises most of the lake's 4,742 acre drainage basin and helps maintain the average 36 inches of water transparency. The lake is located one and one-half miles north of the city of Moline. Construction of the lake was completed on February 18, 1983 for the purposes of flood control, civic water supply, and recreation. The city of Moline still uses the lake as its primary water supply. The 185 acre lake is surrounded by 257 acres of city owned and managed property. Improvements at the lake include a paved boat ramp, boat loading <b>dock,</b> five <b>shelter</b> houses, handicapped accessible outhouse, five earthen and rip-rapped fishing piers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} 1850s, {{the output of the}} Fife {{coalfield}} expanded considerably, {{and a great deal of}} the mineral went for export from east coast ports. Chief among these was Burntisland, expanded from its original role as a simple ferryport. Congestion there became a major source of complaint, and late in 1860 a major expansion of the dock facilities was commissioned. A <b>sheltered</b> <b>dock</b> area of 20 acres had been provided at a cost of £10,000.|$|R
5000|$|South Fox Island (...) is 13.89 km2 in area, {{and about}} 5 mi long and 1.5 mi wide. As of 2001, David V. Johnson also owned {{about two-thirds of}} South Fox. The other third was owned {{by the state of}} Michigan, {{including}} the two lighthouses on the southern tip of the island. There is no ferry service to South Fox, and it has no <b>docks,</b> fuel or <b>sheltered</b> harbor. However, a private airport with a 5500 ft private runway can accommodate jet aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The recent discoveries and {{development}} of the Pre-salt reservoir in Brazilian coast require a new logistical model for crew transportation and transhipment to the drilling and oil rigs due to the large distance from coast, harsh environment conditions and large amount of workers to be transported against the actual model adopted considering only transportation by helicopters in order to reduce overall costs. The adoption of a logistic model with maritime transportation in these scenarios could provide several advantages, however there are several challenges from the technical point of view in transhipment between ship-shaped vessels, that could represent a great limitation in terms of operational window. Previous works showed the feasibility of monocolumn platforms with an internal moonpool as a Logistic HUB [1], allowing the boat <b>docking</b> in <b>sheltered</b> conditions. This work shows an overview of the model testing of a semi-submersible with an internal dock and the comparison of the free-surface elevation and RAOs (Response Amplitude Operators) between experimental results and potential flow computations. The tests were performed for 5 headings considering 10 regular, 5 irregular and 1 transient waves under a single draft and 5 different devices to reduce wave energy in the interior region...|$|R
50|$|Upper Sandusky’s {{diversity}} {{is reflected in}} the existence of numerous industries, such as metal toilet partitions at Mills Company; radio-controlled hydraulics at Ohio Power Systems; concrete sawing at San-Con Industries; walk ramps and roll up doors at Todco Door; plastic trim and weatherstrip at Uni-Grip Corporation; machining and machine manufacturing at Design Fabrication; custom conveyor systems and metal fabrication at the Deyco Corporation; glass recycling at Dlubak Glass; special metal cutting tools at Midwest Ohio Tool; loading <b>docks,</b> seals and <b>shelters</b> at Fairborn USA; twin cutting knives at Handy Twine Knife Company; welding and fabrication at Keaton Welding; and interior vehicle trim at M-Tek, Inc. Upper Sandusky recently became the corporate headquarters for the Ithaca Gun Company, a manufacturer of firearms with a new multimillion-dollar manufacturing facility.|$|R
50|$|The {{new company}} {{was created by}} {{railroad}} financier Jay Gould. He had first taken over the Long Branch and Sea Shore Railroad, when it was of no further interest to the Camden and Amboy, and improved it by extending it farther north on Sandy Hook to Horse Shoe Cove. From this base he then acquired the former R&DB. The Horse Shoe Cove <b>dock</b> was more <b>sheltered</b> than Port Monmouth, and its better access to Long Branch made it the preferred route for the combined railroads. Boat service to Port Monmouth was discontinued about 1871. Trains now ran through from Sandy Hook to Long Branch to Eatontown Junction and from there down the NJS main line to southern New Jersey. Some service continued to run on the old NJS route from Port Monmouth via Red Bank to Eatontown.|$|R
25|$|Edgartown is {{well known}} as having {{been one of the}} primary ports for the whaling {{industry}} during the 1800s. Ships {{from all over the world}} would <b>dock</b> in its <b>sheltered</b> bay and captains would build grand mansions for their families with ornate top floor rooms called widow's walks, which overlooked the harbor. A myth developed that wives would watch for months from these tiny rooms, hoping to see the sails of ships that would bring their husbands home from the sea. There is little or no evidence that widow's walks were intended or regularly used for this purpose. They were frequently built around the chimney of the residence, thus creating an easy access route to the structure, allowing the residents of the home to pour sand down burning chimneys in the event of a chimney fire in the hopes of preventing the house from burning down.|$|R
5000|$|Bombing {{intensity}} {{increased in}} the early part of 1941. In February several attacks resulted in multiple casualties, with around 20 people killed. In March major raids took place on the nights of the 13/14, 14/15, and 18/19. The first large attack targeted the River Hull corridor with damage to paint businesses in Stoneferry; the second on St. Andrew's <b>Dock,</b> a public <b>shelter</b> in Bean Street nearby was hit by a parachute mine (also known as [...] "land mines") causing multiple deaths; the third major raid lasted six hours, and resulted in nearly 100 deaths, bombs dropped over a wide area of Hull, concentrated on the River Hull corridor, with many bombs also causing damage west of the river. On 31 March/1 April the city centre was targeted, with predominant use of land mines. From the beginning of March to April bombing resulted in 200 deaths.|$|R
60|$|Jim paced athwart, and his {{footsteps}} {{in the vast}} silence were loud to his own ears, as if echoed by the watchful stars: his eyes, roaming about {{the line of the}} horizon, seemed to gaze hungrily into the unattainable, and did not see the shadow of the coming event. The only shadow on the sea was the shadow of the black smoke pouring heavily from the funnel its immense streamer, whose end was constantly dissolving in the air. Two Malays, silent and almost motionless, steered, one {{on each side of the}} wheel, whose brass rim shone fragmentarily in the oval of light thrown out by the binnacle. Now and then a hand, with black fingers alternately letting go and catching hold of revolving spokes, appeared in the illumined part; the links of wheel-chains ground heavily in the grooves of the barrel. Jim would glance at the compass, would glance around the unattainable horizon, would stretch himself till his joints cracked, with a leisurely twist of the body, in the very excess of well-being; and, as if made audacious by the invincible aspect of the peace, he felt he cared for nothing that could happen to him to the end of his days. From time to time he glanced idly at a chart pegged out with four drawing-pins on a low three-legged table abaft the steering-gear case. The sheet of paper portraying the depths of the sea presented a shiny surface under the light of a bull's-eye lamp lashed to a stanchion, a surface as level and smooth as the glimmering surface of the waters. Parallel rulers with a pair of dividers reposed on it; the ship's position at last noon was marked with a small black cross, and the straight pencil-line drawn firmly as far as Perim figured the course of the ship--the path of souls towards the holy place, the promise of salvation, the reward of eternal life--while the pencil with its sharp end touching the Somali coast lay round and still like a naked ship's spar floating in the pool of a <b>sheltered</b> <b>dock.</b> 'How steady she goes,' thought Jim with wonder, with something like gratitude for this high peace of sea and sky. At such times his thoughts would be full of valorous deeds: he loved these dreams and the success of his imaginary achievements. They were the best parts of life, its secret truth, its hidden reality. They had a gorgeous virility, the charm of vagueness, they passed before him with an heroic tread; they carried his soul away with them and made it drunk with the divine philtre of an unbounded confidence in itself. There was nothing he could not face. He was so pleased with the idea that he smiled, keeping perfunctorily his eyes ahead; and when he happened to glance back he saw the white streak of the wake drawn as straight by the ship's keel upon the sea as the black line drawn by the pencil upon the chart.|$|R
