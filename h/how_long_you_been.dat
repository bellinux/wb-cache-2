[...] With that, the lights go out, and when they turn back on, the man is dead. Torque is contacted by Miles, who angrily tells him [...] "how long it's been man? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> making a mockery of everything?" [...] He then encounters Warden Elroy (James Patrick Stewert), son of the infamous warden Raymond Elroy, who took sadistic pleasure in torturing inmates through manual labor and solitary confinement. Elroy tells Torque the prison has descended into chaos since {{the appearance of the}} malefactors, and asks for help in restoring order. He is able to convince the guards and prisoners to work together, and with Torque's help they are able to escape, although Torque remains behind.|$|E
