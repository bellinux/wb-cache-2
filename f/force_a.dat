5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states {{that it is possible to}} solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white can <b>force</b> <b>a</b> win, or black can <b>force</b> <b>a</b> win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E

The Film Unit aircraft flew directly from Kaafjord to the United Kingdom, and arrived at its home station after a fifteen-and-a-half hour flight; this was the longest operational Lancaster mission of World War II.|$|E

They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to <b>force</b> <b>a</b> deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E

5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight.
