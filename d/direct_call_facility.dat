40|$|The {{problem of}} {{establishing}} and completing a given set of calls {{as early as}} possible is studied for bidirectional and <b>directed</b> <b>calls</b> in various classes of networks.

Approximation algorithms with constant performance ratio are known for many NP–hard variants of call scheduling. ...|$|R
