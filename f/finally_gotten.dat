5|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell and his Indian allies prepared a major offensive. In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition {{came to a halt}} after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Most of the Indians dispersed after learning that the reports of imminent invasion were false, but Caldwell led 300 Indians into Kentucky and delivered a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. After his victory at Blue Licks, Caldwell was ordered to cease operations because the United States and Great Britain were about to make peace. Although General Irvine had <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> permission to lead his own expedition into the Ohio Country, rumors of the peace treaty killed enthusiasm for the undertaking, which never took place. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the final blow in the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Tucker is {{introduced}} as J.T. Hellstrom’s (Thad Luckinbill) employer, while pursuing a business deal with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and beginning {{an affair with}} Jill Abbott (Jess Walton). Tucker secretly gains control of Katherine’s company, Chancellor Industries, after she buys stock in a dummy corporation and at a shareholders' meeting, Tucker reveals that he is Kay's long-lost son, and he was behind a woman named Jojo Glover pretending to be her daughter. After years of planning, Tucker had <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> his revenge on Katherine for giving him away and he begins slowly dismantling Chancellor Industries by selling its subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Katherine's other son, Brock Reynolds (Beau Kazer) advises Tucker {{to get to know}} their mother, but Katherine refuses to accept him, and Tucker is hurt. He hires Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and plans to sell off Chancellor Industries piece by piece, including Jabot Cosmetics. Adam’s father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) wins Jabot in a bidding war; Tucker refuses to hire Jill at Chancellor Industries. Katherine threatens to reveal Tucker's bribing of Alexander Thomas until she begins feeling guilty and backs off; an impressed Tucker puts a hold on the selling of her company. While Katherine and Tucker bond, he asks about his father, Arthur Hendricks (David Hedison), while Jill finds the information on Tucker and runs it in Restless Style magazine. Tucker and Katherine come to an agreement where she gets 51% of Chancellor Industries, but Tucker mistakenly believes Jill and Katherine were working together, and he promises to dismantle the company before their agreement comes into effect. Thanks to Jill, Tucker is investigated by the SEC while he bonds with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who is struggling with letting go of the child she thought was her daughter. Tucker supports her, much to the dismay of her boyfriend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), while he announces his plans to purchase Jabot for himself. Tucker blackmails Katherine into giving him back control of Jabot in exchange for him keeping quiet about Adam giving Victor access to the bids and he offers Ashley the CEO position.|$|E

Classified employees, who had <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> a piece of the pie through collective bargaining, found that there just wasn’t much to go around. Many school programs such as music, art and athletics simply vanished, and classified employees who worked in those programs lost their jobs or were shuffled around. By the late 1980s, schools, parents and even some of the voters who passed Prop.13, were tired of the funding shortfalls.|$|E

[...] "It {{consisted of}} songs {{that were left}} over from before and that they'd <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> around to using. [...] It wasn't really fresh. It was {{a whole bunch of}} songs that had been hanging around for a while. [...] I was really trying to make a country and western album."

500|$|Replay DVD was commended in {{reviews for}} the quality of the disc. DVD Times reports that [...] "Joking Apart looks much sharper than the average {{television}} show on DVD.

[...] The featurette on the series1 set is labelled [...] "a great little feature", with Moffat particularly praised for his contribution. DVD Times identifies [...] "a real sense of friendship and of a real liking for this show" [...] within the commentaries, highlighting that Moffat [...] "sounds really happy... for Joking Apart to have <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> some recognition".|$|E
500|$|Eddie Fournier of The New Hampshire {{reviewed}} Spiritual Machines positively {{but said}} that [...] "The spoken word sections are intriguing, but in a way, they detract from the overall strength of the album, breaking up the momentum created by the powerful 10 songs." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "Overall, Spiritual Machines is a lovely album from start to finish, and even better, it is an album {{that will make you}} wonder." [...] Cheryl Hunter of the Hartford Courant [...] said that [...] "It may sound formulaic, yet Maida's intelligent songwriting and nasally, but forthright vocals make Our Lady Peace more than just another faceless modern rock band." [...] Bartley Kives of Winnipeg Free Press gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying that Our Lady Peace had <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> control of their sound and calling it [...] "easily the finest thing they've ever created." ...|$|E

500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{recording}} for Off the Deep End officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with [...] "Airline Amy". These recording sessions {{marked the first}} time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. [...] The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: [...] "We [...] had a great run with Rick, he’s a terrific guybut I had become more and more of a control freak over the years, and I’d <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> to the point in my recording career where I felt that I could capably hold the reins all by myself." [...] By late 1990 five originals—"Airline Amy," [...] "Trigger Happy", [...] "When I Was Your Age", [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore," [...] and [...] "Waffle King"—were recorded.|$|E
500|$|LucasArts's game {{producer}} Craig Derrick and {{his team}} conceived {{the idea of the}} remake in 2008. After researching the Monkey Island series' history, they decided to make [...] "something fresh and new while staying true to the original", which resulted in the idea of The Secret of Monkey Island remake. The developers tried to leave much of the original design unchanged. Any changes were intended to achieve the level of immersion desired for the original. To that end, they added details like a pirate ship or pirates talking in the background of scenes. While the team considered the SCUMM interface revolutionary at the time, LucasArts community manager Brooks Brown noted that it is incompatible with an analog stick, which most consoles use. The designers made the cursor contextual to the game objects as the primary interface. Brown had considered updating the reference to advertise [...] because Loom was not on the market at the time, but concluded that the game would not be the same if such changes were implemented. Prior to the Special Edition release, however, LucasArts announced that Loom, along with other games from its back catalog, would be made available on Steam. Brown stated that the decision to distribute the game online was because [...] "digital downloads have <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> going".|$|E
500|$|Originating from New Jersey, Angelina {{arrived in}} Genoa City, Wisconsin {{to be with}} her father Angelo. She also wanted to fulfill her new-found dreams of {{becoming}} a recording artist. Her father hired music producer Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) to create her music. However, it was soon evident that she lacked in talent. She developed a crush on Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), which she takes to extreme heights, conning him into a short-lived marriage {{with the help of her}} father. Angelina eventually achieved her musical dream, having released a song entitled [...] "Good Goodbye" [...] which was written and produced by DeGarmo. The song was about how the character evolved into a better person when she left, and detailed her [...] "emotional journey". DeGarmo said that she had <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> rid of her selfish ways and expressed this through music. After a five-month stint on the series, on March 27, 2012, Angelina left Genoa City to further pursue her music career in Los Angeles. Described as [...] "mafia princess" [...] and an alter ego, TV Guide credited her as being comedic relief for the daytime drama. However, Luke Kerr of Zap2it was not receptive of the character's Jersey Shore concept, criticizing the soap opera for it. DeGarmo likened Angelina's transformation to My Fair Lady.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} ranged from mixed to negative. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles [...] "is surely {{one of the}} most intense guys on TV", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were [...] "an odd way to build a mythology: the Big Secret seems to be that people in {{positions}} of power are evil and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea." [...] She gave it [...] "two out of four Expendable Gerbils." [...] io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her [...] "officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler". She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has <b>finally</b> <b>gotten</b> into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E
