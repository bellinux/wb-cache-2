25|$|Craters {{within the}} Kuiper {{quadrangle}} increase in complexity as they increase {{in size from}} simple bowl-shaped craters to complex craters with central peaks to multiringed basins. Kuiper (11° S., 31.5°) is a moderate-size crater with a central peak cluster; Brunelleschi (9° S., 22.5°) exhibits an <b>incomplete</b> <b>ring</b> of peaks; and Rodin (22° N., 18°) is a well-developed double-ringed basin. These three craters are mercurian counterparts in morphology to the lunar craters Copernicus, Compton (or Antoniadi), and Schrödinger. All craters larger than about 35km diameter and basins are filled to some extent with plains materials, and exposed rims of partly buried craters within the basins indicate that the fill is about 700 to 1000 m thick (De Hon and Waskom, 1976).|$|E
500|$|This is {{the first}} and only {{fragment}} to be encountered by the player, at the end of Halos sixth level, [...] "343 Guilty Spark," [...] after the Flood breach containment. He enlists the help of the Master Chief, whom he calls a [...] "Reclaimer," [...] to activate Halo's defenses, neglecting to tell the Master Chief that Halo's [...] "defenses" [...] would cause the destruction of all sentient life in the galaxy. He attempts to stop the Master Chief and Cortana from destroying the Pillar of Autumn, and thereby destroying Halo, but is ultimately thwarted when the ship explodes and destabilizes his ring, causing it to break up. Discovered in the system by the Covenant, Spark, known as an [...] "Oracle" [...] to the Prophets, eventually informs the Covenant Hierarchs of how to activate Installation 05 in Halo 2. In Halo 3, Spark allies with the humans and Elites; since his installation has been destroyed and he has no more orders, Spark decides to help the Master Chief. Leading the Chief across the Ark, Guilty Spark discovers a new, uncompleted Halo, which is being built to replace Installation 04. Guilty Spark is ecstatic, but when Sergeant Johnson prepares to fire the new Halo to stop the Flood—a process that would destroy the <b>incomplete</b> <b>ring</b> and damage the Ark—Spark goes berserk, refusing to let the Reclaimers destroy [...] "his" [...] ring. He is subsequently destroyed by the Master Chief with a Spartan Laser, but Sergeant Johnson is fatally wounded in the fight.|$|E
2500|$|Rembrandt is {{the second}} largest impact basin (crater) on Mercury after Caloris. Its outer boundary, which is called crater rim, is defined by a ring of inward facing scarps and massifs. The {{diameter}} of this ring is — half the diameter of Caloris. The basin is surrounded by blocky impact deposits made from material excavated at depth. The ejecta are mainly observed {{to the north and}} northeast from the basin. The interior of Rembrandt includes two terrain types: hummocky terrain and smooth plains. The former occupies a part of the basin's floor near its northern margin forming an <b>incomplete</b> <b>ring</b> about [...] wide. The latter fill much of the interior of Rembrandt. These two plain types are separated from each other by a ring of massifs, which is about 450km in diameter.

Many of the flows have distinctive morphologies, consisting of long, sinuous ridges with discontinuous central lava channels. The low areas between the ridges (particularly along the volcano's northern flank) show a branching pattern of shallow gullies and channels (valley networks) that likely formed by water runoff.|$|E
