500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E
500|$|... "Hide" [...] was {{the first}} episode Jenna-Louise Coleman filmed as Clara. Cross only had Coleman's five-minute {{audition}} for [...] "Asylum of the Daleks", in which she played a different but mysteriously linked character to work from, and some editing was done to her lines to make her sound less [...] "bitchy". Otherwise, the scripting process was [...] "smooth". The read-through for [...] "Hide" [...] took place on 21 May 2012; filming began three days later, on the 24th. Scenes for the mansion were filmed at Margam Country Park in June. Tyntesfield, a National Trust property near Bristol {{was used as the}} mansion. The scenes in the forest were filmed in the Gethin Forest in Wales, with artificial mist. The Crooked Man's movements were done in reverse and then played forward, to give it an unnatural movement. Director Jamie Payne had Cross's children be [...] "monster consultants" [...] during filming and evaluate if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> enough.|$|E

500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so much is that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell {{attended}} {{junior high}} and high school in Spanaway, Washington and, before owning his first guitar, {{was a member of the}} high school choir which attended many state competitions. In his senior year, Cantrell became choir president, and the quartet sang the national anthem at basketball games and won competitions with the highest marks achievable. Cantrell has cited his interest in dark musical tones as dating back to this period: [...] "In choir we performed a cappella Gregorian chants from the 14th and 15th centuries. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>scary</b> church music." [...] His choir teacher and drama teacher were, early on, his two greatest motivators toward a career in music. When Alice in Chains' first album went gold, Cantrell sent both teachers a gold record.|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give back to you whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why people thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>scary.</b> I've seen it about 200 times and every time I see something I haven't seen before." ...|$|E

The showrunners were very convincing. I’m glad that we all came together and I got to be this character." ...|$|E

But obviously the physical appearance remains; adoptees will still be judged by what they look like and where they were born, and so on.
