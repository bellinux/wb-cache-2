5|$|The {{first round}} was {{broadcast}} February 14, 2011, {{and the second}} round, on February 15, 2011. The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter. Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible. Watson's <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> the Daily Double location was correct. At {{the end of the}} first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 8, Lyon opened fire on the Alice Dean, {{intending}} to destroy or disable the steamers. The men had only ever fired the cannon at celebratory events and were unsure how to aim it properly. Two shots were fired, with the second one hitting the upper deck of the McCombs, passing through the ship and landing near {{a group of men}} on the shore, wounding a Confederate. Just as the shelling began Provost Marshal John Timberlake arrived on the scene from Corydon with a small company of reinforcements and assumed command. Timberlake, who was a colonel in the regular army, believed Morgan's force was small, and decided to spare the steamships and instead shell the massed cavalry. Before the cannon could be re-aimed, the superior Confederate artillery was set up and returned fire from their significantly higher position {{on the opposite side of}} the river. The dense morning fog in the valley obliged the Confederates to <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> their target. Their first shot landed short of the Legion's position, and the second shot landed behind them and leveled the cabin. The Legion defenders set off a third shot that had already been loaded into their cannon, and fled into a nearby forest. As they moved up the ridge and into the woods, they became visible to the Confederate artillery who began to shell the forest. One shot struck a log where two of the defenders had stopped to rest. They were mortally wounded while the rest fled into the forest as the Confederates continued to shell the landing.|$|E

25|$|The {{shortest}} route of 100 miles was via Horns Reef to the SSE, passing {{north of the}} minefields laid by {{both sides in the}} Heligoland Bight. It was this route which Scheer chose despite having to pass the British fleet. Although it was not Jellicoe's best <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> Scheer's actions, he anticipated that the destroyers and cruisers spread out around his fleet would give warning should the German's take this route, and his general course would still allow him to intercept.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a complex}} set of reasons, {{conditions}} in Western Europe began to improve after 700. In that year, the two major powers in western Europe were the Franks in Gaul and the Lombards in Italy. The Lombards had been thoroughly Romanized, and their kingdom was stable and well developed. The Franks, in contrast, were barely any different from their barbarian Germanic ancestors. Their kingdom was weak, hopelessly divided, and ruled by a king who was barely distinguishable from a peasant. Impossible to <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> the time, {{but by the end of}} the century, the Lombardic kingdom would be extinct, while the Frankish kingdom would have nearly reassembled the Western Roman Empire.|$|E

[...] Regardless of Moore's bias against the lower class and Byron's spending time with other boys during his times in Greece, Byron was close to Giraud while the two were together.|$|E

500|$|Mannix felt it {{was nearly}} {{impossible}} for any writer to escape imparting some anthropomorphism in such a novel, as a human must <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> the way an animal's mind may work and what motivations it may have.

500|$|Danny Boyle, the film's director, {{speaking}} on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, [...] " [...] was what Shakespeare used to do. He would {{take some of the}} facts about a man of power and he would <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made {{some of the most beautiful}} things in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{competing}} linguistic {{theories have}} been put forth. Some scholars argue that her name may {{be a combination of}} the Greek sus ("pig") and korax ("crow"). Another rough translation produces the phrase [...] "the Scythian raven", an etymological description of Medea (Batman upon Bartholome, a work which Shakespeare is likely to have used for reference, gives the name Corax for a raven) Also, psychorrhax ("heartbreaker"), may be a play on the Greek word psychoraggia ("death struggle"). One critic searched for a connection to Sycorax's North African heritage, and found a parallel in Shokereth שוקרת, a Hebrew word meaning [...] "deceiver". Another recent idea suggests that, for thematic as well as historical reasons, the name is the reverberant combination of syllables in the name Corax of Syracuse – the oft acknowledged founder of rhetoric and worthy, fictionalised rival of Prospero. An especially odd and early <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> a meaning by one critic was sic or rex, a Latin homophone alluding to Queen Elizabeth's pride.|$|E

500|$|King {{has since}} been {{critical}} of his performance, which he describes as his [...] "most lackluster". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as [...] "probably the odd man out at that point", he stated he [...] "didn't participate as much because of that". [...] Hanneman said: [...] "We go through dry spells sometimes, but {{the good thing about}} having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I <b>guess</b> <b>at</b> that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." [...] King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels [...] vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and [...] "added too much singing". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: [...] "There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else." ...|$|E
