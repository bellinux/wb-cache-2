2500|$|The {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} three regions. The basal region has three cells found within the posterior portion of the midgut. The anterior and superior cavities are formed by the bases of four Malpighian tubules. The superior cavity opens into the lumen of the small intestine.

Sometimes, the larvae secrete a liquid that consists of uric acid, water and salts. These contents are often carried outside by workers and ejected, but colonies under water stress may consume the contents. In the reproductive system, queens release a pheromone that prevents dealation and oogenesis in virgin females; those tested in colonies without a queen begin oocyte development after dealation and take up the egg-laying role. <b>Flight</b> <b>muscle</b> degeneration is initiated by mating and juvenile hormones, and prevented by [...] Histolysis begins with the dissolution of the myofibril and the slow breakdown of the myofilaments.

40|$|Wing {{polymorphism}} is {{a powerful}} model for examining many aspects of adaptation. The wing dimorphic cricket species, Gryllus firmus, consists of a long-winged morph with functional <b>flight</b> <b>muscles</b> {{that is capable of}} flight, and two flightless morphs. One (obligately) flightless morph emerges as an adult with vestigial wings and vestigial <b>flight</b> <b>muscles.</b> The other (plastic) flightless morph emerges with fully-developed wings but later in adulthood histolyzes its <b>flight</b> <b>muscles.</b> Importantly both flightless morphs have substantially increased reproductive output relative to the flight-capable morph. Much is known about the physiological and biochemical differences between the morphs with respect to adaptations for flight versus reproduction. In contrast, {{little is known about the}} molecular genetic basis of these morph-specific adaptations. To address this issue, we assembled a de novo transcriptome of G. firmus using 141. 5 million Illumina reads generated from <b>flight</b> <b>muscles</b> and fat body, two organs that play key roles in flight and reproduction. We used the resulting 34, 411 transcripts as a reference transcriptome for differential gene expression analyses. A comparison of gene expression profiles from functional <b>flight</b> <b>muscles</b> in the flight-capable morph versus histolyzed <b>flight</b> <b>muscles</b> in the plastic flight incapable morph identified a suite of genes involved in respiration that were highly expressed in pink (functional) <b>flight</b> <b>muscles</b> and genes involved in proteolysis highly expressed in the white (histolyzed) <b>flight</b> <b>muscles.</b> A comparison of fat body transcripts from the obligately flightless versus the flight-capable morphs revealed differential expression of genes involved i...|$|R

40|$|In {{asynchronous}} insect <b>flight</b> <b>muscles,</b> stretch activation {{may arise}} from a matching of the helix periodicities of actin target sites to myosin heads and/or a special form of troponin subunit called troponin-H (Tn-H, relative molecular mass 80 X 103), which has so far only {{been found in the}} asynchronous <b>flight</b> <b>muscles</b> of Drosophila (Diptera) and Lethocerus (Hemiptera).

When we compared the mechanics of most of the asynchronous <b>flight</b> <b>muscles</b> used in this study, we found that in the Diptera Ca 2 +-activated tension was much lower at rest length and stretch-activated tension was more highly dependent on muscle length than in other orders of insects. This suggests that, when Tn-H is in the form found in Diptera, it may be able to modulate Ca 2 +-activated and stretch-activated tension. We conclude that Tn-H is not sufficient for stretch-activation, but it may enhance stretch-activation, particularly when it is in the form found in the Diptera...|$|R

50|$|When halteres are {{experimentally}} induced to flap, volleys {{of action}} potentials within the haltere nerve occur in synchrony with the haltere-beat frequency.

When the first set of muscles relaxes and the second set contracts, the thorax is squeezed in the opposite direction, which extends the body vertically and moves the wings downward.

50|$|The strolling {{arthropods}} {{hypothesis was}} a very early hypothesis {{for the evolution of}} discontinuous gas exchange cycles.

This hypothesis was largely dismissed in the 1970s, but has recently gained additional attention. The strolling arthropods hypothesis is supported by evidence that tracheal parasites can substantially limit O2 delivery to the flight muscles of active honeybees. As a result of large populations of tracheal mites, honeybees are unable to reach metabolic rates in <b>flight</b> <b>muscle</b> necessary for flight, and are grounded.|$|E

Although we detect only one gene (in polytene region 76 D) for flightin, this protein has several isoforms (relative gel mobilities, 27 - 30 kD; pls, 4. 6 - 6. 0).

In 1985, Robert K.

Josephson's innovation generalized the work loop technique for wide use among both invertebrate and vertebrate muscle types, profoundly advancing the fields of muscle physiology and comparative biomechanics.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the need}} to fight off other males in order to be more {{successful}} in breeding, male dragonflies have developed extensive flight muscles. The majority of male Plathemis lydia dragonflies body mass is accounted for by <b>flight</b> <b>muscle,</b> {{and is one of the}} highest flight-muscle ratio (FMR, found by flight-muscle mass/body weight) of an animal. Males with smaller FMRs have a slight decrease in mating success when compared to their counterparts. This decrease in success found in males with a smaller FMR can be contributed to a decrease in the ability to compete in aerial contests. However, a tradeoff must be made in order to have a larger FMR. Males that were found to have the highest FMR had the least amount of gut contents, and in turn less fat reserves. This means that the male dragonflies are making a tradeoff between flight ability and longevity, which may affect long-term mating success.|$|E
