50|$|Basic {{sediment}} {{and water}} (BS&W) is a technical specification of certain impurities in crude oil. When extracted from an oil reservoir, the crude oil will contain some {{amount of water}} and suspended solids from the reservoir formation. The particulate matter is known as sediment or mud. The water content can vary greatly from field to field, and may be present in large quantities for older fields, or if oil extraction is enhanced using water injection technology. The bulk {{of the water and}} sediment is usually separated at the field to minimize the quantity that needs to be transported further. The residual content of these unwanted impurities is measured as BS&W. Oil refineries may either buy crude to a certain BS&W specification or may alternatively have initial crude oil dehydration and <b>desalting</b> <b>process</b> units that reduce the BS&W to acceptable limits, or a combination thereof.|$|E

However it is difficult and costly to produce dye products with ultralow impurities, because the desalting performance decreases proportionally as the concentration of salt impurity decreases. Here in this study, an optimized electrodialysis <b>desalting</b> <b>process</b> was proposed to fill the gap. The dye-membrane interactions, fouling mechanism and abatement strategy were carefully investigated and well understood. Long term system performance stability and reasonable process cost are achieved. Nearly all SO 42 - in the feed dye can be removed, and residual [Cl-] is only 130 mg/L (similar to 96 % removal) in the final aqueous dye product (similar to 200 g/L). The overall purification cost is $ 0. 097 /kg as dye solids, which is very economically competitive.

40|$|In {{petroleum}} refineries, {{water is}} used in desalting units to remove the salt contained in crude oil. Typically, 7 % {{of the volume of}} hot crude oil is water, forming a water-and-oil emulsion. The emulsion flows between two electrodes and is subjected to an electric field. The electrical forces promote the coalescence of small droplets of water dispersed in crude oil, and these form bigger droplets. This paper calculates the forces acting on the droplets, highlighting particularly the mechanisms proposed for droplet-droplet coalescence under the influence of an applied electric field. Moreover, a model is developed in order to calculate the displacement speed of the droplets and the time between droplet collisions. Thus, it is possible to simulate and optimize the process by changing the operational variables (temperature, electrical field, and water quantity).

40|$|Given {{increasing}} regional {{water scarcity}} and that {{almost half of}} the world's population lives within 100 km of an ocean, seawater represents a virtually infinite water resource. However, its exploitation is presently limited by the significant specific energy consumption (kWh/m) required by conventional desalination technologies, further exasperated by high unit costs ($/m) and environmental impacts including GHG emissions (g CO-eq/m), organism impingement/entrainment through intakes, and brine disposal through outfalls. This paper explores the state-of-the-art in present seawater desalination practice, emphasizing membrane-based technologies, while identifying future opportunities in step improvements to conventional technologies and development of emerging, potentially disruptive, technologies through advances in material science, process engineering, and system integration.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of Katwe salt lake are briefly discussed. The lake {{is the largest}} of the eight saline lakes in the Katwe-Kikorongo volcanic field and is a major source of salt production in Uganda. Today, salt production at the lake is carried out using traditional and artisanal mining methods. Attempts to mechanize the production of domestic and commercial grade salt at the lake were unsuccessful due to the use of a wrong technology. In this paper, the most common available technologies for salt extraction from brine are described. These are divided into four broad categories, namely thermal, membrane, chemical and hybrid processes. A review {{of the state of the}} art, previous research and developments in these technologies is presented. A detailed analysis of the processes used was done based on studies reported in the literature. From the analysis, it was observed that thermal salt production processes, especially distillation and solar evaporation have the highest share in installed capacities worldwide. Membrane technologies such as Electro-dialysis, Reverse Osmosis and chemical technologies have not found wide application in the commercial salt industry. Electro-dialysis and Reverse Osmosis have been used mainly as pre-concentration processes for subsequent thermal processes.

Research and development efforts were mainly directed towards the control of scale formation on heat transfer tubes by developments and dose rate optimization of scale inhibiting chemicals and adoption of on-line sponge ball cleaning. Other areas of R&D are selection of appropriate construction materials, increase of unit capacity and improvements of the quality and variety of control and instrumentation. The MSF process is an energy intensive process that is associated with high irreversibility. Although coupling the water production with power generation in a dual purpose arrangement reduces the specific fuel energy consumption for water production to around 60 kWh/m 3 which is 50 percent less than that required by single purpose water production desalting plant, it is still much larger than that required by an ideal reversible desalination process. The specific energy consumption of the MSF process can be reduced either by the use of innovative modifications in conventional power cycles and/or by reducing the irreversibility of the MSF process through the improvements in the design and operating features of the distiller.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the sources}} of {{carbonaceous}} aerosol affecting air quality in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is limited, but needed for the development of pollution control strategies. We conducted sampling of PM 2. 5 from April to September, 2012 at various sites in the city, and used a thermo-optical semi-continuous method to quantify the organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations. The average OC and EC concentrations were 4. 7  ±  4. 4 and 2. 1  ±  2. 5  μg  m, respectively, during this period. Both OC and EC concentrations had strong diurnal variations, with peaks at 6 – 8  a. m. and 20 – 22  p. m., attributed to the combined effect of increased vehicle emissions during rush hour and the shallow boundary layer in the early morning and at night. This finding suggests a significant influence of local vehicular emissions on OC and EC. The OC / EC ratio in primary emissions was estimated to be 1. 01, close to documented values for diesel emissions. Estimated primary (POC) and secondary (SOC) organic carbon concentrations were comparable, with average concentrations of 2. 0  ±  2. 4 and 2. 8  ±  3. 4  μg m − 3, respectively. We also collected 24 hour samples of PM 10 onto quartz microfiber filters and analyzed these for an array of metals by ICP-OES. Total OC was correlated with Ca (R 2 of 0. 63), suggesting they may have similar sources. In addition to a ubiquitous dust source, Ca is emitted during <b>desalting</b> <b>processes</b> in the numerous refineries in the region and from cement kilns, suggesting these sources may also contribute to observed OC concentrations in Riyadh. Concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis showed that high OC and EC concentrations were associated with air masses arriving from the Persian Gulf and the region around Baghdad, locations with high densities of oil fields and refineries as well as a large Saudi Arabian cement plant. We further applied positive matrix factorization to the aligned data set of EC, OC and metal concentrations (Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and V). Three factors were derived, and were proposed to be associated with oil combustion, industrial emissions (Pb-based), and a combined source from oil fields, cement production, and local vehicular emissions. The dominant OC and EC source was the combined source, contributing 3. 9  μg m − 3 (80  %) to observed OC and 1. 9  μg m − 3 (92  %) to observed EC...|$|R

Desalination of seawater and the reuse of treated wastewater effluent, which have historically been viewed as undesirable water sources, are increasingly being explored as sources for reducing water consumption. Although the dominant technologies for taking these water sources to potable quality, energy consumption still makes them unsustainable for widespread application. Membrane distillation (MD) is an innovative water purification method that has shown promise as a technology that can address several of these issues. MD is a membrane process that produces very high quality product water. However, similarly to other thermal <b>desalting</b> <b>processes,</b> MD utilizes heat as the dominant source of energy rather than pressure, and can potentially be used to produce water at higher recoveries (and therefore less waste) than is feasible with existing approaches. Another important advantage of MD is that the water separation occurs at modest temperatures (This work is represents an attempt to provide insight into several of these issues. The overarching approach taken throughout this project is the parallel evaluation of ceramic membranes alongside commonly used polymeric (PTFE) membranes. The combined factors of MD being a relatively nascent technology and the fundamental separation mechanism point toward initial real-world applications of MD {{for the treatment of}} high concentration water that may necessitate membranes exposure to harsher thermal and chemical environments. The robust and inert nature of ceramics make them ideal candidates for such application, although their hydrophilic surface do allow for direct implementation in MD. The first phase of this work details the evaluation of several candidate surface treatments for modifying ceramic membranes and shows that aluminum oxide ceramic membranes can be successfully modified with perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane to possess the necessary hydrophobicity for MD application. The effectiveness of the surface treatment in modifying the membrane surface chemistry was assessed using a multitude of analytical approaches, which showed that the modified ceramic surface attained high hydrophobicity and thus are suitable for application of the membranes in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The next phase of research details the development and verification of a model for DCMD performance. The relative membrane performance was compared, with the polymeric membrane consistently outperforming the modified ceramics, which was attributed to a combination of superior thermal and physical membrane characteristics. Beyond attempting to evaluate the performance differences, this model allows the consideration of various operational scenarios, focusing on membrane flux and energy performance as various membrane and operational parameters change to determine conditions that maximize MD performance as well as provide insight critical to develop MD-specific membranes. Finally, membrane performance was evaluated during the treatment water containing various organic foulants as well for the treatment of municipal wastewater. The results showed that the level of fouling was highly dependent on foulant type, with alginate identified as a component that produces severe fouling under all conditions evaluated, and wastewater fouling being relatively minimal. Membrane cleaning solutions were implemented to show that near-complete flux recovery was attainable, and plain deionized water was shown to be as effective as sodium hypochlorite. Dissertatio...|$|R

A recent market survey by the World Resources Institute shows a doubling in desalinated water production every ten years from both seawater and brackish water sources. The production of desalinated water is energy intensive, requiring approximately 3 - 6 kWh per cubic meter of produced desalted water. At current U. S. water use rates, 1 kW of energy capacity per capita (or 1000 MW for every one million people) {{would be required to}} meet water needs with desalted water. The choice of the desalination technology determines the form of energy required: electrical energy for reverse osmosis systems, relatively low quality thermal energy for distillation systems, and both electrical and thermal energy for hybrid systems such as pre-heat RO systems.

Nuclear plants can provide both electrical and thermal energy in an integrated, co-generated fashion to produce a spectrum of energy products including electricity, <b>desalted</b> water, <b>process</b> heat, district heating, and potentially hydrogen generation.

However, at high water recoveries the concentration of mineral salt ions on the feed-side of the membrane may increase to levels that exceed the solubility limits of various sparingly water-soluble mineral salts (e. g., calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, and barium sulfate). The ensuing crystallization of these minerals results in scale build-up that leads to permeate flux decline, shortening of membrane life, and thus a reduction in process efficiency and increased operational cost. Therefore, process strategies must be designed to enhance product water recovery, while reducing the potential for mineral salt scaling. Accordingly, the principal objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of RO desalting of SJV brackish water. The present project focused on a systematic evaluation of: (a) the recovery limits for RO desalination of SJV AD water that are imposed by mineral salt scaling, and (b) the integration of accelerated precipitation (AP) of mineral salts with RO desalting to mitigate scaling and enable high RO recovery. AP treatment would serve to demineralize and desupersaturate the RO primary or secondary feed with respect to mineral salt scalants. In the first phase of the project, a systematic analysis based on multi-electrolyte thermodynamic solubility calculations was carried to determine the recovery limits due to mineral scaling. Subsequently, a detailed theoretical analysis and laboratory bench-scale studies were carried out with field water samples to assess mineral scaling propensity for a number of specific SJV water sources. In the second phase of the study, the integration of accelerated precipitation with RO desalting was investigated as a potential approach to lowering source water scaling propensity to enable enhanced water product water recovery. Analysis of historical water quality data and of recently obtained water field samples, from various locations in the San Joaquin Valley, demonstrated a significant variability of water salinity and scaling propensity with respect to calcite, gypsum, barite, and silica. The above analysis and experimental RO scaling tests suggested that the expected range of product water recovery by RO desalting across the SJV can be {{in the range of}} 50 %- 70 % for most of the sites, with the exception of the ERR site for which a much higher recovery was estimated (in excess of 90 %). The integration of accelerated precipitation with RO desalting was shown to be technically feasible for the range of brackish water quality in the San Joaquin Valley. In this process, the concentrate from primary RO (PRO) desalting would be treated by accelerated precipitation softening (i. e., chemical demineralization) or desupersaturated to lower the scaling propensity of this stream, followed by secondary RO (SRO) desalting. Overall recovery of up to ~ 90 %- 95 % could be achieved at an estimated cost of $ 0. 56 -$ 0. 98 per m 3 product water, with the ACP process accounting for about 15 %- 25 % of the overall water production cost. The present study demonstrated provided a framework for assessing RO recovery limits and thus identifying potential hurdles that should be addressed in pilot studies and ultimately in the design and implementation of large-scale RO <b>desalting</b> <b>processes.</b> It is expected that, the methods developed in the present study for scale characterization, evaluation of accelerated precipitation effectiveness and RO process performance analysis will significantly advance the knowledge base needed to arrive at optimal design and deployment of future RO brackish water desalination strategies for the San Joaquin Valley...|$|R
30|$|We also {{applied the}} non-blocked PMNPs {{to isolate the}} HMOs. As shown in Figure S 8, the non-blocked PMNPs cannot enrich HMOs efficiently. In the MS spectrum, no HMOs' {{characteristic}} peak was detected, except for lactose, since lactose is the most abundant HMOs in human milk. The other peaks were ascribed to the undesired nonspecific interferents. This result indicated that the blocked molecules are also necessary for isolating real samples. To check the detection limit of the PMNPs for isolating real samples, we reduced the human milk amount to 0.1 μL, and applied for blocked PMNPs analysis. The MS spectrum is shown in Figure S 9 in which less HMOs' characteristic peaks were detected, the peaks were ascribed to Lactose (2 [Hex]), [Hex][NeuAc], 2 [Hex][Fuc], 3 [Hex][HexNAc][Fuc], and 3 [Hex][HexNAc] 2 [Fuc], and the other HMOs in low abundance cannot be detected efficiently. When we further reduced the human milk concentration to 0.01 μL (Figure S 10), just the lactose (m/z 381.1) and [Hex][NeuAc] (m/z 453.1) characteristic peaks were detected, and the MS signal appeared in a very low intensity. When we diluted the human milk to a lower concentration (0.001 μL), the MS cannot detect any characteristic peaks. From these results, the blocked PMNPs enable to enrich the high-abundance HMOs from the human milk in very low concentration. In comparison to other separation methods, such as affinity chromatography, PMNPs method can selectively enrich the HMOs in lower concentration, and just need little amount of human milk samples. The tedious <b>desalting</b> and separation <b>process</b> also is also simplified, and the enrichment and analysis can be completed in shorter time.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The preparation and analysis of input and model data was carried out. The importance of the correct technique of data filtering was highlighted with particular focus being emphasised on the removal of outliers in raw data. An important process {{in the use of}} Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models was identified as being the selection of the right input variables. A comparison between using factor analysis and statistical analysis in the selection of inputs and it was observed that the former gave significantly better results. The training and testing phase of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model development was shown to be an important step in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model development. If this phase was wrongly done then the ANN model would not be accurate in its predictions. Optimisation of the ANN model architecture was carried out with the amount of hidden layers, amount of neurons in the hidden layers, the transfer function used and the learning rate identified as key elements in obtaining an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture that gave fast and accurate predictions. Fresh water addition and demulsifier addition were identified as key parameters in the economic performance of the <b>desalting</b> <b>process.</b> Due to a scarcity of water and the high cost of the demulsifier chemical it was important to try and optimise these two input variables thus reducing the cost of operations...|$|E
40|$|Isoguanine (2 -oxo- 6 -amino-guanine), {{a natural}} but {{non-standard}} base, exhibits unique self-association properties compared to its isomer, guanine, {{and results in}} formation of different higher order DNA structures. In this work, the higher order structures formed by oligonucleotides containing guanine repeats or isoguanine repeats after annealing in solutions containing various cations are evaluated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The guanine-containing strand (G 9) consistently formed quadruplexes upon annealing, whereas the isoguanine strand (Ig 9) formed both pentaplexes and quadruplexes depending on the annealing cation. Quadruplex formation with G 9 showed some dependence on {{the identity of the}} cation present during annealing with high relative quadruplex formation detected with six of ten cations. Analogous annealing experiments with Ig 9 resulted in complex formation with all ten cations, and the majority of the resulting complexes were pentaplexes. CD results indicated most of the original complexes survived the <b>desalting</b> <b>process</b> necessary for ESI-MS analysis. In addition, several complexes, especially the pentaplexes, were found to be capable of cation exchange with ammonium ions. Ab initio calculations were conducted for isoguanine tetrads and pentads coordinated with all ten cations to predict the most energetically stable structures of the complexes in the gas phase. The observed preference of forming quadruplexes versus pentaplexes {{as a function of the}} coordinated cation can be interpreted by the calculated reaction energies of both the tetrads and pentads in combination with the distortion energies of tetrads...|$|E

Purified laccase showed two times higher activity after <b>desalting</b> <b>process</b> and 3. 7 to 13. 4 times activity after DEAE chromatography. During immobilizing process, 93. 8 % protein and 100 % of laccase activity were coupled to the supports. Following immobilization, the optimal pH (5. 5) for immobilized laccase was slightly shifted wide pH values (from 5. 0 to 6. 0) {{in the case}} of some supports, and decreased more gradually in alkaline region. Both free and immobilized laccases showed the highest activity at 60 ℃, however, the immobilized enzyme was more resistant to the wide range of temperature (50 ～ 80 ℃). Even at the 90 ℃, treated glass beads and Supp- 1 maintained almost 80 % activity. After 10 days of storage at 4 ℃, the immobilized laccases retained 95 ～ 100 % of its initial activity. It was also more stable during storage at 4 ℃. While, after the same storage time only 34 % the initial activity was retained by the free enzyme. Immobilized laccase on glass supports was retained 85 ～ 90 % activity over 20 days storage, while free enzyme almost zero activity. The immobilized laccases which are more stable and temperature resistant than free enzyme, seem to be more useful...|$|E
40|$|Plasmids are double {{stranded}} circular DNA molecules, mainly {{known as}} vectors for transferring genes. Therefore, plasmids {{have a high}} importance for molecular biology and gene technology respectively. Presently, {{there is a high}} interest to utilize plasmids in gene therapy and DNA vaccination due to their ability to replace or supplement genes. The manufacturing of plasmid DNA is performed using biotechnological processes by cultivation of optimized E. coli strains. The developed three-step purification process begins with an alkaline lysis of bacterial cells and separation of crude impurities and cell debris using two phase extraction. In this study, a systematic screening led to an optimal system comprising 15 % PEG 800 and 20 % potassium phosphate. This system resulted in a plasmid DNA recovery of about 90 % plasmid in the bottom phase, while most of contaminants together with solids (cell precipitate) are separated into the top phase. Partitioning experiments of plasmid DNA and RNA, performed as a function of temperature, pH and PEG molecular weight, showed a close relation between system conditions and partitioning of plasmid DNA. In the investigated two-phase system it was found that changing the temperature from 15 to 20 °C leads to a partitioning of plasmid DNA from top to bottom phase. This could be attributed to the plasmid solubility in the top phase, which is drastically affected by variation of PEG molecular weight and temperature respectively. The assumption is, that differences of solubility are associated with a structural change of plasmid DNA, known as coil-globule transition. After separation of the main contaminants (capturing) and extraction of plasmid DNA into the bottom phase, the plasmid DNA is isolated from the bottom phase using an adsorptive membrane step. The high potassium phosphate concentrations in the bottom phase were exploited in order to facilitate hydrophobic interaction for the adsorption of plasmid DNA on a nylon membrane followed by a subsequent elution using TE-buffer. During this <b>desalting</b> and concentration <b>process,</b> a step recovery of 95 % plasmid DNA and an 85 % reduction of the RNA content could be determined. For a specific depletion of chromosomal DNA and open circular plasmid DNA a third process step was developed, which is based on a sequence comprising denaturation of the nucleic acids present and selective renaturation of supercoiled plasmid DNA followed by selective partitioning in an ATPS. During this procedure, chromosomal and open circular DNA are irreversibly denatured. The drastic change of hydrophobicity enabled the separation from native supercoiled plasmid DNA using the second aqueous two phase system. With this procedure, the fraction of open circular DNA is reduced to 4 - 6 % and of chromosomal DNA to < 1 % together with a supercoiled DNA yield of 90 - 95 %. The complete process for purification of plasmid DNA is thus a combination of a first extraction for the separation of main impurities (capture), followed by desalting step using reversible membrane adsorption and polish step for the removal of chromosomal DNA and open circular plasmids. Consequently, this procedure was applied for the processing of 100 g biomass and compared to the chromatography based purification method established and commercialized by QIAGEN. As a result, comparable recoveries were achieved, whereas the fraction of supercoiled plasmids was slightly higher for the extraction procedure. Regarding the fraction of chromosomal DNA, open circular plasmids and RNA, the targeted specifications were met. A further scale up of the process seems feasible after solving limitations connected with the mechanical process of phase separation. In addition, extraction in small scale by combining extraction with membrane adsorption shows an interesting alternative for mini-preparation of plasmid DNA...|$|R
40|$|The desalted cod {{industry}} needs {{a suitable}} and reliable control system {{to check the}} desalting point of cod {{in order to provide}} a safe and high-quality product. The growth of the industries that are interested in a non-contacting, real-time control, encourages the development of new methods based on low-power radiation, such as dielectric spectroscopy. These techniques use the modification of wave parameters at some specific frequencies to provide information of the compositional characteristics of foods. In this work, cod parallelepipeds were desalted at 5 ºC by immersing them in distilled water for different desalting times (15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours). Dielectric Spectroscopy studies have been performed on cod samples in the frequency range 200 MHz- 20 GHz. The dielectric properties were measured using a coaxial probe (Agilent 85070 E) connected to a Network Analyzer (Agilent E 8362 B) immediately after removing the cod samples from their desalting solutions. After desalting, the cod samples were separated from their desalting solutions and kept in repose for 24 h at 5 ºC after which some of their physical properties were measured. This experimental procedure ensures that those properties have already reached their final values. Good correlations were found between the quality properties of the cod samples (aw, xw, zNaCl and xNaCl) after 24 h and their loss factor (ε”) measured at 10 GHz just before leaving them in repose, showing the feasibility of an in-line control system for cod <b>desalting</b> <b>process</b> at that frequency...|$|E
40|$|When first {{received}} by a refinery, the crude oil usually contains some water, mineral salts, and sediments. The salt appears in different forms, most often times it is dissolved {{in the formation}} water {{that comes with the}} crude i. e. in brine form, but it could also be present as solid crystals, water-insoluble particles of corrosion products or scale and metal-organic compounds such as prophyrins and naphthenates. The amount of salt in the crude can vary typically between 5 to 200 PTB depending on the crude source, API, viscosity and other properties of the crude. For the following reasons, it is of utmost importance {{to reduce the amount of}} salt in the crude before processing the crude in the Crude Distillation Unit and consequently downstream processing units of a refinery. 1. Salt causes corrosion in the equipment. 2. Salt fouls inside the equipment. The fouling problem not only negatively impacts the heat transfer rates in the exchangers and furnace tubes but also affects the hydraulics of the system by increasing the pressure drops and hence requiring more pumping power to the system. Salt also plugs the fractionator trays and causes reduced mass transfer i. e. reduced separation efficiency and therefore need for increased re-boiler/condenser duties. 3. The salt in the crude usually has a source of metallic compounds, which could cause poisoning of catalyst in hydrotreating and other refinery units. Until a few years ago, salt concentrations as high as 10 PTB (1 PTB = 1 lb salt per 1000 bbl crude) was acceptable for desalted crude; However, most of the refineries have adopted more stringent measures for salt content and recent specs only allow 1 PTB in the desalted crude. This would require many existing refineries to improve their desalting units to achieve the tighter salt spec. This study will focus on optimizing the salt removal efficiency of a desalting unit which currently has an existing single-stage desalter. By adding a second stage desalter, the required salt spec in the desalted crude will be met. Also, focus will be on improving the heat integration of the <b>desalting</b> <b>process,</b> and optimization of the desalting temperature to achieve the best operating conditions in the plant after revamp. 1 yea...|$|E
