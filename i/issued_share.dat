The Royal Bank of Scotland Group is now the ultimate holding company of both banks. At that time the entire <b>issued</b> <b>share</b> capital of Lombard North Central Plc was transferred by the bank to the holding company. Ownership of National Westminster Home Loans Limited was passed to the holding company in December 2005; the mortgage portfolio and related funding were transferred back to NatWest in October 2012. In December 2000 the bank transferred National Westminster Life Assurance Limited to RBS Life Investments Limited, effectively establishing the business as {{a joint venture between}} the Group and Norwich Union.|$|E

25|$|Aitken Spence {{became a}} Private Company in 1952. In its centenary year, 1968, it {{appointed}} its first Sri Lankan Chairman, E.L. Van Langenberg. By 1971, as Sri Lanka {{was preparing to}} end British dominion and declare as republic, the company became a wholly Sri Lankan owned entity. In 1972, it began to offer shares to its executives, thereby broad basing its ownership. The Company eventually moved on from this model and in 1983 offered its shares {{to the general public}} on the Colombo Stock Exchange with an <b>issued</b> <b>share</b> capital of Rs. 51 million.|$|E
25|$|The Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Light Railway (Amendment) Order 1974 {{altered the}} capital {{structure}} of the Statutory Company, allowing its <b>issued</b> <b>share</b> capital and borrowings to amount in aggregate to £400,000 (instead of the previously completely inadequate £68,000). On 1 October 1975 the Statutory Company created a further 24,000 new shares, bringing its issued capital up to £75,000 in £1 shares. The PLC subscribed for 23,950 of these new shares and the remaining 50 were acquired by {{a director of the}} Statutory Company in order to bring their holding up to the minimum for directors of 250 shares specified in the 1926 Light Railway Order. Directors' shareholdings in the Statutory Company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the PLC and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that company.|$|E

The two clubs would continue separately for the last few weeks of the 1982–83 campaign, and Thames Valley Royals would begin play {{at the start of the}} 1983–84 League season. Maxwell claimed to have support in principle for this from the Football League. He said that the amalgamated team would ultimately be based at a new stadium to be built somewhere between [...] Oxford and Reading, and that in the meantime home games would alternate between the two old grounds, Elm Park in Reading and the Manor Ground in Oxford, both of which would eventually be sold. The general public learned of the proposed merger in the late afternoon on 16 April, when it was announced [...] by David Coleman on the television show Grandstand following the report of the day's football results.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dividend}} is allocated as a fixed {{amount per}} share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. [...] For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits {{that have not been}} distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders' equity section on the company's balance sheet [...] the same as its <b>issued</b> <b>share</b> capital. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may declare a dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from the fixed schedule dividends. Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.|$|E

50|$|Buckley J, {{writing for}} the Court, held that the new <b>shares</b> <b>issued</b> by the {{directors}} are invalid. The directors violated their duties as directors by <b>issuing</b> <b>shares</b> {{for the purpose of}} preventing the takeover. The power to <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> creates a fiduciary duty and must only be exercised in order to raise capital and not for any other purposes such as to prevent a takeover. The act could not be justified on the basis that the directors honestly believed that {{it would be in the}} best interest of the company. The improper issuance of shares can only be made valid if the decision is ratified by the shareholders at a general meeting, with no votes allowed to the newly <b>issued</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} firms <b>issuing</b> new <b>shares</b> at higher discounts and hence with larger expected dividend increases, use their opportunities for earnings management {{in such a}} way that, by the year of a <b>share</b> <b>issue,</b> they report larger earnings in excess of current dividends than firms that <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> at lower discounts or that do not <b>issue</b> <b>shares</b> at all. These excess earnings are useful to successful issuing firms in that they reinforce the buffer of retained earnings available for future dividend payments, thereby conveying credible information about the firm's ability to meet the expected dividend increase implied by the issue announcement. The empirical findings are consistent with this argument. Earnings management <b>Share</b> <b>issue</b> Dividend policy Market reaction...|$|R
