5|$|Martinique and Guadeloupe {{are also}} home to their own {{distinct}} folk traditions, most influentially including Guadeloupan gwo ka and Martinican tambour and tibwa.

Tambour and ti bwa <b>ensembles</b> are the origin of several important Martinican popular styles, including chouval bwa and biguine, and also exerted an influence on zouk. Lucian folk music features <b>ensembles</b> of fiddle, cuatro, banjo, guitar and chak-chak (a rattle), with the banjo and cuatro being of iconic importance, and recreational, often lyric song forms called jwé.

Sweater or blouse and skirt <b>ensembles,</b> as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952.
