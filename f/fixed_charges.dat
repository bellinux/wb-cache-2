2500|$|Because of the {{differences}} in priority of <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> and floating charges, security documents came to be drafted to contain as many charges expressed to be <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> as possible, and leave as little as possible covered by the floating charge, where it would have secondary priority to the claims of the preferential creditors. [...] A number of judicial decisions gave conflicting interpretations over the characteristics that were definitive of a fixed charge, particularly with reference to charges over book debts (and a fixed charge that did not contain those characteristics would be [...] "recharacterised" [...] as a floating charge). [...] The position was definitively resolved in NatWest v Spectrum Plus Limited when the House of Lords confirmed that a charge over book debts could be a fixed charge, provided that the secured creditor exhibited the necessary degree of control over the proceeds of the book debts. [...] This would normally require that they either be paid into a blocked account, or that they be paid directly to the secured creditor. [...] Any lesser degree of control was not consistent with a fixed charge, and such charges would be construed as floating charges, regardless of what label the parties had given them.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe salt {{rejection}} of membranes with inhomogeneous <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> densities including both symmetric and asymmetric distributions {{has been investigated}} theoretically. The rejection rates for the different <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> distributions, have been calculated by using a standard nanofiltration (NF) model based on the extended Nernst-Planck equation, the local electroneutrality condition and a modified Donnan equation including both steric and electrostatic effects and have been compared with the rejection rate obtained for a homogeneous distribution with the same average <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> concentration. The effects of the ion diffusion coefficients and the pore radius on the membrane rejection have also been investigated for the various <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> distributions. It {{has been shown that}} inhomogeneous <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> distributions may significantly affect the rejection properties of NF membranes. The value of the <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> concentration at the pore inlet plays a major role and high charge densities at the pore inlet tend to increase the salt rejection. Nonetheless, it has also been shown that strong axial gradients of the <b>fixed</b> <b>charge</b> concentration can affect significantly the ion transport within pores...|$|R

2500|$|Electroosmotic flow is {{observed}} when an electric field {{is applied to}} a solution in a capillary that has <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> on its interior wall. [...] Charge is accumulated on the inner surface of a capillary when a buffer solution is placed inside the capillary. [...] In a fused-silica capillary, silanol (Si-OH) groups attached to the interior wall of the capillary are ionized to negatively charged silanoate (Si-O−) groups at pH values greater than three. [...] The ionization of the capillary wall can be enhanced by first running a basic solution, such as NaOH or KOH through the capillary prior to introducing the buffer solution. Attracted to the negatively charged silanoate groups, the positively charged cations of the buffer solution will form two inner layers of cations (called the diffuse double layer or the electrical double layer) on the capillary wall {{as shown in figure}} 4. [...] The first layer {{is referred to as the}} fixed layer because it is held tightly to the silanoate groups. [...] The outer layer, called the mobile layer, is farther from the silanoate groups. [...] The mobile cation layer is pulled in the direction of the negatively charged cathode when an electric field is applied. [...] Since these cations are solvated, the bulk buffer solution migrates with the mobile layer, causing the electroosmotic flow of the buffer solution. Other capillaries including Teflon capillaries also exhibit electroosmotic flow. [...] The EOF of these capillaries is probably the result of adsorption of the electrically charged ions of the buffer onto the capillary walls. The rate of EOF is dependent on the field strength and the charge density of the capillary wall. [...] The wall's charge density is proportional to the pH of the buffer solution. [...] The electroosmotic flow will increase with pH until all of the available silanols lining the wall of the capillary are fully ionized.|$|E
2500|$|Especially as {{automatic}} crystallisation {{ceased to}} make floating charges an effective form of priority, {{the next step}} by businesses was to contract for <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> over every available specific asset, and then take a floating charge over the remainder. It attempted to do this as well over book debts that a company would collect and trade with. In two early cases the courts approved this practice. In Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd it {{was said to be}} done with a stipulation that the charge was [...] "fixed" [...] and the requirement that proceeds be paid into an account held with the lending bank. In Re New Bullas Trading Ltd the Court of Appeal said that a charge could purport to be fixed over uncollected debts, but floating over the proceeds that were collected from the bank's designated account. However the courts overturned these decisions in two leading cases. In Re Brumark Investments Ltd the Privy Council advised that a charge in favour of Westpac bank that purported to separate uncollected debts (where a charge was said to be fixed) and the proceeds (where the charge was said to be floating) could not be deemed separable: the distinction made no commercial sense because the only value in uncollected debts are the proceeds, and so the charge would have to be the same over both. In Re Spectrum Plus Ltd, the House of Lords finally decided that because the hallmark of a floating charge is that a company is free to deal with the charged assets in the ordinary course of business, any charge purported to be [...] "fixed" [...] over book debts kept in any account except one which a bank restricts the use of, must be in substance a floating charge. Lord Scott emphasised that this definition [...] "reflects the mischief that the statutory intervention... was intended to meet and should ensure that preferential creditors continue to enjoy the priority that section 175 of the 1986 Act and its statutory predecessors intended them to have." [...] The decision in Re Spectrum Plus Ltd created a new debate. On the one hand, John Armour argued in response that all categories of preferential would be better off abolished, because in his view businesses would merely be able to contract around the law (even after Re Spectrum Plus Ltd) by arranging loan agreements that have the same effect as security but not in a form caught by the law (giving the examples of invoice discounting or factoring). On the other hand, Roy Goode and Riz Mokal have called for the floating charge simply to be abandoned altogether, {{in the same way as}} was recommended by the Minority of the Loreburn Report in 1906.|$|E
