The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Andorians, Klingons, Romulans, Tholians, Borg, and Tellarites, are also explored further. The season ends with a cliffhanger that sets up the Xindi story arc, set in the Delphic <b>Expanse,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third season.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Ogle Tayloe married Julia Maria Dickinson on November 8, 1824. Although Tayloe {{preferred}} {{to live at}} Windsor, his estate in King George County, Virginia, his wife asked that they move into the city, where she was more comfortable. The house was constructed on Lots 10 and 11 in Square 221. At {{the time of the}} building's construction in 1828, the <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city from 15th Street NW (one block east of the home) to 17th Street NW from the White House north to H Street NW was a flat field bare of trees and shrubs.|$|E

50|$|As <b>the</b> vast {{agricultural}} <b>expanses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Midwest opened up, {{the local}} wheat industry went into decline, {{beginning in the}} decade prior to the Civil War. This breakdown was exacerbated by severe adverse weather in the latter 1850s.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawn in search of her babies.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is defined}} within {{the borders of}} what is the district, {{formerly}} the municipality, of Kota Kinabalu. With an area of 351 square kilometres, it is the smallest but the most populous district in Sabah. It encompasses Tanjung Aru and Kepayan in the south, up to Telipok and Sepanggar in the north. The urban <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city however extends into the district of Penampang on {{the south of the}} city border, which includes the towns of Donggongon and Putatan. The combined area of Kota Kinabalu (district) and the contiguous built up areas in Penampang and Putatan is known as Greater Kota Kinabalu. The district of Penampang has an area of 466 square kilometres, and is administered by Majlis Daerah Penampang (Penampang District Council).|$|E

5|$|Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was {{confined}} to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated the <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated {{the range of the}} bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock paintings in the Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third country which imports the good.|$|E
5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the <b>expanse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E
