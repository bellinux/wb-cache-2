For this purpose each signer has a public key consisting of four integers p, q, g and y, and a private key x that satisfy the following conditions: (i) p is a prime with 2511 <p < 2512; (ii) q is a prime divisor of p — 1 with 2 ’ < q < 2160...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{signature}} {{is one of}} {{the basic}} primitives in cryptography. A common paradigm of obtaining signatures, known as the Fiat-Shamir (FS) paradigm, is to collapse any Σ-protocol (which is 3 -round public-coin honest-verifier zero-knowledge) into a non-interactive scheme with hash functions that are modeled to be random oracles (RO). The <b>Digital</b> <b>Signature</b> <b>Standard</b> (<b>DSS)</b> and Schnorr’s signature schemes are two salient examples following the FS-paradigm. In this work, we present a modified Fiat-Shamir paradigm, named challenge-divided Fiat-Shamir paradigm, which is applicable to a variant of Σ-protocol with divided random challenges. This new paradigm yields a new family of (online/offline efficient) digital signatures from challenge-divided Σ-protocols, including in particular a variant of Schnorr’s signature scheme called challenge-divided Schnorr signature. We then present a formal analysis of the challenge-divided Schnorr signature in the random oracle model. Finally, we give comparisons between the challenge-divided Schnorr signature and DSS and Schnorr’s signature, showing that the newly developed challenge-divided Schnorr signature can enjoy better (online/offline) efficiency (besides provable security in the random oracle model). Of independent interest is a new forking lemma, referred to as divided forking lemma, for dealing with multiple ordered rewinding points in the RO model, which is of independent interest and can be applied to analyzing other cryptographic schemes in the RO model. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{submission}} {{consists of}} three separate parts. Although these parts are technically related, each addresses a different issue in cryptography and can serve as an independent contribution to the standard. Schemes described in this submission {{can play a role}} complementary to those designed in a different approach. A common feature of these schemes is that they all attemp to minimize computational efforts and communication overhead involved in a cryptographic operation. • In Part I, two slightly modified versions of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Signature</b> <b>Standard</b> (<b>DSS)</b> are presented. Both modified signature schemes are more efficient than DSS and admit provable security in the model of Pointcheval and Stern. • This is followed by Part II where two signcryption schemes are described. A major advantage of signcryption schemes is that they fulfill both the functions of digital signature and public key encryption in a single step, and with a cost, both in terms of modular exponentiation and message overhead, significantly smaller than that required by “signature followed by encryption”. • Finally in Part III, a number of compact, non-repudiatable and unforgeable key agreement schemes/protocols are presented. All these protocols are based on the signcryption schemes. The shortened signature, signcryption and key agreement schemes can all be extended to similar schemes on secure elliptic curves. This is outlined in Appendix A. Discussions on the computational efficiency of the schemes are dependent on a techique proposed by Shamir that allows fast computation of the product of multiple exponentials with the same modulo. This technique is briefly described in Appendix B. The submission is based on the following publications whose on-line versions are availabl...|$|E
