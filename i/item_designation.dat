40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) The {{past decade}} has seen a {{significant}} change in business practices within the Federal contracting arena. The changes have created a more business-to-business like contracting methodology, via commercial <b>item</b> <b>designation</b> streamlined procedures, for the conduct of Federal procurements meeting specific criteria defined in statutory authority provided under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA), and the Services Acquisition Reform Act (SARA). The aforementioned legislation allows for the utilization of Simplified Acquisition Procedures for all commercial item designated goods and services up to and including $ 5 million. The legislation was passed in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal contracting processes. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|E
40|$|Third Annual Acquisition Research SymposiumThe {{following}} {{article is}} taken as {{an excerpt from the}} proceedings of the annual Acquisition Research Program. This annual event showcases the research projects funded through the Acquisition Research Program at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate School. Featuring keynote speakers, plenary panels, multiple panel sessions, a student research poster show and social events, the Annual Acquisition Research Symposium offers a candid environment where high-ranking Department of Defense (DoD) officials, industry officials, accomplished faculty and military students are encouraged to collaborate on finding applicable solutions to the challenges facing acquisition policies and processes within the DoD today. By jointly and publicly questioning the norms of industry and academia, the resulting research benefits from myriad perspectives and collaborations which can identify better solutions and practices in acquisition, contract, financial, logistics and program management.

The changes have created a more business-to-business like contracting methodology, via commercial <b>item</b> <b>designation</b> streamlined procedures, for the conduct of Federal procurements meeting specific criteria defined in statutory authority provided under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA), and the Services Acquisition Reform Act (SARA). The aforementioned legislation allows for the utilization of Simplified Acquisition Procedures for all commercial item designated goods and services up to and including $ 5 million. The legislation was passed in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal contracting processes. However, based on informal review of the business decision protocol at many acquisition and contracting centers, {{and as a result of}} similar research conducted in the Fall of 2004, contracting activities may not be effectively utilizing the legislative authority to garner efficiencies and effective service provision that may be possible under the new legislation. Objective: The objective is to determine the extent to which DoD activities are capitalizing on the legislative provisions of FARA, FASA, and SARA, and to make specific recommendations for improving the full utilization of the commercial <b>item</b> <b>designation</b> provisions. This objective is critical to contracting and acquisition commands (as well as those they support) to achieve reduced acquisition lead times, reduce transactional costs, and generally, garner efficiencies and effectiveness not possible without the legislative provisions. The research would: 1) provide an overview of the legislation; 2) investigate current business practices within DoD related to the legislative provisions; 3) analyze and determine the extent to which DoD is capitalizing on the provisions, and; 4) make specific recommendations for better utilizing the legislation to the benefit of DoD...|$|E

The archive gives access to over 323,000 colour images, {{each of which is}} matched with the <b>item’s</b> listed <b>designation</b> architectural description.|$|R
50|$|Cultural Properties are {{classified}} {{according to their}} nature. Items designated as Tangible Cultural Properties (as opposed to Intangible Cultural Properties), cultural products of high historical or artistic value such as structures, paintings, sculptures, handicrafts, calligraphic works, ancient books, historic documents, archeological artifacts and other such items, can later, if they satisfy certain criteria, be designated either Important Cultural Properties or National Treasures (国宝), for especially valuable <b>items.</b> The <b>designation</b> can take place at a city (city designated Important Cultural Property), prefectural (prefecturally designated Important Cultural Property) or national (nationally designated Important Cultural Property) level. In this last case the designating agency is often not specified. Designations of a different level can coexist. For example, Sankei-en, a traditional Japanese-style garden in Naka Ward, Yokohama, owns both city designated and nationally designated Important Cultural Properties.|$|R
2500|$|To protect Japan's {{cultural}} heritage, the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties {{contains a}} [...] under which selected important items are designated as Cultural Properties, which imposes {{restrictions on the}} alteration, repair, and export of such designated objects. Designation can occur at a , [...] or [...] level. As of 1 February 2012, there were approximately 16,000 nationally designated, 21,000 prefecturally designated, and 86,000 municipally designated properties (one property may include more than one <b>item).</b> Besides the <b>designation</b> system there also exists a , which guarantees {{a lower level of}} protection and support.|$|R

40|$|A {{distinction}} is made between visual declaration and virtual usage of artificial items within a physical environment, {{such as a}} street. Visual declaration is a formal pictorial designation, or a function, e. g. “decoration,” of an item, such as a “planter. ” Virtual usage refers to the item when it is used in lieu of another <b>item.</b> The formal <b>designation,</b> “sitting,” customarily designated to an item such as “bench,” {{could also be a}} virtual usage of the item “planter. ” The question asked is, “What is the relationship between items, given their formal, visual declaration and their informal, virtual, usage?” An artificial item, according to its visual declaration, is referred to as a ‘visual’ or ‘real item’. Each visual item has the property of being used as another item by virtue of its undeclared usage. Pending on the item's design and configuration, a visual item can be then substituted for another visual item. An artificial item, thus, attains deliberate ambiguity between its formal designation and its virtual usage. This ambiguity between visual declaration and virtual usage can be quantified. Within the full domain of n possible usages, this relationship can be conveniently presented in a nonnegative matrix. It is shown that the inverse of this matrix belongs to a class of well-known matrices. This being the case, the relationship between visual and virtual properties of items within the environment can be formalized. The formalization throws further light on the emerging opportunities in streetscape design...|$|R
