5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my stomach on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table. Although the flight was very smooth, {{it seemed like the}} movie projector was running the film faster than intended.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose {{and we had a}} camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

6000|$|... "In this tent. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the sand, trying if I {{could make}} it hold enough to build a castle of it, when the curtain was put back, and there thou stoodest, Richard!" ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening when}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my bed outside the cave, I heard {{the tale of}} Anscombe and Heda. Up {{to a certain point}} he told it, then she went on with the story.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad I {{tried to}} look {{pleasant}} when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the board while Ralph did my head, for the pleasantness got into the clay face, and that made the lady like it," [...] said Jill, as she lay resting on the sofa.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a sudden}} silence. I was still left in the darkness; feeling nothing, hearing nothing. Even the {{consciousness}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my bed deserted me. I {{had no idea that}} I was in the bedroom; I had no knowledge of where I was.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard no}} more. Consciousness was blotted {{out by the}} {{darkness}} he had so graphically described, and when I came to myself <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the floor and he was smoking a cigar and regarding me thoughtfully with that old familiar light of curiosity in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|I woke {{with the}} {{consciousness}} of violent wordy warfare carried on around me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and the first things I saw were three or four pairs of feet standing close together. Gradually out of the confused hubbub a few sentences struck my reawakened senses.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Her {{innocent}} reputation {{would be}} ruined, my friend. She would be punished, not he. I have wronged her enough in fact; I have wronged her still more in intention. You recollect what pavement {{is said to}} be made of good intentions. It is made of bad intentions too. Mortimer, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> it, and <b>I</b> know!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! It {{would not}} have been {{voluntary}} on my part, any more than it is voluntary in me to be here now. You draw me to you. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> shut up in a strong prison, you would draw me out. I should break through the wall to come to you. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> a sick bed, you would draw me up--to stagger to your feet and fall there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Trooper Hood, 2nd Scottish Horse: 'While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> wounded <b>on</b> {{the ground}} the Boers {{came up and}} {{stripped}} me of my hat and coat, boots, 15s., and a metal watch. I saw them fire at another wounded man as {{he was coming to}} me for a drink.' ...|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} again my eyes opened upon George. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the sofa, {{still in the}} same room; the lights we had read by in the evening were burning on the table; my son was {{kneeling}} at my pillow, and we two were alone.|$|E
60|$|When I {{recovered}} my consciousness, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> {{the couch}} in my own study. My father was supporting me on the pillow; the doctor had his fingers on my pulse; and a policeman was telling them where he had found me, and how he had brought me home.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Love {{makes us}} hypocrites, I fear, my Ferdinand; for, a moment before, I was so wearied that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my sofa quite wretched. And then, when I saw him, I pretended that I {{had not been}} out, and was just {{thinking}} of a stroll. Oh, my Ferdinand! will you pardon me?' ...|$|E
60|$|After a blank, I {{found that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> unbound, <b>on</b> the floor, {{in the same}} place, with my head on some one's knee. My {{eyes were fixed on}} the ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,--had opened on it before my mind saw it,--and thus as I {{recovered}} consciousness, I knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the place where I had lost it.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Brain. Who {{would have}} thought, that 'nown dear {{would have come}} so soon? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> even <b>lying</b> down <b>on</b> my bed, and dreaming of him. Tum a' me, and buss, poor dear; piddee buss.|$|R
60|$|I {{went into}} the tussock, face first, an inch at a time, my mouth open and my eyes fine, full, and prominent. When I had {{overcome}} {{the resistance of the}} grass I found that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking straight across a black gap in the ground--that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my chest leaning over the mouth of a well so deep I could scarcely see the water in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly, {{as you do}} the picture-book. Well, there I was lying, Miss Baker, with {{my little}} eyes wide open. It is {{astonishing}} how much babies see, though people never calculate on their having eyes at all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my back, staring at the mantelpiece, on which my mother had left her key-basket." ...|$|E
6000|$|She became emphatically pink. [...] "NO," [...] {{she said}} again quite conclusively, and coughed shortly. [...] "Thank you," [...] {{she said to her}} ninth or tenth cake. Beatrice burst into cheerful {{laughter}} with her eye on me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the turf, and this perhaps caused a slight confusion about the primordial curse in Lady Osprey's mind.|$|E
60|$|When I awoke {{again it}} was to find myself in a large room that I did not know. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> a bed, and {{by the light of}} sunrise which {{streamed}} through the window-places I saw the three others, my son Roderick, Orme and Higgs lying on the other beds, but they were still asleep.|$|E
60|$|The frail youngster, swaying like a reed, made a low moaning sound. I {{stopped short}} and {{addressed}} this sufferer with advice. It {{was prompted by}} the sight of a hammer (used for opening the wine-cases, <b>I</b> suppose) which <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the floor.|$|R
5000|$|Spiritual affection {{has long}} been {{documented}} in various lives of the saints. Biographies of Thomas Aquinas, Teresa of Avila, Martin de Porres, Joseph of Cupertino and many others include episodes of spiritual affection witnessed both by others who knew the saint or confessed by the saints themselves in their own writings. In Saint Teresa's Life for instance, she describes what {{has become known as}} the Ecstasy of Saint Theresa: [...] "The loving exchange that takes place between the soul and God is so sweet that I beg Him in His goodness to give a taste of his love to anyone who thinks <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>lying.</b> <b>On</b> the days this lasted I went about as though stupefied. I desired neither to see nor to speak, but to clasp my suffering close to me, for to me it was greater glory than all creation. Sometimes it happened—when the Lord desired—that these raptures were so great that even though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> among people <b>I</b> couldn't resist them; to my deep affliction they began to made public." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know--it seemed {{long enough}} before a most welcome boat appeared, with some men in it, and Triton in an agony. They {{would never have}} found me but for him, for my voice was gone; indeed the next thing <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the grass in the park, and Markham saying, 'Well, sir, if you do wish to throw away your life, let it be for something better worth saving than Farmer Holt's vicious old ram!' ...|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my {{bed in the}} cabin. Elfie was playing with the green flag, and Mary was sitting by me with my hand in hers. One long look of love passed silently from her eyes to mine--from mine to hers. In that look the kindred spirits were united; The Two Destinies were fulfilled.|$|E
60|$|One day in mid-winter, as {{the weather}} was very mild and open, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the rough grass field that I have spoken of which borders a flat stretch of moorland. On this moorland in summer grew tall ferns, but now these had died and been broken down by the wind. Suddenly I woke up from my sleep to see a number of men walking and riding towards me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you that she did," [...] Lady Cynthia insisted. [...] "I never sleep, amongst my other peculiarities," [...] she went on bitterly, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> a couch {{by the side of the}} open window when the car came for her. She stopped it at the bend of the avenue--so that it shouldn't wake us up, I suppose. I saw her get in and drive away." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{opened my}} eyes, I {{found myself in}} the worst fix <b>I</b> had ever <b>been</b> in in my life. I couldn't move my arms or my legs, for my arms were tied fast to my body, at the elbows and wrists, and my feet and my knees <b>were</b> tied together. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> flat <b>on</b> my back, but I could turn my head over to where Rectus' bed stood--it was a small one like mine--and he wasn't there. I sung out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't their body, yer honor. It's their legs. They're just {{cruel to}} look at. It {{was one of}} 'em that gave me a turn, a while ago. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> my bed smoking my pipe, when I {{saw one of the}} creatures (as big as a saucer, I'll take my oath) walking towards me with his wicked eye fixed full on me. I jumped off the bed and on to a bench that stood handy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dreamed that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> awake <b>on</b> my bed, with the moon shining on me; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> cold, and crying bitterly because <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> left so long alone. All at once I saw you {{standing}} {{at my side}} in the moonlight. 'Poor Yoletta,' you said, 'your tears have chilled you like winter rain.' Then you kissed them dry, and when you had put your arms about me, I drew your face against my bosom, and rested warm and happy in your love." ...|$|R
