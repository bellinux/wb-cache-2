40|$|Abstract. In the {{collision}} system Xe-Ag, the thresholds for excitation of quasimolecular L radiation and characteristic Ag L radiation {{have been found}} to lie at about 5 MeV and 1 MeV, respectively. These results are discussed on the basis of ab initio calculations of the screened interaction potential and the electron-correlation diagram. Relativistic Dirac-Slater molecular calculations have been shown to give a good account of the spectral shape of x-radiation excited in collisions between very heavy particles (Fricke et al 1976, Lutz et a 1 1976, Morovik et a 1 1977). It has been suggested that observation of the threshold behaviour of the excited radiation should provide a check on the details of the theoretical correlation diagrams, e. g., the location of individual level crossings (cf Lutz et al (1976) for the Xe-Au system). In this paper we report on an experimental investigation of the Xe-Ag collision system at and below 9 MeV ion energy, the molecular correlation diagram of which has been calculated by Morovik et al (1977).

40|$|For {{a fusion}} {{reaction}} to be feasible, {{it is necessary}} to heat plasmas to a very high temperature. One of the most promising ways for heating plasmas is to inject high energy neutral particles to the magnetically confined plasmas and to convert their kinetic energy to the thermal energy through collisions. In order to investigate various problems associated with this neutral beam injection method, a 20 kV, 1. 5 A neutral beam injector has been designed and constructed. By using this injection system, the effect of a gas injection to the ion source was investigated, and it was shown that the accurate control of the gas injection pressure was necessary to attain the stable ion beam extractions. The effect of the anode size on the arc discharge characteristics in an ion source was also obtained experimentally. The beam profiles were measured by a calorimeter and the good beam convergence was shown to be obtrained by the present system. Since the plasma produced in the ion source contained molecular ions, the low energy particles existed in the ion beam. The energy of the extracted ion beam was analysed by using the <b>deflection</b> <b>magnet,</b> and the variations of low energy ion fractions with arc descharge currents were also clarified...|$|E
40|$|The beam <b>deflection</b> <b>magnet</b> {{and energy}} control {{system of the}} Utrecht cascade {{generator}} are described. The uniform-field magnet has entrance and exit slits located outside the magnetic held. Since the cascade generator produces a vertical beam, the most convenient choice for the angle of deflection was 90 degrees. The radius of curvature of the beam {{in the region of}} the uniform-field is 20 cm, which makes it possible to deflect a one MeV beam of He+ or DeT ions with a field of 14. 5 kilograms. The value assembly of the magnet and slits can be repeated about the incoming beam in order to direct the beam to different experimental arrangements. Energy control is achieved in two steps: first the exciting current of the magnet is stabilized, the magnetic field being measured with a proton magnetic resonance fluxmeter, and second the high tension is controlled so as to maintain the deflected beam centered on the exit slit of the magnet. The expected energy resolution of the system has been verified down to an energy spread (full width at half maximum) of 0. 15 % in proton energy. At the resolution a useful beam (~ 2 μA is obtainable with a high-frequency ion delivering a total beam of about 40 μA protons...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{purpose of}} the {{injection}} kicker is to provide the ultimate deflection to the incoming beam from the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) into the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).

In order to achieve the required <b>deflection</b> angle four <b>magnets</b> powered by four pulsers will be used for each ring of RHIC. When the bunches are stacked in RHIC the last few rf buckets are left unfilled in order to provide a gap in the beam to facilitate the ejection or beam abort process.

50|$|ANKA {{features}} a storage ring with a circumference of 110.4 m (120.7 yards) that stores electrons at {{the energy of}} 2.5 GeV. For this purpose, electrons (90 keV) are generated by a triode and preaccelerated to 500 MeV via a “Racetrack Microtron” (53 MeV) and a booster. The actual working energy is finally reached in the storage ring, where the electrons are now spinning at almost the speed of light. The storage ring contains an ultra-high vacuum of 10−9 mbar. The synchrotron light is thereby generated by the constant <b>deflection</b> of 16 <b>magnets</b> that keep the electrons focused {{in the center of}} the tube. In addition to that, wigglers and undulators - specialized magnet configurations with alternating straight and reverse polarity - are used to deflect the electrons into a sinus-curve-like course on which they emit synchrotron radiation. A special feature of the ANKA synchrotron configuration is the super conducting SCU15 undulator that was - as its predecessor SCU14 - co-developed at the ANKA facility. This new undulator does not only generate synchrotron light of enhanced brilliance, but also a much more variable spectrum of radiation easily adjustable to the respective research requirements.|$|R
40|$|Today tumour {{diseases}} are {{the second most}} {{cause of death in}} Western countries. But only 45 percent of the patients can be cured by the established treatment methods. The further improvement of the these forms of therapy and the development of new therapeutical approaches is urgent. A substantial proportion of the patients could benefit from particle therapy with heavy ions. Beams of accelerated heavy ions (e. g. carbon, nitrogen or oxygen) with an energy between 70 and 500 AMeV are characterised by physical and biological properties superior to the radiation used in conventional radiotherapy (photons, electrons, neutrons). They form a sharp dose maximum (Bragg peak) shortly before coming to rest and are scarcely scattered while penetrating tissue. Because of the increased relative biological efficiency of these ions in the Bragg peak region they are suitable for precision therapy of deeply seated, compact, radioresistant tumours near to organs at risk. For a safe application of heavy ions close to radiosensitive structures (brain stem, optical nerves, eyes) an in situ monitoring of the therapy is desirable. This can be accomplished by positron emission tomography (PET), since fragmentation reactions between the stable ions of the therapy beam and the atomic nuclei of the tissue generate a dynamic spatial distribution of positron emitters (ß+-emitters) that can be observed by a positron camera. At the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt a medical treatment site for heavy ion therapy has been established in co-operation with the Radiologische Universitätsklinik Heidelberg, the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum Heidelberg and the Forschungszentrum Rossendorf. The fast variation of the beam energy in conjunction with the vertical and horizontal beam <b>deflection</b> by dipole <b>magnets</b> (raster scanning) allows the three-dimensional, strictly tumour shape conformed irradiations. The dual head positron camera BASTEI has been installed at the treatment place in order to measure the decay of the ß+-emitters during the irradiation and a few minutes after. Two ways to verify the treatment plan by PET are possible. # In critical situations when the beam has to pass very heterogeneous structures and radiosensitive organs are situated {{in the direction of the}} beam behind the Bragg peak, a monoenergetic low dose beam pulse can be applied to the patient. The range of the particles can be derived from the simultaneous PET scan, so that the correct range calculation of the treatment plan is ensured before the therapeutical irradiations are started. # During each fraction of the heavy ion therapy the ß+-activity distributions are measured routinely. Based on the time course of every individual therapy fraction the expected ß+-emitter distribution is computed. By comparing the simulated with the measured data the precision of the dose deposition of this single therapy fraction is assessed. If a considerable disagreement between these two distributions is revealed by this comparison the treatment plan has to be modified before proceeding with the following therapy fraction. The PET data are recorded in list mode, together with a protocol of important accelerator parameters of the irradiation. Because of the half-lives of the most abundant ß+-emitters 11 C and 15 O it is on principle impossible to obtain the precise position of the 12 C therapy beam by PET during the irradiation. ...|$|R
