60|$|It {{was twelve}} o'clock exactly when I hooked him, {{and a quarter}} of an hour sped by. My first big thrill came when he leaped. This was a surprise. He was fooling round, and then, all of a sudden, he broke water clear. It was an awkward, {{ponderous}} action, and looked as if he had come up backward, like a bucking bronco. His size and his long, sinister sword amazed me and frightened me. It gave me a cold sensation to realize <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hooked</b> to a huge, dangerous fish. But that in itself was a new kind of thrill. No boatman fears a Marlin as he does the true broadbill swordfish.|$|E
60|$|Once off the Point, {{where the}} tide rip is strong, {{he began to}} circle in great, wide circles. Strangely, he did not put out to sea. And here, during the next hour, I had the finest of {{experiences}} I think that ever befell a fisherman. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hooked</b> to a monster fighting swordfish; I was wet with sweat, and salt water that had dripped from my reel, and I was aching in every muscle. The sun was setting in banks of gold and silver fog over the west end, and the sea was opalescent--vast, shimmering, heaving, beautiful. And at this sunset moment, or hour--for time seemed nothing--a school of giant tuna began leaping around us, smashing the water, making the flying-fish rise in clouds, like drifting bees. I saw a whole flock of flying-fish rise into the air with that sunset glow and color in the background, and the exquisite beauty of life and movement was indescribable. Next a bald eagle came soaring down, and, swooping along the surface, he lowered his talons {{to pick up a}} crippled flying-fish. And when the hoary-headed bird rose, a golden eagle, larger and more powerful, began to contest with him for the prey.|$|E
60|$|My second thrill {{came when}} the fish lunged on the surface in a red foam. If I had hooked him so he bled freely {{there was a chance}} to land him! This {{approach}} to encouragement, however, was short-lived. He went down, and if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>hooked</b> to a submarine I could scarcely have felt more helpless. He sounded about five hundred feet and then sulked. I had the pleasant task of pumping him up. This brought the sweat out upon me and loosened me up. I began to fight him harder. And it seemed that as I increased the strain he grew stronger and a little more active. Still there was not any difference in his tactics. I began to get a conception of the vitality and endurance of a broadbill in contrast with the speed and savageness of his brother fish, the Marlin, or roundbill.|$|R

Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed.
