25|$|Uyghur food shows both Central Asian and Chinese elements. A typical Uyghur dish is polu (or pilaf), a dish found {{throughout}} Central Asia.

Another common Uyghur dish is leghmen (لەغمەن, ләғмән), a noodle dish with a stir-fried topping (säy, from Chinese cai, 菜) usually made from mutton and vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, chili peppers, and cabbage.

40|$|<b>Dried</b> <b>apricot</b> was {{extracted}} {{using two}} different solvents: 80 % ethanol and hexane. The contents of total phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanins were determined in ethanol apricot extract (EAE), while the carotenoid content was determined in hexane apricot extracts (HAE) by spectrophotometric method. The detected amounts of bioactive compounds in <b>dried</b> <b>apricot</b> were: phenolics 498. 13 ± 12. 04 mg GAE/ 100 g DA, flavonoids 218. 45 ± 14. 14 mg R/ 100 g DA and anthocyanins 3. 08 ± 0. 40 mg CGE/ 100 g DA. In <b>dried</b> <b>apricot</b> the β-carotene {{was present in}} the amount of 0. 56 ± 0. 03 mg/ 100 g DA. Some individual phenolic compounds in EAE were determined by HPLC analysis and the most dominant compound was gallic acid (35. 02 ± 1. 65 mg/ 100 g DA). Free radical scavenging activities of EAE and HAE were tested spectrophotometrically using stable DPPH radicals and reducing power method. The EC 50 value for EAE was 2. 05 ± 0. 06 mg/ml and for HAE was 6. 28 ± 0. 01 mg/ml. The RP 0. 5 values determined by reducing power method were 6. 11 ± 0. 01 mg/ml for EAE and 62. 04 ± 0. 03 mg/ml for HAE.

40|$|Sugars, mainly fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose ratios in {{the fresh}} red grape and raisins and {{in the fresh}} and <b>dried</b> <b>apricot</b> fruit were {{determined}} by High Performance Liquid Chromatography, HPLC, equipped with Ec 250 / 4. 6 Nucleodur 100 - 5 NH 2 -RP column and Refractometer -RID as a detector. Each type of the four samples was separately homogenized after removing the seeds from the samples before crushing, and in this study the deionized water was used for extraction of sugars. The ratio of each sugar in the four investigated cultivars was compared as well as comparing the contents of total sugars between these types, and {{it became obvious that}} fructose and glucose recorded significant increase rather than sucrose and maltose in these cultivars. Comparison has also been conducted for determination of fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose ratios between the fresh red grapes and raisins on one hand, and between the fresh <b>apricot</b> fruit and <b>dried</b> <b>apricot</b> on the other. The study showed that the raisins contain high level of fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose compared to the fresh grapes.

40|$|Abstract: The present {{experimental}} {{work is to}} study drier {{in the form of}} solar air heater that <b>dries</b> <b>Apricots</b> (Prunus armeniaca). A small dish type solar air heater, connected to a drying chamber was developed in May, 2012 to evaluate its performance for <b>drying</b> <b>apricots.</b> The efficiency of this solar air heater was evaluated in May, 2012 at three air flow rates. Results showed that flow rates significantly (P< 0. 000) affected the 1 efficiency of the solar air heater. Efficiency improved from 20 % at the natural flow rate of 0. 01 kg. sec to 42. 6 % 1 at a high convective flow rate of 0. 21 kg. sec. Furthermore apricots were dehydrated at a temperature of 50 °C and less than 15 % relative humidity. <b>Apricots</b> were <b>dried</b> to a moisture content of less than 8 %. It was experiential that apricots took 13 hours of lost moisture from 85 % to 8 %.
