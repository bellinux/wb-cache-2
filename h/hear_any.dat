As a result, they were unable to count songs in or perform in unison.|$|E
5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|Chintanda's {{affidavit}} {{caused the}} BSAC to become concerned about Clark's continued authority in North-Eastern Rhodesia {{and to begin}} investigating him more thoroughly. The situation was complicated when, after a month's perusal, the Company's lawyers resolved that the courts in Salisbury and Bulawayo held no jurisdiction outside Southern Rhodesia and therefore could not <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> case brought against Clark. On 4 July 1899, Arthur Lawley, the Company's administrator in Matabeleland, wrote to Cape Town to report the situation to the resident High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Alfred Milner. Lawley briefly summarised the charges against Clark and requested permission to hold a court north of the Zambezi {{under the supervision of}} one of three chiefs friendly to the Company. Milner replied on 17 August that he could not legally sanction this, and that Lawley should pursue the matter further only when authority extended over Clark's area.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} three bullets were found inside Baader's cell is {{considered}} suspicious. The first explanation given was that Baader signaled the other prisoners.

There was no change in the judicial system when the Straits Settlements were dissolved in 1946 and Singapore became a crown colony in its own right, except that the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements became known as the Supreme Court of Singapore.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} courts {{from the}} provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, {{which means that}} the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, they can <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.|$|E
25|$|The Crathie was a steamer {{of about}} 475 tons gross and 272 net. She left Rotterdam with general cargo for Aberdeen on January 29, 1895 {{carrying}} just 12 hands. The Craithie was also badly damaged in the collision {{and returned to}} Rotterdam flying signals of distress. When later asked why they had not stayed on to help the Elbe and her passengers, the captain, Alexander Gordon, said that he feared that his ship would sink, {{and in any case}} he did not <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> cries for help coming from the liner. It appeared to him that the Elbe was steaming away from his position.|$|E

25|$|Almost all {{civil work}} is {{dealt with by}} either the High Court or County Courts. Prior to the Act, there was a simple {{financial}} boundary to decide which cases would go to which court—any contract or tort case valued at less than £5,000 {{would go to the}} County Courts, while any case valued at more than that would go straight to the High Court. Section 1 of the Act allows the Lord Chancellor to change the financial boundaries after consultation with senior judges such as the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, and also allows the Lord Chancellor to create categories based on things other than the financial value of the case, such as the complexity involved or the importance of any legal question likely to be raised. An exception to this rule is that the Lord Chancellor cannot ask a County Court to <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> case of judicial review.|$|E
25|$|With a few limited exceptions, the High Court has the {{jurisdiction}} {{to hear and}} try any action in personam (that is, directed towards a particular person) where the defendant is served with a writ of summons or other originating process in or outside Singapore, or where the defendant submits to the Court's jurisdiction. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> type of case no matter how trivial or serious. In practice, though, parties may be penalized by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.|$|E
25|$|Justinian then {{targeted}} {{his former}} place of exile in the Crimea. There his brother-in-law, the Khagan, had infringed on Imperial territory {{by establishing a}} Khazar governor of his own to run Cherson. Upon arriving there, the expedition set about doing its work— countless citizens were drowned (apparently with weights attached) and seven were roasted alive. The Tudun, the governor appointed by the Khagan was sent to Constantinople with 30 others. However, a storm destroyed his army and his fleet when he ordered it to return. Justinian {{is said to have}} greeted the news with great laughter. Another fleet was sent but the arrival of the Khagan's army made Justinian reconsider his move to a more diplomatic one. He decided to send the Tudun back to the Khagan with his apologies and had George of Syria to present the Imperial apology. The citizens of Cherson were naturally in no mood to <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> apology after what Justinian had done. When the Tudun died along the way, the Khazars took it upon themselves to send his 300-strong escort to the afterlife with him.|$|E

25|$|Free Information Act – He {{has filed}} Senate Bill No. 109 (Free Information Act) to {{implement}} the Constitutional guarantee to free access by the people to official information, except when the disclosure of such information would jeopardize other prerogatives of the government, namely, {{the protection of the}} privacy of individuals, trade secrets, national security, public order and safety, and foreign diplomatic relations. The bill also proposes the adoption by all government bodies a mechanism wherein all written requests for information shall be responded to within two days, unless proper justification is given by the government body, subject only to the payment of reasonable fees for the viewing or reproduction of such information. To compel disclosure of information, in case a government body refuses access to such information on whatever grounds, the Office of the Ombudsman would be tapped to <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> citizens' complaints of not being properly assisted by the pertinent government body. Penalties will be levied to officials or employees who knowingly and unjustly refuse to provide access to information, or who consciously release false or misleading information.|$|E
25|$|A legal {{challenge}} was {{filed in the}} Superior Court of Essex County, contesting the fine imposed for a citizen's failure to get health insurance {{as well as the}} fine imposed for a failure to provide information on a tax return as to whether that citizen had health insurance. The judge dismissed the case upon a motion filed by an assistant to Attorney General Martha Coakley for failure to state a case upon which relief can be granted. A petition for a writ of mandamus to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), ordering Essex Superior Court to vacate this dismissal on procedural grounds, the failure to provide trial by jury in a dispute over property as requested by the plaintiff, was denied by Associate Justice Spina. An appeal was then filed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court. A later petition for a writ of mandamus with the SJC was also denied, this time by Chief Justice Ireland. The Appeals Court then heard the appeal and declined to send the case back to Essex Superior Court for trial by jury based on their belief that no facts needed to be determined and therefore trial by jury in this case was not a protected right under either the US or Massachusetts Constitutions. The SJC declined to <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> further appeals.|$|E
25|$|Kilgore {{refused to}} debate Russ Potts, a {{decision}} which columnist Barnie Day said could strengthen Potts' underdog appeal {{and was a}} poor decision by Kilgore. It is unclear whether this had any effect on the election's outcome. Russ Potts polled 9% in a Mason-Dixon poll, but then dropped to 6% in a September poll. He needed to poll 15% in two separate polls to qualify {{for participation in the}} October Kaine-Kilgore debate. This poll was taken before Potts' TV ads ran. Although Potts was excluded from the final debate, he agreed to be sequestered in an office at Richmond's WTVR-TV during Sunday evening's debate and was not allowed to <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> of the questions nor any of the answers offered by his opponents. Minutes after the debate ended, Potts was taken into WTVR-TV studios where the station played back the debate in real time and recorded Potts' answers to each of the debate questions. WTVR-TV announced plans to air key segments of the 'virtual debate' on seven consecutive nights at 11 p.m., beginning Sunday October 16 through Saturday October 22. Each segment focuses on one or two debate topics and presented the complete, timed answers from Mr. Kaine, Mr. Kilgore and Mr. Potts. The station also announced plans to present a composite one-hour virtual debate among the three candidates at 11:30p.m. on Sunday, October 23.|$|E
