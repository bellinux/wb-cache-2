40|$|<b>Establishing</b> <b>parentage</b> The {{subject of}} this master thesis {{is the issue of}} <b>{{establishing}}</b> <b>parentage.</b> The thesis targets areas of establishing parenthood, issues of three legal presumptions and last but not least, parenthood denial. The question of establishing maternity is examined mainly from perspectives including surrogate maternity, assisted reproduction method and secret and anonymous delivery. All matters are reviewed based on the valid amendment to Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code that has come into effect on 1. 1. 2014. The goal of the thesis is it to introduce, describe and analyze the new amendment to the Family Act. Further, it aims to compare individual institutions with respect to changes made to the Family Act in the past and those made {{as a part of the}} new amendment. The thesis consists of eight key chapters. The initial chapter targets relationships among parents and their children, protection of children's legal rights as well as a child's right to know its biological origin. Following, the second and the third chapters concentrate in depth on legislation of the paternity establishment per se. While the second chapter covers the historical development of the legislation from the ancient Rome era until present, the latter chapter intends to introduce the legislation from domestic, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|When former U. S. Senator and Presidential {{candidate}} John Edwards (finally) {{declared his}} paternity of Quinn, born of sex to Rielle Hunter, many assumed he could then begin to raise {{as well as}} financially support the child he once publicly shunned. Many assumed legal paternity could arise through a court order, if not Rielle’s wishes. Had he been on the Maury Povich television show, the positive genetic tests would have prompted the host to declare John the father. Yet notwithstanding these declarations, {{there would be no}} childrearing by John if Rielle determined he should have no contact with Quinn, even if Rielle sought child support from John and even if Quinn’s best interests favored contact between her and John. For genetic fathers like John whose bedmates are not like Rielle, there are often no opportunities to present Christmas gifts. As John and Rielle were never married and as Rielle was not married to another, Quinn was a nonmarital child with no federal constitutional legal father at birth. At birth, John may have had a federal constitutional opportunity interest in <b>establishing</b> <b>parentage,</b> seized by stepping up to parental responsibilities. Yet, as John only declared paternity two years after birth, after denying fatherhood and prompting another man to declare his genetic ties with Quinn, he may have been too late to seize the federal opportunity interest in order to fully parent Quinn without Rielle’s cooperation. Only with Rielle’s consent could John now complete a voluntary paternity acknowledgment, a prerequisite to placing John on Quinn’s birth certificate. And with Rielle’s opposition, any paternity lawsuit by John to establish regular contacts with Quinn would most likely fail even though any paternity lawsuit to establish John’s financial support of Quinn would most likely succeed. Popular misconceptions about legal paternity for nonmarital children born of sex largely arise due to confusion and ignorance about voluntary paternity acknowledgments. Our exploration of the federal and state acknowledgment laws reveals that a John Edwards is often no new father with legal childrearing rights so that without a Rielle Hunter’s help, his relationship with a Quinn would be limited to checks in the mail. Voluntary acknowledgment laws are especially important today because about 1. 7 million nonmarital children are born of sex each year in the United States, with about one third, like Quinn, having no legal father at birth. In 1940, there were only about 90, 000 nonmarital children. Like Quinn, some of today’s fatherless children have late arriving declarations about genetic ties, and perhaps paternal child care. Far more nonmarital children remain fatherless, though possibly the subject of later suits seeking child support. Many nonmarital children will be born fatherless under law even though U. S. governments proclaim that these children should have both a mother and father under law at birth. Voluntary paternity acknowledgment laws can better prompt dual parentage. After reviewing contemporary acknowledgment forms, we suggest laws to prompt more, and more reliable, paternity acknowledgments, and thus more legal fathers at birth for nonmarital children...|$|E

40|$|SummaryPopulation {{connectivity}} through larval dispersal is {{an essential}} parameter in models of marine population dynamics [1 – 3] and the optimal size and spacing of marine reserves [4 – 6]. However, there are remarkably few direct estimates of larval dispersal for marine organisms, and the actual birth sites of successful recruits have never been located. Here, we solve {{the mystery of the}} natal origin of clownfish (Amphiprion polymnus) juveniles by mass-marking via tetracycline immersion all larvae produced in a population. In addition, we <b>established</b> <b>parentage</b> by DNA genotyping all potential adults and all new recruits arriving in the population. Although no individuals settled into the same anemone as their parents, many settled remarkably close to home. Even though this species has a 9 – 12 day larval duration, one-third of settled juveniles had returned to a 2 hectare natal area, with many settling < 100 m from their birth site. This represents the smallest scale of dispersal known for any marine fish species with a pelagic larval phase. The degree of local retention indicates that marine reserves can provide recruitment benefits not only beyond but also within their boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of male reproductive success {{are essential to}} understanding the evolution of polyandrous mating systems. Here, we use multilocus DNA fingerpinting to assess parentage in an island population of Tasmanian native hens (Tribonyx mortierii), which often live in multi-male and/or multi-female social groups. This isolated population presented special challenges to this technique because it was artificially founded from {{a small number of}} individuals in the recent past. DNA profiles from four multilocus minisatellite probes were analyzed for adults and offspring from six social groups using two methods: (1) significance of band-sharing coefficients and (2) distribution among a group 2 ̆ 7 s offspring of fragments unique to certain adults. Traditional band-sharing analyses did not provide sufficient resolution to <b>establish</b> <b>parentage</b> in this population due to the high level of band-sharing between adults within groups. In contrast, the distribution of unique fragments suggests that in most cases, all offspring within a group have the same male and female genetic parents, so that monogamy may be the predominant 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 genetic 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 mating system of this species.

40|$|We {{examined}} fine-scale genetic {{structure of}} mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) in an old-growth stand and an adjacent seedling population, {{with the goal}} of detecting the effects of fragmentation. Three hundred and six old-growth trees and 195 naturally regenerating seedlings were genotyped at 5 microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was similar across old-growth life stages and within the clear-cut seedlings. Significant inbreeding was found in the adult class (30 þ cm diameter at breast height) of old-growth seedlings and in the adjacent natural regeneration. Relatedness was significantly associated with physical dis-tance for both the oldest age class and for regenerating seedlings in the adjacent clear-cut, whereas intermediate classes showed no such association. As intermediate classes show no isolation by distance, the associations that arise probably occur from single cohort regeneration that clearly has taken place in the clear-cut, and possibly when the oldest old-growth trees were <b>established.</b> <b>Parentage</b> analysis suggested that large-scale fragmentation, such as this clear-cut, allowed for increased long-distance seed dispersal. We conclude that long-lived tree populations can consist of a cohort mosaic, reflecting the effects of fragmentation, and resulting in a complex, age-dependent, local population structure with high levels of genetic diversity.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to analyze the genetic characteristics of the Donggyeong dog and <b>establish</b> <b>parentage</b> conserva-tion systems for it by using 10 microsatellite markers recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG). A total of 369 dogs from 12 dog breeds including the Donggyeong dog were genotyped using 10 microsatellite loci. The number of alleles per locus varied from 5 to 10 with a mean value of 7. 6 in the Donggyeong dog. The observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 4706 to 0. 9020 (mean 0. 7657) and from 0. 4303 to 0. 8394 (mean 0. 7266), respectively. The total exclusion probability of 10 microsatellite loci was 0. 99955. Of the 10 microsatellite markers, the AHT 121, AHTh 260 and CXX 279 markers had relatively high PIC values (≥ 0. 7). This study found that there were specific alleles, 116 allele at AHT 121 in the Donggyeong dog when compared with other dog breeds. Also, the results showed two (Korean native dogs and the foreign dog breeds) distinct clusters. The closest distance (0. 1184) was observed between the Donggyeong dog and Jindo dog, and the longest distance (0. 3435) was observed between the Donggyeong dog and Bulgae. The Korean native dog breeds have comparatively near genetic distances between each other. KEY WORDS: Donggyeong dog, genetic distance, microsatellite marker doi: 10. 1292 /jvms. 14 - 0189; J. Vet.

Almost all European {{societies}} support legal {{efforts to}} <b>establish</b> <b>parentage</b> when the paternity of children {{born out of}} wedlock has not been established. In this context, courts frequently ask for DNA tests as part of public policies to ensure that children are cared for not only financially, but also regarding education, upbringing and psychological development. Underlying such action, there is a biological conception of paternity that has been discussed against the emergence of new family forms dissociated from the trilogy ‘heterosexual couple-marriage-procreation’. Feminist studies have shown that state institutions, when actively engaging in civil action to identify a child’s father tend to reveal patriarchal gender relations grounded on the evaluation of the mothers’ sexual activity and fidelity and of the fathers’ income and employment status. This paper explores {{the ways in which the}} legal investigation of paternity of children {{born out of wedlock}} reveals cultural models that reinforce the naturalisation of gender differences. We contend that: by allowing for the “biological true” of paternity, biotechnology has effects on the configuration of parental roles and identities by reproducing gender inequalities, which may question both the rights of children and of biological mothers and fathers. We intend to show how women and men evaluate legal interventions in this domain; reconfigure their private rights in ways that tend to reproduce and at the same time challenge prevailing patriarchal structures.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of inbreeding on the performance of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) larvae in the field and in the lab-oratory. We used microsatellite analysis to <b>establish</b> the <b>parentage</b> and degree of inbreeding of the larvae. Two different estimators of inbreeding were used. The first was based on average multilocus heterozygosity, and the second was based on a molecular relatedness estimator. The estimators were highly correlated, and both showed a significant negative relation-ship between inbreeding and survival in the wild. However, {{there was no evidence that}} inbreeding influenced growth or development in the wild. Neither was there any evidence that inbreeding affected survival, growth, or development in the laboratory. These results suggest that, for wood frogs, inbreeding has a bigger effect on fitness in the wild than in captivity and that measurements of survival are more sensitive than measures of growth or development. Inbreeding depression can be defined at the individual or population level as a decline in the fitness of the offspring that is a direct consequence of increasing relatedness between mates.

40|$|More {{than three}} decades {{after the birth of}} the first child {{conceived}} through in vitro fertilization, few states have comprehensive statutes to <b>establish</b> the <b>parentage</b> of children born using assisted reproduction techniques (ART). While thousands of such children are born each year courts struggle to apply outdated laws. For example, does a statute terminating paternity for a man who donates sperm to a married woman apply if the woman is unmarried? In 2008, the Uniform Probate Code (UPC) added two much-needed sections on the complicated parentage and inheritance issues that arise in the field of assisted reproduction. Yet it is unclear whether states will enact these new UPC sections; few states have enacted comparable provisions of the Uniform Parentage Act (UPA).

GISH confirmed the LLRR constitution of the doubled amphimonoploid (allodiploid), and the LLR constitution of all BC 1 plants. The three selected BC 2 plants were, as expected, aneuploid, containing three complete sets of L. longiflorum chromosomes and six, seven or eight L. rubellum chromosomes, respectively.

In spite of the high frequencies of homoeologous recombination in the F 1 hybrids (LR) pollen was found to be sterile in all cases. At metaphase I of the pollen mother cells of the BC 1 plants, genome painting did not reveal any cases of homoeologous pairing and recombination between L and R chromosomes. This lack of exchange between homoeologous chromosome segments indicates complete preferential pairing of the L and R chromosomes in the F 1 (amphidiploid) and BC 1 plants.

40|$|Legal {{parentage}} under American {{state laws}} is significantly and rapidly evolving. And, {{it is increasingly}} imprecise. No longer is legal parentage only defined at precise moments in time or for particular conduct, as by giving birth, having biological ties, marriage to the birth mother at time of conception or birth, name placement on a birth certificate, or formal adoption. Both men and women can now become legal parents, as through de facto parenthood or equitable adoption, where neither {{the time of the}} relevant conduct nor the conduct prompting parentage can be precisely determined. Because legal parentage increasingly depends upon fluid and imprecise doctrines, lawyers and judges must be vigilant in handling legal disputes implicating parentage. Together with the growing phenomenon of imprecise legal parentage, lawyers and judges are also challenged because an <b>established</b> legal <b>parentage</b> in one setting often is inapplicable in other settings. Parentage under law is frequently contextual. Thus, a father for child support purposes often is not a father for childcare purposes. Further, lawyers and judges are now challenged both in proceedings first establishing and later overriding legal parentage. Legal parentage increasingly can be overridden via imprecise norms, including standards on waivers, forfeitures, rebuttals, and rescissions. The numbers of disestablished parents are growing due to reliable and inexpensive genetic testing, births during marriage resulting from adultery, and greater use of assisted reproduction. Moreover, lawyers and judges investigating both the establishment and disestablishment of legal parentage are challenged due to significant interstate variations. As one distinguished commentator observed: “The relative importance of biology, intent, contract, and parental function varies tremendously by jurisdiction and even by case, adding confusion and unpredictability to a determination of critical importance. ” Because parents and their children are quite mobile, in resolving parentage disputes, choices increasingly must be made between competing and quite different imprecise American state parentage laws. This article examines the challenges for lawyers and judges investigating parentage. First, it will survey varying American state imprecise parentage laws. Then, it will examine the investigative norms guiding parentage inquiries. In conclusion, it will review the possible results of failed inquiries and offer suggestions to lawyers and judges who must contend with an array of differing fluid, imprecise, and contextual American state parentage laws...|$|R
40|$|<b>Establishing</b> legal <b>parentage,</b> once a {{relatively}} straightforward matter {{of marriage and}} biology, has become increasingly complex. The determination of legal status as mother may now involve several women making claims based on genetic contribution, contract, status as gestational carrier or other bases. The debate about {{the best choice for}} children when adults are competing for parental status is ongoing, lively and filled with many voices. Less {{attention has been paid to}} a much larger, second category of cases - cases in which the law is faced with resolving the legal status of the one adult who may be available to serve as the legal mother or father. For mothers, these cases most often arise in the context of determining their legal status as biological mothers when the state has identified them as being at risk for abusing or neglecting their infant children. These cases almost always involve mothers or fathers who are poor, often members of minorities and usually without legal representation in parentage establishment and/or disestablishment proceedings. In these orphan cases, the governing rules or legal standards chosen by the legislature or courts will not be used to choose among potential parents; rather, the issue is whether anyone will serve as a child 2 ̆ 7 s parent. This paper examines the laws that establish and disestablish the maternal rights of poor women. The paper examines patterns of state intervention in child abuse and neglect law that determines the legal recognition of motherhood for these women. It concludes that current child welfare rules and policies promote the loss of birth mothers in poor children 2 ̆ 7 s lives, often with no long-term maternal substitute for affected children. The paper also notes that focusing on parentage laws alone cannot preserve fit mothers in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives.

Finally, the paper concludes with some principles to guide the formulation of parentage laws that have as their primary goal protecting poor children by keeping mothers in their lives...|$|R
40|$|This {{multifaceted}} study primarily {{aimed at}} understanding the genetic make-up of captive versus wild cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) populations in South Africa, {{with a specific}} emphasis on a valuable gene pool of a recessive phenotype that is increasingly being maintained in captive population country-wide. The current literature on cheetah genetics has very little information on diversity levels of wild South African cheetahs, and no information on founder dynamics and genetic make-up of South African captive populations. Decisions on cheetah relocations are being made, implementing current conservation policy, from assumptions on origin and relatedness. This research compared population genetic parameters within the largest South African captive cheetah population to free-ranging Namibian and South African conspecifics. The study addressed concerns regarding excessive Namibian genetic introgression into the native captive population and established the extent of genetic variability and Namibian ancestry within the captive population. The study has attempted to address the rising concern among conservation officials with respect to illegal trade of wild-captured cheetahs, wild caught cheetahs that are sold as captive-bred after implanting a microchip. In addition to <b>establishing</b> routine <b>parentage</b> verification using genetic markers that are polymorphic in this species, this study established a technique powerful enough to estimate ancestry in cheetahs of unknown antecedents. The potential of spatial Bayesian clustering to differentiate the point of origin of unknown cheetahs was exploited and in addition, a database for future forensic efforts {{to address the problem}} of illegal trade was established. The captive population that was part of this dataset proved to be quite admixed, excepting for the King lineage which was distinct. The second aspect of this study investigated complex conditions such as development of gastritis, renal conditions and/or susceptibility to infections and its relation to pedigree and marker based inbreeding levels. Heritability values for important breeding traits were estimated from pedigree records of 532 cheetahs and are reported for the first time. Gastritis was weakly correlated to the expression of the King trait. Finally, a smaller cohort of the captive pedigree that segregates for a recessive colour variant called the King phenotype was tested for the assumption that the variation is a mutation of the tabby locus described in domestic cats. Genetic linkage analysis was done by testing microsatellite markers detected linked to Tabby for linkage to a conserved region in the cheetah that potentially codes for the King coat colour. Genetic linkage analysis was not detected between the King locus and the domestic cat microsatellite markers used for this study, with LOD scores remaining non-significant for all the markers.

40|$|Legal {{parentage}} for childcare purposes under American {{state laws}} is significantly and rapidly expanding, {{with the new}} norms growing increasingly imprecise. No longer is childcare parentage, that is, parentage carrying the superior right to the “care, custody, and control” of a child, only defined at precise moments in time, as by giving birth; having biological ties; marriage to the birth mother; name placement on a birth certificate; or, formal adoption. In increasing numbers, {{both men and women}} are now becoming childcare parents where the time of the actions prompting legal parentage is imprecise. Here, parentage typically depends on assessing earlier parental-like acts, like providing financial support or the holding out of a child as one’s own. Here, an earlier intent to be a parent, and not simply be a child caretaker, also is often key. Both precise and imprecise forms of <b>establishing</b> childcare <b>parentage</b> are now also increasingly overridden under new imprecise disestablishment norms. Whether labeled as rebuttals or rescissions, parentage disestablishments today are frequently dependent on assessing earlier conduct occurring at no precise time, like the failure of a biological father to establish a bonded and dependent familial relationship with his child. Judicial inquiries into imprecise childcare parentage in both establishment and disestablishment settings would be greatly facilitated if American state lawmakers created new mechanisms for personal declarations of earlier assumed and/or now intended parental acts. As intent to parent often is quite relevant, these declarations would be quite helpful, though not controlling, when courts assess earlier actions while determining imprecise childcare parentage issues. Before suggesting new mechanisms for formal declarations of intended childcare parentage, the paper first reviews current American state imprecise childcare parentage laws and the importance of parental intentions in such laws. New legal mechanisms could aid courts in their inquiries into earlier parental-like acts in imprecise parental childcare cases if clear indications of childcare intentions were earlier expressed by existing legal parents and/or by those looking forward to (further) pursuing a parental role. Voluntary paternity acknowledgements do not now, and should not ever, cover such expressions. They were meant, and should remain, for alleged biological fathers of children born of consensual sex. States having imprecise parentage laws should facilitate later judicial inquiries into parental-like acts by establishing new mechanisms for formal declarations of assumed and/or intended parentage. Such declarations would not control courts making childcare parentage determinations. Rather, they would guide, helping courts apply their states’ imprecise childcare parentage laws that depend upon earlier actions and intentions of parents and of nonparents regarding the continuing or future care and support of children. New state mechanisms for formal declarations of assumed and/or intended childcare parentage should be developed after imprecise childcare parent laws are established, as through statutes or court decisions abiding by premarital or midmarriage childcare pacts (dealing, e. g., with assumed and/or intended stepparent childcare) or by cohabitation pacts between single parents and their significant others...|$|R
40|$|Dispersal, the {{movement}} of individuals or gametes, {{is one of the}} most important life history traits affecting the dynamics and structure of populations. In particular, successful dispersal through the landscape can be critical to the maintenance of genetic variation and persistence of wild populations, especially for small, isolated populations prone to extinction. With many ecosystems now facing threats from habitat fragmentation and alteration, knowledge concerning the ability of species to adapt to these changes through dispersal is crucial for successful species conservation and management. Despite this, {{the movement}} of individuals (and genes) remains one of the least understood concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, the emergence of ecological genetic techniques has provided tools to examine patterns of population structure and to infer dispersal at multiple geographic scales. Consequently, ecological genetic methods are becoming central in studies of behaviour and conservation, particularly for small populations or in declining or threatened species. Rock-wallabies (genus Petrogale), medium-sized macropodid marsupials dependent on rocky habitats, are model species for investigating the relationships among genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow in small, fragmented populations. Rock-wallaby colonies are typically small and their strong dependence on rocky terrain has resulted in series of discreet colonies distributed across suitable habitat. In addition, ecological disturbances since European settlement, such as predation by introduced predators and land clearing, have had a significant negative impact on some rock-wallaby populations. Currently many rock-wallaby species are in serious decline with rapidly diminishing distributions. Dispersal among spatially isolated colonies is very restricted, and as rock-wallaby colonies become further fragmented by habitat alteration and increased predation pressure, movement of individuals between colonies will become increasingly important to prevent colony extinction. However, baseline information on dispersal behaviour and population dynamics is limited for rock-wallabies and no studies have been conducted in areas in which colonies were embedded in a landscape of continuous rocky escarpment habitat. This thesis combines ecological genetic techniques with long-term mark-recapture records to examine the population genetics and dispersal ecology of the threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) at two geographic scales in southeastern Queensland, Australia. While contemporary populations of brush-tailed rock-wallabies in the southern part of the species range are restricted to small, isolated remnant colonies, the northern part of the species range still sustains many small colonies closely distributed across suitable habitat, providing a rare opportunity to investigate the natural processes of population structure and gene flow within and among populations of a listed threatened species. The first two chapters of the thesis focus on contemporary patterns of population structure and dispersal of brush-tailed rock-wallabies at two geographic scales, within and among colonies. Chapter two combines spatial data on home ranges of individuals and 12 polymorphic microsatellite markers to examine patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure within a well studied colony at Hurdle Creek Valley. Patterns of pairwise relatedness and spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to test the hypothesis that dispersal is male-biased in this species. The data demonstrate significant patterns of relatedness among females in close proximity and a female genetic neighbourhood size of only 600 m, supporting a pattern of male-biased dispersal in brush-tailed rock-wallabies. This is the first robust evidence for strong female philopatry and spatial clustering of related females within the rock-wallaby taxon. Chapter three investigates genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow among brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies within and among two valley regions with continuous habitat in southeast Queensland. Using 12 polymorphic microsatellite markers, Bayesian-modeling analyses and traditional population genetic methods (Wrights F-statistics), I demonstrate a strong and significant pattern of isolation by distance among colonies indicating restricted gene flow over a small geographic scale (< 10 km). I conclude that gene flow is more likely limited by intrinsic factors rather than environmental factors. In addition, this chapter provides evidence that genetic diversity is significantly lower in colonies located in a more isolated valley region compared to colonies located in a valley region surrounded by continuous habitat. I discuss the implications of restricted patterns of contemporary gene flow within and among colonies for the conservation and management of brush-tailed rock-wallaby populations in both the remaining connected brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies in the northern parts of the species range and the remnant endangered populations in the south. Mating dispersal, the dispersal of gametes through mate choice, can also influence population structure and patterns of genetic diversity, particularly in small, isolated, or remnant populations. In chapter four of the thesis I investigate the importance of mating dispersal and breeding group structure to inbreeding avoidance within a brush-tailed rock-wallaby colony. Using 13 microsatellite markers and <b>established</b> likelihood-based <b>parentage</b> analyses, I assign paternity to pouch young sampled over 4 years in the Hurdle Creek colony. The parentage data revealed a remarkably restricted pattern of mating dispersal and strong breeding group structuring for a mid-sized mammal. I suggest that the restricted pattern of mating dispersal, with strong breeding group structuring and male-biased dispersal among groups, facilitates inbreeding avoidance within the Hurdle Creek colony. These results provide insight into the population structure and maintenance of genetic diversity within colonies of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby. Chapters three and four document strong female philopatry and restricted gene flow using nuclear DNA markers; however, the patterns observed could be influenced by landscape clearing or fragmentation. Chapter five of the thesis uses mitochondrial DNA, a maternally inherited marker which better reflects historical processes, to investigate patterns of female philopatry at both the colony and landscape scales. I test the hypotheses that female philopatry over a long time scale has led to lineage sorting among brush-tailed rock-wallaby colonies and that the brush-tailed rock-wallaby is a marsupial species that shows matrilineal genetic structuring. The results confirm that female brush-tailed rock-wallabies are exceptionally faithful to their natal colony and that females sharing mtDNA haplotypes form tight and significant spatial clusters within a single colony. This is the first unequivocal support for the presence of long-term matrilineal genetic structuring in a marsupial mammal. Rock-wallabies are intriguing species. At some time in the past rock-wallabies managed to colonize much of the Australian continent; however, this thesis documents a pattern of strong population structure and restricted dispersal at multiple geographic scales in the brush-tailed rock-wallaby. The final chapter of the thesis attempts to synthesise these findings and discusses the implications of the results for the conservation and management of brush-tailed rock-wallabies, a threatened listed species, and other rock-wallaby species in Australia...|$|R
