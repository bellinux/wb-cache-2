5|$|The Beatles' booking agent, Allan Williams, {{decided to}} send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and the Seniors, proved {{successful}} there. Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best {{a few days before}} their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson (after McCartney or Best had set fire to a condom <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> quarters as a light source to gather their possessions as their host had cut off power to their room).|$|E
5|$|Towers A, B, and C house mostly first-year freshmen. The towers {{are all of}} {{different}} heights, and differ slightly <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> accommodations. Tower B is the tallest of the three, at 22 stories. Tower A is 19 stories tall, and Tower C is 16 stories in height. Rooms in Towers A and B are the same size, roughly 17ft (5.2m) by 11ft (3.4m). These measurements are not exact, however, because the three towers are cylindrical in shape (although actually twenty-sided) and the rooms themselves are therefore somewhat trapezoidal.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, giant lemurs {{existed on}} Madagascar. Now {{represented}} only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms {{that were once}} part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> relatives. All 17extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200kg (440lb), and {{are thought to have}} been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, in 1918, Portugal {{fell into}} a serious {{economic}} crisis, {{in part due to}} the Portuguese military intervention in the war.

25|$|The {{effects on}} living {{conditions}} {{the industrial revolution}} have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s. A series of 1950s essays by Henry Phelps Brown and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus {{that the bulk of}} the population, that was {{at the bottom of the}} social ladder, suffered severe reductions <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> standards. During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of establishment, Mae Ji Chandra sought finance to support the center and set the {{regulations}} for those living in the temple. Luang Pu Sodh was her model in this. An {{example of such a}} regulation was that a monk had to receive guests in public rooms rather than <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> quarters. Asian Studies scholar Jesada Buaban believes that Mae Ji Chandra made Wat Phra Dhammakaya attractive, because most other Thai temples are male-led, with no women in a leading role.|$|E
25|$|During the 1981–82 period, state {{industrial}} investment was substantially increased, 17billion francs in ”soft loan” credit {{was provided to}} private industry, 7billion francs was set aside to help school leavers, 54,000 new civil service jobs were created, and a major housebuilding drive was launched. Efforts were made to shift the burden of direct taxes away from lower- income groups, while increases {{in the minimum wage}} gave the low paid a real increase <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> standards of about 15% in 1981–82. Unemployment benefits were also increased, together with the duration of time in which one could receive them. In addition, the maximum allowable workweek was reduced from 50 to 48 hours.|$|E

Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Jobs were Apple and Kobun. By the early 1977, she and Jobs would spend time together at her home at Duveneck Ranch in Los Altos, which served as a hostel and environmental education center. Brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm.|$|E

25|$|The Enchanted Ceiling is {{the third}} {{extended}} play from wizard rock and indie rock band, Harry and the Potters. It was released in July 2007. The album was primarily inspired by the first two novels in the Harry Potter book series. It was released in a limited run of 1000CDs as the Wizard Rock EP of the Month for July 2007. It was later released for digital download. After three albums, Paul DeGeorge of Harry and the Potters decided to start a subscription-based Wizard Rock EP of the Month club. During March 2007, the brothers decided to record write as many songs as possible and record them in one weekend. The brothers recorded the songs <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> room.

25|$|All private {{property}} and – crucial to Jewish economic life – private businesses were nationalized; political activity was delegalized {{and thousands of people}} were jailed, many of whom were later executed. Zionism, which was designated by the Soviets as counter-revolutionary was also forbidden. In just one day all Polish and Jewish media were shut down and replaced by the new Soviet press, which conducted political propaganda attacking religion including the Jewish faith. Synagogues and churches were not yet closed but heavily taxed. The Soviet ruble of little value was immediately equalized to the much higher Polish zloty {{and by the end of}} 1939, zloty was abolished. Most economic activity became subject to central planning and the NKVD restrictions. Since the Jewish communities tended to rely more on commerce and small scale businesses, the confiscations of property affected them to a greater degree than the general populace. The Soviet rule resulted in near collapse of the local economy, characterized by insufficient wages and general shortage of goods and materials. The Jews, like other inhabitants of the region, saw a fall <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>living</b> standards.|$|E

500|$|Very little {{information}} was available about homosexuality beyond medical and psychiatric texts.

Around the same time, Meiklejohn received letters from the Baraboo, Wisconsin, schools superintendent and a Baraboo judge noting the Experimental College's sordid reputation in the state and its habit of repelling [...] "ordinary" [...] students whose parents were uninterested in the ramifications of such an education.
