5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> Group was a Gaullist {{political}} group with {{seats in the}} European Parliament between 1965 and 1973.|$|E
50|$|As the Parliament developed, other Groups emerged. Gaullists from France {{founded the}} <b>European</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> Group. When Conservatives from Denmark and the United Kingdom joined, they created the European Conservatives Group, which (after some name changes) {{eventually}} {{merged with the}} Group of the European People's Party.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, along with {{official}} endeavors directed towards the accession of Romania into the European structures, political parties tried to integrate themselves into wider European families. Approaching the European People&rsquo;s Party (the most prominent {{group in the}} European Parliament) - dominated by Christian democrats whose existence was largely influenced by the Catholic social teaching - seemed {{to be one of}} the most difficult tasks. For their first European elections held in 2007 several Romanian political parties - apart from the National Christian Democrat Peasant Party (a member of the <b>European</b> Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> since 1987) - changed their orientation and claimed themselves as Christian Democratic. This article intends to explore the extent to which Romanian political parties who assert themselves as Christian-democratic can be considered to belong to this political family or whether their claim has a rather administrative motivation...|$|R

50|$|As a large Christian {{democratic}} party, the CDA {{is comparable}} to other <b>European</b> Christian <b>democratic</b> parties such as Germany's Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (although it's more moderate).

Both of these parties had roots in the Solidarity trade union movement. It {{represented}} <b>European</b> <b>democratic</b> and liberal tradition, i.e., it advocated free market economy and individual liberty, rejected extremism and fanaticism, favoured European integration (in the form of European Union membership), rapid privatisation of the enterprises still owned by the Polish state and decentralisation of the government.|$|R

40|$|This book {{discusses}} {{good governance}} in democratic {{societies in the}} context of globalisation from a cross-cultural perspective. India and the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> - <b>democratic</b> <b>unions</b> representing old histories, rich cultures and new aspirations - are viewed comparatively in order to assess what they can learn from each other. Moving beyond disciplinary demarcations, this volume considers the issues involved from a broader perspective. The 18 original essays, supplemented by a detailed introduction, are presented in three parts: the societal context of governance, administrative reforms, and corporate governance. These three parts have an important bearing on each other since administrative reforms provide a mechanism for good governance at the macro level which is in turn related to good governance at the corporate level. Dealing with a theme of considerable importance from a unique perspective, this volume will be of interest to a wide readership: social scientists, administrators, business executives, management students, NGOs, as well as international organisations like the World Bank. It will also serve as a text for courses on governance in general, public administration and corporate governance...|$|R

40|$|This is an {{introduction}} to a Special Issue that first considers representative and deliberative conceptions of democratic legitimacy in the EU, and then presents empirical research on how {{the institutions of the}} EU are attempting to increase the democratic legitimacy of the multi-level political system. The first three articles concern central democratic concepts and use political theory and institutional analysis. The second set of three articles turns to an empirical analysis of the institutions and institutional processes of the EU and the member states, including the European Commission and the media, the European Parliament and the Open Method of Coordination. It is concluded that both representative and deliberative mechanisms within each of the member states and the EU institutions need to be improved in order to increase the democratic legitimacy of the EU among the citizens.
