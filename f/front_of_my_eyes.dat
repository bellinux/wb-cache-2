AJE reported that Matar was forced at gunpoint to enter an unmarked car.

500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E

The worst thing is that she will suffer." [...] Pasternak's last words were, [...] "I can't hear very well.

The young boy was killed. His head was cut off. The body remained on the lap of the mother. The Serbian soldier placed the head of the young boy on his knife and showed it to everyone. … I saw how a pregnant woman was slaughtered. There were Serbs who stabbed her in the stomach, cut her open and took two small children out of her stomach and then beat them to death on the ground. I saw this with <b>my</b> own <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Çehre officially {{divorced}} Güney in April 1968, {{after only}} fifteen months of marriage. Abdurrahman Keskiner described another incident that occurred within {{the final days}} of Güney and Çehres marriage: [...] "...Yılmaz, Nebahat and I... One day they and Çehre had another quarrel at a night club. Nebahat angrily left the club. She didnt pay any attention when Yılmaz said stop. As Nebahat began running towards the hotel that they were staying at in Elmadağ, Yılmaz hopped into his automobile. He angrily passed the steering wheel. Then, in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>eyes,</b> he ran over the woman he loved with his car. Nebahat flew up into the air, smashed on to the car and then on to the sidewalk... She stayed in hospital for four days. We hid this incident from everybody. Their relationship ended after the incident. But their love never, ever ended." [...] The incident resulted in Çehre to having had broken her right-collarbone.|$|R
2500|$|In 1948 in an {{apartment}} in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his [...] "Blake vision"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as [...] "voice of the ancient of days". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked {{at the sky and}} intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: [...] "living blue hand itself. [...] Or that God was in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> - existence itself was God" [...] and [...] "And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 24, 1989, at a {{press conference}} at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Washington, DC, Minister Farrakhan {{described}} a vision which he had on September 17, 1985 in Tepoztlán, Mexico. In this 'Vision-like' experience he was carried up to [...] "a Wheel, or what you call an unidentified flying object", as in the Bible's Book of Ezekiel. During this experience, he heard the voice of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He said in the press conference that Elijah Muhammad [...] "spoke in short cryptic sentences and as he spoke a scroll full of cursive writing rolled down in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> but it was a projection of what was being written in my mind. As I attempted to read the cursive writing, which was in English, the scroll disappeared and the Honorable Elijah Muhammad began to speak to me." [...] , [...] "President Reagan has met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan a war. I want you to hold a press conference in Washington, D.C., and announce their plan and say to the world that you got the information from me, Elijah Muhammad, on the Wheel." ...|$|E
2500|$|His work is methodical, because [...] "an artwork {{is not an}} act of 'imagination' (...) but of observation, perception, form manipulation." [...] "I {{start with}} shapes, still arbitrary. I put ten shapes on the frame; I {{look at it and}} {{suddenly}} a sort of spark ignites. Then the form appears. Color is secondary, used to accentuate the intensity of the form." [...] Nadir Afonso did not renege on his early expressionist and surrealist works: [...] "An individual initially does not see the true nature of things, he starts by representing the real, because he is convinced therein lies the essence of the artwork. I thought that too. But, as I kept working, the underlying laws of art, which are the laws of geometry, slowly revealed themselves in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> There was no effort on my part, it was just the daily work what led me to that result, guided by intuition." [...] The illustrations in this article are a chronological representation of the evolution of Nadir Afonso's style and thought towards the original geometric alphabet with which he created his artworks, as explained in his books and seen most prominently in his Cities series.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{an ideal}} {{atmosphere}} for a bedroom. The air was heavy with many chemical odours, that of methylated spirit predominating. Nor were the decorations <b>of</b> <b>my</b> chamber very sedative. The odious line of glass jars with their relics of disease and suffering stretched in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> very <b>eyes.</b> There was no blind to the window, and a three-quarter moon streamed its white light into the room, tracing a silver square with filigree lattices upon the opposite wall. When I had extinguished my candle this one bright patch {{in the midst of}} the general gloom had certainly an eerie and discomposing aspect. A rigid and absolute silence reigned throughout the old house, so that the low swish of the branches in the garden came softly and smoothly to my ears. It may have been the hypnotic lullaby of this gentle susurrus, or it may have been the result <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tiring day, but after many dozings and many efforts to regain <b>my</b> clearness <b>of</b> perception, I fell at last into a deep and dreamless sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{diagram of}} numerals which I usually see has roughly {{the shape of}} a horse-shoe, lying on a {{slightly}} inclined plane, with the open end towards me. It always comes into view in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> me, a little to the left, so that the right hand branch of the horse-shoe, at the bottom of which I place 0, is in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> left <b>eye.</b> When I move <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> without moving <b>my</b> head, the diagram remains fixed in space and does not follow the movement <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> When I move the head the diagram unconsciously follows the movement, but I can, by an effort, keep it fixed in space as before. I can also shift it from one part of the field to the other, and even turn it upside down. I use the diagram as a resting-place for the memory, placing a number on it and finding it again when wanted. A remarkable property of the diagram is a sort of elasticity which enables me to join the two ends of the horse-shoe together when I want to connect 100 with 0. The same elasticity causes me to see that part of the diagram on which I fix my attention larger than the rest." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} after the war, Schoenebeck gave his own account: [...] "One day we flew {{both to the}} front. That was done often because a flight of 2 is harder to spot than a whole squadron. If one {{was smart enough to}} use the sun in one's back, the enemy could be easily surprised. Wolff was a smart leader and from the sun we attacked an enemy flight. Wolff was shooting brilliantly but got caught in a dogfight. I flew behind him, as suddenly another Englishman appeared behind me. I only was able {{to get rid of him}} with great difficulty. While I was busy shaking off the Englishman, another machine attacked Wolff from behind and before I could help I saw how Wolff was going down into a spin and hit the ground. So was Lt. Wolff, who had me for covering him and who had to protect myself, falling in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> very <b>eyes.</b> I was deeply shocked. At his funeral I had to carry his cushion of decorations." ...|$|R

40|$|I was {{twenty-eight years}} old when I visited the Whitney Museum for the first time. I {{immediately}} dashed to see the beloved painting The Artist and His Mother by Arshile Gorky. As I stood in awe in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the painting, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> wandered to the museum placard. It read ‘‘Arshile Gorky, American Artist. ’’ My heart stopped. It felt like as if the wave of genocide denial so often experienced by those of Armenian descent had crashed against that wall of the Whitney—erasing not only Gorky’s heritage but my own. A scholar in the field would have known what to expect. At the time, I was young and unprepared for this experience. How could Gorky be just an ‘‘American’’ {{in the eyes of}} the Whitney, without the slightest hint of his origins or experiences...|$|R
6000|$|As I moved thus mildly and vaguely in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the bookstall, <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> {{caught a}} sudden and scarlet title that for the moment {{staggered}} me. On the outside of a book I saw written in large letters, [...] "Get On or Get Out." [...] The {{title of the book}} recalled to me with a sudden revolt and reaction all that does seem unquestionably new and nasty; it reminded me that there was in the world of to-day that utterly idiotic thing, a worship of success; a thing that only means surpassing anybody in anything; a thing that may mean being the most successful person in running away from a battle; a thing that may mean being the most successfully sleepy of the whole row of sleeping men. When I saw those words the silence and sanctity of the railway station were for the moment shadowed. Here, I thought, there is at any rate something anarchic and violent and vile. This title, at any rate, means the most disgusting individualism of this individualistic world. In the fury <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bitterness and passion I actually bought the book, thereby ensuring that my enemy would get some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> money. I opened it prepared to find some brutality, some blasphemy, which would really be an exception to the general silence and sanctity of the railway station. I was prepared to find something in the book that was as infamous as its title.|$|R

Davy and me was sitting here talking about having the banns called, and it was a sorry talk, lady, for the vicar, he's told me four times I should not marry Davy, because he says he is a Radical; but for all that Davy and me wants the banns called all the same, but not knowing how we was to have it done, for the vicar, he's so set against Davy, and Davy, he had just got done saying to me {{that he was going to}} marry me, vicar or no vicar, banns or no banns, come what might, when that very minute, with an awful hiss, {{something}} flashed in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> us, dazzling <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> so that I shut them and screamed, and then when I opened them again, there, in the yard back of us, was a great white spirit twice as high as the cow stable, with one eye in the middle of its forehead, turning around like a firework. I don't remember anything after that, and I don't know how long I was lying here when you came and found me, lady, but I know what it means. There is a curse on our marriage, and Davy and me will never be man and wife." [...] And then she fell to groaning and moaning.|$|R
60|$|I {{raised my}} tumbler to my lips, and nodded to him. Then I rose to my feet, but almost as I did so, I {{realized}} what had happened. The floor heaved up beneath my feet, my knees trembled, I felt the perspiration break out upon my forehead. Through the mist which was gathering in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I {{could see the}} half-curious, half-derisive glances of the other occupants of the room; and opposite, Mr. Stanley, his eyes blinking at me from behind his spectacles, his expression one of grieved concern.

60|$|The {{room was}} {{a replica of the}} one I had just left. If possible, it was more crowded, more packed with {{miscellaneous}} articles. I picked my way through these and approached the desk. Mr. Lott was a small, dingy-looking man, with very dirty hands, and small, restless eyes. I was glad that he was not imposing, or my shyness might have descended upon me; as it was, I felt better able to do myself justice. At once he plunged into the business by seizing and waving in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> a bulky bundle of letters tied together with red tape.|$|E
