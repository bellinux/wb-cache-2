Will is eventually released from the prison and taken to the Jerome's home, where Will and Cal's Uncle Tam is delighted to see him and informs Will that his adoptive father, Dr. Burrows, was recently there, and had willingly traveled down into the Deeps — a place even deeper in the Earth than The Colony. Will learns that the Styx, the religious rulers of the Colony, are <b>either</b> <b>going</b> to enslave Chester or banish him to the Deeps to fend for himself.

25|$|The {{summit of}} Càrn Mairg is steep sided, partly craggy and {{is made up}} of greyish {{quartzite}} stones. South west of the summit are steep slopes which fall to the head of Coire Chearcaill which is drained by the Allt Coire a' Chearcaill, a tributary of the Invervar Burn and contains an old stalkers bothy on its lower north bank. The northern slopes fall to the glen containing Loch Rannoch and Loch Tummel while to the north east is Gleann Mòr which separates the mountain from Schiehallion which is four km distant. All drainage from the mountain feeds the River Tay <b>either</b> <b>going</b> north and then via the River Tummel or south and via the River Lyon.|$|E
25|$|The lower slopes on the SE {{side of the}} {{mountain}} are composed of ice polished slabs dotted with long flowing mounds of debris, this is fluted moraine, deposited from a glacier, the mounds are less than four metres in height but up to 400 metres in length. The mountains visual attraction is further added to by the presence of four small lochs around its NE flanks, they are all on different levels. One of these lochs, Loch a’ Mhadaidh Ruadh, is rated {{as one of the most}} beautiful in the Scottish Highlands, it is located on the Bealach a’ Choire Ghairbh and is enclosed by walls of quartzite rock, giving it an almost artificial look. All drainage from {{the mountain}} makes the short journey to the west coast of Scotland, <b>either</b> <b>going</b> directly west to Upper Loch Torridon or SE to Glen Carron and then Loch Carron.|$|E
25|$|Shel (Cissy Jones) and {{her younger}} sister, Becca (Brett Pels) have joined a large group who have {{acquired}} the truck stop some time after Russell's story and were the same group Dee stole from in Bonnie's story. Several {{members of the group}} are also former cancer patients who Lee encounter in Episode 4 of the main story and who stole Kenny's boat. Roman (Kid Beyond) holds tight control {{as the leader of the}} group, and when Roberto, a scavenger, attempts to steal from the group on Day 236 of the outbreak, Roman debates whether to have him kill the scavenger or let him go and risk their safety, making Shel give the deciding vote. Sometime after on Day 259, the consequences of her choice have splintered the group's security or positivity. When another group member Stephanie (Dana Bauer) is caught stealing supplies, Roman asks Shel to kill her, leading Shel to consider <b>either</b> <b>going</b> through with it or fleeing the camp with Becca.|$|E

25|$|Beinn a’ Chuallaich’s large bulk {{dominates the}} village of Kinloch Rannoch and {{contains}} several long ridges and two significant corries. The longest of the ridges goes north and then NE taking in the subsidiary top of Meall nan Eun (852 metres) before broadening and descending NE to the shores of Loch Errochty. The top of Meall nan Eun {{is marked by a}} ring of stones and gives a fine view of Loch Errochty which is not visible from the main summit. Loch na Caillich stands on this NE ridge at a height of around 700 metres and is a well known gathering point for deer with Charles Plumb describing it as a place “where the deer love to wallow”. Coire Odhar on {{the eastern side of the}} hill is ringed by cliffs which fall from the summit, the corrie itself contains some very large detached boulders. The western corrie, known as Coire Labhrainn is drained by the Allt Mòr which is a fine sight after heavy rain as it roars through the woodland above Kinloch Rannoch and through the village to join the River Tummel. All drainage from the mountain joins the River Tay eventually <b>either</b> <b>going</b> by Glen Errochty or Strath Tummel. Some of the streams on the eastern side of the hill have been diverted into the Errochty catchwater as part of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme.|$|E

Johns believed Diorama would be [...] "the kind of record that people were <b>either</b> <b>going</b> to be into or were really going to hate", and needed a producer who would understand the band's new direction.

[...] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.|$|E
