5000|$|While Todd-AO was {{intended}} to be [...] "Cinerama out of one hole", the extreme wide angle photography and projection onto a very deeply curved screen (which is what that would imply) saw little use. Most Todd-AO theatre installations had only moderately curved screens and the extreme wide angle camera lenses were used only on a few shots here and there. Todd-AO films made after 1958 used a conventional flat widescreen, and resembled ordinary films, except <b>for</b> their <b>greater</b> <b>clarity</b> and six-track stereo sound. A variation on Todd-AO called Dimension 150 did, however, make use of Cinerama-like deeply curved screens. Only two films were made in Dimension 150 - The Bible: In the Beginning, directed by John Huston, and Patton, starring George C. Scott. In some venues, however, Todd-AO and Dimension 150 films received their first run in Cinerama theatres in order that they be shown on a deeply curved screen - such as the first Atlanta, Georgia showings of The Sound of Music.|$|R

5000|$|Because of the {{standard}} 35 mm-size film, CinemaScope and its stereophonic sound was capable of being retrofitted into existing theaters.

However, because the film needed a new, specially designed projector, the system proved impractical, and the two films made in the process, Carousel and The King and I, were released in 35 mm CinemaScope reduction prints. To compensate, the premiere engagement of Carousel used a six-track magnetic full-coat in an interlock, and a 1961 re-release of The King and I, featured the film [...] "printed down" [...] to 70 mm, used a six-track stereo soundtrack as well.|$|R

40|$|As {{policymakers and}} {{researchers}} focus increasing {{attention on the}} importance of government transparency for accountability and good governance more generally, the demand <b>for</b> <b>greater</b> conceptual <b>clarity</b> and authoritative measures of government transparency increases. Transparency advocates maintain that greater access to government information is {{the sine qua non of}} greater accountability and better quality of government in the long term. As a concept, transparency is, similar to rule of law or democracy, difficult to capture with single empirical indicators. This paper introduces a set of measures that we argue together capture key components of government transparency: government openness, whistleblower protection and likelihood of exposure (or publicity). The transparency data, collected through an expert survey carried out by the Quality of Government Institute, currently cover 52 countries with additional countries to be added in subsequent surveys. This paper explores these new measures in an effort to determine their validity and robustness...|$|R

40|$|The {{communication}} of uncertainty in clinical evidence {{is an important}} endeavor that poses difficult conceptual, methodological, and ethical problems. Conceptual problems include logical paradoxes in the meaning of probability and “ambiguity”— second-order uncertainty arising {{from the lack of}} reliability, credibility, or adequacy of probability information. Methodological problems include questions about optimal methods for representing fundamental uncertainties and for communicating these uncertainties in clinical practice. Ethical problems include questions about whether communicating uncertainty enhances or diminishes patient autonomy and produces net benefits or harms. This article reviews the limited but growing literature on these problems and efforts to address them and identifies key areas of focus for future research. It is argued that the critical need moving forward is <b>for</b> <b>greater</b> conceptual <b>clarity</b> and consistent representational methods that make the meaning of various uncertainties understandable, and for clinical interventions to support patients in coping with uncertainty in decision making...|$|R
40|$|Situated {{learning}} theory offers a radical critique of cognitivist theories of learning, emphasizing the relational aspects of learning within communities of practice {{in contrast to}} the individualist assumptions of conventional theories. However, although many researchers have embraced the theoretical strength of situated {{learning theory}}, conceptual issues remain undeveloped in the literature. Roberts, for example, argues in this issue that the notion of ‘communities of practice'- a core concept in situated learning theory - is itself problematic. To complement her discussion, this paper explores the communities of practice concept from several perspectives. Firstly, we consider the perspective of the individual learner, and examine the processes which constitute ‘situated learning'. Secondly, we consider the broader socio-cultural context in which communities of practice are embedded. We argue that the cultural richness of this broader context generates a fluidity and heterogeneity within and beyond communities. Finally, we argue that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish conceptually between the terms ‘participation' and ‘practice' because of occasional duplication of meaning. We propose, instead, a refinement of the definition to allow <b>for</b> <b>greater</b> conceptual <b>clarity...</b>|$|R
