5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} {{sedentary}} lifestyle at this point, {{not having a}} <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E

5|$|Gyeongju has {{produced}} notable individuals throughout its history. As {{the capital of}} Silla, Gyeongju was a center of culture in its heyday. Notable Gyeongju residents in the Silla period included most of the kingdom's leading figures, not only rulers but scholars such as Seol Chong and Choe Chi-won, and generals like Kim Yusin, {{the leader of the}} Hwarang warriors. The city continued to contribute to traditional Korean thought in subsequent dynasties. Relatives of Choe Chi-won such as Choe Eon-wui and Choe Hang {{played an important role in}} establishing the structures of early Goryeo. In the Joseon period, Gyeongju joined the rest of Gyeongsang in becoming a hotbed of the conservative Sarim faction. Notable Gyeongju members of this faction included the 15th century intellectual Yi Eon-jeok. He has been enshrined in the Oksan Seowon since 1572. In modern times, the city produced writers such as Kim Dong-ni and Park Mok-wol, both of whom did a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> popularize the region's culture, as well as Choe Jun, a wealthy businessman who established the Yeungnam University Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the credibility of the conversion of the khagan to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. The conversion of the khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E
25|$|Cul-de-sac (1966) is a bleak nihilist tragicomedy filmed on {{location}} in Northumberland. The tone and premise of the film owe a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, along with aspects of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party.|$|E

Much of this aid was designed to restore infrastructure and help refugees. Britain, for example, received an emergency loan of $3.75 billion.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish {{leadership}} {{decided to}} center the {{struggle in the}} illegal immigration to Palestine and began organizing massive amount of Jewish war refugees from Europe, without {{the approval of the}} British authorities.

25|$|The years 1856-58 on the Texas {{frontier}} {{were particularly}} vicious and bloody as settlers continued to encroach into the Comancheria. They plowed under valuable hunting grounds and the Comanche lost grazing land for their herds of horses.

25|$|An iconostasis, {{also called}} the templon, is a wall of icons and {{religious}} paintings, separating the nave from the sanctuary in a church. Iconostasis also refers to a portable icon stand that can be placed anywhere within a church. The modern iconostasis evolved from the Byzantine templon in the 11th century. The evolution of the iconostasis probably owes a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> 14th-century Hesychast mysticism and the wood-carving genius of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E
25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time {{and the ability to}} restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E

In 1622–23 the Leeuwin made the first recorded rounding of the south west corner of the continent, and gave her name to Cape Leeuwin.|$|E

25|$|Black liberation {{theology}} was first systematized by James Cone and Dwight Hopkins.

In 1969, Cone published the seminal work that laid the basis for black {{liberation theology}}, Black Theology and Black Power. In the book, Cone asserted {{that not only was}} black power not alien to the Gospel, it was, in fact, the Gospel message for all of 20th century America.|$|E
25|$|Public {{views are}} crucial {{to the success of}} opt-out or presumed consent {{donation}} systems. In a study done to determine if health policy change to a presumed consent or opt-out system would help to increase donors, an increase of 20 to 30 percent was seen among countries who changed their policies from some type of opt-in system to an opt-out system. Of course, this increase must have a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> do with the health policy change, but also may be influenced by other factors that could have impacted donor increases.|$|E

Further the threat of encirclement and capture of Hodgson's force meant there was little to be gained and a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> lose from further fighting.
