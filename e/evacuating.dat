5|$|Major-General Charles George Gordon {{was given}} the job of <b>evacuating</b> the Egyptian {{garrison}} from Khartoum. He arrived on 18 February 1884. Gordon was reluctant to abandon the population of Khartoum to {{the forces of the}} Mahdi, and also felt that by <b>evacuating</b> the city he would open the way for the Mahdi to threaten Egypt. He bombarded the authorities in Cairo with telegrams suggesting alternative courses, and delayed starting the evacuation. On 13 March 1884 the tribes north of Khartoum declared for the Mahdi, cutting the telegraph and blocking river traffic. Khartoum was besieged, falling on 25 January 1885 after a siege of 313 days. A relief column arrived two days after the city had fallen and Gordon had been killed. Despite a short-lived public outcry in Britain over Gordon's death, Britain took no further action in Sudan for several years.|$|E

5|$|The French Navy and Air Force {{had been}} {{depleted}} during World War II. They {{were unable to}} deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees.

France asked Washington for assistance, so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to mobilise an evacuation task force.|$|E
