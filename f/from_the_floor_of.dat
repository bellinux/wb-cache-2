25|$|Knowles battled {{multiple}} sclerosis from 1946, {{but it was}} his 1981 stroke that ultimately removed him from public life.

25|$|According to news {{accounts}} from around that time, the assassination {{was carried out}} in a backroom of the Yanceyville courthouse. Stephens was in attendance at a Democratic gathering, in an attempt to convince a prominent Democrat to run for Sheriff as a Republican. The man he was attempting to sway signaled to him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the hall, and Stephens followed him downstairs. Knowing Stephens' reputation for being quite well armed, his Klan assassins had assembled between eight and twelve men who lay in wait in a darkened room on the Caswell County Courthouse's first floor.|$|E
25|$|Heart Mountain is an 8,123-foot (2,476 m) klippe {{just north}} of Cody in the U.S. state of Wyoming, rising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Bighorn Basin. The {{mountain}} is composed of limestone and dolomite of Ordovician through Mississippian age (about 500 to 350 million years old), but it rests on the Willwood Formation, rocks that are about 55 million years old—rock on the summit of Heart Mountain is thus almost 300 million years older than the rocks at the base. For over one hundred years, geologists have tried to understand how these older rocks {{came to rest on}} much younger strata.|$|E
25|$|However, as yet the baldachino has {{not been}} constructed. In front of the altar in the {{sanctuary}} floor are two pieces of mosaic from the Holy Land, brought back after being uncovered during the First World War by the Australian Light Horse Regiment.

The other is a fragment <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> a 6th-century Christian church at Gaza and {{is part of a larger}} mosaic now housed in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Beyond the high altar the cathedral ends in a semicircular apse and ambulatory (processional aisle), a link to the architecture's French-Norman past.|$|E

25|$|Some early ichthyosaurs were durophagous and had flat convex teeth {{adapted for}} {{crushing}} shellfish. They thus ate benthos <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> more shallow seas. Other species were perhaps suction feeders, sucking animals into their mouths by quickly opening their relatively short jaws. This was first assumed for Shonisaurus, which giant by this means might have secured a constant food supply for its huge body, and in 2011 for the short-snouted Guanlingsaurus liangae. However, in 2013 a {{study concluded that}} the hyoid bone of ichthyosaurs, at the tongue base, was insufficiently ossified to support a sucking movement and suggested the alternative that such species were ram feeders, gathering food by constantly swimming forwards with a wide open mouth.|$|E

One of his duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of the globe. In this respect he is like the conductor of an orchestra in which the instruments are slide-rules and calculating machines. But instead of waving a baton he turns a beam of rosy light upon any region that is running ahead of the rest, and a beam of blue light upon those who are behindhand.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the damage}} to {{adjacent}} container AVN7511 to guide them, the investigators concluded that the explosion had occurred about 13inches (330mm) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> AVE4041 and about 25inches (640mm) from {{the skin of the}} fuselage. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigators then conducted a series of tests in the United States, at which Alan Feraday of Britain's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) is understood to have been present. The tests involved using metal containers loaded with luggage, and detonating plastic explosive within Toshiba radio cassette players in garment-filled suitcases, so as to replicate the sooting and pitting pattern of AVE4041. The tests were said to have proved AAIB investigators' theory concerning both the position of the bomb and the quantity of explosive involved.|$|E

25|$|The {{velocity}} of a tsunami {{can be calculated}} by obtaining the square root of {{the depth of the}} water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10m/s2). For example, if the Pacific Ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres, the {{velocity of}} a tsunami would be the square root of √(5000 × 10) = √50000 = ~224 metres per second (735 feet per second), which equates to a speed of ~806 kilometres per hour or about 500 miles per hour. This formula is the same as used for calculating the velocity of shallow waves, because a tsunami behaves like a shallow wave as it peak to peak value reaches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the ocean to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Pavey Ark is {{the largest}} cliff in the Langdales, but faces east over Stickle Tarn and is less {{prominent}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Great Langdale away to the south. The main face is {{a little over a}} quarter of a mile across and drops about 400ft. To the south-west it merges into the crags of Harrison Stickle, while the northern end peters out into the valley of Bright Beck. Stickle Tarn is wholly within the territory of the Ark, a corrie tarn which has been dammed to create additional capacity. The stone-faced barrage is low enough not to spoil the character of the pool, and the water is used for public consumption in the hotels and homes below. The tarn has a depth of around 50ft.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{moving to}} the Senate in March 1927, Hayden {{continued}} {{his opposition to the}} Boulder Canyon Project. With growing national support for the project, however, it became obvious to Hayden that passage of the bill was inevitable. Seeking time to gain terms more favorable to Arizona, he continued his opposition with the aid of two filibusters from Arizona's other Senator, Henry F. Ashurst, and was able to delay a vote of the full Senate on the measure {{until the end of the}} 70th Congress' first session. When the Swing-Johnston bill came up for a vote on May 28, 1928 Hayden made his first speech <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the Senate, a filibuster in which he spoke for nine hours during an all-night session before allowing Ashurst to take over for another twelve hours.|$|E
