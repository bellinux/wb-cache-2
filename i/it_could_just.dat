25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, a shophouse often {{contains}} a shop with separate residential spaces. More generally, space {{occupied by the}} former contains a semi-public function. While this usually is, and historically usually was, a shop, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily be a food and beverage outlet (e.g. coffeeshop or bar), a service provider (e.g. clinic or barber), an industrial activity (e.g. cottage industry or auto workshop) or a community space (e.g. a school or clan association). Residential spaces are meant to accommodate one or more families, or serve as a dormitory for single workers. Popular belief holds that shophouses were initially occupied by single families, with their private living areas in one space and the more public family business in another. However, {{it is possible that}} the two spaces were always usually used by unrelated persons or groups, who may be tenants or resident owners. The position of the shop and residential space depends on the number of floors of the shophouse: A single storey shophouse tends to include residential space behind the shop, while residential spaces in shophouses of two or more storeys are typically located above the shop.|$|E

When James McTeigue was asked whether or not BTN was based on Fox News Channel, McTeigue replied, [...] "Yes. But not just Fox.

500|$|During the 20th century, one {{illustration}} was repeatedly– and wrongly– {{published as}} [...] "Christopher Wren, {{design for the}} Theatre Royal Drury Lane, 1674". Since 1964, this presumption has been disputed by scholars. Careful inspection of the drawing at All Soul's Library shows that it has one pencil inscription: [...] "Play house" [...] , {{which may have been}} added by a librarian or by anyone else. No sign of a signature (by Wren or anyone else) or a date appears anywhere on the drawing. Robert D. Hume of Penn State University explained that use of the drawing [...] "rests almost entirely on the supposition that the so-called [...] "Wren section" [...] at All Souls represents this theatre. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily be a discarded sketch unconnected to Drury Lane in any way." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the ninth best {{episode of the}} show with a sports theme. Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, praised the episode {{as one of the}} best from season two. He commented that the miniature golf challenges [...] "are delightful, the denouncement is highly amusing , and the beauty of the whole episode is that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily be an episode in a live action TV sitcom, though the slight touches of fancy enabled by the animation enhance its comic impact." [...] Dusty Sanders of the Rocky Mountain News commented that the title of the episode is [...] "funnier than the content of most TV sitcoms." [...] The reference to The Karate Kid was named the 21st greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E
500|$|John Kricfalusi, {{the creator}} of The Ren & Stimpy Show, claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump", {{which was part of}} a cartoon book series {{viewable}} online. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, [...] "I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!'... This idea of [...] singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea." [...] Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of South Park were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company Spümcø was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump" [...] and that the claim was [...] "ludicrous". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of Ren & Stimpy, which {{he said he did not}} enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying. Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the South Park creators: [...] "He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, I see how <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be a coincidence, but you should just admit to the press that you're a big Ren and Stimpy fan.' — I'm not a Ren and Stimpy fan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Electrotyping {{was used}} for general purpose type {{manufacture}} in the nineteenth century, but was a somewhat disreputable process, leading to some typefounders disdaining it (or at least claiming to). This was because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily be used to pirate another company’s type as an original design. (It was also used to revive older typefaces in cases where original punches had not survived but matrices or type had, and so sometimes for licensed copying of typefaces in order to send matrices to other countries.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with CNN, Edward Castronova, a professor of Telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington {{said he was not}} surprised by the outcome of the Australian study but also discussed the issue of causal connection. [...] "Though there is a link between gaming and higher math and science scores, it doesn't mean playing games caused the higher scores. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be that kids who are sharp are looking for a challenge, and they don't find it on social media, and maybe they do find it on board games and video games," [...] he explained.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{emphasis}} {{is not on}} us (our sinfulness) but on God’s mercy and salvific action in Jesus Christ. [...] <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as accurately be translated [...] "O Lord, you are merciful!" [...] Note that the sample tropes all mention what Christ has done for us, not how we have sinned. [...] For example, “you were sent to heal the contrite,” “you have shown us {{the way to the}} Father,” or “you come in word and sacrament to strengthen us in holiness,” leading to further acclamation of God’s praises in the Gloria.|$|E

Although the town is officially known as [...] "Stanley", one frequently hears it still referred to as [...] "Port Stanley", especially in British reports about the Falklands War.

50|$|Kesh was {{an ancient}} Sumerian city and {{religious}} site, whose patron goddess was Ninhursag.

Unlike the original DeLorean, the flux capacitor is in the front of the cockpit along with a small screen, the time circuits, and the speedometer. The original DeLorean is also shown to have its original [...] "OUTATIME" [...] license plate instead of the bar code license plate, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> mean that this DeLorean is actually a new one being built into a time machine. However, in a post-credits scene, Clara Clayton, who has built Hover Train with Doc, currently repaired the DeLorean and travels back to 1947 to a farm.|$|E
2500|$|Repsold-Bessel pendulum: It was {{time-consuming}} and error-prone to repeatedly swing the Kater's pendulum {{and adjust the}} weights until the periods were equal. [...] Friedrich Bessel showed in 1835 that this was unnecessary. [...] As long as the periods were close together, the gravity could be calculated from the two periods {{and the center of}} gravity of the pendulum. [...] So the reversible pendulum didn't need to be adjustable, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be a bar with two pivots. Bessel also showed that if the pendulum was made symmetrical in form about its center, but was weighted internally at one end, the errors due to air drag would cancel out. Further, another error due to the finite diameter of the knife edges could be made to cancel out if they were interchanged between measurements. Bessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract by the Swiss Geodetic Commission made a pendulum along these lines. [...] The Repsold pendulum was about 56cm long and had a period of about [...] second. It was used extensively by European geodetic agencies, and with the Kater pendulum in the Survey of India. Similar pendulums of this type were designed by Charles Pierce and C. Defforges.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 March, Room 40 had intercepted {{a message}} which clearly {{demonstrated}} that the Germans had broken the code used to pass messages to British merchant ships. Cruisers protecting merchant ships were warned {{not to use the}} code to give directions to shipping because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily attract enemy submarines as steer ships away from them. Queenstown (Cobh since Irish independence) was not given this warning and continued to give directions in the compromised code, which was not changed until after Lusitanias sinking. At this time the Navy was significantly involved with operations leading up to the landings at Gallipoli, and the intelligence department had been undertaking a program of misinformation to convince Germany to expect an attack on her northern coast. As part of this, ordinary cross-channel traffic to the Netherlands was halted from 19 April and false reports were leaked about troop ship movements from British west and south coast ports. This led to a demand from the German army for offensive action against the expected troop movements, and consequently, a surge in German submarine activity on the British west coast. The fleet was warned to expect additional submarines, but this warning was not passed on to those sections of the navy dealing with merchant vessels. The return of the battleship Orion from Devonport to Scotland was delayed until 4 May and she was given orders to stay [...] from the Irish coast.|$|E

(31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next to us with the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of my sight.

We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days.
