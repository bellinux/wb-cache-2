5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob wishes he could fly with the jellyfish. He makes several attempts to do so, but all of these fail. At home, SpongeBob is drying his hair and receives a phone call, he puts the hair <b>dryer</b> in his square pants, and the <b>dryer</b> inflates them, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts. However, other characters continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish.|$|E
5|$|Blade Runner has {{numerous}} deep {{similarities to}} Fritz Lang's Metropolis, including a built-up urban environment, {{in which the}} wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building– the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in Blade Runner. Special effects supervisor David <b>Dryer</b> used stills from Metropolis when lining up Blade Runners miniature building shots.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Black sought {{election}} to the United States Senate from Alabama, following the retirement of Senator Oscar Underwood. Since the Democratic Party dominated Alabama politics at the time, he easily defeated his Republican opponent, E. H. <b>Dryer,</b> winning 80.9% of the vote. He was reelected in 1932, winning 86.3% of the vote against Republican J. Theodore Johnson.|$|E
50|$|Like {{heat pump}} <b>dryers,</b> {{mechanical}} steam compression <b>dryers</b> recycle {{much of the}} heat used to dry the clothes, and they operate in a very similar range of efficiency as heat pump <b>dryers.</b> Both types can be over twice as efficient as traditional <b>dryers.</b> The considerably higher temperatures used in mechanical steam compression <b>dryers</b> result in drying times {{on the order of}} half as long as those of heat pump <b>dryers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The drying {{technology}} {{department is}} headed by Dr. Ing. Mathias Trojosky. The drying technology that has been developed by Allgaier is notable due to its ability to conserve time, space, and energy while excelling in quality. Specialized machine types include Rotary <b>dryers,</b> Fluidized bed <b>dryers,</b> Rolling bed <b>dryers,</b> Suspension and Paste <b>dryers,</b> and Dispersion <b>dryers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thermal drying {{is usually}} used for fine {{particles}} and to remove low water {{content in the}} particles. Some common processes include rotary <b>dryers,</b> fluidised beds, spray driers, hearth <b>dryers</b> and rotary tray <b>dryers.</b> This process is usually expensive to operate due to the fuel requirement of the <b>dryers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob's pants have shrunk in the <b>dryer.</b> Unable {{to find a new}} pair, he tries round pants, but no one seems to recognizes him as SpongeBob RoundPants.|$|E
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in <b>dryer</b> circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers (ITS and ETS), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pdh) region, in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera. They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of the arid Northern Territory (F. platypoda, F. subpuberula and F. lilliputiana) and classified it in a new series Obliquae in the subsection Platypodeae. The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into <b>dryer</b> regions.|$|E

40|$|Drying for {{agricultural}} and marine products {{are one of}} the most attractive and cost-effective application of solar energy. Numerous types of solar <b>dryers</b> have been designed and developed in various parts of the world, yielding varying degrees of technical performance. Basically, there are four types of solar dryers; (1) direct solar <b>dryers,</b> (2) indirect solar <b>dryers,</b> (3) mixed-mode <b>dryers</b> and (4) hybrid solar <b>dryers.</b> This paper is a review of these types of solar <b>dryers</b> with aspect to the product being dried, technical and economical aspects. The technical directions in the development of solar-assisted drying systems {{for agricultural}} produce are compact collector design, high efficiency, integrated storage, and long-life drying system. Air-based solar collectors are not the only available systems. Water-based collectors can also be used whereby water to air heat exchanger can be used. The hot air for drying of agricultural produce can be forced to flow in the water to air heat exchanger. The hot water tank acts as heat storage of the solar drying system.

5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia {{are very}} similar in appearance. The foliages of larger shrubs of both Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} resemble those of Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but the latter has a wider inflorescence, and the buds are more crowded in appearance on the inflorescence before anthesis. Banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but the latter has a prominent midrib on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on <b>dryer</b> rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin prefers more arid habitat {{than its}} relatives, and inhabits <b>dryer</b> areas while the scarlet robin {{occupies}} wetter forests where they co-occur. The red-capped robin's preferred habitat is dry Acacia, Callitris or mixed scrubland or woodland, dominated by such species as mulga (Acacia aneura), Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae), raspberry jam (Acacia acuminata), black cypress-pine (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress-pine (C. columellaris), and slender cypress-pine (C. preissii) with understory shrubs such as Cassia, hop-bush (Dodonaea), emu bush (Eremophila) and spinifex (Triodia).|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in central, southern, and western Tasmania and is absent from warmer, <b>dryer</b> areas. It grows on moist acidic soils in wet sclerophyll forest or subalpine scrub at altitudes of 600 to 1200m (2000–4000ft). It is an {{understory}} component of subalpine forest stands of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and alpine yellow gum (E. subcrenulata), as well as Athrotaxis selaginoides–Nothofagus gunnii short rainforest, Athrotaxis selaginoides rainforest, Leptospermum-with-rainforest scrub, the tall Nothofagus–Atherosperma rainforest and Nothofagus–Phyllocladus short rainforest. It is occasionally found in the Leptospermum scoparium–Acacia mucronata forest community of western Tasmania.|$|E

50|$|In the European Union, the EU energy {{labeling}} {{system is}} applied to dryers; <b>dryers</b> are classified with a label from A+++ (best) to G (worst) according {{to the amount of}} energy used per kilogram of clothes (kWh/kg). Sensor <b>dryers</b> can automatically sense that clothes are dry and switch off. This means over-drying is not as frequent. Most of the European market sells sensor <b>dryers</b> now, and they are normally available in condenser and vented <b>dryers.</b>|$|R
30|$|Main energy {{demanding}} {{processes of}} FPH manufacture are hydrolysation, concentration and drying steps. Drying at industrial scale is mostly utilized by spray <b>dryers</b> and, thus, their performance must be evaluated {{for making a}} conclusion on energy status of the operation. Moisture evaporation rate for most spray <b>dryers</b> {{is found in the}} range between 600 and 41, 000  kg/h (Baker and McKenzie 2005). Some pilot models of spray <b>dryers</b> have specific energy consumption in the range between 3 000 and 5500  kJ/kg of evaporated water (Al-Mansour et al. 2011), but the real heat consumption by industrial models of spray <b>dryers</b> is much higher. The average energy consumption for industrial spray <b>dryers</b> is in the range between 4 500 and 11 500  kJ/kg (Mujumdar 2007). The review, devoted to energy efficiency of spray <b>dryers</b> with respect to the industry, revealed the average energy consumption for food production as 4880  kJ/kg of evaporated water in the case of multi-stage spray <b>dryers</b> (Baker and McKenzie 2005).|$|R
5|$|Within {{the forest}} habitat, the red-winged fairywren prefers wetter gullies and {{riverside}} sword sedge (Lepidosperma effusum). It borders {{the range of}} the variegated fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the blue-breasted fairywren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying <b>dryer</b> scrub while the red-winged fairywren is restricted to wetter forests. The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all three taxa as separate species.|$|E
5|$|Doggett first {{appears in}} the fifth episode. She wishes to hang up a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture to fall down and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also {{displays}} transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her for {{the damage to the}} chapel. Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a <b>dryer</b> while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause for dancing provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the canopy of trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in <b>dryer</b> regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E

This work concerns the comparison between conventional <b>dryers</b> and <b>dryers</b> using air dehumidified by zeolite. Steady-state mass and energy balances have been used and the work concerns drying temperatures ranging from 52 to 70 °C. Process integration based on pinch analysis has been applied and nine different heat exchanger networks for energy recovery are compared. Results indicated that <b>dryers</b> using air dehumidifier by zeolites are 10 - 18 % more efficient than conventional <b>dryers...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh cheese is Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it could be brought to market, it was a moist cheese that would not last very long. Production of the cheese was halted due to milk {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was still made in England. There, the cheese was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a <b>dryer</b> cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{factor in}} nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa {{third and fourth}} chicks inevitably starve. In the <b>dryer</b> habitats with fewer amphibians the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to <b>dryer</b> {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E
5000|$|The largest <b>dryers</b> are {{normally}} used [...] "Off-farm", in elevators, and {{are of the}} continuous type: Mixed-flow <b>dryers</b> are preferred in Europe, while Cross-flow <b>dryers</b> in the United States. In Argentina, both types are commonly found. Continuous flow <b>dryers</b> may produce up to 100 metric tonnes of dried grain per hour. The depth of grain the air must traverse in continuous <b>dryers</b> range from some 0.15 m in Mixed flow <b>dryers</b> to some 0.30 m in Cross-Flow. Batch <b>dryers</b> are mainly used [...] "On-Farm", particularly in the United States and Europe. They normally consist of a bin, with heated air flowing horizontally from an internal cylinder through an inner perforated metal sheet, then through an annular grain bed, some 0.50 m thick (coaxial with the internal cylinder) in radial direction, and finally across the outer perforated metal sheet, before being discharged to the atmosphere. The usual drying times range from 1 h to 4 h {{depending on how much}} water must be removed, type of grain, air temperature and the grain depth. In the United States, continuous counterflow <b>dryers</b> may be found on-farm, adapting a bin to slowly drying grain fed at the top and removed {{at the bottom of the}} bin by a sweeping auger.|$|R

5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the <b>dryer</b> Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E

5|$|Within its range, {{the grey}} currawong is {{generally}} sedentary, {{although it is}} a winter visitor in the southeastern corner of Australia. Comparatively little studied, much of its behaviour and habits is poorly known. Omnivorous, it has a diet that includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Less arboreal than the pied currawong, the grey currawong spends more time foraging on the ground. It builds nests high in trees, which has limited the study of its breeding habits. Unlike its more common relative, it has adapted poorly to human impact and has declined in much of its range. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas as well as scrubland in <b>dryer</b> parts of the country.|$|E

30|$|The {{drying process}} of FPH is usually {{accomplished}} by {{a limited number}} of drying apparatus: they are typically spray <b>dryers</b> which provide convectional drying, and vacuum freeze <b>dryers</b> and roller drum <b>dryers</b> which utilize contact heat supply. From the experience, the authors suggest convection spray <b>dryers</b> as the most used drying systems at large scale in FPH production due to a satisfactory productivity, reasonable quality of the final FPH and a relative easiness of operation. The term “spray dryer” is used in this article to describe convectional spray dryers; the authors do not devote the work to spray drying using radiation or mixed heat transfer.|$|R
