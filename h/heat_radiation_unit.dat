Thermal manikin {{tests were}} {{performed}} on selected protective garments to assess their heat transfer properties during exposure to infrared <b>heat</b> <b>radiation.</b> Comparing a newly developed Infrared (IR) <b>Heat</b> <b>Radiation</b> attenuatuion vest with a standard winter jacket, it could be seen that that the IR Vest provided a thermal comfort benefit above a <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure level of 150 Watts while the winter jacket provided a thermal benefit above a 450 Watt <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure level. The study identified important temperature cross-over points which define the thermodynamic properties and also characterize the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> attenuation and <b>heat</b> insulation properties of garments.

40|$|Abstract—Heat {{radiation}} equation contains 4 th exponential {{order of}} temperature which makes mathematics analysis very complicated and troublesome. Therefore, most heat transfer experts and scholars believe, {{based on their}} own experiences, that the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> effect can be ignored due to small temperature difference between insulated surfaces and surrounding to simplify analysis. Due to this reason, insulation examples shown in most heat transfer, air conditioning and refrigeration text books, and some commercial packages for the design of insulations, commonly ignore the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>radiation.</b> However, this paper demonstrates that the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> effect can not be ignored in the situations of thin insulation with low ambient convective heat coefficient and a large surface emissivity. In those situations, ignoring the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> will result in an inaccurate insulation design. The paper also shows that a smaller insulated surface emissivity can largely promote the insulation effect.

40|$|Robust {{nonlinear}} {{control with}} compensation operator is presented for a Peltier actuated system, where the compensation operator is designed {{by using a}} predictive model on <b>heat</b> <b>radiation.</b> For the Peltier system, the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> {{is related to the}} fourth power of temperature. So, the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> is affected evidently by the temperature when it is high and temperature difference between the system and environment is large. A new nonlinear model with the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> is set up for the system according to some thermal conduction laws. To ensure robust stability of the nonlinear system, operator based robust right coprime factorization design is considered. Also, a compensation operator based on a predictive model is proposed to cancel effect of the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation,</b> where the predictive model is set up by using radial basis kernel function based SVM (support vector machine) method. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|R

This is an extension study of former paper of insulated oval duct neglecting <b>heat</b> <b>radiation.</b> It is found that in the practical situations with long-short-axes ratio a/b 5 / 1, heat transfer rate errors are within 1. 2 % by comparing with accurate two-dimensional numerical solutions for most practical dimensionless insulated thickness (t/R 2 0. 5). On the contrary, neglecting the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> effect is likely to produce very big heat transfer rate errors of non-insulated (E> 43 % at t/R 2 = 0) and thin-insulated (E> 4. 5 % while t/R 2 0. 1) oval ducts in situations of ambient air with lower external convection heat coefficients and larger surface emissivity.

Conductor coatings are available that have a high emissivity for high <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> and a low absorption of sunlight. These coatings would be applied to new conductor during manufacture. These types of coatings have the ability to potentially increase the current rating of the ACSR conductor. For the same amount of amperage, the temperature of the same conductor will be lower due to the better heat dissipation of the higher emissivity coating.|$|R

40|$|In {{the sixth}} section of his light quantum paper of 1905, Einstein {{presented}} the miraculous argument, as I shall call it. Pointing out an analogy with ideal gases and dilute solutions, he {{showed that the}} macroscopic, thermodynamic properties of high frequency <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> carry a distinctive signature of finitely many, spatially localized, independent components and so inferred that it consists of quanta. I describe how Einstein’s other statistical papers of 1905 had already developed and exploited {{the idea that the}} ideal gas law is another macroscopic signature of finitely many, spatially localized, independent components and that these papers in turn drew on his first two, “worthless” papers of 1901 and 1902 on intermolecular forces. However, while the ideal gas law was a secure signature of independence, it was harder to use as an indicator that there are finitely many components and that they are spatially localized. Further, since his analysis of the ideal gas law depended {{on the assumption that the}} number of components was fixed, its use was precluded for <b>heat</b> <b>radiation,</b> whose component quanta vary in number in most processes. So Einstein needed and found another, more powerful signature of discreteness applicable to <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> and which indicated all these properties.
