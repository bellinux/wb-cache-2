500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Winter Garden shows, however, Diamond {{announced}} that he needed a break, and he engaged in no more live performances till 1976. He used those four years {{to work on the}} score for Hall Bartlett's film version of Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull and to record two albums, Serenade and Beautiful Noise. He said years later, [...] "I knew I'd come back, but I wasn't sure when. I spent one year on each of those albums...I'd been on the road six years. I had a son 2Â½ and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> needed me more than the audience did. So for four years I devoted myself to my son Jesse." [...] He also said he needed to get back to having a private life, one where he could be anonymous.|$|E
60|$|Instinctively <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> {{was both}} unscrupulous and untrustworthy. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was seeking me for ends of his own, {{and all the}} time I was half afraid of him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was unanswerable, here; but I {{tried to}} argue the question, nevertheless.|$|R
60|$|Again the Dragoon {{inclined}} his head. This silence impressed me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> {{was indeed}} a dangerous man.|$|R
2500|$|Wainwright became {{addicted}} to crystal meth {{in the early}} 2000s and temporarily lost his vision. His addiction reached its peak in 2002, during {{what he described as}} [...] "the most surreal week of my life." [...] During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program Absolutely Fabulous, spent several nights partying with George W. Bush's daughter Barbara, enjoyed a [...] "debauched evening" [...] with his mother and Marianne Faithfull, sang with Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons for Zaldy's spring 2003 collection, and experienced recurring hallucinations of his father throughout. He decided after that he [...] "was either going to rehab or I was going to live with my father. I knew I needed an asshole to yell at me, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> fit the bill." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{he first}} came into the game <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was a huge prospect. For some reason he has {{deteriorated}} in such a big way. Just {{the way he is}} walking back, he looks like a totally lost guy." [...] In the final Test of the series Ramdin struck his second Test century, managing 107 not out. At the fall of the ninth wicket Ramdin was joined by Tino Best and the pair built a 143-run partnership, the highest stand for the tenth wicket by the West Indies and the third highest in Test history. On reaching his century, Ramdin produced a piece of paper from his pocket on which he had written a message for Richards the night before. The message read [...] "Yeah Viv Talk Nah". The ICC fined Ramdin 20% of his match fee for [...] "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game".|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was lying. Don't ask for my reasons: I have no {{reasons to}} give. When he said [...] "I will remain at Browndown," [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was lying.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was {{watching}} me keenly and made a great effort to remain composed, although my pulses were beating fast and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> my colour rising.|$|R
60|$|I took {{no notice}} of her. My {{eyes were fixed}} upon Paul. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was going to speak to me; and he did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, if I {{said that}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> certain <b>he</b> {{had given them}} to {{somebody}} you would have some idea as to who it would probably be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Laura blushed, but {{she gave}} Stannard a steady look. [...] "I liked Jimmy, Father, and I was not {{altogether}} selfish. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to go}} back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The moment I saw him <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{would give}} trouble," [...] said Mrs. Jackson, shaking her head. [...] "I told you, Archibald, that I didn't like {{the look of}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{had almost}} {{finished}} dinner, when {{taking a step}} or two towards the table, from the corner where he kept watch upon us, or rather upon me, as <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>he</b> said to his master: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was it {{for this}} reason that you brought about their deaths, Zikali?" [...] I asked, staring him in the face, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was lying to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor am I, {{in the way}} you mean," [...] Ida rejoined. [...] "I {{thought he}} looked honest, though perhaps {{reliable}} is nearest what <b>I</b> <b>felt.</b> Then <b>he</b> was very professional." ...|$|R
60|$|Strickland's eyes {{rested on}} him, {{and there was}} in them a {{malicious}} expression. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>he</b> was seeking for some gibe, could think of none, and so was forced to silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks like}} justice," [...] said Challoner. [...] "But {{we are getting}} away from the point. I'd better tell you that after my talk with the man <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> might be {{dangerous}} and that I must send for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|For my own part, I quite {{agreed with}} [...] "Margot." [...] When the Colonel {{was reduced to}} {{dressing}} {{the part of a}} known personage <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had reached almost his last card, and would be well advised to retire into Surrey.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't know, but I wasn't {{going to}} put him wise. I was just thankful for the information. I liked the man, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was straight, but I wasn't {{going to give him}} the whole story. For one thing he {{probably}} wouldn't have believed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was hard}} to tell what the fellow thought; but somehow <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> {{expected}} to find your story true. He, however, gave me no information. What do you suppose he wants?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MARGARET. [slipping her {{arm through}} his] I have loved Juggins {{since the first}} day I beheld him. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> instinctively <b>he</b> {{had been in the}} Guards. May he walk out with me, Mr Gilbey? ...|$|R
60|$|His {{attentive}} face relaxed a little. But I {{saw one of}} his feet, softly, quietly, incessantly {{beating on}} the carpet under the table, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> was secretly as anxious as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think it; I'm sure of it. He's odiously conceited. All {{the time}} I {{was talking to}} him <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{considered}} himself superior to me. No nice-minded man would have refused our offer to say a short prayer on his behalf during morning service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt {{tempted to}} do the same, after what I learned at the Lake of Shadows," [...] he remarked. [...] "However, when I'd had a few words with Andrew I decided to hold on. Though he's {{carrying}} {{a good bit of}} my money, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was worth backing." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{might have}} {{laughed at the}} director's enthusiasm had I {{believed}} it real, {{but there was something}} in his tone which indicated got-up raptures. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was only affecting fervour in order to put me off my guard, to induce me to come out in return, so I scarcely even smiled. He went on: ...|$|E
60|$|As {{we looked}} full at one another, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> my breath come quicker in my {{strong desire to}} get {{something}} out of him. And as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that it came quicker, and as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> saw that it came quicker, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>I</b> had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I hardly {{answered}} him, but {{of course}} I was young and inexperienced, and I could not help being flattered and pleased at his words. I may have shown him what <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> for <b>he</b> suddenly--' ...|$|R
60|$|Tarvrille's notes {{recorded}} his repeated attempts to see me, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> alone {{was capable of}} clearing up things for me, and I went out again at once and telegraphed to him for an appointment.|$|R
60|$|In truth, he {{said this}} with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done with, even though I should be under his father's roof {{for years and years}} to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> as {{perfectly}} understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself.|$|E
60|$|All {{the time}} he was {{speaking}} his eyes kept moving rapidly up and down, all round me, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was taking in my whole person.... After these few words he smiled, a harsh, mechanical smile, meant to be gracious, and with a courteous bow moved on. I turned to Matteo and saw him looking after the Count very sourly.|$|E
6000|$|He stood {{a moment}} {{as if he were}} listening; then turned, smiling irresolutely, and eyed me aimlessly. He seemed afraid of his own house, askance at his own furniture. Yet, though I scarce know why, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> had not told me the whole truth. Something {{fidelity}} had yet withheld from vanity. I longed to enquire further. I put aside how many burning questions awhile! ...|$|E
60|$|Frank {{would not}} return from town much before six, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure. <b>He</b> always loitered when he got down to Hilo. Unless {{somebody}} came to relieve me soon I must surely be killed by slow torture.|$|R
