5000|$|Pedestrian (and other {{sidewalk}} user) access requires {{at least}} four crosswalks (two to cross the two signalized lane crossover intersections, while two more cross the local road at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interchange).</b> This could be mitigated by signalizing all movements, without impacting the two-phase nature <b>of</b> the <b>interchangeâ€™s</b> signals.|$|R
50|$|The route {{begins at}} US 65 Business {{at the west}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an <b>interchange</b> with Interstate 40/US 65.

50|$|North of I-55, I-355 {{continues}} to run almost due north through the established western suburbs of Chicago in DuPage County. Travelers pay another toll {{just north of}} Boughton Road, at the Boughton Road Toll Plaza (mile 13.5). Continuing north, I-355 has another multiple flyover interchange with I-88 (miles 19.5 and 23.0), officially designated the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway. On the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interchange,</b> northbound I-355 has exits to both directions of I-88. I-355 then swings below I-88 and runs side-by-side with the other tollway for 1 mi.

50|$|After an {{interchange}} with Three Points Road, that directs {{drivers to}} Thomson, I-20 crosses over Mattox Creek. It then has an interchange with SR 17 (Washington Road). At the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> this <b>interchange,</b> it travels under a bridge that carries US 78/SR 10/SR 17 Bypass (Thomson Bypass). It crosses over Little Germany Creek before curving to the east-southeast. It crosses over Germany Creek {{on the southern}} edge of Upper Folly Lake.

50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} <b>of</b> the <b>interchange</b> with CR 97 (Nicolls Road), exit 62 was for Morris Avenue and Waverly Avenue eastbound, and Morris Avenue westbound. Between exits 63 and 64, the eastbound service road was intended to weave around a recharge basin and replace a local residential street. Residents would have lived {{on both sides of}} the service road, similar to the segment between exits 59 and 60. Exit 68 was originally planned to be built as a cloverleaf interchange without collective-distributor roads. Additionally in the 1970s, Suffolk County Department of Public Works proposed an extension of East Main Street in Yaphank (CR 102) that would have terminated at the west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> this <b>interchange.</b>|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, Toronto International Airport was {{expanded}} {{with the construction}} of the Aeroquay One terminal.To serve the expected demand of the expansion, the DHO built a new four lane freeway north from Highway 401 at Renforth Drive. This new route, which roughly followed the same route as Highway 427 as far as Dixon/Airport Road, was known as the Toronto Airport Expressway and was opened on January 3, 1964.It featured a connection with the western terminus of Richview Sideroad at the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interchange</b> with Highway 401 as well as an interchange with Renforth Drive.|$|R
50|$|This 2.5 mi {{corridor}} with concurrent routes ends in {{the east}} at the US 29/US 70/US 220/Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard junction.

50|$|The route {{begins at}} the {{northern}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the diamond <b>interchange</b> with exit 86 and briefly heads south before turning east on a frontage road paralleling I-70's southern side.

50|$|Prior to SR 21's {{northern}} terminus, Blanding {{continues to}} the northeast for several more blocks north of San Juan Avenue until it straightens to the north again and crosses St. Johns Avenue. Blanding Boulevard has a full intersection with Park Street, with eastbound Park Street providing access to US 17 south. North of Park Street, Blanding becomes a limited access connecting overpass crossing over Hamilton Street, a double tracked railroad, and has an interchange with US 17 (Roosevelt Boulevard) northbound {{at the edge of}} Florida State College at Jacksonville's Kent Campus, also with access from US 17 Roosevelt Boulevard southbound to SR 21 southbound. SR 21 ends at a second intersection with Park Street and an entrance to Kent campus at the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interchange.</b>|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{travelers}} from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had {{to traverse}} the one-lane cloverleaf ramp {{in the southwest}} quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for US 1. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained {{for access to the}} new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interchange</b> was also modified into its present configuration, and the Park and Ride was built.|$|R
50|$|I-787 officially {{begins at}} the toll barrier for I-87/Thruway exit 23; however, a short 0.57 mi spur between U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) and the {{interchange}} connecting I-787 to the Thruway, designated as NY 912S, an unsigned reference route, is signed as I-787.

5|$|MD 198 {{continues}} east as Sandy Spring Road, which {{drops to}} four lanes {{as the road}} leaves Burtonsville. The route crosses the MontgomeryPrince George's county line and temporarily expands to six lanes between the intersection with Old Gunpowder Road and Bond Mill Road and the state highway's junction with I-95 in West Laurel. The junction is a cloverleaf interchange with a flyover ramp from westbound MD 198 to southbound I-95. MD 198 again becomes six lanes at the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interchange</b> where the highway enters the city of Laurel. At Ninth Street, the state highway splits into a one-way pair that uses Gorman Avenue eastbound and Talbott Avenue westbound. MD 198 meets the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> MD 216 (Seventh Street) and intersects US 1, which comprises a one-way pair that uses Washington Boulevard southbound and Second Street northbound.

MD32 offers northbound travelers direct access into the fort {{and to the}} National Security Agency, while the next interchange, another employee-only access road into Fort Meade, features only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Fort Meade itself is a military installation opened in 1917 that trained 3.5 million troops during World War II and is still a major fort. To {{the west of the}} parkway off MD32 is the Savage Mill, which was an operating cotton mill from 1822 to 1947 and is currently an antique mall, and the Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge, an 1869 cast and wrought iron bridge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Capital Subdivision) line between Baltimore and Washington D.C.
