40|$|A certain {{proportion}} of DRI produced in India is consumed for the steel production through the <b>induction</b> <b>furnace</b> route which provides for slag metal separation actuated by a mere melting of the DRI without any purification reactions.

50|$|An {{induction}} furnace uses induction to heat metal to its melting point. Once molten, the high-frequency magnetic field {{can also be}} used to stir the hot metal, which is useful in ensuring that alloying additions are fully mixed into the melt. Most <b>induction</b> <b>furnaces</b> consist of a tube of water-cooled copper rings surrounding a container of refractory material. <b>Induction</b> <b>furnaces</b> are used in most modern foundries as a cleaner method of melting metals than a reverberatory furnace or a cupola. Sizes range from a kilogram of capacity to a hundred tonnes capacity. <b>Induction</b> <b>furnaces</b> often emit a high-pitched whine or hum when they are running, depending on their operating frequency. Metals melted include iron and steel, copper, aluminium, and precious metals. Because it is a clean and non-contact process it can be used in a vacuum or inert atmosphere. Vacuum furnaces make use of induction heating for the production of specialty steels and other alloys that would oxidize if heated in the presence of air.|$|E
