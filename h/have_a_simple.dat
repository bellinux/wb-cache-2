5|$|Gastrotrichs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{body plan}} {{with a head}} region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the {{reproductive}} organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the {{prevailing}} {{view was that}} the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of bacteriophage T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> linear structure {{and are likely to}} be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Some turbellarians <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> pharynx {{lined with}} cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, {{which are usually}} {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E
30|$|In {{this section}} the authors discuss {{whether there are}} any differing views on the {{statement}} ‘It is too difficult to integrate multiple modes of transport in ICT’ that achieved <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority agreement by all types of participants groups. But the authors find {{that there are some}} differences (see Table  5) among the sub-groups. The TLSP and the Terminal Operator sub-groups <b>had</b> <b>a</b> similar (<b>simple</b> majority) agreement whereas the Academic-Researcher sub-group <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority disagreement. Both SMEs and Non-SMEs sub-groups <b>had</b> <b>a</b> similar (<b>simple</b> majority) agreement. There are some differences among the Geographic sub-groups. The Non-EU sub-group <b>had</b> <b>a</b> full agreement whereas the Northern EU sub-group <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority disagreement. The remaining sub-groups <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority agreement. There are some major differences among the ICT sub-groups. The ICT-Expert <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vast majority agreement; the ICT-Competent sub-group <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority disagreement whereas the ICT-Basic sub-group <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> majority agreement. In contrast two sub-groups: Academic-Researcher and Northern EU had majority disagreement. The authors find that although the statement <b>had</b> achieved <b>a</b> majority agreement, in particular taking into account of the views of the TLSP and Terminal Operator who have better practical experience over the Academic-Researcher sub-group.|$|R

5|$|Isopods <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> gut which lacks a midgut section; instead {{there are}} caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part {{connected to the}} caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> stomach that {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E
5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E

5|$|To {{maintain}} a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted {{to meet their}} dietary requirements {{in a variety of}} ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require {{little in the way of}} specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.|$|E
