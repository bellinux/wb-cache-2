40|$|Most of the {{electricity}} being produced throughout the world today is from steam power plants. At the same time, many other competent means of gener-ating electricity have been developed viz. electricity from natural gas, MHD generators, biogas, solar cells, etc. But steam power plants {{will continue to be}} competent because of the use of water as the main working fluid which is abundantly available and is also reusable. The condenser remains among one of the key components of a steam power plant. The efficiency of a thermal power plant depends upon the efficiency of the condenser. In this paper, a the-oretical investigation about thermal analysis and design considerations of a steam condenser has been undertaken. A hybrid steam condenser using a higher surface area to diameter ratio of cooling a water tube has been analyzed. The use of a hybrid steam condenser enables higher efficiency of the steam power plant by lowering condenser steam pressure and increasing the vacuum inside the con-denser. The latent/sensible heat of steam is used to preheat the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> to the boiler.

40|$|Coupled {{calculations}} {{are important}} for the simulation of nuclear power plants {{when there is a}} strong feedback between the neutron kinetics and the thermal-hydraulics. A general coupled model of the Ringhals- 3 Pressurized Water Reactor has been developed for this purpose. The development is outlined in the thesis with details given in the appended papers. A PARCS model was developed for the core calculations and a RELAP 5 model for the thermal-hydraulic calculations. The RELAP 5 model has 157 channels for modelling the flow in the fuel assemblies. This means that there is a one-one correspondence radially between the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic nodalization. This detailed mapping between the neutron kinetics and the thermal-hydraulics makes it possible to use the model for all kinds of transient. To provide realistic material data to the PARCS model, a cross-section interface was developed. With this interface one can import material data from a binary CASMO- 4 library file into PARCS. Due to the one-to-one mapping, any any core loading can easily be considered. The PARCS model was benchmarked against measurements of the steady-state power distribution of Ringhals- 3. The power shape was well reproduced by the model. Validational work for steady-state conditions of the thermal-hydraulic was also successfully performed. The most challenging part of the validation of a coupled model is for transients. This is much more difficult since the dynamics of the system becomes very important. Two transients that occurred at Ringhals- 3 were chosen for the validational work. The first transient was a Load Rejection Transient. In general the model gave good results but some problems were experienced, e. g. the pressurizer pressure {{turned out to be more}} difficult to be correctly simulated. The second transient was a Loss of Feed Water transient. A malfunctioning feed water control valve closed, and therefore shut down the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> to the steam generator in one of the loops. Low level in the affected steam generator led to the SCRAM of the reactor. Finally, the model was applied to the simulation of hypothetical Main Steam Line Break transient. Several cases were simulated. Both Hot Full Power conditions and Hot Zero Power conditions were used. The effects of SCRAM timing, mixing, and delayed neutrons were investigated...|$|E

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} {{the costs and benefits}} of full pressure and constant flow water supply on a rural residential community located in the Lockyer Valley. The Lockyer Valley Regional Council was formed on the 15 th of March 2008 through an amalgamation forced by the State government of the previous Laidley Shire Council and Gatton Shire Council. The amalgamation of the Councils identified large differences in water supply agreement for their rural residential developments. A uniform approach across the newly formed Council was required. An investigation into the costs of constant flow and full pressure water supply was required before Council could make an informed decision about a new combined policy. A cost benefit analysis of the two existing options has been sponsored by the Lockyer Valley Regional Council in order to regulate water supply infrastructure throughout the region. The objectives of the project are to: · Determine the water consumption behaviour of rural residential properties located within the full pressure supply area of Gatton and the constant flow supply area of Regency Downs. · Investigate trunk infrastructure requirements and maintenance costs for full pressure and trickle <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply.</b> · Investigate and determine the effect of rural residential development and the water supply options on salinity due to ground water table behaviour · Provide a cost benefit analysis of the two water supply options and provide recommendations which consider economic, social and environmental aspects. Cost benefit analysis is a critical method of determining costs and benefits of the alternative options in monetary terms, whether those costs or benefits are economic, social or environmental. This research project has been limited to the environmental cost due to salinity and the physical infrastructure costs for the alternatives. Based on the cost benefit analysis undertaken, it was determined that the supply of full pressure water supply would come at an additional cost of 2, 334, 566. 00 for Council, and 55, 417. 00 to agricultural yield per farm over a period of twenty years compared to the supply of constant flow water supply. Due to the applicable costs, a recommendation was made to the Lockyer Valley Regional Council that rural residential developments should continue to be supplied with a constant flow water supply, based on the costs to Council and the environment due to the potential for increased dryland salinit...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a large-scale}} land deal {{which resulted in}} the contamination of water sources in the Iringa region of Tanzania, and the negotiation process which followed. An area of 1400 ha was rented to investors for agriculture and livestock-keeping. These activities caused contamination of the <b>water</b> sources which <b>feed</b> a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> scheme managed by a downstream local community and serving a population of 45, 000. While there are mechanisms within Tanzanian law to limit potentially polluting activities, establish protected zones around water sources and empower water user organisations to exercise control over activities that damage the quality of water, in practice, in the Iringa region, these were not effective as many procedures were not followed. This paper examines the cause of this, the effect that these failures had on downstream access to safe drinking water and the subsequent (largely successful) process of correcting the damage done. The paper discusses the direct causes of water contamination (the use of fertilisers and pesticides and the presence of cattle) and the indirect causes (unclear administrative boundaries, lack of participation and transparency, procedures not followed and limited resources). The negotiation process and its outcomes are described. From this study we conclude that stakeholder communication and transparency are key elements in anticipating and preventing the arising of such situations. Often, these are in short supply when large land deals occur. In this case, ex-post solutions were arrived at. Finally, the paper looks at the broader dimensions of land deals that pollute the <b>water</b> <b>feeding</b> a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> scheme.

Slaughter characteristics of broilers in the 1 st group were also the best. They had the biggest share of the most valuable parts, breast and drumsticks. Obtained results showed that mineral adsorbents can be successfully used as additives in the diets for broilers for improved production and better fattening performances...|$|R
40|$|Need and Importance of Study Water {{demands in}} Utah are {{continuously}} increasing. It {{is essential that}} these demands be me to insure the continued enhancement {{of the social and}} economic well-being of all sectors of our society. Since water needs must be met from a relatively fixed <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> it is imperative that supplies be managed for complete utilization {{in such a way that}} all legitimate requirement scan be satisfied. As our available <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> are used more completely by making a given supply satisfy more than one use, water quality problems become more pronounced. The multiplicity of uses to which water may be put as it moved through a hydrologic system is limited only as its quality is reduced below acceptable standards of particular users, or as its quantity is reduced through evapotranspiration. Thus, a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> may be reduced just as effectively by lowering its quality as if it is consumed or otherwise transported from a region. In several areas of Utah, water quality problems are aggravated by contributions of highly mineralized springs. These <b>feed</b> into regular <b>water</b> <b>supplies,</b> thus impairing or completely destroying their usefulness – especially during periods of low streamflow. An inventory of sources of such mineralized springs, their quantities and qualities, along with an evaluation of their effects on natural waters, might suggest possible management and control measurements which could materially extend the usefulness of certain <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> in the state. Specifically, the major objectives of this investigation were: 1. To obtain an inventory of mineralized spring waters with respect to location, hydrologic and geologic setting, and quantity and quality of water. 2. To make an appraisal of current and potential effects of these springs on important usable supplies. 3. To evaluate possible management and control measures aimed at extending the usefulness of principal <b>water</b> <b>supplies...</b>|$|R
