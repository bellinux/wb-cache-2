40|$|Inoculation of the {{neonatal}} rat with {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis}} virus (LCMV) results in the selective infection of several neuronal populations and in focal pathological changes. However, the pathway by which LCMV reaches the susceptible neurons has not been described, and the nature and time course of the pathological changes induced by the infection are largely unknown. This study examined the sequential migration of LCMV in the developing rat brain and compared the pathological changes among <b>infected</b> brain <b>regions.</b> The results demonstrate that astrocytes and Bergmann glia cells are the first cells of the brain parenchyma infected with LCMV and that the virus spreads across the brain principally via contiguous glial cells. The virus then spreads from glial cells into neurons. However, not all neurons are susceptible to infection. LCMV infects neurons in only four specific brain regions: the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus, and periventricular region. The virus is then cleared from glial cells but persists in neurons. LCMV induces markedly different pathological changes {{in each of the}} four <b>infected</b> <b>regions.</b> The cerebellum undergoes an acute and permanent destruction, while the olfactory bulb is acutely hypoplastic but recovers fully with age. Neurons of the dentate gyrus are unaffected in the acute phase but undergo a delayed-onset mortality. In contrast, the periventricular region has neither acute nor late-onset cell loss. Thus, LCMV infects four specific brain regions in the developing brain by spreading from glial cells to neurons and then induces substantially different pathological changes with diverse time courses {{in each of the four}} <b>infected</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R

50|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} of Alternaria dauci {{is not known}} to occur, and the disease is most active during spring, summer, and autumn cropping cycles. The disease cycle begins when fungus overwinters on or in host seed and in soil-borne debris from carrot. A. dauci may also be spread into fields via contaminated carrot seeds during cultivation. Once introduced, the pathogen can persist in carrot debris or contaminated seeds in the soil {{for up to two}} years. Seedling infection near the hypocotyl-root junction (just below the soil line) then occurs in the early spring following overwintering of Alternaria dauci mycelium or conidia. This <b>infected</b> <b>region</b> will become necrotic and lead to the production of more asexual conidia on conidiophores, which will serve as secondary inoculum. Wind and rain cause conidia to disperse to neighboring host species, and multiple germination tubes will be produced from each conidium that successfully colonizes a new host. As penetration occurs, Alternaria dauci will produce a chemical known as phytotoxin zinniol, which degrades cell membranes and chloroplasts, ultimately leading to the chlorotic symptoms characteristic of the disease. These germination tubes will pierce host cell walls to initiate infection, or if wounds are present the pathogen may enter in that manner. The process of germination, penetration, and symptom development generally occurs in a timespan of 8 to 16 days, but the presence of wounds shortens the amount of time needed to carry out the process.|$|E

An important prerequisite for successful host invasion of the virus is to cross the epithelial cell layer and the underlying basement membrane barrier. In the present study, an analysis was performed to see if an EHV- 1 infection of nasal mucosa epithelial cells leads to damage of the underlying extracellular matrix proteins. Nasal mucosa explants were inoculated with EHV- 1 and collected at 0, 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi). Then, double immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect viral-antigen-positive cells {{on the one hand}} and integrin alpha 6, laminin, collagen IV and collagen VII on the other hand. The area of these extracellular matrix proteins was measured in regions of interest (ROIs) at a magnification of 200 X by means of the software imaging system ImageJ. ROIs were defined beneath uninfected and <b>infected</b> <b>regions.</b> In uninfected regions, 22 - 28 % of the ROI was stained for integrin alpha 6, 18 - 37 % for laminin, 14 - 38 % for collagen IV and 18 - 26 % for collagen VII.

Until recent years, most spatial epidemiological studies have used simple space-time analyses, but the continuous advancements in statistical modeling software and geographic information systems have made more complex spatial analyses readily available. However, methods may be problematic and several ongoing statistical weaknesses have been documented, including failing to account for three significant correlative factors - spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal autocorrelations. Using Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) human incidence data, this Master's thesis aimed to answer the research question, is there a northeastern shift in human EEE incidence within the United States, by identifying a statistical model that adjusts for spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal autocorrelations. This thesis introduced the spatial autoregressive distributed lag (SADL) model, a model that adjusts for spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal autocorrelations. However, results demonstrated that EEE is too rare an event for the SADL model to be appropriate, and a non-autocorrelation model was used as the final model. Results showed that EEE incidence is significantly increasing over time for all <b>infected</b> <b>regions</b> of the United States, with a significant difference of 1. 4 cases/ 10 million between 1964 and 2015.

Deposition of lignin during defense responses is considered to function as a physical barrier against pathogen infection (Moerschbacher et al. 1990). Cinnamoyl-CoA esters, the precursors of monolignol biosynthesis, are generated by the general phenylpropanoid pathway and then converted into monolignols by two enzymes, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (CCR 1) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase.

The long and short incubation periods were defined by duration of infection and onset time, and the cases were compared by demographic factors and clinical symptom, infection and onset time.
