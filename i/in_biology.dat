5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is {{not until the}} age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances <b>in</b> <b>biology</b> resumed. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation <b>in</b> <b>biology.</b> In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E

The sample was taken among 100 samples of student using stratified random sampling technique. Documentation technique was used to uncover studentâ€™s cognitive learning achievement, while internal motivation and learning readiness was measured by using queationnaire.
