5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

I read the Western economic textbooks and also the more general work of people like Hayek.

In 1968, I was glad at the political liberalism of the Dubcek Prague Spring, but was very critical of the Third Way they pursued in economics.|$|E

25|$|On 2 October 1920 King Alexander <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{incident}} {{when he took}} a walk on {{the lands}} of the domain of Tatoi. A macaque who belonged to the manager of the vineyards of the palace attacked Fritz, the German shepherd dog of the sovereign, and he attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander I and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys (which were later destroyed), and the King's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He didn't consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either.

500|$|Townshend {{has taken}} an {{interest}} in licensing the Who's work to media and advertising, and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] has made several appearances on TV and film. A portion of the song {{has been used as}} the opening theme for the CBS series , while an edited version of the track was played on The Simpsons [...] "A Tale of Two Springfields" [...] which featured the Who as special guests. However, Townshend refused permission for director Michael Moore to play the song over the closing credits of Fahrenheit 9/11, as he was suspicious of Moore's journalistic credentials and did not want his work to be associated with a possibly inaccurate film. Townshend later said [...] "nce <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> idea what the film was about, I was 90% certain my song was not right for them." [...] In response Moore accused Townshend of supporting the Iraq War, which Townshend denied.|$|E
500|$|In her childhood, Diamandis {{attended}} Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, reflecting, [...] "I sort of {{found my}} talent there... I {{was the one}} who always [...] off choir, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> incredible music teacher who managed to convince me I could do anything." [...] However, she felt that she [...] "stuck out" [...] by being from a lower-income family than the other girls at the school. At the age of 16, she moved to Greece with her father [...] "to connect with my heritage and learn to speak the language", and sang Greek folk songs with her grandmother. Having earned an International Baccalaureate at St. Catherine's British Embassy School in Athens, she returned to Wales two years later. She and her mother then moved to Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. Obsessed with becoming a singer, [...] "almost {{as if it was a}} disease", she worked at a petrol station for two months in order to earn money to move to London.|$|E

50|$|Here, the presupposition {{triggered}} by the expression my wife (that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence does imply that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife.|$|R
40|$|Think of {{the most}} boring, uncontroversial case of presupposition {{satisfaction}} you can imagine. I thought of this one: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pet hamster. <b>I</b> know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. You know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. <b>I</b> know that you know, and so forth. I say to you: (1) Tomorrow I’m taking my hamster to the vet. Why was it acceptable for me to utter this sentence, which contains the presuppositional expression my hamster? Presumably it’s because the sentence presupposes that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster; and a sentence with this presupposition is acceptable in any context like the one we’re in, where you and I come into the conversation sharing the belief that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. It could also be that you didn’t know that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hamster, but <b>I</b> told you: “I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. Tomorrow I’m taking my hamster to the vet. ” So then it’s not necessary that we begin the conversation both believing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster: it’s enough that, before the sentence containing the phrase my hamster is uttered, we both believe that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. But beliefs are fickle creatures. What happens if I start a sentence, and then something happens in the room while I’m talking? If you and I witness the event, our beliefs will change, and the context changes accordingly. For instance, imagine I say...|$|R
500|$|On 30 August 2013, Tasci {{moved to}} Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow for an {{undisclosed}} fee. Upon leaving Stuttgart, he told the press, [...] "It {{was not an easy}} decision. The present decision is not a decision against VfB, but for the new task. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> incredibly great time at VfB, have played in the youth here, then I turned pro and recently been the captain. I have always said that I am a VfBler and that I will remain." [...] Immediately after joining the club, his debut was delayed by the injuries he sustained while at Stuttgart and he did not play for three weeks. He made his first appearance with the club on 2 October 2013 when he appeared in training. After damaging his meniscus, Tasci announced he would return in January following an operation. He made his debut for the club on 17 March 2014 in a 2–2 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala. He made three more appearances that season.|$|E
500|$|On May 6, 2013, Hill {{was sentenced}} by Judge Arleo to serve {{three months in}} prison for failing to file taxes/tax fraud and three months house arrest {{afterwards}} {{as part of a}} year of supervised probation. She had faced a possible sentence of as long as 36 months, and the sentence given took into account her lack of a prior criminal record and her six minor-aged children. By this point Hill had fully paid back $970,000 in back taxes and penalties she owed, which also took into account an additional $500,000 that Hill had in unreported income for 2008 and 2009. In the courtroom, Hill said that she had lived [...] "very modestly" [...] considering how much money she had made for others, and that [...] "I am a child of former slaves who had a system imposed on them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> economic system imposed on me." [...] Hill reported to the minimum-security Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury on July 8, 2013, to begin serving her sentence.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{his looks}} in the film, Ram Charan said, [...] "Personality wise there isn’t really much {{difference}} to Kalabhairava but I {{have to tell you}} minor changes like the shape of my mustache, a slight voice modulation, the background scale, the atmosphere and even the ‘Chandrabindu’ worked wonders on screen and gave a totally different look and feel and I felt like it was an altogether different side of me. When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly." [...] Ram Charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film.|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, I {{was scared to death}} on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing off the ground and landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E
500|$|When McCartney was a child, {{his mother}} read him poems and {{encouraged}} him to read books. His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him, to increase their [...] "word power", as McCartney said. In 2001, McCartney published Blackbird Singing, a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City. In the foreword of the book, he explains: [...] "When I was a teenager... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful—which was promptly rejected—and I suppose I {{have been trying to}} get my own back ever since". His first children's book was published by Faber & Faber in 2005, , a collaboration with writer Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar. Featuring a squirrel whose woodland home is razed by developers, it had been scripted and sketched by McCartney and Dunbar over several years, as an animated film. The Observer labelled it an [...] "anti-capitalist children's book".|$|E
500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Rihanna {{explained}} why {{she liked to}} collaborate with Minaj, saying [...] "She has a great buzz {{and she has a}} 'thing' to her. She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps but she can write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts on how {{we were going to get}} to do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> off day, they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the album were written {{at the same time}} as the songs on Body Talk Pt. 1. In mid-July 2010, music {{magazine}} Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed. Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund, who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt. 1. Unlike the first installment, Body Talk Pt. 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund, such as Diplo, Kleerup, Niggaracci and electronic duo Savage Skulls. She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song [...] "U Should Know Better". The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single [...] "Sexual Eruption" [...] (2007). Six months later, they met up once again to write and record [...] "U Should Know Better." [...] While being interviewed by Billboard, Robyn spoke of the experience of working with the rapper, stating, [...] "It was really cool to be able to be in the studio with him, first because I always was a fan but also because he was really creative and we had so much of an exchange in being there together, both as vocalists. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> idea and he really got it and got into it, which was awesome." [...] She also worked with Savage Skulls on two {{songs on the}} album; [...] "Love Kills" [...] and the iTunes exclusive [...] "Bad Gal".

500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E
