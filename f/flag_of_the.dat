5|$|On 15 April 1861, the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Sardinia was {{declared}} the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly formed Kingdom of Italy.

5|$|The {{flags of}} Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, can all trace their roots to the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation of Gran Colombia (1819–1830), the {{short-lived}} republic that encompassed the territories of all three. The Gran Colombian flag {{in turn was}} inspired by the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation. The <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Venezuelan Republic was modeled on the one created earlier by General Francisco de Miranda during his attempts to gain Venezuelan independence and which first flew over the port of La Vela in Santa Ana de Coro, Venezuela, in 1806.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, after Napoleon had crowned himself first French Emperor, the Italian Republic was {{transformed}} into the first Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, or Italico, under his direct rule.

5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was {{that as part of}} the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E
