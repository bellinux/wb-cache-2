5|$|When the Buffalo nickel {{had been}} struck for 25 years and could be {{replaced}} without an act of Congress, the Mint moved quickly to replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> status in 1938, {{and there was no}} public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. Anticipating the 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson's birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.|$|E
25|$|After Cambridge, Darwin {{became a}} court lawyer, {{but did not}} {{particularly}} <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> career, and gradually moved into journalism, despite having no formal training. He covered golf for The Times from 1907 to 1953 and for Country Life from 1907 to 1961, the first writer ever to cover golf on a daily basis, instead of as an occasional feature.|$|E

25|$|Engadget Distro was {{a tablet}} {{magazine}} from the editors at Engadget {{that has been}} published {{on a weekly basis}} since its inception, although Special Issues have appeared at times and multiple issues per week are published during the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The magazine was born from Tim Stevens' desire to provide a different, distilled look at a week's worth of Engadget news, and to enable readers to <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> coverage without the frantic nature of the online experience being necessarily attached. The magazine was announced on September 20, 2011 and teased on that night's episode of The Engadget Show in New York City. It became available to the public on October 12, 2011, with the initial issues being available for Apple's iPad. On December 21, 2011, Distro officially moved into the Newsstand app within Apple's iOS ecosystem while also becoming available {{for the first time on}} Android tablets. Each issue is also made available in PDF form.|$|E
500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his speech, Colbert joked about other people in the audience, including Peter Pace, Antonin Scalia, John McCain, and Joe Wilson. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: [...] "You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. <b>Enjoy</b> <b>that</b> metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{their last}} record, the highly {{successful}} Odyssey Number Five, the band {{agreed that they}} wanted to continue in their musical careers, but wanted to have more fun with it. They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is really important to us, but we wanted to make it more fun".|$|E

500|$|... "Swim Good" [...] {{was written}} by Frank Ocean, Waynne Nugent and Kevin Risto of the duo Midi Mafia, who also {{produced}} the track. The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, which was released on February 18, 2011. When asked by The Quietus about his own interpretation of the character in the song {{it was noted that}} Ocean [...] "politely withdrew, saying he'd <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> discussion but he doesn't want to spoil his audience's experience of his songs". He further commented [...] "but you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that everything has to be... Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, {{and a little bit of}} satire." [...] The track was released as the second single from Nostalgia, Ultra digitally on October 18, 2011 by Def Jam Recordings.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really <b>enjoy</b> <b>that.</b> The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something I think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not just any powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I <b>enjoy</b> <b>that.</b> Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ocean {{later said}} of {{his work at the}} time, [...] "There was a point where I was {{composing}} for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family." [...] He has also worked with artists such as Nas and Pharrell Williams.|$|E
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every nightâ€”that is how she would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> at school so actually to write a scriptâ€”it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2009 Littlemore has {{received}} medication for his arthritis. From late 2009 Littlemore worked in Montreal, Canada with the Cirque Du Soleil as a composer and musical {{director for the}} touring arena show, Zarkana, which debuted on 29 June 2011 in New York. Pnau's fourth album, Soft Universe, was recorded in London. Upon its release Mayes confirmed Littlemore and Steele were working on a second Empire of the Sun album. Littlemore expanded, [...] "We just started writing {{two or three weeks}} ago in New York ... Luke and I got into a studio, which was run by blind people â€“ it was great. It's good to be in weird places with Luke, we <b>enjoy</b> <b>that.</b> He has an extraordinary mind â€“ it's sounding so good". As from July 2011, when not touring or performing, he lives in LA. During late 2011 Pnau toured through Australia promoting their album.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first volume}} of Viz Media's English edition has sold well enough to rank on the New York Times Manga Best Seller List. The first volume was in 7th place in its first week of publication, fell to 10th place in the second, and stayed in 10th place for another week. Reviews of the {{first volume of}} the English version were {{generally}} positive. Leroy Douresseaux of the Comic Book Bin gave the volume an A-, suggesting that fans of Tanemura were sure to like the series, but that it's darker than many of her other works. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime calls the volume [...] "enthralling," [...] also noting the darker tone of the work. Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart gave the first volume a 7 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty standard shojo" [...] but seeming to <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> [...] "There is excellent detail in the art, as well as a variety of good action shots to balance the [...] "pretty" [...] shojo shots." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{went to see}} {{quite a lot of}} them" [...] , [...] "I mean I {{went back}} to the villages, and saw what I had done. I used to go painting, as you know, when I had any time off, and I went to one village in Normandy, and painted it, because I had picked it {{particularly}} and it was a waste of time, because everybody" [...] "had got through," [...] " [...] and I found what I had thought in the rubble were a whole row of footballs, and they weren't footballs - I was sitting right beside them, painting - and they weren't footballs, they were children's heads, and what it was, I discovered later, was a whole school of kids, a convent, had been pulled out of school, out of class, and lined up in this little narrow alleyway between the buildings to save them from the bombing, and the whole thing had come in on top of them, plus the nuns, but by that time [...] they were lice-ridden, and there was nothing. I can talk about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't <b>enjoy</b> <b>that.</b> A row of kid's heads that you thought were footballs and you kick one and it wasn't, and it rolled away down the rubble." ...|$|E
