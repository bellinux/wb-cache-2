5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of their relationship is unknown. It {{is unlikely that the}} Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|Christy has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her storyline with Billie, which {{was compared to}} those from previous seasons. Her role as a villain received positive attention, while Patterson's acting was cited as over-exaggerated. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of Christy's morality and her status as the season's antagonist {{have been the subject}} of debate among television critics and the series' fans.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth {{reached its}} basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its {{elements}} originated in religious ideas, but {{the struggle between}} Horus and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in Egypt's early history or prehistory. Scholars have tried to discern the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> {{of the events that}} gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{black-and-white}} film process, the C-41 {{process can be}} used to push process films. Due to the complexity of the film and <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> of the process, the results vary widely; as with black-and-white negatives, the process generally results in a negative that is higher in contrast and sometimes higher in grain.|$|R

5|$|The {{shock of}} Shays' Rebellion drew retired General George Washington back into public life, leading to his two terms as the United States' first President. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> and {{consequence}} of the rebellion's influence {{on the content of}} the Constitution and the ratification debates continues to be a subject of historical discussion and debate.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
5|$|When Nicholas {{returned}} to Scotland, and the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of his activities {{over the next}} few years, remain unclear matters. His episcopal rank makes it likely that he attended the parliaments and took part in the affairs of the kingdom {{during the early years of}} his episcopate, but direct proof is lacking.|$|E
5000|$|Cardinal Hergenröther {{undertook}} another work of {{the most}} <b>exacting</b> <b>nature,</b> the continuation of Karl Joseph von Hefele's [...] "History of the Councils", two volumes of which he published before his death (vol. VIII, Freiburg, 1887; vol. IX, 1890). The latter volume contains the preliminary history of the Council of Trent and is also {{a history of the}} Lutheran Reformation.|$|R
50|$|Shackleton {{was forced}} to stop {{painting}} in 1907 as her sight deteriorated, affecting her ability to execute the fine detail in her work. Her medical condition may {{have been caused by}} the <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> of her work. She died completely blind, and a spinster, on 10 November 1914 at her home in Rathgar, Dublin.

5|$|Alexander {{presided over}} the {{organisation}} of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by William de Corbeil, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and the archbishop quarrelled, but the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of their dispute is unknown. William and Alexander travelled to Normandy in 1134 to seek out King Henry to settle their dispute.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of Tréhot's {{relationship}} with Renoir while she was modeling; she is said to have given birth to a baby boy named Pierre on 14 December 1868, but it is unclear what became of him and he may have died as an infant. On 21 July 1870, Tréhot gave birth to a baby girl named Jeanne (d. 1934) who was given to a wet nurse to raise as her own. Renoir continued to secretly support Jeanne financially until he died (and after his death with the help of Ambroise Vollard), but never publicly or legally acknowledged that she was his daughter during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome {{is primarily a}} 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
50|$|Due to the <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> {{of legal}} forms {{and the time}} and effort {{required}} to prepare legal documents, form books were created as an aid in the drafting process. These books conserve time and serve as a reference to attorneys and law students seeking to use them in their practice. The importance of these books is not to be underestimated, as a form lacking proper language or information may jeopardize court proceedings.|$|R

She loved the man, and they were happy words to her, and she was satisfied with them, though perhaps some women might have thought that they left a good deal to be desired. But Bessie was not of an <b>exacting</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{fair number}} of higher polycycles {{containing}} the biphenylene nucleus have also been prepared, some having considerable antiaromatic character. [...] In general, additional 6-membered rings add further aromatic character, and additional 4-membered and 8-membered rings add antiaromatic character. However, the <b>exact</b> <b>natures</b> of the additions and fusions greatly affect the perturbations of the biphenylene system, with many fusions resulting in counter-intuitive stabilization by 4n rings, or destabilization by 6-membered rings. This has led to significant interest in the systems by theoretical chemists and graph theoreticians.|$|R
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of Chad's sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Governance of the Jerseys {{also created}} {{problems}} for Andros. James had awarded the territory {{west of the}} Hudson River to proprietors John Berkeley and George Carteret, and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion (which became known as West Jersey) to a partnership of Quakers. Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group, and the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of the rights James had given both Berkeley and Carteret was disputed, in part because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he had made to Berkeley and Carteret.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{which was}} {{presented}} {{as part of a}} doctoral examination in Portuguese literature at the University of Oporto in 1997, the author attempts to reflect on Fernando Echevarria's poetic art, trying to define some of his main ideas and to articulate them with his latest work, published in 1995. With this book Fernando Echevam'a completed forty years of an extremely discreet and productive literary existence. The demanding and <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> which characterizes this poetry - and which is to be found within a traditional form - is indissociable from an ontological meaning of literary creation, which lends it an unusual profundity...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the crime}} of {{burglary}} required a jury trial in the Old Bailey, Edward Henry, the Assistant Commissioner (Crime) of the Metropolitan Police Service {{and head of the}} Criminal Investigation Department, was determined to make this case succeed. As the man who devised [...] the Henry System of Fingerprint Classification and the founder of the Fingerprint Bureau, he knew that only the soundest sort of Crown prosecutor would be able to convince conservative English judges and a sceptical jury to overcome their prejudices. For this purposes, he decided on Richard Muir, a prosecutor with a reputation for thoroughness and <b>exacting</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
5|$|The Liao dynasty was {{destroyed}} by the Jurchen people of the Jin dynasty in 1125 with the capture of Emperor Tianzuo of Liao. However, the remnant Khitan, led by Yelü Dashi, established the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty), which ruled over parts of Central Asia for almost a century before being conquered by the Mongols. Although cultural achievements associated with the Liao dynasty are considerable, {{and a number of}} various statuary and other artifacts exist in museums and other collections, major questions remain over the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> and extent of the influence of the Liao Khitan culture upon subsequent developments, such as the musical and theatrical arts.|$|E
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
40|$|Host-cell {{invasion}} by Cryptosporidium {{is a complex}} process that requires many different factors derived from both the parasite and the host cell. However, the <b>exact</b> <b>natures</b> of the processes {{have yet to be}} resolved. Here, research on different components of the invasion process is put in context, and the sequence of events and pathways associated with the establishment of Cryptosporidium in its unique niche is clarified. In addition, initial parasite–host contact, host-cellinvasion and host-cell responses are described. The roles of parasite and host-cell-derived components in the invasion process are examined, as is the question of whether Cryptosporidium actively invades cells and to what extent host-cell responses are involved...|$|R

5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their <b>exact</b> <b>nature.</b> Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over {{the identity of the}} structures.|$|E
