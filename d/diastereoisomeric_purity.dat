40|$|A {{range of}} the methyl glycosides of 2 -deoxy- 2 -aminohexoses, {{comprising}} d-allosamine, d-mannosamine, d-idosamine and d-talosamine, were prepared from the corresponding d-aldopentoses via a seven step synthetic sequence. The doubly diastereoselective conjugate addition of the requisite antipode of lithium N-benzyl-N-(α-methylbenzyl) amide and in situ enolate oxidation with the requisite antipode of camphorsulfonyloxaziridine (CSO) {{was used as the}} key, stereodefining step. Sequential reduction of the resultant α-hydroxy-β-amino esters and oxidative cleavage of the C(1) -C(2) diol unit furnished the corresponding α-amino aldehydes. Subsequent N- and O-deprotection gave the target compounds (as mixtures of anomers) in good yield and high <b>diastereoisomeric</b> <b>purity.</b> © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The 2 -[18 O]phosphorothioate of D-glycerate, chiral at phosphorus, was prepared. The chiral {{phosphoryl}} group was transferred enzymically to ADP [by using enolase and pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2 -O-phosphotransferase; EC 2. 7. 1. 40) ] {{resulting in the}} synthesis of adenosine 5 '-O-([gamma- 18 O],gamma-thio) triphosphate. This labeled ATP {{was used as a}} thio{{phosphoryl group}} donor in the reactions catalyzed by glycerol kinase (ATP:glycerol 3 -phosphotransferase; EC 2. 7. 1. 30) and by hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6 -phosphotransferase; EC 2. 7. 1. 1). The product from the latter (glucose 6 -phosphorothioate) was converted enzymically into glycerol phosphorothioate. Determination of the relative configurations and <b>diastereoisomeric</b> <b>purities</b> of the samples of glycerol phosphorothioate demonstrates that all three phosphokinases (pyruvate kinase, glycerol kinase, and hexokinase) transfer the thiophosphoryl group with complete stereospecificity, and further shows that these reactions follow an identical stereochemical course...|$|R
40|$|The β-hydroxy-α-amino acids (S,S) -allo-threonine, (S,S) -β-hydroxyleucine and a {{range of}} aryl {{substituted}} (S,S) -β-hydroxyphenylalanines were prepared from the corresponding enantiopure anti-α-hydroxy-β-amino esters via a rearrangement protocol, which proceeds via the intermediacy of the corresponding aziridinium ions. The starting anti-α-hydroxy-β-amino esters were prepared in > 99 : 1 dr using our diastereoselective aminohydroxylation procedure, whereby conjugate addition of lithium (R) -N-benzyl-N-(α-methylbenzyl) amide to an α,β-unsaturated ester is followed by oxidation of the resultant enolate with (-) -camphorsulfonyloxaziridine. Subsequent activation of the hydroxyl group within the anti-α-hydroxy-β-amino esters promoted aziridinium ion formation [which proceeds with inversion of configuration at C(2) ], and regioselective ring-opening of the intermediate aziridinium ions with H 2 O [which proceeds with inversion of configuration at C(3) ] gave the corresponding anti-β-hydroxy-α-amino esters as single diastereoisomers (> 99 : 1 dr). Deprotection of these substrates via sequential hydrogenolysis and ester hydrolysis gave the corresponding β-hydroxy-α-amino acids in good yield and high <b>diastereoisomeric</b> and enantiomeric <b>purity...</b>|$|R
