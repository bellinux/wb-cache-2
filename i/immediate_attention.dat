5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring <b>immediate</b> <b>attention</b> will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} less {{successful}} in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following {{the release of}} Age of Empires that {{there was still no}} process by which patches could be issued. Extensive cheating in multiplayer games of Age of Empires came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for The Age of Kings. On release, there were several bugs that needed <b>immediate</b> <b>attention,</b> but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the <b>immediate</b> <b>attention</b> of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the evening}} of 31 December 1965, Dacko left the Palais de la Renaissance to visit one of his minister's {{plantations}} southwest of the capital. At 22:30WAT (UTC 21:30), Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup; one of his subordinates was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was {{to take control of}} Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his <b>immediate</b> <b>attention.</b> Izamo, who was at a New Year's Eve celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. After announcing his refusal to support the coup, Izamo was overpowered and locked in a cellar.|$|E

25|$|Chlordiazepoxide is a {{drug that}} is very {{frequently}} involved in drug intoxication, including overdose. Chlordiazepoxide overdose is considered a medical emergency and, in general, requires the <b>immediate</b> <b>attention</b> of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of chlordiazepoxide (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. Flumazenil should be given with caution as it may precipitate severe withdrawal symptoms in benzodiazepine-dependent individuals.|$|E

25|$|The heat {{exchangers}} in direct-combustion furnaces, typical in many residences, are not 'coils'. They are, instead, gas-to-air {{heat exchangers}} that are typically made of stamped steel sheet metal. The combustion products pass {{on one side}} of these heat exchangers, and air to heat on the other. A cracked heat exchanger is therefore a dangerous situation that requires <b>immediate</b> <b>attention</b> because combustion products may enter living space.|$|E

25|$|When {{confronted by}} humans, coral snakes will almost always attempt to flee, and bite {{only as a}} last resort. In addition, coral snakes have short fangs (proteroglyph dentition) that cannot {{penetrate}} thick leather clothing. Any skin penetration, however, is a medical emergency that requires <b>immediate</b> <b>attention.</b> Coral snakes have a powerful neurotoxin that paralyzes the breathing muscles; mechanical or artificial respiration, along with large doses of antivenom, are often required to save a victim's life. There is usually only mild pain associated with a bite, but respiratory failure can occur within hours.|$|E
25|$|Years of hastily made alterations, {{including}} the structural changes made by McKim and {{later with the}} addition of an attic story during the Coolidge administration, took a major physical toll on the structural integrity of the White House. Cracks appearing in walls and ceilings, and a sagging East Room ceiling in 1948 signaled that <b>immediate</b> <b>attention</b> was needed. To save the White House, President Truman set in place a process of dismantling the interior structure, constructing a load-bearing internal steel structure, and reconstructing the interior rooms within the new framework.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not usually}} fatal when taken alone, a {{diazepam}} overdose {{is considered a}} medical emergency and generally requires the <b>immediate</b> <b>attention</b> of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of diazepam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil (Anexate). This drug is only used in cases with severe respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications. Because flumazenil is a short-acting drug, {{and the effects of}} diazepam can last for days, several doses of flumazenil may be necessary. Artificial respiration and stabilization of cardiovascular functions may also be necessary. Though not routinely indicated, activated charcoal can be used for decontamination of the stomach following a diazepam overdose. Emesis is contraindicated. Dialysis is minimally effective. Hypotension may be treated with levarterenol or metaraminol.|$|E

25|$|Captains of House are {{slightly}} different though {{in that they}} play a more personal role for pupils who want to voice problems with conditions within the house and this often means that House Captains {{have a lot more}} pupils to be responsible for. This difference is more evident in their original title of 'Helper'. They tend to be in close contact with the housemaster so that any issues requiring <b>immediate</b> <b>attention</b> can be sorted out as well as being able to relay any general ideas or concerns in the House Captains' Council which meet once every two weeks. At the meeting a teacher is present and minutes are taken {{so that they can be}} passed onto the Colour Bearers (CBs).|$|E
25|$|After adoption, the FAMAS F1 {{replaced}} {{both the}} aging MAS 49/56 rifle and MAT-49 submachine gun. Approximately 400,000 FAMAS F1 assault rifles were produced by MAS. While a capable rifle, the F1 had numerous problems to overcome. For instance, many plastic {{pieces on the}} rifle easily broke, including critical parts like the cheek riser on the buttstock. The FAMAS was also susceptible to malfunction on occasion because of poorly-built, or rather improperly used, magazines. The FAMAS was designed around the concept of single-use, disposable magazines; when the limited budget of the French military forced soldiers to reuse disposable magazines over and over, the FAMAS would jam and require <b>immediate</b> <b>attention.</b> MAS would eventually manufacture more durable magazines for the FAMAS that reduced malfunctions.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have <b>immediate</b> <b>attention...</b> Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E
