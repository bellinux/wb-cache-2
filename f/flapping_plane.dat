40|$|Phase-averaged schlieren {{video and}} an array of azimuthally {{oriented}} microphones were used in the experiments performed to determine the preferred spatial structure associated with supersonic nozzle design for an exhaust Mach number of 2. The jet flow was unheated, chemically inert, and submerged in a static environment, conditions that are satisfactory for the quasi-linear wave-analytical model of Tam and Morris (1980) and Tam and Burton (1984). For general conditions of undeterminate phase-averaged optical records, a conditional sampling method was devised, based on fundamental multimode components. This method uncovers the preferred spatial structure, and shows that in addition to the dominant jet flapping mode, there is also a significant contribution from the axisymmetric mode. Near-field correlations with a moving microphone indicate that the <b>flapping</b> <b>plane</b> is nearly stationary, and not spinning as in the Westley and Wolley (1975) experiment...|$|E
40|$|The Ornicopter is {{a single}} rotor {{helicopter}} that uses forced flapping of the blades to propel the rotor and thus to prevent a reaction torque from arising on the fuselage. By changing the am-plitude of this forced flapping motion, the yaw movement of the fuselage can be controlled. As a result, the Ornicopter {{does not require a}} tail ro-tor or a similar anti-torque device. In order to limit the loads that arise on the blades due to forced flapping, and to prevent con-trollability problems, some amount of blade flap-ping freedom is required. Up to now, flapping freedom was provided by blade flexibility, but this implies that a large bending moment is in-troduced in the blade root. In the current paper an alternative solution is presented, one that gets rid of the root bending moment altogether {{and at the same time}} allows free flapping on top of the forced flapping motion. Basic trim equations for the alternative con-figuration are derived, based on a planar model of a rigid blade rotating at constant tip speed. The hub loads in the <b>flapping</b> <b>plane</b> are analyzed and the results are compared with existing Ornicopter theory for rigid blades. Proof of concept is pro-vided with the help of a small electric model ro-tor. The main advantage of the new configuration turns out to be the more beneficial blade loading, which may even allow the use of conventional he-licopter rotor blades. The positive influence on hub loads only becomes significant for relatively large Lock numbers...|$|E
40|$|The flow {{structure}} obtained when Localized Arc Filament Plasma Actuators (LAFPA) are employed {{to control the}} flow issuing from a perfectly expanded Mach 1. 3 nozzle is elucidated by visualizing coherent structures obtained from Implicit Large-Eddy Simulations. The computations reproduce recent experimental observations at the Ohio State University to influence the acoustic and mixing properties of the jet. Eight actuators were placed on a collar around {{the periphery of the}} nozzle exit and selectively excited to generate various modes, including first and second mixed (m = +/- 1 and m = +/- 2) and axisymmetric (m = 0). In this fluid dynamics video [URL] [URL] unsteady and phase-averaged quantities are displayed to aid understanding of the vortex dynamics associated with the m = +/- 1 and m = 0 modes excited at the preferred column-mode frequency (Strouhal number 0. 3). The unsteady flow in both contains a broad spectrum of coherent features. For m = +/- 1, the phase-averaged flow reveals the generation of successive distorted elliptic vortex rings with axes in the <b>flapping</b> <b>plane,</b> but alternating {{on either side of the}} jet axis. This generates a chain of structures where each interacts with its predecessor on one side and its successor on the other. Through self and mutual interaction, the leading segment of each loop is pinched and passes through the previous ring before rapidly breaking up, and the mean jet flow takes on an elliptic shape. The m = 0 mode exhibits relatively stable roll-up events, with vortex ribs in the braid regions connecting successive large coherent structures. Comment: 3 pages.

40|$|Tests of two {{wing-body}} combinations {{have been}} conducted in the Langley 19 -foot pressure tunnel at a Reynolds number of 4 x 10 (exp 6) and a Mach number of 0. 19 {{to determine the effects}} of the bodies on the wing span load distributions. The wings had 45 degrees sweepback of the quarter-chord line, aspect ratio 8. 02, taper ratio 0. 45, and incorporated 12 -percent-thick airfoil sections streamwise. One wing was untwisted and uncambered whereas the second wing incorporated both twist and camber. Identical bodies of revolution, of 10 : 1 fineness ratio, having diameter-to-span ratios of 0. 10, were mounted in mid-high-wing arrangements. The effects of wind incidence, wing fences, and flap deflection were determined for the plane uncambered wing. The addition of the body to the plane wing increased the exposed wing loading at a given lift coefficient as much as 10 percent with the body at 0 degrees incidence and 4 percent at 4 degrees incidence. The bending-moment coefficients at the wing-body juncture were increased about 2 percent with the body at 0 degrees incidence, whereas the increases were as much as 10 percent with the body at 4 degrees incidence. The spanwise load distributions due to the body on the plane wing as calculated by using a swept-wing method employing 19 spanwise lifting elements and control points generally showed satisfactory agreement with experiment. The spanwise load distributions due to body on the <b>flapped</b> <b>plane</b> wing and on the twisted and cambered wing were dissimilar to those obtained on the plane wing. Neither of the methods of calculation which were employed yielded distributions that agreed consistently with experiment for either the <b>flapped</b> <b>plane</b> wing or the twisted and cambered wing...|$|R
