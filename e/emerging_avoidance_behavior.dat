In addition, <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> {{is a common}} problem among {{patients with}} implantable cardioverter defibrillators. We examined the association between <b>avoidance</b> <b>behaviors</b> and depressive symptoms in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Method: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional study with self-completed questionnaires between May 2010 and March 2011. We measured <b>avoidance</b> <b>behaviors</b> (<b>avoidance</b> of places, avoidance of objects, and avoidance of situations) and depressive symptoms (using the Beck Depression Inventory, Version II) in 119 participants. An <b>avoidance</b> <b>behaviors</b> instrument was developed for this study and we confirmed its internal consistency reliability. Results: Ninety-two (77. 3 %) patients were aged older than 50 years, and 86 (72. 3 %) were men. Fifty-one (42. 9 %) patients reported “avoidance of places”, 34 (28. 6 %) reported “avoidance of objects”, and 63 (52. 9 %) reported “avoidance of activity”. <b>Avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> was associated with increased odds {{for the presence of}} depressive symptoms (OR 1. 31; 95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 62).

40|$|Â© 2017.

This study examined the extent to which <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> moderates the relationship between general anxiety at baseline and 18 months later in women with a diagnosed social anxiety disorder (n = 91) and women with a diagnosed specific phobia (n = 130) at baseline. Circumscribed avoidance of social and specific situations were clinician-rated using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Lifetime (ADIS-IV-L), and general anxiety was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).

A large animal literature shows that the acquisition and extinction of <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> in rodents depends on individual differences (e. g., sex, strain) and might be modulated by the presence of environmental cues. However, there is a dearth of such reports in human literature, mainly {{due to the lack of}} adequate experimental paradigms. In the current study, we employed a computer-based task, where participants control a spaceship and attempt to gain points by shooting an enemy spaceship that appears on the screen. Warning signals predict on-screen aversive events; the participants can learn a protective response to escape or avoid these events. This task has been recently used to reveal facilitated acquisition of <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> in individuals with anxiety vulnerability, due to female sex or inhibited personality. Here, we extended the task to include an extinction phase, and tested the effect of signals that appeared during safe periods. Healthy young adults (n= 122) were randomly assigned to a testing condition with or without such signals. Results showed that the addition of safety signals during the acquisition phase impaired acquisition (in females) and facilitated extinction of the <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior.</b> We also replicated our recent finding of an association between female sex and longer avoidance duration and further showed that females continued to demonstrate more <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> even on extinction trials when the aversive events no longer occurred.

40|$|Background and objectives: <b>Avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> {{is central}} to several anxiety disorders. The current study tested whether <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> for spiders depends on a dynamic interplay between {{implicit}} and explicit processes, moderated by the availability to exert control through working memory capacity (WMC). Methods: A total of 63 participants completed an approach-avoidance task, an implicit association test, a spider fear questionnaire and a behavioral avoidance test that included an assessment of approach distance as well as approach speed. WMC was measured by a complex operation span task. It was hypothesized that in individuals with low WMC, implicit avoidance tendencies and implicit negative associations predict <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> for a spider better than the explicit measure, whereas in high WMC individuals, the explicit measure should better predict <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> than the implicit measures. Results: Results revealed that WMC moderated the influence of implicit negative associations, but not implicit avoidance tendencies, on spider approach distance but not the speed of approaching. Although explicit spider fear directly influenced <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior,</b> its impact was not modulated by WMC. Limitations: Participants in our study were from a non-clinical sample, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Conclusions: These findings suggest that implicit processes might become more pertinent for fear behavior {{as the ability to}} control such processes wanes, which may be particularly relevant for anxiety disorders given their association with lowered executive control functioning.

Methods: Data were analyzed from 841 adolescent girls aged 13 to 15 years old who completed an internet-delivered survey {{as part of a}} cohort study examining SHS exposure and substance use. Measures assessed demographics, smoking behavior and intentions, frequency and locations of SHS exposure, and <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> related to SHS. Results: Excluding their own smoking, 27 % of girls reported exposure {{at least once a week}} and an additional 17 % reported daily or almost daily exposure over the past month. Among girls who reported daily or almost daily exposure, the locations of most frequent levels of high exposure were in the home, at or near school, inside a vehicle, and outdoor public places. <b>Avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> related to SHS exposure significantly differed by overall SHS exposure in the past month. Conclusions: Despite historically low smoking rates, many adolescent girls continue to report regular SHS exposure in multiple locations in British Columbia.

Such <b>avoidance</b> <b>behaviors</b> could greatly impact daily routines of the community and the local economy. This study examined the prevalence of the <b>avoidance</b> <b>behaviors</b> (i. e. avoiding going out, visiting crowded places and visiting hospitals) and negative psychological responses of the general population in Hong Kong at the initial stage of the H 1 N 1 epidemic. Methods A sample of 999 respondents was recruited in a population-based survey. Using random telephone numbers, respondents completed a structured questionnaire by telephone interviews at the 'pre-community spread phase' of the H 1 N 1 epidemic in Hong Kong. Results This study found that 76. 5 % of the respondents currently avoided going out or visiting crowded places or hospitals, whilst 15 % felt much worried about contracting H 1 N 1 and 6 % showed signs of emotional distress. Females, older respondents, those having unconfirmed beliefs about modes of transmissions, and those feeling worried and emotionally distressed due to H 1 N 1 outbreak were more likely than others to adopt some <b>avoidance</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Those who perceived high severity and susceptibility of getting H 1 N 1 and doubted the adequacy of governmental preparedness were more likely than others to feel emotionally distressed.

40|$|Objective: Addiction {{is often}} {{conceptualized}} as a behavioral strategy for avoiding negative experiences. In rodents, opioid intake {{has been associated}} with abnormal acquisition and extinction of <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior.</b> Here, we tested the hypothesis that these findings would generalize to human opioid-dependent subjects. Method: Adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for heroin dependence and treated with opioid medication (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 26) were recruited between March 2013 and October 2013 and given a computer-based task to assess <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior.</b> For this task, subjects controlled a spaceship and could either gain points by shooting an enemy spaceship or hide in safe areas to avoid on-screen aversive events. Hiding duration during different periods of the task was used to measure <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior.</b> Results: While groups did not differ on escape responding (hiding) during the aversive event, heroin-dependent men (but not women) made more avoidance responses during a warning signal that predicted the aversive event (analysis of variance, sex × group interaction, P =. 007). Heroin-dependent men were also slower to extinguish the avoidance response when the aversive event no longer followed the warning signal (P =. 011). This behavioral pattern resulted in reduced opportunity to obtain reward without reducing risk of punishment. Results suggest that, in male patients, differences in <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> cannot be easily explained by impaired task performance or by exaggerated motor activity. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for abnormal acquisition and extinction of <b>avoidance</b> <b>behavior</b> in opioid-dependent patients. Interestingly, data suggest that abnormal avoidance is demonstrated only by male patients.
