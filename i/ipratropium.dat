5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. <b>Ipratropium</b> nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Bronchodilatation {{is already}} maximized in the exercising horse, {{therefore}} bronchodilatory agents such as <b>ipratropium,</b> albuterol, or clenbuterol are not {{effective in reducing}} EIPH.|$|E
25|$|Other {{bronchodilators}} {{that may}} be used include aminophylline, although this may lead to excitation, and is only effective in 50% of cases, or <b>ipratropium</b> (which is relatively short acting at 4–6 hours duration).|$|E
2500|$|Respiratory {{medications}} such as salbutamol, <b>Ipratropium</b> bromide and methylprednisolone, used {{to treat}} conditions such as asthma and acute bronchitis ...|$|E
2500|$|Current {{scope of}} practice: [...] Ibuprofen, 3/12 lead ECG acquisition, nasopharyngeal airway, nebulised salbutamol, nebulised <b>ipratropium,</b> GTN spray, IM glucagon, {{laryngeal}} mask airway, ondansetron (oral), loratadine, PEEP valve, adrenaline (IM, IN and nebulised), prednisone, tramadol, urinary catheter troubleshooting, laryngoscopy (Wellington Free Ambulance), Magills forceps.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the decline in lung function observed in chronic bronchitis may be slowed with smoking cessation. Chronic bronchitis is treated symptomatically and may be treated in a nonpharmacologic manner or with pharmacologic therapeutic agents. Typical nonpharmacologic approaches to the management of COPD including bronchitis may include: pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. Inflammation and edema of the respiratory epithelium may be reduced with inhaled corticosteroids. Wheezing and shortness of breath can be treated by reducing bronchospasm (reversible narrowing of smaller bronchi due to constriction of the smooth muscle) [...] with bronchodilators such as inhaled long acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (e.g., salmeterol) and inhaled anticholinergics such as <b>ipratropium</b> bromide or tiotropium bromide. Mucolytics may have a small therapeutic effect on acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Supplemental oxygen is used to treat hypoxemia (too little oxygen in the blood) and {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality in chronic bronchitis patients. Oxygen supplementation can result in decreased respiratory drive, leading to increased blood levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and subsequent respiratory acidosis.|$|E
2500|$|Primary Care Paramedics (PCPs) are the {{entry-level}} of paramedic {{practice in}} some Canadian provinces. The scope of practice includes performing semi-automated external defibrillation. Oxygen administration. Establishing an IV. Cardiac monitoring such as Lead 2 and 12 Lead interpretation. Administration of Symptom Relief Medications {{for a variety}} of emergency medical conditions (these include epinephrine, salbutamol, <b>ipratropium</b> bromide, aspirin, nitroglycerine, naloxone, dextrose, thiamine, glucagon, gravol, benadryl and nitrous oxide). In addition, some services have started implementing non-opiate medications so that Primary Care Paramedics can treat patients that require pain management. These medications include ketorolac, aceotominophen and ibuprofen. As of 2015, PCP's can now administer Naloxone for suspected opiate overdose. [...] performing trauma immobilization, including cervical immobilization, and other basic medical care. PCPs may also receive additional training in order to perform certain skills that are normally in the scope of practice of ACPs, such as interpretation or transmission of a 12 lead EKG. This is regulated both provincially (by statute) and locally (by the medical director), and ordinarily entails an aspect of medical oversight by a specific body or group of physicians. [...] This {{is often referred to as}} medical control, and is the role played by a base hospital.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of anticholinergics are tiotropium (Spiriva) and <b>ipratropium</b> bromide.|$|E
5000|$|Anticholinergic medications, such as <b>ipratropium</b> bromide, provide {{additional}} benefit {{when used in}} combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms. Anticholinergic bronchodilators {{can also be used}} if a person cannot tolerate a SABA. If a child requires admission to hospital additional <b>ipratropium</b> does not appear to help over a SABA.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} anticholinergics used in COPD, <b>ipratropium</b> and tiotropium. <b>Ipratropium</b> is a short-acting agent while tiotropium is long-acting. Tiotropium is {{associated}} with a decrease in exacerbations and improved quality of life, and tiotropium provides those benefits better than <b>ipratropium.</b> It does not appear to affect mortality or the overall hospitalization rate. Anticholinergics can cause dry mouth and urinary tract symptoms. They are also associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Aclidinium, another long acting agent, reduces hospitalizations associated with COPD and improves quality of life. Aclinidinium has been used as an alternative to tiotropium, but it is not known which drug is more effective.|$|E
50|$|If <b>ipratropium</b> is inhaled, {{side effects}} {{resembling}} {{those of other}} anticholinergics are minimal. However, dry mouth and sedation have been reported. Also, effects such as skin flushing, tachycardia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, nausea, palpitations and headache have been observed. Inhaled <b>ipratropium</b> does not decrease mucociliary clearance. The inhalation itself can cause headache and irritation of the throat in a few percent of patients.|$|E
50|$|Important muscarinic antagonists include atropine, Hyoscyamine, hyoscine butylbromide and hydrobromide, <b>ipratropium,</b> tropicamide, cyclopentolate, and pirenzepine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ipratropium</b> as a nasal {{solution}} sprayed {{into the}} nostrils can reduce rhinorrhea {{but will not}} help nasal congestion.|$|E
50|$|Fenoterol is {{produced}} and sold by Boehringer Ingelheim as Berotec N and {{in combination with}} <b>ipratropium</b> as Berodual N.|$|E
5000|$|Respiratory {{medications}} such as salbutamol, <b>Ipratropium</b> bromide and methylprednisolone, used {{to treat}} conditions such as asthma and acute bronchitis ...|$|E
50|$|Chemically, <b>ipratropium</b> bromide is a {{quaternary}} ammonium compound obtained by treating atropine with isopropyl bromide, thus the name: isopropyl + atropine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ipratropium</b> {{exhibits}} broncholytic {{action by}} reducing cholinergic {{influence on the}} bronchial musculature. It blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, without specificity for subtypes, and therefore promotes the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in a decreased intracellular concentration of cGMP. Most likely due to actions of cGMP on intracellular calcium, this results in decreased contractility of smooth muscle in the lung, inhibiting bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. It is a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, and does not diffuse into the blood, which prevents systemic side effects. <b>Ipratropium</b> is a derivative of atropine but is a quaternary amine and therefore does not cross the blood-brain barrier, which prevents central side effects (anticholinergic syndrome). <b>Ipratropium</b> is not considered a short-acting bronchodilator and should never be used in place of salbutamol (albuterol) as a rescue medication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ipratropium</b> bromide was {{developed}} in Germany in 1976. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Ipratropium</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale price in the developing world is about 6.60 USD for a 200 dose inhaler. In the United States, a month worth of medication costs 100 to 200 USD.|$|E
50|$|Bronchodilatation {{is already}} maximized in the exercising horse, {{therefore}} bronchodilatory agents such as <b>ipratropium,</b> albuterol, or clenbuterol are not {{effective in reducing}} EIPH.|$|E
50|$|Interactions {{with other}} anticholinergics like {{tricyclic}} antidepressants, antiparkinson drugs and quinidine, which theoretically increase side effects, are clinically irrelevant when <b>ipratropium</b> is administered as an inhalant.|$|E
50|$|Muscarinic antagonists such as <b>ipratropium</b> bromide {{can also}} be {{effective}} in treating asthma, since acetylcholine is known to cause smooth muscle contraction, especially in the bronchi.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} preparation <b>ipratropium</b> bromide/salbutamol is a formulation containing <b>ipratropium</b> bromide (an anticholinergic) and salbutamol sulfate (albuterol sulfate, a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist) used in {{the management}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma (not an FDA approved usage). It is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim as a metered dose inhaler (MDI) and nebuliser under the trade name Combivent. It is also marketed by Dey, L.P. (Napa, California) under the brand name DuoNeb as a nebulizer. In Italy it is known as Breva. The chemical is sold in India by Cipla as duolin.|$|E
50|$|Its developer, Boehringer Ingelheim, is {{currently}} conducting Phase III clinical trials in the U.S. {{with a variety}} of their products, such as Spiriva (tiotropium bromde) and Combivent (<b>ipratropium</b> bromde/albuterol).|$|E
50|$|The main {{contraindication}} for inhaled <b>ipratropium</b> is hypersensitivity to atropine {{and related}} substances. For oral administration, contraindications {{are similar to}} other anticholinergics; they include narrow angle glaucoma and obstructions in the gastrointestinal tract and urinary system.|$|E
50|$|Tiotropium {{and another}} member of its class <b>ipratropium</b> were linked to {{increased}} risk of heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death. The FDA requested further trials; these are now complete, and adequately resolve the previous safety concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Gustatory {{rhinitis}} - spicy and pungent food may in {{some people}} produce rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, lacrimation, sweating and flushing of face. It can be relieved by <b>ipratropium</b> bromide nasal spray (an anticholinergic), {{a few minutes before}} meal.|$|E
50|$|Ligands {{targeting}} the mAChR {{that are currently}} approved for clinical use include non-selective antagonists {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease, atropine (to dilate the pupil), scopolamine (used to prevent motion sickness), and <b>ipratropium</b> (used in the treatment of COPD).|$|E
50|$|<b>Ipratropium</b> is {{administered}} by inhalation {{for the treatment of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma exacerbation. For that purpose, it is supplied in a canister for use in an inhaler or in single dose vials for use in a nebulizer.|$|E
5000|$|Inhaled {{bronchodilators}} {{open up the}} airways in the lungs. These include salbutamol and terbutaline (both β2-adrenergic agonists), and <b>ipratropium</b> (an anticholinergic).

50|$|Current {{scope of}} practice: Ibuprofen, 3/12 lead ECG acquisition, nasopharyngeal airway, nebulised salbutamol, nebulised <b>ipratropium,</b> GTN spray, IM glucagon, {{laryngeal}} mask airway, ondansetron (oral), loratadine, PEEP valve, adrenaline (IM, IN and nebulised), prednisone, tramadol, urinary catheter troubleshooting, laryngoscopy (Wellington Free Ambulance), Magills forceps.|$|E
50|$|People {{experiencing}} bronchospasm {{due to the}} β2 receptor-blocking {{effects of}} nonselective beta blockers may be treated with anticholinergic drugs, such as <b>ipratropium,</b> which are safer than beta agonists in patients with cardiovascular disease. Other antidotes for beta-blocker poisoning are salbutamol and isoprenaline.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include dry mouth, cough, and {{inflammation}} of the airways. Potentially serious side effects include urinary retention, worsening spasms of the airways, and a severe allergic reaction. It appears to be safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. <b>Ipratropium</b> is a muscarinic antagonist, a type of anticholinergic, which works by causing smooth muscles to relax.|$|E
50|$|Aclidinium is a long-acting, {{reversible}} antagonist at muscarinic receptors, {{with similar}} affinity to all five subtypes, {{but with a}} dissociation half-life from subtype M3 of 29.2 hours, or six times longer than that from M2. For comparison, M3 dissociation half-lives of the related drugs <b>ipratropium</b> and tiotropium are 0.47 hours and 62.2 hours, respectively.|$|E
