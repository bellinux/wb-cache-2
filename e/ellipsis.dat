5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended <b>ellipsis</b> at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is <b>ellipsis.</b> Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E

25|$|Either an <b>ellipsis</b> or an em dash can {{indicate}} aposiopesis, {{the rhetorical}} device {{by which a}} sentence is stopped short not because of interruption, but because the speaker is too emotional or pensive to continue. Because the <b>ellipsis</b> is the more common choice, an em dash for this purpose may be ambiguous in expository text, as many readers would assume interruption, {{although it may be}} used to indicate great emotion in dramatic monologue.|$|E

25|$|Even some {{infinite}} sets can be diagrammed by superimposing an <b>ellipsis</b> (...) on {{a finite}} sub-order. This {{works well for}} the natural numbers, but it fails for the reals, {{where there is no}} immediate successor above 0; however, quite often one can obtain an intuition related to diagrams of a similar kind.|$|E
25|$|This new idiom, {{combined}} with a study of 19th-century French poetry, {{formed the basis of}} American input into 20th-century English-language poetic modernism. Ezra Pound (1885–1972) and T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) were the leading figures at the time, with their rejection of traditional poetic form and meter and of Victorian diction. Both steered American poetry toward greater density, difficulty, and opacity, with an emphasis on techniques such as fragmentation, <b>ellipsis,</b> allusion, juxtaposition, ironic and shifting personae, and mythic parallelism. Pound, in particular, opened up American poetry to diverse influences, including the traditional poetries of China and Japan.|$|E
25|$|This {{changed with}} the {{introduction}} of the HP82240B printer in 1989 and the HP48 series in 1990, which came with a new character set now based on ECMA94/ ISO8859-1 instead of HPRoman-8, but with the control codes in the range 128 to 159 (0x80 to 0x9F) being replaced by additional displayable characters. Compared to ISO8859-1, codepoint 127 (0x7F) showed a medium shaded gray box like in the former HPRoman-8 based character set. Code points 131 (0x83) to 142 (0x8E) were also taken over from the former HPRoman-8 based character set. In addition to this, codepoint 31 (0x1F) was used for <b>ellipsis</b> (…) and codepoints 169 (0xA9) and 174 (0xAE) showed ambiguous glyphs which could be viewed as inverse circled numbers ❸ or copyright (©) and as ❷ or registered trademark (®), respectively. This first version of the character set also had a non-breaking space at position 160 (0xA0).|$|E
25|$|Syntactic {{dependencies}} are {{the focus}} of most work in dependency grammar, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many dependency grammars can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of dependency grammars is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of constituency grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic constituency tests being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and <b>ellipsis</b> constituency tests. Etymological considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution. When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.|$|E

500|$|Herschel {{notified}} the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: [...] "I don't {{know what to}} call it.

500|$|Responding to {{an article}} in The Nation by Alexander Cockburn, Dershowitz also cited The Chicago Manual of Style:Cockburn's claim {{is that some of}} the quotes should not have been cited to their {{original}} sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes I stumbled upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters's book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: [...] "With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This...helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism ... To cite a source from a secondary source ('quoted in...') is generally to be discouraged...." ...to which Cockburn responded:Quoting The Chicago Manual of Style, Dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing [...] "the original" [...] as opposed to the secondary source, Peters. He misrepresents Chicago here, where [...] "the original" [...] means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.Now look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point <b>ellipsis.</b> As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage ("To cite a source from a secondary source...") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the <b>ellipsis,</b> in a section titled [...] "Citations Taken from Secondary Sources." [...] Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: [...] "'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source ("quoted in") is generally to be discouraged, since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed."So Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals. Plagiarism, QED, plus added time for willful distortion of the language of Chicago's guidelines, cobbling together two separate discussions. On behalf of Dershowitz, Harvard Law School dean Elena Kagan asked former Harvard president Derek Bok to investigate the assertion of plagiarism; Bok exonerated Dershowitz of the charge. In an April 3, 2007 interview with the Harvard Crimson, [...] "Dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last September to DePaul faculty members lobbying against Finkelstein's tenure." ...|$|E
500|$|Pretty on the Inside was {{released}} on September 17, 1991, in the United States on Caroline Records and on City Slang in Europe. The album's lead single, [...] "Teenage Whore", {{was released}} in Europe on September 23, and entered the UK Indie Chart's Top 10 at number one on September 28, 1991, beating out [...] "Heaven Sent An Angel" [...] by Revolver, [...] "Let It Slide" [...] by Mudhoney, and [...] "Love to Hate You" [...] by Erasure, among others. On The Chart Show on Channel 4, the song's title was censored with <b>ellipsis</b> {{in place of the}} word [...] "whore". The single's success in the United Kingdom led the band to perform a twelve-date tour of the country supporting Mudhoney. The subsequent success of both the album, single, and tour saw Hole embark on a further three tours of the United States, Germany and Western Europe {{in the latter half of}} 1991, playing again with Mudhoney, as well as alternative rock acts Daisy Chainsaw and Therapy?. In spite of the album's popularity in the United Kingdom, it failed to chart in the United States despite extensive touring, though it was known to be outselling Nirvana's output before the band's release of Nevermind the following week.|$|E
500|$|In 1781, the {{astronomer}} William Herschel was searching {{the sky for}} elusive stellar parallaxes, when he observed what he termed a comet in the constellation of Taurus. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased {{in proportion to the}} power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope. However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his [...] "comet", his colleague, British Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, wrote to him, saying, [...] "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric <b>ellipsis.</b> I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it." [...] The [...] "comet" [...] was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named Uranus after the father of Saturn.|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote, [...] "Beyoncé may {{not know}} a thing about algebra, {{but when it comes to}} the math of power ballads, she totally gets it." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "the album [...] opens with its most tender ballad, a slow-burning number that calls back to both Sam Cooke's 'Wonderful World' and Prince's 'Purple Rain' without {{sounding}} like a retread of either tune [...] it sounds best in the context of the album, where its slow, steady build to a cathartic guitar break is the perfect introduction to a set of mostly low-key tracks about love and heartbreak." [...] Similarly considering [...] "1+1" [...] to be [...] "the perfect opener" [...] of 4, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that it exposes a more vulnerable side of Beyoncé and that it will remain [...] "a classic stripped-back slow jam from the diva." [...] Praising Beyoncé's vocals, Jon Caramainca of The New York Times stated that [...] " [...] requires a vocal muscle few singers possess, and even fewer would care to deploy." [...] Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Wesley Case included [...] "1+1" [...] in his list of Five Great Songs and praised song's concept, writing that he began crying when he heard the album version and called it [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] and [...] "gorgeous". Case appreciated Beyoncé's sensitivity and concluded that it [...] "fades to black like an <b>ellipsis</b> and it's so damn beautiful." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of Love and Rockets, the Hernandez {{brothers}} made increasing using of what Joseph Witek calls [...] "uncued closure": frequent use of abrupt <b>ellipsis</b> to pack large amounts of narrative into {{a small number of}} panels, relying on readers to fill in the gaps. [...] In Poison River the gaps between panels, which readers normally processed unconsciously, come to the forefront in a slow, staccato rhythm. [...] Panels are crowded with abundant dialogue, stretching out their perceived duration in time, while transitions from one panel to another are sudden—as are transitions from scene to scene, which can happen several times per page. [...] Hernandez limits the narrative only to important details, showing rapid growth in his characters and situations in limited space, rather than relating the story in a traditional step-by-step manner. [...] He compresses great a great deal of action into a minimum of panels, as in a two panel sequence which critic Jordan Raphael says [...] "delineates both the entirety (action and consequences) of a shootout between rival gangs even as [...] reveals each character's guiding motivation". [...] The narrative's chronology is fluid, with frequent jumps in time, such as an uncued 16-page flashback sequence. [...] Hernandez avoids using captions, leaving such jumps to the reader to sort out. [...] The copious, compact dialogue gives the reader an impression {{of what is going on}} at a given moment, but filtered through the speaker.|$|E
500|$|The {{recourse}} to oral literature schemes {{made it into}} his writings, where it became a defining trait. As part of this process, Călinescu assessed, [...] "Creangă acts as all his characters in turn, for his stories are almost entirely spoken.... When Creangă recounts, the composition is not extraordinary, but once his heroes begin talking, their gesticulation and wording reach a height in typical storytelling." [...] According to the critic, discovering this [...] "fundamental" [...] notion about Creangă's work was the merit of literary historian and Viața Românească editor Garabet Ibrăileanu, who had mentioned it as a main proof of affiliation to realism. The distinctive manner of characterization through [...] "realistic dialogues" [...] is seen by Vianu as a highly personal intervention and indicator of the Moldavian writer's originality. Both Vianu and Călinescu discussed this trait, together with the technique of imparting subjective narration in-between characters' replies, as creating other meeting points between Creangă and his counterpart Caragiale. Partly replicating in paper the essence of social gatherings, Ion Creangă often tried to transpose the particular effects of oral storytelling into writing. Among these characteristic touches were interrogations addressed to the readers as imaginary listeners, and pausing for effect with the visual aid of <b>ellipsis.</b> He also often interrupted his narratives with concise illustrations of his point, often in verse form, and usually introduced by vorba ceea (an expression literally meaning [...] "that word", but covering the sense of [...] "as word goes around"). One example of this connects the notions of abundance and personal satisfaction: ...|$|E
