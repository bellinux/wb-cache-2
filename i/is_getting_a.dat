25|$|In some European {{countries}} government organisations and non-government organisations provide auxiliary {{positions for}} a certain period in institutions like hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of volunteering {{is that there are}} strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that fact, the volunteer <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> limited amount as a pocket money from the government. An organization having one of the biggest manpower in Europe is the German Federal volunteers service (Bundesfreiwilligendienst), that was founded in 2011, by having more than 35.000 federal volunteers in 2012. A much older institution is the Voluntary social year (Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) in Austria and Germany.|$|E

25|$|Its {{educational}} project being based on research, ENS seeks to train its {{students to become}} researchers. The main objective of the education given <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> doctorate, and more than 85% of normaliens achieve this. The students are free {{to choose their own}} course of study but must at least attain a master's degree in research. Since, traditionally, the institution does not have the powers to grand university degrees, this entails that students have to follow courses in other universities in Paris. To this end, ENS cultivates a large number of partnerships and conventions with other higher education institutions to create master's degrees which are co-presided by two institutions. ENS works closely with the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), the Paris-Sorbonne University, the Panthéon-Sorbonne University, HEC Paris and ESSEC Business School in particular to deliver joint diplomas to a certain number of students who have followed courses shared between the two institutions. It is also the main partner in the Paris School of Economics project which it has launched along with the EHESS, the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique (ENSAE) and the École des Ponts. This project seeks to create a unified Master's-level economics school in Paris.|$|E

[...] Some critics agreed.

2500|$|Though {{the closest}} of confidants, Beavis and Butt-Head have a jaded, violent, {{and at times}} {{borderline}} sadistic relationship.

[...] if Butt-Head feels his friend <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> bit too hyperactive, as he often does). On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (“Madame Blavatsky”, “They're Coming to Take Me Away, Huh Huh”). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In [...] "Canoe", he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across {{the head with a}} paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it). Butt-Head usually knows when Beavis is approaching his breaking point and will back off (as seen when he calls Beavis [...] "Buttknocker" [...] or insults Metallica one too many times). In [...] "Choke", he specifically states that Butt-Head is [...] "not really my friend". Nevertheless, it can be inferred that the duo are still best friends, considering their shared activities, residency, interests, and their lack of any other friends. The two usually complement each other when one makes any sort of endeavor, especially if it involves their lifelong goal to 'score with chicks'.|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{returned}} to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, {{a crowd of}} 53,775 people showed up for the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing. Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' bullpen, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students [...] sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful Craig Sager actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota. As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: [...] "Henry Aaron, {{in the second inning}} walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!" [...] Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully addressed the racial tension— or apparent lack thereof— in his call of the home run: [...] "What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ...And {{for the first time in}} a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous strain and relief of what it must have been like to live with for the past several months." [...] On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final home run as a Braves player. Thirty days later, after Aaron decided not to retire, the Braves traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roger Alexander and Dave May. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball's all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star Game selection); he lined out to Dave Concepción as a pinch-hitter in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium.|$|E
