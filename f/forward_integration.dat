40|$|International audienceA new Ertel-potential-vorticity {{inversion}} {{method is}} proposed and {{tested in the}} framework of a low-order model as well as in Météo France's operational primitive-equation spectral model, ARPEGE. The potential-vorticity (PV) inversion procedure is designed so that its result lies within the subspace of model solutions, without the use of any explicit balance condition. The inversion is based on a variational problem in which one minimizes simultaneously the distance to the dynamical initialized solution following in a digital-filter method and the PV to be inverted. Since the inverted solution results from model backward and <b>forward</b> <b>integrations,</b> and not from a set of algebraic equations, it possesses a strong dynamical consistency. In the framework of a low-order model, it is found that for small Rossby number, digital-filter initialization lies between nonlinear normal-mode initialization and quasi-geostrophic methods. The method has also been successfully used to rebuild the non-divergent flow, the temperature, and {{a significant part of the}} divergent flow, knowing only the three-dimensional PV field and a boundary condition...|$|R

40|$|Transaction cost {{economics}} (TCE) {{has guided}} {{a variety of}} research on governance in the strategic management literature. An important question arises, however, {{as to whether the}} TCE framework is equally appropriate for all types of firms in all business settings. In this paper, we argue that TCE is not and suggest that firms with high market power may be able to lower transaction costs under high asset specificity and uncertainty in nonintegrated distribution channels, avoiding the need to utilize highly integrated channels as a result. We test our hypotheses with data collected from 40 manufacturers of electronic and telecommunications products in 109 product-markets in the United States. The results support our hypothesis that transaction cost factors are better at explaining <b>forward</b> channel <b>integration</b> for firms with low market power than for firms with high market power.

40|$|Results from {{a series}} of {{long-term}} numerical integrations of orbits centred on that of C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale-Bopp) are presented. Initially, 33 orbits taken from various sources were integrated in realistic models of the Solar system for various time-scales about the present in the range (- 3, + 2) Myr and analysed to assess the probability of different dynamical outcomes, such as Sun-grazing state or the number of orbits since the comet was captured from a long-period orbit in the Oort cloud. Further integrations were performed using an ensemble of 26 orbits more closely clustered about the present orbit of the comet, based on a more accurate method of orbit determination. We find that the ensemble half-life for the comet tp be captured or ejected is on the order of 0. 5 Myr in the backward integrations and 1. 2 Myr in the <b>forward</b> <b>integrations,</b> although a few members of our ensemble were captured during strong encounters with Jupiter within 10 revolutions.

However, when pushing <b>forward</b> the <b>integration,</b> {{it is necessary to}} note that new urbanization does not blindly pursue construction of metropolitans; instead, it looks <b>forward</b> an <b>integration</b> of big- and medium-sized cities, small towns, and rural villages. Cities, towns, and villages demand different public services, and thus, it is necessary for fiscal subsidies to be statically appropriate, i.e., subsidize according to the different demands cities and rural areas have; and the subsidies must also be dynamically flexible, i.e., be human centered, taking population migration into consideration, and coordinate the supply and subsidy of public service provision in urban and rural areas. For instance, when subsidizing for medical and health-care services, it is necessary to recognize what the local medical and health-care industry demands, and difference between urban and rural needs should be considered; at the same time, {{it is also important to}} make sure when rural population migrate and get settled in cities so that the already subsidized rural medical and health-care industry can also be transferred to the cities so as to avoid resource waste.|$|R
