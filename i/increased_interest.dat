5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films.

Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes.
