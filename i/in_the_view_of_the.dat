5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} team, Peggy's {{breast cancer}} was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism {{was also an}} issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer. In 2001, {{it was reported that}} Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised EastEnders for this.|$|E
5|$|Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) {{is a set}} of four similar oil {{paintings}} by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland {{at the behest of the}} Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E

5|$|These repressive {{measures}} included taking prominent Serbs hostage against Serb attacks. To {{avoid being}} {{taken as a}} hostage, Stojanović paid 100,000 dinars to the Ustaše in Prijedor. Resistance began to emerge in occupied Yugoslavia; royalists and Serbian nationalists {{under the leadership of}} then-Colonel Draža Mihailović founded the Ravna Gora Movement, whose members were called Chetniks. The KPJ, led by Josip Broz Tito, prepared to rise to arms at a favourable moment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KPJ, the fight against the Axis and its domestic collaborators would be a common fight of all Yugoslav peoples.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth was {{a son of}} the Æthelmær the Stout and a {{grandson}} of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of Æthelred I. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was told at Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his hand made a motion much like that an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan {{is said to have}} prophesied that Æthelnoth would become an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Hagiographic {{accounts}} of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's Life and Times of Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration {{soon became a}} byword for corruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed Harding, as did Samuel Hopkins Adams' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, Revelry. These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the Great Depression in full swing, Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding.|$|E

This includes non-Christians, those who, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church, do not have valid baptism (such as Mormons), and those who, again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church, have valid baptism but not valid confirmation or Eucharist.

25|$|The {{initiative}} Choice in eCommerce {{was founded}} on May 8, 2013 by several online retailers in Berlin, Germany.
