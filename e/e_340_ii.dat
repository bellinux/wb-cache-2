However, the latter decreases with time of storage, due to complex alteration reactions. This study presents a first approach of alteration reactions in a particular range of products: drum-dried pregelatinized cereal products. While this type of product is widely used as thickeners or in infant foods, no study has ever been made on the subject. The cereal studied here {{is one of the most}} consumed by mankind: rice.

40|$|This work {{constitutes}} the first {{approach of the}} phenomena’s responsible for the ageing of partially hydrolyzed and pregelatinized cereal products. To our knowledge, no studies have been made on the subject. First, physico-chemical properties of a rice based product were followed during natural and accelerated (55 °C – 12 % RH) ageing. From the results, it appeared the properties evolution was {{probably due to the}} protein oxidation and denaturation, and the starch depolymerization. Next, the influence of chemical (addition of food additives, E 170 and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> <b>ii),</b> physical (reduction of particle size) and biological (choice of cereal, wheat) parameters on the evolution of the product was investigated. The additives could be antioxidant at high temperature; the reduction of the size of particles slows down the ageing, supposedly by compaction of the production; and the wheat based product doesn’t evolve. Finally, a new method for volatiles analysis, by TD-GC-MS, was developed to study the olfactory alterations of pregelatinized products. Its relevance was evaluated on fresh and old products. Then the method was validated for three aldehydes, for a range between 0 and 10 000 ng. Eventually, it was applied on the studied product...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{stimulation}} by odorants, Ca 2 + and Na+ {{enter the}} cilia of olfactory sensory neurons through channels directly gated by cAMP. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels {{have been found}} in a variety of cells and extensively investigated in the past few years. Glutamate residues at position 363 of the alpha subunit of the bovine retinal rod channel have previously been shown to constitute a cation-binding site important for blockage by external divalent cations and to control single-channel properties. It has therefore been assumed, but not proven, that glutamate residues at the corresponding position of the other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels play a similar role. We studied the corresponding glutamate (<b>E</b> <b>340)</b> of the alpha subunit of the bovine olfactory channel to determine its role in channel gating and in permeation and blockage by Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. <b>E</b> <b>340</b> was mutated into either an aspartate, glycine, glutamine, or asparagine residue and properties of mutant channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were measured in excised patches. By single-channel recordings, we demonstrated that the open probabilities in the presence of cGMP or cAMP were decreased by the mutations, with a larger decrease observed on gating by cAMP. Moreover, we observed that the mutant <b>E</b> <b>340</b> N presented two conductance levels. We found that both external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + powerfully blocked the current in wild-type and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> D mutants, whereas their blockage efficacy was drastically reduced when the glutamate charge was neutralized. The inward current carried by external Ca 2 + relative to Na+ was larger in the <b>E</b> <b>340</b> G mutant compared with wild-type channels. In conclusion, we have confirmed that the residue at position <b>E</b> <b>340</b> of the bovine olfactory CNG channel is in the pore region, controls permeation and blockage by external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, and affects channel gating by cAMP more than by cGMP...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} properties of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from Rough Sike, a stream draining blanket peat in the northern Pennines, UK, were investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays. Nine stream samples were collected at different discharges during 2003 - 2006, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid {{was used as a}} quality control standard in the assays. Dissolved organic matter in high-discharge samples was more light-absorbing at 280 and 340 nm and adsorbed more strongly to alumina, than DOM characteristic of low streamflow, but was less fluorescent and hydrophilic, and poorer in proton-dissociating groups. No significant differences were found in light absorption at 254 nm, copper- or benzo(a) pyrene binding, or photochemical fading. Combination of the Rough Sike data with previously-published results for other streams and a lake yields totals of 20 - 23 values per assay, for a range of DOM types. Analysis of these data shows that DOM hydrophilicity and adsorption are well-predicted by linear relationships with the extinction coefficient at <b>340</b> nm (<b>E</b> <b>340),</b> while good quadratic relationships exist between <b>E</b> <b>340</b> and both buffering capacity and fluorescence.

40|$|Comparative {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor in its empty {{as well as}} agonist(i. e. active) and antagonist-bound (i. e. nonactive) forms have been carried out. The agonists 5 -HT and (R) - 8 -OH-DPAT {{as well as the}} antagonist WAY 100635 have been employed. The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the receptor portions close to the E/DRY/W motif, with prominence to the cytosolic extensions of helices 3 and 6, are particularly susceptible to undergo structural modification in response to agonist binding. Despite the differences in the structural/dynamics behavior of the two agonists when docked into the 5 -HT 1 A receptor, they both exert a destabilization of the intrahelical and interhelical interactions found in the empty and antagonist-bound receptor forms between the arginine of the E/DRY sequence and both D 133 (3. 49) and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30). For both agonists, the chemical information transfer from the extracellular to the cytosolic domains is mediated by a cluster of aromatic amino acids in helix 61 following the ligand interaction with selected amino acids in the extracellular half of the receptor, such as D 116 (3. 32), S 199 (5. 42), Y 195 (5. 38), and F 361 (6. 51). A significant reduction in the bend at P 360 (6. 50), as compared to the empty and the antagonist-bound receptor forms, is one of the features of the agonist-bound forms that is related to the breakage of the interhelical salt bridge between the E/DRY arginine and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30). Another structural feature, shared by the agonist-bound receptor forms and not by the empty and antagonist-bound forms, is the detachment of helices 2 and 4, as marked by the movement of W 161 (4. 50) away from helix 2, toward the membrane space...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial {{adhesion}} is {{an important}} determinant of colonization and infection, including dental caries. The salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich glycoprotein gp- 340, which mediates adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (implicated in caries), harbours three major size variants, designated gp- 340 I to III, each specific to an individual saliva. Here we have examined the association of the gp- 340 I to III polymorphisms with caries experience and adhesion of S. mutans. Methods A case-referent study was performed in 12 -year-old Swedish children with high (n = 19) or low (n = 19) caries experiences. We measured the gp- 340 I to III saliva phenotypes and correlated those with multiple outcome measures for caries experience and saliva adhesion of S. mutans using the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate projection technique. In addition, we used traditional statistics and 2 -year caries increment to verify the established PLS associations, and bacterial adhesion to purified gp- 340 I to III proteins to support possible mechanisms. Results All except one subject were typed as gp- 340 I to III (10, 23 and 4, respectively). The gp- 340 I phenotype correlated positively with caries experience (VIP = 1. 37) and saliva adhesion of S. mutans Ingbritt (VIP = 1. 47). The gp- <b>340</b> <b>II</b> and III phenotypes tended to behave in the opposite way. Moreover, the gp- 340 I phenotype tended to show an increased 2 -year caries increment compared to phenotypes II/III. Purified gp- 340 I protein mediated markedly higher adhesion of S. mutans strains Ingbritt and NG 8 and Lactococcus lactis expressing AgI/II adhesins (SpaP or PAc) compared to gp- <b>340</b> <b>II</b> and III proteins. In addition, the gp- 340 I protein appeared over represented in subjects positive for Db, an allelic acidic PRP variant associated with caries, and subjects positive for both gp- 340 I and Db tended to experience more caries than those negative for both proteins. Conclusion Gp- 340 I behaves as a caries susceptibility protein. </p...|$|R

We now describe the structure and characteristics of a novel form of GlcCerase under investigation {{for the treatment of}} Gaucher disease, Gene-ActivatedTM human GlcCerase (velaglucerase alfa). In contrast to imiglucerase and prGCD, velaglucerase alfa contains the native human enzyme sequence. All three GlcCerases consist of three domains, with the active site located in domain III.

Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase, as well as their specific activities, are similar.

The predominant glycan on velaglucerase alfa is a high-mannose type, with nine mannose units, while imiglucerase contains a chitobiose tri-mannosyl core glycan with fucosylation.

The red shift in the violet emission band of ceria i. e. from 368 nm to 396 nm with increasing excitation wavelength, {{has been attributed to}} the recombination of electrons trapped in the defect band and the deeply trapped holes in oxygen vacancies.

Observations performed with wild-type (WT) and an integrin-binding-site double-mutant (K 288 <b>E</b> <b>340)</b> suggested that the penton base could enter the cell via an alternative, RGD- and LDV-independent, pathway.

Oxygen reduction is a three-phase reaction, in which protons in the solution phase and oxygen in the air phase combine together on the solid AC catalyst phase (Duteanu et al., 2010; Nie et al., o 47 % of the total ical to reduce the-scale MF a per volu the reactor) (Logan et al., 2015).

No clear correlation exists between the ~ 200 GlcCerase mutations and disease severity, although homozygosity for the common mutations N 370 S and L 444 P is associated with nonneuronopathic and neuronopathic disease, respectively. We report the X-ray structure of GlcCerase at 2. 0 Å resolution. The catalytic domain consists of a (β/α) TIM barrel, as expected for a 8 member of the glucosidase hydrolase A clan.

We demonstrate that this element, which acts in cis, possesses several properties characteristic of transcriptional enhancers. Firstly, it potentiates initiation of transcription from the capsite of the heterologous Ad 2 MLP and from "cryptic" sites often preceded by TATA box-like sequences. Secondly, although there is no critical distance requirement between the enhancer element and the Ad 2 MLP, the extent of stimulation decreases as the distance between the two element increases.

In this study, live and frozen/thawed A. simplex larvae were subjected to conventional or microwave heating during time-temperature suffi{dotless}cient to kill live larvae, and digested with pepsin in the strong conditions used in fi{dotless}sh inspection. The antigenicity of A. simplex in the larvae extracts and in the incubation media fi{dotless}ltrates after all treatmentswas studied. RESULTS: The immunoblotting assay showed the presence of Ani s 4 in all the larvae extracts and all the incubation media filtrates. A. simplex crude antigenswere detected in all conditions; nevertheless, differenceswere observed among treatments, with lower values detected in the filtrates obtained after the strong acidic pepsin treatment. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that ingestion of A. simplex larvae can cause allergy in consumers already sensitised to this allergen, even if the parasitised fish is consumed well-cooked and after freezing in the recommended conditions selected for killing the larvae to avoid human anisakiasis. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) is a lysosomal) beta-glucosidase that degrades glucosylceramide. Its {{deficiency}} {{results in}} Gaucher disease (GD). We {{examined the effects}} of active site occupancy of GBA on its structural stability. For this, we made use of cyclophellitol-derived activity-based probes (ABPs) that bind irreversibly to the catalytic nucleophile (<b>E</b> <b>340),</b> and for comparison, we used the potent reversible inhibitor isofagomine. We demonstrate that cyclophellitol ABPs improve the stability of GBA in vitro, as revealed by thermodynamic measurements (T-m increase by 21 degrees C), and introduce resistance to tryptic digestion. The stabilizing effect of cell-permeable cyclophellitol ABPs is also observed in intact cultured cells containing wild-type GBA, N 370 S GBA (labile in lysosomes), and L 444 P GBA (exhibits impaired ER folding) all show marked increases in lysosomal forms of GBA molecules upon exposure to ABPs. The same stabilization effect is observed for endogenous GBA in the liver of wild-type mice injected with cyclophellitol ABPs. Stabilization effects similar to those observed with ABPs were also noted at high concentrations of the reversible inhibitor isofagomine. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the increase in cellular levels of GBA by ABPs and by the reversible inhibitor is in part caused by their ability to stabilize GBA folding, which increases the resistance of GBA against breakdown by lysosomal proteases. These effects are more pronounced {{in the case of the}} amphiphilic ABPs, presumably due to their high lipophilic potential, which may promote further structural compactness of GBA through hydrophobic interactions. Our study provides further rationale for the design of chaperones for GBA to ameliorate Gaucher diseas...|$|R
40|$|Background: High {{pressure}} (HP) {{ranging from}} 100 to 350 MPa (1 - 15 min) {{was applied to}} Anisakis simplex larvae and parasitised hake (Merluccius merluccius) muscle. The aim {{of the study was}} to kill the larvae to prevent human anisakidosis, to evaluate the effect on A. simplex allergens and to minimally alter fish muscle quality. Results: The larvae were killed at pressures ≥ 200 MPa and times ≥ 1 min, producing alterations in the larva body and ruptures in the cuticle when observed by scanning electron microscopy. Nevertheless, Ani s 4 and A. simplex crude antigens were recognised by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry at all HPs assayed. Small changes in colour and texture were observed in fish muscle under all pressure/time conditions. Major changes were observed visually at 300 MPa, where the muscle appeared as slightly cooked. Apparent viscosity of muscle homogenates decreased significantly at longer times or higher applied pressure. No changes were detected at 200 MPa in the electrophoretic pattern of proteins treated with or without β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that disulfide bonds were not formed. Conclusion: Application of HP at 200 MPa for up to 5 min would kill A. simplex larvae, avoiding infestation of the consumer and causing small changes in the hake muscle perceived sensorially. However, HP-treated A. simplex-parasitised fish would still be a potential hazard for consumers allergic to the larvae. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

[...] Soon, however, they began quarreling over which parts of the African provinces belonged to Carthage, and thus Constantine, and which belonged to Italy, and therefore Constans. This led to growing tensions between the two brothers, which were only heightened by Constans finally coming of age and Constantine refusing to give up his guardianship. In <b>340</b> Constantine <b>II</b> invaded Italy. Constans, at that time in Dacia, detached and sent a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, stating that he would follow them in person with the remainder of his forces. Constantine was eventually trapped at Aquileia, where he died, leaving Constans to inherit all of his brother’s former territories - Hispania, Britannia and Gaul.|$|R
