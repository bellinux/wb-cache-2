40|$|In {{response}} to a Presidential request, this study examines how the <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil market (and related energy markets) in the Northeast behaved {{in the winter of}} 1999 - 2000, explains the role played by residential, commercial, industrial, and electricity generation sector consumers in <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil markets and describes how that role is influenced by the structure of tie energy markets in the Northeast. In addition, this report explores the potential for nonresidential users to move away from <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil and how this might impact future prices, and discusses conversion of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil users to other fuels over the next 5 years. Because the President's and Secretary's request focused on converting factories and other large-volume users of mostly high-sulfur <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil to other fuels, transportation sector use of low-sulfur <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil is not examined here...|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} data collected from gas service providers and end-use customers in the six New England States and offers a preliminary assessment {{of the impact of}} interruptible gas customers on the <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil market this past winter. Based on information collected and analyzed as of October 2000, the main findings areas follows: (1) For interruptible gas customers with <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil as a backup fuel, their volume of interruptions was equivalent to about 1 to 2 percent of the total sales of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil in New England during January-February 2000. For the two peak weeks of gas supply interruptions, however, the equivalent volume of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil amounted to an estimated 3 to 6 percent of total sales in New England. There were no interruptions of the natural gas service during the 2 -month period. (2) Purchases of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil by interruptible gas customers may have contributed somewhat to the spike in the price of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil in January-February 2000, especially during the peak weeks of gas interruptions. Nevertheless, other factors [...] a sudden drop in temperatures, low regional stocks of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuels,</b> and weather-related supply problems during a period of high customer demand [...] appear to have {{played a significant role in}} this price spike, as they have in previous spikes. (3) While this preliminary analysis suggests that interruptible natural gas service does not threaten the stability of the home heating oil market, several steps might be taken-without undermining the benefits of interruptible service [...] to reduce the potential adverse impacts of gas supply interruptions in times of market stress. Regardless of the magnitude of the impact of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil purchases by interruptible gas customers on Northeast heating oil markets, the threat of future heating oil price spikes and supply problems still remains. To help counter the threat, President Clinton in July 2000 directed Secretary Richardson to establish a heating oil component of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the Northeast, and 2 million barrels of heating oil are now stored in the reserve.

40|$|During the {{development}} of a rich-lean staged dry low NOx combustor, the conventional trend of increasing smoke with increasing operating equivalence ratio was found when tests were run with <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> (% H = 13. 0). However, when tests were run with residual fuel (% H = 11. 4), the trend was reversed. In addition, when the same combustor was run with blends of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> and residual fuel, a drastic improvement of smoke was observed when only 6 percent of residual fuel was mixed with <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel,</b> and for any blending of more than 10 percent of residual fuel the combustor was practically smoke free. A chemical analysis of fuel samples revealed an appreciable amount of trace metals in the residual fuel, giving rise to the suspicion that the smoke reduction may have been due in part to these trace metals.

40|$|The {{outlook for}} <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil this winter is for {{increased}} demand {{and a return}} to normal inventory patterns, assuming a resumption of normal, cooler weather than last winter. With industrial production expected to grow slightly from last winter`s pace, overall consumption is projected to increase 3 percent from last winter, to 3. 4 million barrels per day during the heating season (October 1, 1995 -March 31, 1996). Much of the supply win come from stock drawdowns and refinery production. Estimates for the winter are from the Energy Information Administration`s (EIA) 4 th Quarter 1995 Short-Tenn Energy Outlook (STEO) Mid-World Oil Price Case forecast. Inventories in place on September 30, 1995, of 132 million barrels were 9 percent below the unusually high year-earlier level. Inventories of high-sulfur <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil, the principal type used for heating, were 13 percent lower than a year earlier. Supply problems are not anticipated because refinery production and the ready availability of imports should be adequate to meet demand. Residential heating off prices are expected to be somewhat higher than last winter`s, as the effects of lower crude oil prices are offset by lower distillate inventories. Heating oil is forecast to average $ 0. 92 per gallon, the highest price since the winter of 1992 - 93. Diesel fuel (including tax) is predicted to be slightly higher than last year at $ 1. 13 per gallon. This article focuses on the winter assessment for <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil, how well last year`s STEO winter outlook compared to actual events, and expectations for the coming winter. Additional analyses include regional low-sulfur and high-sulfur distillate supply, demand, and prices, and recent trends in <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil inventories...|$|R
40|$|Emissions {{from two}} biofuels, a soy-based {{biodiesel}} and an animal-based biodiesel, were measured and compared to emissions from a <b>distillate</b> petroleum <b>fuel</b> oil. The three fuels were burned {{in a small}} (3. 5 x 10 6 Btu/hr) firetube boiler designed for use in institutional, commercial, and light industrial applications. Emissions were measured for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) using continuous emission monitors. Concentrations and size distributions of particulate matter (PM) were also measured. Flue gas samples were collected and analyzed to determine concentrations of aldehydes and other volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The boiler efficiency was also determined for operation using {{each of the three}} fuels. The most significant difference was for PM, where the <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> oil had emissions roughly ten times higher than for either of the two biodiesel fuels.

40|$|Emissions of particles, gases, heat, {{and water}} vapor from ships are {{discussed}} {{with respect to}} their potential for changing the microstructure of marine stratiform clouds and producing the phenomenon known as "ship tracks. " Airborne measurements are used to derive emission factors of SO_ 2 and NO from diesel-powered and steam turbine-powered ships, burning low-grade marine fuel oil (MFO); they were 15 – 89 and 2 – 25 g kg^(- 1) of fuel burned, respectively. By contrast a steam turbine–powered ship burning high-grade navy <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> had an SO_ 2 emission factor of 6 g kg^(- 1). Various types of ships, burning both MFO and navy <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel,</b> emitted from 4 x 10 ^(15) to 2 x 10 ^(16) total particles per kilogram of fuel burned (4 x 10 ^(15) – 1. 5 x 10 ^(16) particles per second). However, diesel-powered ships burning MFO emitted particles with a larger mode radius (0. 03 – 0. 05 µm) and larger maximum sizes than those powered by steam turbines burning navy <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> (mode radius 0. 02 µm). Consequently, if the particles have similar chemical compositions, those emitted by diesel ships burning MFO will serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at lower supersaturations (and will therefore be more likely to produce ship tracks) than the particles emitted by steam turbine ships burning <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel.</b> Since steam turbine–powered ships fueled by MFO emit particles with a mode radius similar to that of diesel-powered ships fueled by MFO, it appears that, for given ambient conditions, the type of fuel burned by a ship {{is more important than the}} type of ship engine in determining whether or not a ship will produce a ship track. However, more measurements are needed to test this hypothesis. The particles emitted from ships appear to be primarily organics, possibly combined with sulfuric acid produced by gas-to-particle conversion of SO_ 2. Comparison of model results with measurements in ship tracks suggests that the particles from ships contain only about 10...|$|R
