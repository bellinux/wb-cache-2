50|$|As LATAs {{exist for}} US {{regulatory}} purposes, where {{they serve as}} a demarcation between intra-LATA calls (handled by regional Bell operating companies) and <b>inter-LATA</b> calls (handled by interstate long distance carriers such as AT&T), they have no legal significance in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{the local}} calling area {{includes}} a 13-mile (21 km) radius {{from the point}} of origination. The ZUM zone beyond that is divided into ZUM1 (12-13 mile radius), ZUM2 (14-15 mile (24 km) radius), and ZUM3 (15-16 mile (26 km) radius). Beyond the ZUM zone calls are considered intra-LATA or <b>inter-LATA.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the United States, long-distance {{is either}} of two {{different}} classes of calls that are not local calls. The most common class of long-distance is often called interstate long-distance, though the more accurate term is <b>inter-LATA</b> interstate long-distance. This is the form of long-distance most commonly meant by the term, and the one for which long-distance carriers are usually chosen by telephone customers.|$|E
50|$|A reorder tone, {{sometimes}} called a fast busy signal, indicates that no transmission {{path to the}} called number is available. This can occur either because the <b>Inter-LATA</b> trunk is busy {{at the time of}} the call- in which case this clears in a few seconds, if one redials- or the number is temporarily out of service, due to maintenance or the number is not willing to accept calls. It is otherwise played after a recorded announcement explaining the reason for a general call failure.|$|E
5000|$|Another form of long-distance, {{increasingly}} {{relevant to}} more U.S. states, {{is known as}} <b>inter-LATA</b> intrastate long-distance. This refers to a calling area outside of the customer’s LATA but within the customers state. While technically and legally long-distance, this calling area is not necessarily served by the same carrier used for [...] "regular" [...] long-distance, or may be provided at different rates. In some cases, customer confusion occurs as, due to rate or carrier distinctions, a local long-distance call can be billed at a higher per-minute rate than interstate long-distance calls, despite being a shorter distance.|$|E
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of local exchange competition, most telephone companies outsourced directory assistance service to nationwide call centers. This has blurred the distinction between 4-1-1 and 555-1212. For regulatory reasons, where telephone service is provided by traditional local-exchange carriers, the local carrier will determine how to handle 411, the chosen local toll (intra-LATA) carrier will determine how to handle 555-1212 calls for area codes within the LATA, and the chosen long distance carrier for <b>inter-LATA)</b> calls will determine how to handle other area code-555-1212 calls. For service provided by cellular and VoIP carriers where the customer {{does not have a}} choice of local toll or long distance carriers, all calls may be handled the same way.|$|E
50|$|An Interexchange Carrier (IXC) is a U.S. {{legal and}} {{regulatory}} {{term for a}} telecommunications company, commonly called a long-distance telephone company, such as MCI (before its absorption by Verizon), Sprint and the former AT&T Corporation (before its merger with SBC in 2005). In the United States, it is defined as any carrier that provides <b>inter-LATA</b> communication, where a LATA is a local access and transport area. From the telephone user's point of view, the long-distance company does not handle calls {{that do not have}} additional tolls. Calls made across phone circuits within the local geographic area covered by one local network are handled only by that one LATA, commonly called a 'local telephone exchange.' Local calls are usually defined by connections made without additional charge whether the connected call is in the same LATA or connects to another LATA with no charge. In the United States intraLATA usually refers to rated or 'Toll' calls between LATA within state boundaries, as opposed to interstate, or calls between LATA in different states.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the business telecommunications demands for local, intra-LATA and <b>inter-LATA</b> services, using US {{data from a}} Bill Harvesting R survey carried out during 1997. We model heterogeneity, which is present among firms due {{to a variety of}} different business telecommunication needs, by estimating normal heteroskedastic mixture regressions. The results show that a three-component mixture model fits the demand for local services well, while a two-component structure is used to model intra-LATA and <b>inter-LATA</b> demand. We characterize the groups in terms of their differences among the coefficients, and then use Retina to perform automatic model selection over an expanded candidate regressor set which includes heterogeneity parameters as well as transformations of the original variables.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the business telecommunications demand for local, intra-LATA and <b>inter-LATA</b> services, using US telecommunications {{data from a}} Bill Harvesting ® survey carried out during 1997. Available information does not allow specifying demand as function of prices; hence we use flexible modelling estimation tools {{in order to find}} a useful specification with improved predictive ability over alternative models. We use an automated selection method called RElevant Transformations of the Inputs Network Approach (RETINA) due to Perez-Amaral, Gallo and White [9] to approximate the demand function for each service. In addition, we use finite mixtures as a convenient framework to model heterogeneity due to the different usages of telecommunications services in business activity. Combining these tools in an appropriate way we obtain models with improved predictive ability over benchmark models estimated without using any variable selection strategy. 1...|$|E
40|$|The study {{projects}} until 2000 {{the evolution}} of long distance fiber optic networks in the U. S. Volume 1 is the Executive Summary. Volume 2 focuses on fiber optic components and systems that {{are directly related to}} the operation of long-haul networks. Optimistic, pessimistic and most likely scenarios of technology development are presented. The activities of national and regional companies implementing fiber long haul networks are also highlighted, along with an analysis of the market and regulatory forces affecting network evolution. Volume 3 presents advanced fiber optic network concept definitions. <b>Inter-LATA</b> traffic is quantified and forms the basis for the construction of 11 -, 15 -, 17 -, and 23 -node networks. Using the technology projections from Volume 2, a financial model identifies cost drivers and determines circuit mile costs between any two LATAs. A comparison of fiber optics with alternative transmission concludes the report...|$|E
