Alone in the billiard room, Sumner tells Diane that, against her will, he submitted one of her unfinished manuscripts {{to one of his}} colleagues, who praised it, and was sent to publishers. At first, she becomes excited. However, Sumner persuades her to leave <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> behind, including Sam, in order to hone her talents. He warns her that finishing the novel is impossible and that her potentials will be wasted if she marries Sam. Diane tells Sumner to leave the bar and never return again. Unbeknownst to them, Sam overhears this conversation under the pool table whose underneath is covered by drapes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. <b>Everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> was monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E

25|$|Advaita also posits {{the fourth}} state of Turiya, which some {{describe}} as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya {{is the state}} of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (ananta) and non-different (advaita/abheda), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything,</b> for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the Jivanmukta.|$|E

25|$|Hindu texts {{accept a}} polytheistic framework, {{but this is}} {{generally}} conceptualized as the divine essence or luminosity that gives vitality and animation to the inanimate natural substances. There is a divine in everything, human beings, animals, trees and rivers. It is observable in offerings to rivers, trees, tools of one's work, animals and birds, rising sun, friends and guests, teachers and parents. It is the divine in these that makes each sacred and worthy of reverence. This seeing divinity in everything, state Buttimer and Wallin, makes the Vedic foundations of Hinduism quite distinct from Animism. The animistic premise sees multiplicity, power differences and competition between man and man, man and animal, as well as man and nature. The Vedic view does not see this competition, rather sees a unifying divinity that connects <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything.</b>|$|E

Together with them, Zagłoba engages in various adventures, fighting for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and seeking adventures and glory. During a feast, in a rather drunken state, {{he was the first}} to call prince Janusz Radziwiłł a traitor. Eventually he becomes a widely known person, treated with respect by powerful magnates and offering counsel to the king.

The ESTP knows <b>everyone</b> who matters <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> there is to do because they are very resourceful, always knowing where the fun and action is. They like to indulge themselves in the finer things in life and to bring other people with them. Their goal in life is to sell themselves and their ideas to others.

Normally when you record, <b>everyone</b> wears headphones <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> is isolated, so if someone {{makes a mistake}} you can cut it out. We had a PA in the studio - everything bled through everything else. What it meant was we had to record virtually live.

500|$|A few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> is Rudra, and Rudra is the {{principle}} found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. The Kaivalya Upanishad similarly, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who [...] "feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, {{in the depths of}} his heart.|$|E
500|$|The {{next stage}} of Yoga practice, states the text, is termed Ghata (Sanskrit: घट) {{with the goal of}} {{bringing}} union of Prana (breath), Apana (hydration and aeration of body), Manas (mind) and Buddhi (intellect), as well as between Jivatma (life soul force) and Paramatman (supreme soul). This practice is a step, asserts the text, for Pratyahara (withdrawal from distraction by sensory organs) and Dharana (concentration). The aim of Dharana, states Yogatattva, is to conceive <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> one perceives with any of his senses as same as his own self and soul (Atman). In verses 72 to 81, the text describes a range of mystical powers that develop within those who have mastered Ghata stage of yoga. The Upanishad adds that [...] "perfection requires practice, the yogin must never revel in what he achieves, never be vain, never be distracted by trying to comply with demonstration requests, remain oblivious to others, yet be always intent on achieving the goals he sets for himself".|$|E

About {{the message of}} the song, Stan confessed that it [...] "shows love in different ways and portrays as well relationships between obvious couples, which fall into a certain pattern. Love can transform <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> in the most wonderful and important thing in the universe". Alvaro from Spanish music website Popelera pointed out major differences between the dance style of the track and that of its predecessor, [...] "Lemoande" [...] (2012), while Mia, writing for Romanian portal Info Music, drew comparisons with the Pussycat Dolls' single [...] "Hush Hush; Hush Hush" [...] (2009).

500|$|Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars. Reviewer Jim DeRogatis praised the album as [...] "one of the rare epic rock {{releases}} whose bulk is justified in the grooves". The writer stated that the album's main flaw was Corgan's lyrics, describing the songwriter as [...] "wallowing in his own misery and grousing about <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> not meeting his expectations." [...] DeRogatis contended that while Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness [...] "may even match The Wall in its sonic accomplishments", Corgan's lyrics lacked in comparison. Mojo reviewer Ben Edmunds also praised the music while criticizing Corgan's lyrics. Edmunds wrote, [...] " [...] lyrics {{appear to be the}} repository for the worst aspects of his most treasured influences. He writes with a heavy metal aptitude for wordplay and an inflated prog-rock conviction of its worth, a deadening combination.

500|$|Madonna {{wanted to}} use a few {{performers}} from her tour, such as Daniel [...] "Cloud" [...] Campos, Miss Prissy from LaChapelle's Rize crew and traceur Sebastien Foucan, a practitioner of Parkour, a philosophical French sport. Renck said that [...] "It's not about the music, but the bodily expression, [...] We wanted to show the whole spectrum, be it krumping, breakdancing, jazz or disco." [...] Since they could not shoot all over the world, Madonna wanted the video to have an [...] "omnipresent feel", with the middle section of the song generating a sense of congregation. Renck suggested that they include a boombox, used {{as a means of}} uniting <b>everyone</b> <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> since it was through listening to songs on a boombox that street dancing started. Though some scenes in the video feature cities like London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Tokyo, in reality the actual sets were constructed in Los Angeles and London only. A London suburb was made to look like a Parisian one, where the routine for Parkour takes place, whereas a restaurant in London's Chinatown was used for the Shanghai sequence and Compton stood in for the Bronx. The dancers' scenes were shot in early October 2005 within half a day, for a total of six days of shooting.|$|E

Caillat told PopEater about the clip: [...] "The video is me waking {{up in bed and}} singing the song. I'm thinking about that guy and then I'm going and doing stuff around the house, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> in my house kind of portrays the way I'm feeling. There's an alarm clock that you see a smiley face on, and you see a hanger on the door and somehow the door knob and the hanger look like they're smiling. It's all these cool little things when I'm walking around my house. I play with my dog, I start singing to my dog because I'm so happy and giddy. It shows the real moments of when you're not with that person, when you're thinking about them and knowing that you're ready to tell them that you love them." [...] Caillat did get miffed at the way video directors were interpreting the song. She told AOL: [...] "Every single director who sent treatments in it all a wedding dress, or me at the altar or me dreaming about a wedding. And I was like, 'No. Come on, if you understood the song then you'd know it wasn't about that.'" [...] TJ wrote for NeonLimelight that [...] "she has a spring in her step and {{a smile on her face}} thanks to the love of her life she’s thinking about taking a trip down the aisle with in the happy-go-lucky clip, <b>and</b> she inspires <b>everyone</b> — <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> — to turn their frowns upside down." ...|$|R

Mac does not eat the crumpets (since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar, and he can't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind) and is able to save the others.
