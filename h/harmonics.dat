5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as <b>harmonics,</b> are created. <b>Harmonics</b> are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd <b>harmonics)</b> are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
5|$|While <b>harmonics</b> in the PWM output {{can easily}} be {{filtered}} by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, <b>harmonics</b> caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge <b>harmonics</b> because their 5th and 7th <b>harmonics</b> are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

Once the threshold for instability is met, {{a cascade of}} <b>harmonic</b> generation processes is triggered. Firstly, the up-conversion of first <b>harmonic</b> phonons into second <b>harmonic</b> phonons is established. Subsequently, the down-conversion of second <b>harmonic</b> phonons into first <b>harmonic</b> phonons and conversion of first and second <b>harmonic</b> phonons into third <b>harmonic</b> phonons occur. On the similar lines, an eventual conversion of third <b>harmonic</b> phonons to high orders is also observed to commence. This surprising physical pathway for phononic low-order to high-order <b>harmonic</b> conversion may find general relevance to other physical systems. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|The <b>harmonic</b> impact {{caused by}} wind {{turbines}} should be carefully investigated before wind turbines are interconnected. However, the <b>harmonic</b> currents of wind turbines {{are not easily}} predicted due to the variations of wind speed. If the <b>harmonic</b> current outputs can be predicted accurately, the <b>harmonic</b> impact of wind turbines and wind farms for power grids can be analyzed efficiently. Therefore, this paper analyzes the <b>harmonic</b> current characteristics of wind turbines and investigates the feasibility of developing <b>harmonic</b> current predictors. Field measurement, data sorting, and analysis are conducted for wind turbines. Two <b>harmonic</b> current predictors are proposed {{based on the measured}} <b>harmonic</b> data. One is the Auto-Regressive and Moving Average (ARMA) -based <b>harmonic</b> current predictor, which can be used for real-time prediction. The other is the stochastic <b>harmonic</b> current predictor considering the probability density distributions of <b>harmonic</b> currents. It uses the measured <b>harmonic</b> data to establish the probability density distributions of <b>harmonic</b> currents at different wind speeds, and then uses them to implement a long-term <b>harmonic</b> current prediction. Test results use the measured data to validate the forecast ability of these two <b>harmonic</b> current predictors. The ARMA-based predictor obtains poor performance on some <b>harmonic</b> orders due to the stochastic characteristics of <b>harmonic</b> current caused by the variations of wind speed. Relatively, the prediction results of stochastic <b>harmonic</b> current predictor show that the <b>harmonic</b> currents of a wind turbine in long-term operation can be effectively analyzed by the established probability density distributions. Therefore, the proposed stochastic <b>harmonic</b> current predictor is helpful in predicting and analyzing the possible <b>harmonic</b> problems during the operation of wind turbines and wind farms...|$|R

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (<b>harmonics).</b> Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to <b>harmonics,</b> losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{unbalanced}} {{features of}} distribution systems, a three-phase <b>harmonic</b> analysis method {{is essential to}} accurately analyze the <b>harmonic</b> impact on distribution systems. Moreover, <b>harmonic</b> analysis is the basic tool for <b>harmonic</b> filter design and <b>harmonic</b> resonance mitigation; therefore, the computational performance should also be efficient. An accurate and efficient three-phase <b>harmonic</b> analysis method for unbalanced distribution systems is proposed in this paper.
