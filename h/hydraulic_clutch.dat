The wing was redesigned again, {{this time with}} new NACA laminar flow airfoils, 66(215)-116 a=0.6 at the root and a NACA 66(215)-216 a=0.6 at the tip.

At higher altitudes, when additional boost was required, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutch</b> would engage the second supercharger, adding [...] to the service ceiling. A larger four-bladed propeller was also standardized. A persistent complaint against the Airacobra was that its nose armament was not easily accessible for ground maintenance, {{and in order to}} cure this problem, the XP-63 airframe was fitted with larger cowling panels.|$|E

The design method of loads of face flight conveyers in the steady regime with regard to the forces from the failure of material during its carriage and to the beginning of natural vibrations according to the casual character of loading, the design method of power, the method of restriction of maximal loads in the transient regimes have been developed.

50|$|In most {{features}} the Sargos were {{a repeat of}} the Salmons, except for the return to full diesel-electric drive for the last four boats and the adoption of the improved Sargo battery design. The first six Sargos were driven by a composite direct-drive and diesel-electric plant (two engines in each mode) {{in the same manner as}} the Salmons. In this arrangement, two main engines in the forward engine room drove generators. In the after engine room, two side-by-side engines were clutched to reduction gears which sat forward of the engines, with vibration-isolating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutches.</b> Two high-speed electric motors, driven by the generating engines or batteries, were also connected to each reduction gear. The Bureau of Steam Engineering (BuEng) and the General Board desired a full diesel-electric plant, but there were some dissenting opinions, notably Admiral Thomas C. Hart, the only experienced submariner on the General Board, who pointed out that a full diesel-electric system could be disabled by flooding. Technical problems went against the use of two large direct-drive diesels in place of the four-engine composite plant. No engine of suitable power to reach the desired 21-knot speed existed in the US, and the current vibration-isolating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutches</b> were not capable of transmitting enough power. It was also not practical to gear two engines to each shaft. So a full diesel-electric plant was adopted for the last four Sargos, and remained standard for all subsequent conventionally-powered US submarines.|$|R

50|$|Active {{yaw control}} {{is based on}} a {{computer-controlled}} rear differential which can actively split torque based on input from various accelerometers in the vehicle measuring longitudinal and lateral g forces, steering, brakes and throttle position. Where ABS brakes are fitted they too are included in the input parameters. It accomplishes this via two <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutches</b> which can limit torque on individual axles. This system {{should not be confused with}} stability control systems which utilize the braking system of a vehicle by individually braking certain wheels to rotate and slow the car (such as Electronic brakeforce distribution). AYC is a performance-oriented system which aims to increase cornering speeds.|$|R
50|$|Where {{large numbers}} of gear ratios, six or more, are to be {{provided}} then these will require a third or more gear clusters on the layshaft. To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional driven gear for each layshaft, but the mechanism is otherwise very similar. The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the multiple clutch gearbox, used for some buses, where each ratio has its own layshaft and separate plate or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutches,</b> rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, {{two-speed}} drives {{were developed}} for superchargers for aero engines providing more flexibility aircraft operation. The arrangement also entailed more complexity of manufacturing and maintenance. The gears connected the supercharger {{to the engine}} using a system of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutches,</b> which were initially manually engaged or disengaged by the pilot with a control in the cockpit. At low altitudes, the low-speed gear would be used {{in order to keep}} the manifold temperatures low. At around 12000 ft, when the throttle was full forward and the manifold pressure started to drop off, the pilot would retard the throttle and switch to the higher gear, then readjust the throttle to the desired manifold pressure. Later installations automated the gear change according to atmospheric pressure.|$|R

5000|$|Lambrettas have {{attracted}} an eclectic following of [...] "revival" [...] Mods, collectors, scooterists, cutdown enthusiasts, and even racers. Vespa and Lambrettas both {{can be converted}} to fun and relatively fast machines with little (but relatively expensive) modification. Many owners customize these scooters with elaborate customizations and paintwork and attend well-organised scooter rallies. The Lambretta has benefitted from advances in technology in the motorcycle world. To boost performance some owners have fitted aftermarket cylinders and crankshafts that increase the swept volume to as much as 250 cc. Common modifications include a Nikasil plated aluminium barrel with radical porting, large Dell'Orto or Mikuni carburettors and bespoke expansion chambers. Hydraulic disc brakes in the front are becoming common on the more highly tuned machines, as are <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutches</b> and rear brakes. Modern low-profile tyres greatly improve handling, as do uprated front and rear suspension units.|$|R

50|$|Cutdowns {{are often}} tuned - {{much like a}} four-wheeled hot rod - by overboring the {{cylinders}} to increase engine power or adding performance exhausts, modified carburettors, or aftermarket shock absorbers. Some enthusiasts replace the standard drum front brakes with hydraulic disc brakes or add water cooling radiators. Lambretta owners may replace existing parts with a Nikasil plated aluminium barrel with radical porting, large Dell'Orto or Mikuni carburettors and bespoke (custom-made) expansion chambers, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>clutches,</b> and modern low-profile tyres. Some scooterists use aluminum Fabrizi racing barrels, because they use a rotary induction mechanism. Stock gas tanks may be replaced with increased capacity tanks, which put {{the weight of the}} fuel further forward.Some riders install a small fairing to reduce wind resistance and enable higher speeds and stability. To reduce weight, some scooterists use lighter-weight aftermarket parts, such as carbon fibre sports seats and other parts made from carbon fibre, carbon kevlar and fiberglass.|$|R
2500|$|In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed {{longitudinal}} S tronic {{version of}} the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates — the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system [...] — Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits.
