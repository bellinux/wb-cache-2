25|$|In 1998, the Seattle Times {{reported}} that pistachio makers in California were unhappy {{about the fact}} that Israel imported most of its pistachio from Iran.

Based on the article Israel imports only a quarter of pistachios <b>from</b> <b>US</b> <b>and</b> about half of its pistachios from Britain and Germany, whereas these two countries are not producers of pistachio at all and the source is very likely to be from Iran. Furthermore, in 1998 Israeli government punished the Hamama Brothers Co. for illegally importing 105 tonnes of pistachio from Iran. Israeli newspaper Ynet reported in 2007 that US government once again asked Israeli government to stop importing pistachios from Iran. In 2008 US ambassador to Israel, Richard H. Jones wrote a letter to Israel's finance minister Ronnie Bar-on demanding Israel to stop importing Iranian pistachios from Turkey. Similar reports have been published by Haaretz.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s RNC {{underwent}} significant restructuring as it responded {{to changes in}} the world of employment and therefore the courses that it offered its students. However, some of the college's changes provoked criticism from staff and students who argued these were not in RNC's best interest. There was some controversy over the college's decision to reduce the availability of courses in piano tuning, traditionally regarded as a secure profession for visually impaired people, while fears were expressed that the decrease in A Level subjects would lead to RNC becoming a sport rather than an academic orientated college. Responding to these concerns in July 2008, the then principal Christine Steadman told In Touch, the BBC Radio 4 news programme for visually impaired listeners; [...] "It's about what the local authorities, what the learning and skills council, what the Welsh Assembly for government will purchase <b>from</b> <b>us.</b> <b>And</b> at the moment we are reducing a small number of A Level courses {{but at the same time}} we're extending other courses, for example we've got level 3 Braille being taught for the first time at the college, we're not cutting A Levels, we're just responding to the needs of the learners that are coming through our doors." [...] In an interview in January 2010, the then principal Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be taught at the college if there was a demand for it, and suggested RNC could look to bringing in international students to fill places.|$|E
