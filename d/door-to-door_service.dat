5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a <b>door-to-door</b> <b>service,</b> (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E

The decision {{was meant to be}} a cost-cutting measure in the face of financial losses, due primarily to the decreased use of traditional mail in favour of electronic alternatives.|$|E

The main contributions of Sustainable Development projects in both FPs were identified as developing, integrating and managing a more efficient, safer, more secure and environmentally friendly transport system to provide user-friendly <b>door-to-door</b> <b>services.</b> Contribution to the development of decision-making tools was the main achievement of Community and Public Policies related projects in both FPs.|$|R
30|$|The {{panel was}} less {{sure about the}} {{projections}} concerning transport intermodality in urban areas, expressed through low probability assessments and involving more corrections. Greatest uncertainty was registered on sub-themes concerning provision of <b>door-to-door</b> <b>services</b> from public transport companies, and a more dynamic public transport service outside city centres. It is interesting that panel members generally believe it “likely” that city-bikes will handle most passenger transport in the inner parts of the city, and that car-sharing arrangements will replace the private car in most families. Low standard deviation scores indicate an overall high degree of consensus in this case as well.|$|R
