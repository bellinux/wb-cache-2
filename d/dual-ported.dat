40|$|In {{intrusion}} detection among different hardware approaches, memory-based architecture {{has attracted a}} lot of attention be-cause of its easy re-configurability and scalability. In order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful network {{intrusion detection}} system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. In an efficient pattern-matching algorithm for memory architecture, state traversal algorithm was used to significantly reduce the memory requirement. In this paper, an adaptively dividable <b>dual-port</b> TCAM is proposed to further reduction of the memory requirement by which we can achieve a high-throughput, low-power, and low-cost pattern detection processor for mobile devices. The proposed <b>dual-port</b> TCAM is realized with the <b>dual-port</b> AND-type match-line scheme which is composed of <b>dual-port</b> dynamic AND gates. The <b>dual-port</b> designs reduce power consumption and increase storage efficiency due to shared storage spaces. The method readily generalizes to higher-dimensional pattern matching problems. 1...|$|R

The primary designed passive antenna is capable of supporting two different WLAN bands at 2. 4 – 2. 84 GHz and 5. 15 – 5. 35 GHz due to its <b>dual-port</b> structure. In {{order to reduce the}} transmission coefficient between the two ports of antenna a coupling sleeve-arm and an inverted T-shaped slot are utilized on the ground plane of antenna each beneath one of the corresponding feed-lines which act as filtering structures at desirable frequencies. The proposed passive <b>dual-port</b> antenna is integrated with a power amplifier (PA) and a low noise amplifier forming a <b>dual-port</b> microstrip AIA which {{can be used as a}} full-duplex transceiver at its operating WLAN frequency bands.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the design and}} analysis of Data Cen-ter Network (DCN) architectures for interconnecting <b>dual-port</b> servers. Unlike existing works, we propose the concept of Normal-ized Switch Delay (NSD) to distinguish a server-to-server-direct hop and a server-to-server-via-switch hop, to unify the design of DCN architectures. We then consider a fundamental problem: maximizing the number of <b>dual-port</b> servers, given network diameter and switch port number; and give an upper bound on this maximum number. Two novel architectures are proposed: SWCube and SWKautz, based on the generalized hypercube and Kautz graph, respectively, which in most cases accommodate more servers than BCN [1], which was {{claimed to be the}} largest known architecture. Compared with three existing architectures, SWCube and SWKautz demonstrate various advantages. Analysis and simulations also show that SWCube and SWKautz have nice properties for DCNs, such as low diameter, good fault-tolerance, and capability of efficiently handling network congestion.
