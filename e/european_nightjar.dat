5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar.</b> Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as heaths, forest clearings or newly planted woodland. The male <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> occupies a territory {{in spring and}} advertises his presence with a distinctive sustained churring trill from a perch. He patrols his territory with wings held in a V and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Wing clapping also occurs when the male chases the female in a spiralling display flight. The <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> does not build a nest, and its two grey and brown blotched eggs are laid directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17–21 days and the downy chicks fledge in another 16–17 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> comprises Europe north to around latitude 64°N and Asia north to about 60°N and east to Lake Baikal and eastern Mongolia. The southern limits are northwestern Africa, Iraq, Iran and the northwestern Himalayas. This nightjar formerly bred in Syria and Lebanon.|$|E
5000|$|The Caprimulgiformes is {{an order}} of birds that {{includes}} a number of birds with global distribution (except Antarctica). They are generally insectivorous and nocturnal. The order gets {{its name from the}} Latin for [...] "goat-milker", an old name based on an erroneous view of the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar's</b> feeding habits.|$|R
5|$|Broods {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} so during incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. <b>European</b> <b>nightjars</b> breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|R
5|$|<b>European</b> <b>nightjars</b> hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|R
5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total global {{population of}} 2–6million individuals. Although {{there appears to be}} a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, {{including}} moths, beetles, mantises, dragonflies, cockroaches and flies. It will pick glowworms off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey, but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own faeces.|$|E
500|$|Birds hunt over open {{habitats}} and woodland clearings and edges, {{and may be}} attracted to insects concentrating around artificial lights, near farm animals or over stagnant ponds. They usually feed at night, but occasionally venture out on overcast days. Nightjars pursue insects with a light twisting flight, or flycatch from a perch; they may rarely take prey off the ground. They drink by dipping to the water surface as they fly. Breeding <b>European</b> <b>nightjars</b> travel on average [...] from their nests to feed. Migrating birds live off their fat reserves.|$|R
5|$|Like other nightjars, it {{will sit}} on roads or paths {{during the night}} and hover to {{investigate}} large intruders such as deer or humans. It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light, and by bats, other nightjar species or Eurasian woodcocks during the night. Owls and other predators such as red foxes will be mobbed by {{both male and female}} <b>European</b> <b>nightjars.</b> Like other aerial birds, such as swifts and swallows, nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash. They have a unique serrated comb-like structure on the middle claw that is used to preen and perhaps remove parasites.|$|R
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, <b>European</b> <b>nightjars</b> appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|R
5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E
5|$|The nightjars, Caprimulgidae, are a {{large family}} of mostly nocturnal insect-eating birds. The largest and most {{widespread}} genus is Caprimulgus, characterised by stiff bristles around the mouth, long pointed wings, a comb-like middle claw and patterned plumage. The males, and sometimes females, often have white markings in the wing or tail. Within the genus, the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> forms a superspecies with the rufous-cheeked nightjar and the sombre nightjar, African species with similar songs. It is replaced further east in Asia by the jungle nightjar which occupies similar habitat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are {{relatively}} large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
500|$|The male <b>European</b> <b>nightjar's</b> song is a {{sustained}} churring trill, given continuously {{for up to}} 10minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch. It is delivered from a perch, and the male may move around its territory using different song posts. Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night, and is reduced in poor weather. The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing-clapping, perhaps indicating the approach of a female. Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing. Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs. Even a singing male {{may be hard to}} locate; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions, and the song has a ventriloquial quality as the singer turns his head. The song is easily audible at , and can be heard at [...] in good conditions; it can be confused with the very similar sound of the European mole cricket.|$|R

5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that <b>European</b> <b>nightjars</b> have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|R
5|$|The <b>European</b> <b>{{nightjar}},</b> Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and {{nocturnal bird}} in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Deciduous {{trees are}} dominant, with the beech, linden, European ash, and {{sycamore}} maple being most widespread. The Little Carpathians PLA {{is the only}} place in Slovakia where some plants grow, for example, Ruscus hypoglossum and Rhamnus saxatilis.

40|$|Capsule Nightjars prefer open {{places in}} younger forest areas, and open stands with wide forest tracks in older forest areas. Aims <b>European</b> <b>Nightjars</b> are a Species of European Conservation Concern (historical declines in both {{population}} and range). The reduction of heathland habitats means that forested areas are {{an increasingly important}} habitat for Nightjars. However, the ecology of Nightjars in forested areas is poorly understood. We set out to investigate Nightjar habitat preferences in a 5000 -ha forest landscape in northern Belgium. Methods Calling ‘churring’ males were counted in each year over ten years. Habitat descriptors were derived from detailed habitat mapping based on aerial photographs and extensive field surveys. The different habitat descriptors were compared between patches occupied by Nightjars and control patches (patches selected at random in the study area). Results As expected, Nightjars showed a preference for open places in younger forest areas (clearfelled areas, young stands, windfall and permanent open places). They also showed a preference for old and open stands that had wide forest tracks. Forest type appeared not to be significant. Heath, bare sand and, to a lesser extent, leaf litter have an increased presence in patches used by Nightjars. Conclusion For the conservation of Nightjars, we suggest that open places within larger forests should be created. Also a network of wide forest tracks can make smaller patches suitable for Nightjars. Patches of bare sand should be created or maintained...|$|R

500|$|The <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> is a bird of dry, {{open country}} with some trees and small bushes, such as heaths, commons, moorland, forest clearings or felled or newly planted woodland. When breeding, it avoids {{treeless}} or heavily wooded areas, cities, mountains, and farmland, but it often feeds over wetlands, cultivation or gardens. In winter {{it uses a}} wider range of open habitats including acacia steppe, sandy country and highlands. It has been recorded at altitudes of [...] on the breeding grounds and [...] in the wintering areas.|$|E
500|$|The <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> was {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name. Caprimulgus {{is derived from the}} Latin capra, [...] "nanny goat", and mulgere, [...] "to milk", referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats, and the species name, europaeus is Latin for [...] "European". The common name [...] "nightjar", first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, {{the second part of the}} name deriving from the distinctive churring song. Old or local names refer to the song, [...] "churn owl", habitat, [...] "fern owl", diet, [...] "dor hawk" [...] and [...] "moth hawk".|$|E
500|$|Other {{nightjar}} species {{occur in}} parts of the breeding and wintering ranges. The red-necked nightjar breeds in Iberia and northwest Africa; it is larger, greyer and longer winged than the <b>European</b> <b>nightjar,</b> and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail. Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous-cheeked and sombre nightjars. Both have a more prominent buff hind-neck collar and more spotting on the wing coverts. The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin. Given their nocturnal habits, cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation, nightjar observation [...] "is as much a matter of fortune as effort or knowledge".|$|E
500|$|The <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> is crepuscular and nocturnal. During the day {{it rests}} on the ground, often in a partly shaded location, or perches {{motionless}} lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch. The cryptic plumage {{makes it difficult to}} see in the daytime, and birds on the ground, if they are not already in shade, will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow. If it feels threatened, the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed, flying only when the intruder is [...] away. It may call or wing clap as it goes, and land as far as [...] from where it was flushed. In the wintering area it often roosts on the ground but also uses tree branches up to [...] high. Roost sites at both the breeding and wintering grounds are used regularly if they are undisturbed, sometimes for weeks at a time.|$|E
2500|$|Coppice {{management}} favours a {{range of}} wildlife, often of species adapted to open woodland. After cutting, the increased light allows existing woodland-floor vegetation such as bluebell, anemone and primrose to grow vigorously. Often brambles grow around the stools, encouraging insects, or various small mammals that can use the brambles as protection from larger predators. Woodpiles (if left in the coppice) encourage insects such as beetles to come into an area. The open area is then colonised by many animals such as nightingale, <b>European</b> <b>nightjar</b> and fritillary butterflies. [...] As the coup grows, the canopy closes and it becomes unsuitable for these animals again—but in an actively managed coppice there is always another recently cut coup nearby, and the populations therefore move around, following the coppice management.|$|E
