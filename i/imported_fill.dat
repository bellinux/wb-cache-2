This is a simplification, but the ease of calculation encourages the comparison of solutions; it makes the output of assessments accessible, transparent and repeatable; and CO 2 savings can readily be counted towards industry and national and international targets. This chapter describes a framework for calculating embodied carbon of construction solutions that incorporate geotextiles. It outlines techniques for determining the carbon footprint and common definitions, presents examples of embodied carbon for geotextile materials, defines life cycle boundaries and presents sample calculations for common construction case studies: protection, a working platform and landfill capping. All three examples demonstrate significant CO 2 savings that can result from employing geotextiles. These savings are realised by {{reducing the amount of}} <b>imported</b> <b>fill</b> material used, which minimises transport-related carbon emissions. The approach that is introduced can be used to undertake site-specific calculations to inform decisions regarding the selection of approaches to construction that contribute to sustainable practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The scheme involves extensive demolition of 900 m of masonry viaduct followed by the construction of 900 m of new structures, 200 m of reinforced earth structures, and 200 m of embankment widening and raising. This paper describes a study undertaken in 2012 that examined the viability of recycling the demolished brickwork material into a crushed engineered fill material for use in the permanent works. The overarching objective of the study was to seek to reduce the significant volumes of both <b>imported</b> <b>fill</b> and exported demolition material that would be required for the BDU scheme. In addition to the associated sustainability benefits, the significant reduction in lorry movements from London’s congested streets would result in significant environmental and safety benefits. The paper details the sampling and testing of brickwork that was undertaken as part of the study and presents the findings from the study. A synopsis of the properties of the crushed brick and the material requirements for engineered fill is included.

Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.Stiff polymer geogrids, with very open apertures, in addition to three-dimensional geocells made from various polymers are also increasingly specified in unpaved and paved roadways, load platforms and railway ballast, where the improved loadbearing characteristics significantly reduce the requirements for high quality, <b>imported</b> aggregate <b>fills,</b> thus reducing the carbon footprint of the construction.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the study of soil {{composites}} that are constructed by combining regions of soft clay and granular materials in various spatial configurations. The underlying basis for the work stems from the practical application {{of the results of}} the research to offshore land reclamation practices. Due to depletion of local coarse-grained soil sources and the high cost of <b>imported</b> granular <b>fill,</b> the use of dredged and excavated marine clay has become the preferred source of materials in reclamation activities. A common reclamation technique involves placing dredged clay lumps directly on top of other layers; these lumpy fills contain large initial inter-lump voids with the result that the fills experience substantial compression purely due to the closure of the void space. A practical solution therefore is to fill the void space with a granular soil to enhance the load-carrying capacity and to minimize the settlements of the reclaimed fills. In this research a coordinated experimental investigation was undertaken to examine the consolidation behavior of composites fabricated using a number of spherical and disk-shaped clay inclusions placed within an artificial granular medium (ballotini). The results of this experimental research program indicated that the volume fraction, shape, configuration and the constitutive properties of both the clay inclusions and the granular component are all important factors that could affect the mechanical response of the soil composites. A computational scheme, validated using the results of the bench-scale experiments, was used to analyze the response of an idealized composite lumpy fill subjected to self-weight stresses, surcharge and a load applied through a rigid footing. The computational results indicated that the consolidation behavior of the composite lumpy layers can be significantly influenced by the volume proportion, location and configuration of the clay inclusions interspersed within the granular fill. The incorporation of the constitutive behaviors of the soil components, used in reclamation activities, into such a computational analysis could assist engineers in designing reclaimed fills where the least ultimate settlement occurs within the shortest time...|$|R

In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production.

6000|$|... (1) While Rousseau was in Paris, there {{appeared}} a letter nominally addressed {{to him by}} the King of Prussia, and written in an ironical strain, which persuaded Jean Jacques himself that it was the work of Voltaire.[360] Then he suspected D'Alembert. It was really the composition of Horace Walpole, who was then in Paris. Now Hume was the friend of Walpole, and had given Rousseau a card of introduction to him for the purpose of entrusting Walpole with the carriage of some papers. Although the false letter produced the liveliest amusement at Rousseau's cost, first in Paris and then in London, Hume, while feigning to be his warm friend and presenting him to the English public, never took any pains to tell the world that the piece was a forgery, nor did he break with its wicked author.[361] (2) When Rousseau assured Hume that D'Alembert was a cunning and dishonourable man, Hume denied it with an amazing heat, although he well knew the latter to be Rousseau's enemy.[362] (3) Hume lived in London with the son of Tronchin, the Genevese surgeon, and the most mortal of all the foes of Jean Jacques.[363] (4) When Rousseau first came to London, his reception was a distinguished triumph for the victim of persecution from so many governments. England was proud of being his place of refuge, and justly vaunted the freedom of her laws and administration. Suddenly and for no assignable cause the public tone changed, the newspapers either fell silent or else spoke unfavourably, and Rousseau was thought of no more. This must have been due to Hume, who had much influence among people of credit, and who went about boasting of the protection which he had procured for Jean Jacques in Paris.[364] (5) Hume resorted to various small artifices for preventing Rousseau from making friends, for procuring opportunities of opening Rousseau's letters, and the like.[365] (6) A violent satirical letter against Rousseau appeared in the English newspapers, with allusions which could only have been supplied by Hume. (7) On the first night after their departure from Paris, Rousseau, who occupied the same room with Hume, heard him call out several times {{in the middle of the}} night in the course of his dreams, Je tiens Jean Jacques Rousseau, with extreme vehemence--which words, in spite of the horribly sardonic tone of the dreamer, he interpreted favourably at the time, but which later event proved to have been full of malign significance.[366] (8) Rousseau constantly found Hume eyeing him with a glance of sinister and diabolic <b>import</b> that <b>filled</b> him with an astonishing disquietude, though he did his best to combat it. On one of these occasions he was seized with remorse, fell upon Hume's neck, embraced him warmly, and, suffocated with sobs and bathed in tears, cried out in broken accents, No, no, David Hume is no traitor, with many protests of affection. The phlegmatic Hume only returned his embrace with politeness, stroked him gently on the back, and repeated several times in a tranquil voice, Quoi, mon cher monsieur! Eh! mon cher monsieur! Quoi donc, mon cher monsieur![367] (9) Although for many weeks Rousseau had kept a firm silence to Hume, neglecting to answer letters that plainly called for answer, and marking his displeasure in other unmistakable ways, yet Hume had never sought any explanation of what must necessarily have struck him as so singular, but continued to write as if nothing had happened. Was not this positive proof of a consciousness of perfidy? ...|$|R
40|$|Perth is {{a rapidly}} growing city {{and the demand for}} urban land has been {{steadily}} increasing over recent years (D. P. I., 2011) and the meeting of environmental legislations for storm-water management and floodplain strategic management is the kernel around which a variety of skills and deep speculation revolves. Technological advancement and multi-variable calculus have made possible the ability to predict how a given artefact will behave according to a defined series of variables in the environment within which the apparatus is expected to perform its duty. This is to introduce the key role that modelling resembles within the design process. In geological terms, it is known with deposition that Perth is accommodated over a rather variegated spectrum of soil types that ranges from sand, silt, clayey sand and clay. Due to this multi-faceted nature there are no standard design guidelines for subsoil drainage systems at date. A calibrated mathematical model can readily facilitate the design process and decision making thanks to its ability to provide groundwater mounding height values for environments with different physical and hydrogeological characteristics. Subsoil drainage is used throughout the world to control shallow groundwater levels to facilitate land use in both agricultural and urban development. The term subsoil implies that a buried pipe is used as opposed to an open drain, usually where land values are high. The primary mechanism by which subsoil drainage functions is the provision of an outlet from a slotted pipe system such that groundwater can flow by gravity, according to Darcy’s law, towards the pipe thus lowering groundwater levels. Subsoil drainage is usually constructed in parallel or sub-parallel lines, so that the water table mounds between the parallel drainage lines. Critical parameters determining whether a subsoil drainage system operates as intended are: the soil permeability, the volume of water to be drained in unit time and drain spacing. On the Swan Coastal Plain subsoil drainage has been used in urban developments where the water table has been shallow for decades, generally with success owing to the characteristically sandy soils and the relatively low rainfall in the South West of Western Australia. This paper describes a subsoil drainage experimental site in the City of Armadale, instrumented to monitor water table mounding between a set of parallel subsoil drains in <b>imported</b> sand <b>fill</b> in 2009 and 2010. The paper describes the data collected together with application of a suitable model to represent the relevant components of water flux, and an application of that model to design the subsoil drainage systems on the Swan Coastal Plain. It is the contention of this paper that a properly designed and calibrated model is to foresee the rise and decline of the perched water table under a given set of environmental conditions. Doing so, {{it will be possible to}} implement the Best Practice Technique (BPT) while addressing the need to avoid the oversizing of sand-fill requirements and consequent levitation of capital budget, maximise the security of assets and obviate the violation of buildings’ structural integrity. In terms of literature review, it has been deliberately decided to report references that are relevant to the Western Australia scenario solely: this is justified by the unique morpho-geological arrangement of the Swan Coastal Plain; in fact, overseas regulators for urban development may enforce building codes, approval schemes and land sub-divisional requirements that are not parallel to the Australian decisional criteria for such practices...|$|R
