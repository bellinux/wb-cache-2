25|$|Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, {{operating}} {{for long}} periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, {{have the potential to}} reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets. Such vehicles probably have the potential to power Solar System exploration with reasonable trip times within the current century. Because of their low-thrust propulsion, they would be limited to off-planet, deep-space operation. Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion powered by a portable power-source, say a nuclear reactor, producing only small accelerations, would take centuries to reach for example 15% of the velocity of light, thus unsuitable for <b>interstellar</b> <b>flight</b> during a single human lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Project Orion {{team member}} Freeman Dyson {{proposed}} in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure deuterium fusion detonations {{with a very}} high fuel-burnup fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000km/s delta-v allowing a flight-time to Alpha Centauri of 130 years. Later studies indicate that the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a Teller-Ulam thermonuclear unit powered Orion starship, assuming no fuel is saved for slowing back down, is about 8% to 10% {{of the speed of}} light (0.08-0.1c). An atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 3%-5% of the speed of light. A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a magnetic sail to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity. Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include Project Longshot, Project Daedalus, and Mini-Mag Orion. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for <b>interstellar</b> <b>flight</b> without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight.|$|E

50|$|Besides <b>interstellar</b> <b>flights</b> (both FTL and sublight), {{another method}} of travel is through hypertunnels. This {{does not require}} the {{traveller}} to know the hyperspace coordinates of the target world (how it works is never fully explained). As such, extraterrestrials can get to Earth (for example, Palian vampires have visited Earth numerous times in the past to feed). However, such method of transportation lacks commercial or military value, as physical laws prohibit any mass greater than 80 metric ton to be moved through a hypertunnel. Also, no weapon capable of destroying a planet can be successfully transported. For example, a quark bomb (description below) becomes inert after rematerialization.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 21st century a group of scientists from MSU invented a jumper, a device allowing FTL travel. But distance of every jump is a constant — about 12.3 light years, so travelling requires high navigation skills and a good dose of luck.

40|$|Exposure to {{the space}} {{environment}} has resulted in numerous alterations to homeostatic mechanisms within the human body. Immune suppression, musculoskeletal degradation, decreased cardiac output and fluid redistribution have all been reported throughout {{short and long term}} space flight. The goal of this review is to discover if long term interstellar travel is biologically possible for humans. The relative influence of cosmic radiation, microgravity, and high velocity travel on homeostasis has not been previously established for interstellar space travel. Real-time space flight data and ground-based studies were compiled from other researchers. This data was analyzed with the goal of establishing the relationship between the aforementioned environmental pressures and the corresponding homeostatic consequences. Meta-analysis revealed that the predicted homeostatic consequences of <b>interstellar</b> space <b>flight</b> do not significantly inhibit the body’s ability to function in the space environment. Although interstellar travel is mechanically restricted, it is biologically plausible provided proper defense mechanisms are applied. Further research must be directed towards eliminating mechanical restrictions including but not limited to propulsion mechanisms, circular sustainment systems, environmental protection and interstellar communication.

40|$|AbstractThe {{navigation}} of X-ray pulsar {{depend on}} the signal of X-ray pulsar radiation as an information input, through the corresponding signal and data processing, provide for navigation information of spacecraft position, velocity and attitude for near-Earth orbit, deep space and <b>interstellar</b> space <b>flight,</b> to achieve high-precision autonomous navigation of spacecraft. This paper introduces the principle of pulse satellite navigation established {{on the basis of}} the X-ray pulsars, autonomous navigation system, the state equation and observation equation. Select the three pulsars, using extended Kalman filter (EKF) and strong tracking extended Kalman filter (STEKF) algorithm, for satellite operation of the position and velocity estimation carried out simulation experiments. Simulation results show STEKF through the introduction of fading to dynamically adjust the gain matrix, to extract the maximum output of the residuals of all the useful information, making adaptive filter to correct the estimated bias and the ability to fast track the state changes, overcome the EKF defects in filtering performance degradation caused by the more complex non-linear navigation model due to uncertainty. Therefore, STEKF has higher valuation accuracy, numerical stability and strong traceability than EKF,and broad applicability in the autonomous celestial navigation...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is clear}} {{on the basis of}} the above {{calculations}} that a relativistic rocket would likely need to be a rocket that is fueled by antimatter. Other antimatter rockets in addition to the photon rocket that can provide a 0.6c specific impulse (studied for basic hydrogen-antihydrogen annihilation, no ionization, no recycling of the radiation) needed for <b>interstellar</b> space <b>flight</b> include the [...] "beam core" [...] pion rocket. In a pion rocket, antimatter is stored inside electromagnetic bottles in the form of frozen antihydrogen. Antihydrogen, like regular hydrogen, is diamagnetic which allows it to be electromagnetically levitated when refrigerated. Temperature control of the storage volume is used to determine the rate of vaporization of the frozen antihydrogen, up to a few grams per second (amounting to several petawatts of power when annihilated with equal amounts of matter). It is then ionized into antiprotons which can be electromagnetically accelerated into the reaction chamber. The positrons are usually discarded since their annihilation only produces harmful gamma rays with negligible effect on thrust. However, non-relativistic rockets may exclusively rely on these gamma rays for propulsion. This process is necessary because un-neutralized antiprotons repel one another, limiting the number that may be stored with current technology to less than a trillion.|$|R
