5000|$|Well, I think that's a very valid {{point and}} I think that it's a {{reflection}} of, not necessarily this programme but of television in general, {{that if you}} die and enough people are watching you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well known. So when you have these things like Columbine, and you have these kids who are angry and they {{have something to say}} and no one's listening, the media sends a message that says <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> loud enough and it gets our attention then you will be famous for it.

[...] —Simon on his work on The Simpsons. Simon co-developed the {{animated}} series The Simpsons, which premiered on the Fox network in 1989 and has remained on air ever since. The show is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest television shows of all time, with Time magazine naming it the 20th century's best series. The premise for the series originated as a series of short cartoons airing in 1987 as part of The Tracey Ullman Show, on which Simon was a writer and executive producer alongside James L. Brooks, with whom Simon had worked on Taxi. The cartoons were developed into a full series two years later. For The Simpsons, Simon served alongside Matt Groening (who conceived the show and the five main characters) and Brooks as executive producer and showrunner for the show's first (1989-1990) and second (1990-1991) seasons, and was creative supervisor for the first four seasons. He assembled and led the initial team of writers, consisting of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. The cartoonist and writer, Mimi Pond, who wrote the first broadcast episode, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] (1989), has asserted that Simon deliberated kept women out of the writing team.|$|E

40|$|You’re {{sitting in}} a bar with eight friends, {{everyone}} staring at one hot guy. The only caveat is that you can’t get his attention, and neither can anyone else. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to get noticed all your friends will regard you as a traitor and, while the guy might be cute, he’s not worth that much. So {{you and your friends}} have two options: 1. Sit around and stare at him, on the odd chance that he might come over on his own. 2. Everyone chips in to buy him a drink from the group; then he will definitely notice your group, and he can decide on his own whom he wants to leave the bar with, if anyone. What the friends would do in such a situation depends not only on each individual girl’s confidence in winning the guy, but also on each girl’s willingness to risk the cost of the drink, knowing that there is a pretty good chance that she herself will not get the guy. When other forms of communities make decisions about the functioning of their systems of government, welfare, wealth-management, and trade, they often follow similar lines of thinking. Many internal communal policies are founded upon the amount of risk that the individuals in the community are willing to take, and the discussion between John Rawls and John C. Harsanyi on a democratic politic’s moral responsibility is based on the moral riskiness which each attributes to society’s members...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} question why some contemporary Protestant ethicists {{differ in their}} critiques of capitalism, and seeks to find the answer in the ethicists 2 ̆ 7 views of theological anthropology and in their economic justice criteria. The selected Protestant ethicists [...] Ronald Nash, J. Philip Wogaman, and Ronald Sider [...] represent various moral assessments of capitalism. Their theological anthropologies, their economic justice criteria, and their critiques of capitalism are systematically analyzed, giving special attention to sin and self-interest as a motivator for economic exchange in capitalism, {{as well as to}} the effects of sin and self-interest on capitalism as a system. Ronald Nash views human persons as inherently evil or sinful and endorses capitalism, believing that sinful self-interest and greed are effectively countered by the market mechanism which says 2 ̆ 2 <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> good for me, I 2 ̆ 7 ll do something good for you. 2 ̆ 2 J. Philip Wogaman views human persons in covenantal relationship with God, grounded in the imago Dei. He rejects capitalism because it forces participants to act greedy and selfishly, and endorses democratic socialism as that form of political economy which recognizes the communitarian values he derives from his anthropology. Ronald Sider believes humankind to be fallen and sinful; yet when redeemed we experience transformed relationships with God and our fellow human beings. For Sider, it is not the system which needs changing, but the human participants. Once transformed, Christians bear witness to sin 2 ̆ 7 s reality in individual and structural economic practices. This dissertation shows that the differences in the capitalistic critiques of Nash, Wogaman, and Sider ought to be formed or influenced by their theological anthropologies and economic justice criteria, but unfortunately they often are not. In order for their moral assessments of capitalism to be adequate, there must be an internal consistency between their theological anthropology, their economic justice criteria, and their critique of capitalism. Sider displays greater internal consistency between these elements than does either Nash or Wogaman. However, the differences regarding their moral assessments of capitalism can be explained as much by the way they apply those anthropologies as by what they are...|$|E
