500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright.

Somerset did not go for the win (which would have meant scoring at well over 7 an over), and made 69 for 3 off 22.3 overs before play ended because of bad light. Lancashire's Mal Loye, who fell just short of his century on 92 in the second innings to go with his 53 in the first said, [...] "To {{get a couple of}} fifties against a pretty good attack <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start.</b> It was a pretty difficult pitch to bat on during the first day but it got easier as the match wore on and I was disappointed to miss out.
