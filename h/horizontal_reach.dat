40|$|Several studies {{conducted}} {{during the past decade}} have suggested that episodic memory is better equipped to handle the future than the past. Here, we consider this premise in the context of motor memory. State-of-the-art computational models for trial-by-trial motor adaptation to constant and stochastic force field perturbations in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaching</b> paradigm have shown that motor memory registers a weighted sum of past experiences to predict force perturbation in a subsequent trial. In the current study, we used the standard <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaching</b> movement paradigm and a novel vertical reaching movement paradigm to test motor memory function during adaptation to force fields increasing in magnitude in a simple predictable linear series. We found that adaptation to constant and sequence force fields are similar in vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaching.</b> For both <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>reaching,</b> we found that the expectation in a particular trial was the average of the previous few trials rather than an expectation of a larger perturbation, as would be expected from a simple extrapolation. These findings are not consistent with those of our previous studies on lifting and grasping tasks, in which we found that the grip force is correctly adjusted to the next weight in a series of tasks with gradually increasing weights, thus predicting the future rather than averaging the past. The results of the current study devoted to reaching movements and of our previous study addressing a lifting task suggest that the brain can generate at least two different types of motor representation, either addressing the past in reaching or predicting the future in lifting. We propose that prior experience and the effect of environment’s variability are the reasons for the observed differences in expectation during lifting and reaching. Finally, we discuss these two types of memory mechanisms with respect to the distinct neural circuits responsible for lifting and reaching...|$|R

40|$|As {{has been}} {{frequently}} observed, single-joint movements {{are characterized by}} single-peaked, bell-shaped speed profiles. This findings and the tendency of natural movements to be characteristically smooth and graceful led to suggest that motor coordination can be mathematically modeled by postulating that voluntary movements are made, {{at least in the}} absence of any other overriding concerns, to be as smooth as possible. Particularly the goal of the central nervous system (CNS) is to maximize smoothness and one measure of this feature is the integrated mean squared magnitude of jerk. Although in the past have been explored kinematic characteristics of reaching movements recorded with actigrafi or goniometric systems and potentiometers, few studies have evaluated the kinematic characteristics of these movements obtained with the new rehabilitative technologies, such as robot mediated therapy.

To this end, simulated trajectories and EMG patterns, generated with hypothetical central commands, were compared to empirical trajectories and EMG patterns. In general, the model was able to predict trajectories but was less successful in predicting EMG patterns. The results indicated that, in general, motions to both single- and double-step targets are generated by shifting the EP of the hand {{in a straight line}} towards the present target. Thus, a common control strategy underlying movements to single-step targets and trajectory modifications to double-step targets is proposed.

This was estimated based on the routine GEONET analysis by differencing the daily coordinates for March 10 through 12.

The vertical deformation was characterized by subsidence as great as 1.2 m along the Pacific coast. However, the coastal area facing the Japan Sea was uplifted by a few centimeters, which is consistent with the predicted deformation by reverse faulting in an elastic half-space (Okada et al., 1985). A postseismic deformation following the mainshock was also observed. The maximum postseismic <b>horizontal</b> displacement <b>reached</b> 41 cm on the 25 th day after the mainshock.

40|$|Effective {{movements}} largely {{depend on}} adaptation, an error-driven process that corrects error from movement to movement. Adaptation is traditionally assumed {{to depend on}} the magnitude of movement error. However, not all movement errors of a given magnitude have the same subjective value. Here we examined whether the subjective value of error influenced how participants adapted their control from movement to movement. Seated human participants grasped the handle of a force-generating robotic arm and made <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaching</b> movements in two novel dynamic environments that penalized errors of the same magnitude differently, changing the subjective value of the errors. We expected that adaptation in response to errors of the same magnitude would differ between these environments. In the first environment, Stable, errors were not penalized. In the second environment, Unstable, rightward errors were penalized with the threat of unstable, cliff-like forces. We found that adaptation indeed differed. Specifically, in the Unstable environment, we observed reduced adaptation to leftward errors, an appropriate strategy that reduced the chance of a penalizing rightward error. These results demonstrate that adaptation is influenced by the subjective value of error, rather than solely the magnitude of error, and therefore is risk-sensitive. In other words, we may not simply learn from our mistakes, we may also learn from the value of our mistakes...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that an effector movement intervening between encoding and reaching to a proprioceptive target determines the underlying reference frame: proprioceptive reach targets {{are represented in}} a gaze-independent reference frame if no movement occurs but are represented with respect to gaze after an effector movement (Mueller and Fiehler, 2014 a). The present experiment explores whether an effector movement leads to a switch from a gaze-independent, body-centered reference frame to a gaze-dependent reference frame or whether a gaze-dependent reference frame is employed {{in addition to a}} gaze-independent, body-centered reference frame. Human participants were asked to reach in complete darkness to an unseen finger (proprioceptive target) of their left target hand indicated by a touch. They completed 2 conditions in which the target hand remained either stationary at the target location (stationary condition) or was actively moved to the target location, received a touch and was moved back before reaching to the target (moved condition). We dissociated the location of the movement vector relative to the body midline and to the gaze direction. Using correlation and regression analyses, we estimated the contribution of each reference frame based on <b>horizontal</b> <b>reach</b> errors in the stationary and moved conditions. Gaze-centered coding was only found in the moved condition, replicating our previous results. Body-centered coding dominated in the stationary condition while body- and gaze-centered coding contributed equally strong in the moved condition.

40|$|Introduction: Participatory {{ergonomic}} {{approaches have}} been shown to be an effective method for identifying work place hazards. Since in many workplaces, expertise in ergonomics is not available, simple educational messages to identify low back injury (LBI) hazards were developed. This thesis examined lifting risk perceptions of workers and the efficacy of a simple educational message on improving their ability to recognize key LBI hazards, in particular, lifting objects on or close to the ground. Methods: 178 participants from differing sectors were shown 44 different lifting videos (representing 36 lifting scenarios). These scenarios differed in terms of factors such as lifting height origin/destination, weight, and the amount of <b>horizontal</b> <b>reach.</b> Participants were asked to rate each video, from 0 - 10, on how likely they believed the lifting task they just saw could eventually lead to a low back injury. One of two educational messages was then shown to the participants. These messages were crafted with the help of academic experts and knowledge translation professionals in health and safety associations. One message was used as the intervention and spoke of the risk of lifting objects from close to the floor and the other as the control and spoke of the use of back belts in industry. After reading the message, participants were shown and asked to rate the same 44 lifting videos again, but in a different order. Participant’s ratings of risk were correlated to a biomechanically-based tool (3 DMatch) that estimates low back loading. Results: As lifts deviated from a waist-to-waist height, light object lift (mean Likert score = 0. 421 units), ratings of risk perception increased. The highest rated tasks were the floor-to-waist stoop lift, heavy floor-to-floor lift, and the heavy floor-to-waist lift (mean Likert scores = 7. 73, 7. 382, and 7. 107 respectively). Pre-post score differences were used to assess message efficacy. Of the 36 types of tasks, 19 significantly changed in the Lifting Height Message receiving group compared to 3 in the Back Belt Message group. The 19 changes were mainly seen in the videos that had lift origins at floor height. Participant’ risk ratings correlated positively, albeit only moderately with 3 DMatch (R-value = 0. 495, p< 0. 05). Demographically stratified correlations were also positive but were weak to moderate in strength (R-value range = 0. 357 to 0. 674, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results support the use of a simple message to increase conceptual awareness of the important lifting hazard of lifting objects from near the ground. This increase in recognition is the first step in the injury prevention cycle of identifying hazards, assessing risks, and controlling hazards...|$|E
40|$|Limited {{time frames}} caused by {{infection}} threat and weather demand for efficient pesticide application techniques in modern integrated and organic fruit farming. This demand is best complied by low volume spraying, since it minimizes traveling time {{and number of}} fillings per spray treatment, but also minimizes {{the probability of a}} contamination of the operator with concentrated pesticides. To obtain good spray deposition, low volume spray application demands small droplets which offer numerous benefits, but also carry a high drift potential. This feature threatened the technique, because no method for spray drift reduction has been available in order to make use of reduced buffer zones to water courses and non-target areas. A new method based on cross flow characteristics of the sprayer fan, canopy adapted forward speed and fan speed and a mixed set of hollow cone nozzles and air induction nozzles resulted in an approx. 85 % reduction of particle drift deposits, so that the method has been registered in the official German list of drift reducing devices in the 75 % drift reduction class. Besides drift reduction a canopy adapted fan speed also results in an enormous reduction of fuel consumption and noise emission as further environmental benefits of small droplets. An assessment of the influence of a canopy adapted forward speed and fan speed on spray deposit, relative spray coverage and droplet deposit density revealed a significant increase of the application efficiency, rising with decreasing canopy width and compensating a reduction of water volume and dose rate from canopy related dosing models. Testing a tower sprayer in orchards for use with reduced fan speed unexpectedly showed an unusable vertical air distribution. Alarmed by this finding, a subsequent testing of various fan types on a test bench disclosed a very unsatisfying vertical air distribution of many fan types and even within a production series the air distribution differed enormously. Especially an uneven <b>horizontal</b> <b>reach</b> of the air stream over working height is a major obstacle for a successful use of canopy adapted fan speed with all its benefits. Since a uniform vertical air distribution is the basic requirement for a highly efficient and environmentally safer spray application {{not only in terms of}} the potential to reduce pesticide consumption, but also for reducing fuel consumption and noise emissions, testing and adjusting fans of orchard sprayers on a test bench is urgently needed. Because of the importance of the topic, three fruit growers associations in Austria, Italy and Germany together initiated the development of a new test bench to measure vertical air distribution of orchard sprayers...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several psychophysical {{experiments}} {{found evidence}} for the involvement of gaze-centered and/or body-centered coordinates in arm-movement planning and execution. Here we aimed at investigating the frames of reference involved in the visuomotor transformations for reaching towards visual targets in space by taking target eccentricity and performing hand into account. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined several performance measures while subjects reached, in complete darkness, memorized targets situated at different locations relative to the gaze and/or to the body, thus distinguishing between an eye-centered and a body-centered frame of reference involved in the computation of the movement vector. The errors seem to be mainly affected by the visual hemifield of the target, independently from its location relative to the body, with an overestimation error in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>reaching</b> dimension (retinal exaggeration effect). The use of several target locations within the perifoveal visual field allowed us to reveal a novel finding, that is, a positive linear correlation between horizontal overestimation errors and target retinal eccentricity. In addition, we found an independent influence of the performing hand on the visuomotor transformation process, with each hand misreaching towards the ipsilateral side. Conclusions: While supporting {{the existence of an}} internal mechanism of target-effector integration in multiple frames of reference, the present data, especially the linear overshoot at small target eccentricities, clearly indicate the primary role of gaze-centered coding of target location in the visuomotor transformation for reaching...|$|R

40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. The bell-and-spigot joints tend to leak {{as these}} pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron bell and spigot joints from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and attaching a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service (which results in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains. The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 [...] Program Management was previously completed. Two reports, one describing the program management plan and the other consisting of the technology assessment, were submitted to the DOE COR in the first quarter.

A significant knock-on effect {{is an extension of}} Community regulatory competence to cover this same subject matter, despite the contrary indications in Article 137 (5) EC. The judgment in Viking implies that Article 28 EC is also capable of horizontal effect, at least in cases where collective action of individuals produces regulatory effects similar to those resulting from State action. The Court’s reasoning leaves room for future incremental increases in the horizontal effect of fundamental freedoms in cases which involve contractual rules, in particular rules regulating employed or self employed activities. The approach to horizontal effect in Viking supports, for example, the argument that provisions of a corporate constitution could amount to a restriction on freedom of establishment, as could action taken by the board of a company to frustrate a takeover bid. Advocate General Maduro in Viking argues that the Treaty rules on freedom of movement apply directly to any private action that is capable of effectively restricting others from exercising their right of freedom of movement. The present writer suggests further considerations as being relevant to determining the extent of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>reach</b> of fundamental freedoms. Normal market behaviour on the part of one market operator should not in principle be held to amount to a restriction on the fundamental freedom of another. But discriminatory conduct by market operators, or other conduct which falls outside the range of normal market behaviour, would seem capable of falling within the horizontal effect of a fundamental freedom, at any rate where it restricts access of other market operators, or consumers, to the market, or places market operators or consumers at a disadvantage because they have exercised a fundamental freedom. Account must be taken of the aims and wording of the freedom in question, along with the policy questions of whether it would be excessively burdensome to make private operators subject to the obligation to comply with the fundamental freedom in question, and whether any consequential extension of Community regulatory competence would unreasonably limit that of the Member States. A related issue {{to be taken into account}} is the possible horizontal effect of the fundamental principle of equality, as articulated in the Mangold case. Even a restrained reading of this much criticised case would suggest that the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality in Article 12 EC might have horizontal effect in circumstances falling within the scope of Community law, such as the supply of goods, services, business accommodation and housing. A similar conclusion could be reached as regards discrimination in the sale of goods, services and real property to non residents. It would not be excessively burdensome to impose on private market operators the obligation not to depart from their normal terms and conditions of sale in the case of non-nationals or non-residents, unless such departure represented normal market behaviour. A possible example of discriminatory service provision contrary to the general principle of equality is that of excessive ‘roaming’ charges, which have been recently regulated by Regulation (EC) No 717 / 2007. A key question which arises in this context is the extent to which a market operator can, or should be able to be, justify discrimination against out of state operators, or discrimination against customers solely because they have crossed a national frontier, on grounds of normal market behaviour, when market conditions are not normal, and the market is not fully competitive...|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 {{shows the}} {{horizontal}} stresses (x-direction) in virgin {{ground and the}} induced stresses that could reach 5.86  MPa (850 psi), caused by mining of the coal in the longwall panel. The <b>horizontal</b> stresses <b>reach</b> a maximum value of 12.73  MPa (1, 846 psi) at the coal seam level and decreases {{to a depth of}} 274  m (900 ft). The stresses will then increase with depth as anticipated in virgin ground, since the effect of mining does not extend far below the coal seam. Examination of the estimated stresses and strains along the projected well location allows for quantifying the values needed for casing design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study many-to-one {{boundary}} labeling with backbone leaders. In this new many-to-one model, a <b>horizontal</b> backbone <b>reaches</b> {{out of each}} label into the feature-enclosing rectangle. Feature points {{that need to be}} connected to this label are linked via vertical line segments to the backbone. We present dynamic programming algorithms for label number and total leader length minimization of crossing-free backbone labelings. When crossings are al-lowed, we aim to obtain solutions with the minimum number of crossings. This can be achieved efficiently in the case of fixed label order, however, in the case of flexible label order we show that minimizing the number of leader crossings is NP-hard. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{brown meagre}} is between 30 to 40 cm in length but can grow to 60 cm. It has a flat belly and its {{strongly}} arched back which {{give it an}} easily recognisable shape, the body is laterally compressed and the large, <b>horizontal</b> mouth <b>reaches</b> {{the level of the}} eye and contains villiform teeth. The anal and pelvic fins are black with an anterior white border. Both dorsal fins and the truncate caudal fin, are yellow with a black border. The body is grey with flashes of gold and silver. The scales are cteniod on the nape and the body while the head scales are cycloid.|$|R
