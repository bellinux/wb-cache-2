5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One Meridian Plaza's owners E/R Partners {{to pay more}} than US$13 million for the site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon Plaza in 1993. Damaged and vacant since the One Meridian Plaza fire, Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to {{the south side of the}} One Meridian Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to the One Meridian Plaza fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of the One Meridian plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While the One Meridian Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E

3000|$|The {{compensation}} scheme for agent i ([...] w_i^H,PB(r_i), w_i^L,PB(r_i)), i= 1, 2, reveals some interesting insights. If {{the importance of}} coordination is high, i.e., β is high, the principal needs to pay less compensation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> report and high earnings. Thus, the rents to agent i <b>for</b> inducing <b>a</b> <b>high</b> effort supply and truthful reporting are diminished. The negative effect of agent i’s misreporting on his expected compensation payment becomes more severe <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> importance of coordination. Thus, it becomes cheaper to induce <b>high</b> effort supply <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> report whenever coordination is very important. In addition, the agents’ compensation payments {{in the case of}} realized high earnings x_H are not affected by the level of x_H. The benefit from their joint production, i.e., the synergy, is arbitrarily split between the two agents. Comparing the {{compensation scheme}} in Proposition 2 with the one of the second benchmarks stated in Observation 1 reveals that only the bonus payment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> report is adapted due to the truth-telling issue. Specifically, w_i^H,PB(η _H)>w_i^H,b 2 (η _H)=c/η _H, i.e., the bonus payment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> report in the participative budgeting process is higher than the corresponding payment in the second benchmark. Thus, the incentive costs with participative budgets comprise two components: one for inducing high productive effort and one for ensuring truth-telling.|$|R
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Schenn was a highly-regarded prospect, ranked fifth among draft-eligible North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau.

McGuire, then-director of the Central Scouting Bureau, compared him {{to former}} first overall selection Ed Jovanovski.

The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> jump. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E
5|$|During the Tauca phase, {{water levels}} in Laguna Miscanti {{were higher than}} today; shorelines formed from an event in Ch'iyar Quta lake; saline lakes formed in the Lipez area, and water levels rose in the Guayatayoc-Salinas Grandes basin and lakes at Uturuncu and Lazufre. Some Atacama Altiplano lake levels {{increased}} by , and evidence exists at the Quebrada Mani archeological site <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> water supply 16,400–13,700 years ago. During the Tauca, greater flow occurred in rivers in the Atacama region; more precipitation fell in the Rio Salado valley; the excavation of the Colca Canyon may have been aided by an increased water supply, and glaciers advanced in the Cordillera de Cochabamba. A moraine formed at Hualca Hualca; the Choqueyapu II glacier in the Eastern Cordillera advanced; moraines formed from glacial advances in Argentina (including the Sierra de Santa Victoria); basal sliding glaciers formed at Sajama; landslide activity in northwestern Argentina decreased; the climate grew wetter over the southern Amazon; flooding in the Río Paraguay-Parana basin and precipitation and forest cover in Pampa del Tamarugal increased; erosion occurred along the Pilcomayo, {{and an increase in}} Pacific plankton was probably linked to increased runoff (and an increased nutrient supply) from the Andes. A glacial advance in central Chile around 15,000 years ago, also associated with increased precipitation and the Lake Tauca period, was probably triggered by tropical circulation changes.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius, Lactantius, and Constantine each {{allege that}} Galerius was the prime {{impetus for the}} {{military}} purge, and its prime beneficiary. Diocletian, for all his religious conservatism, still had tendencies towards religious tolerance. Galerius, by contrast, was a devoted and passionate pagan. According to Christian sources, he was consistently the main advocate of such persecution. He was also eager to exploit this position to his own political advantage. As the lowest-ranking emperor, Galerius was always listed last in imperial documents. Until {{the end of the}} Persian war in 299, he had not even had a major palace. Lactantius states that Galerius hungered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> position in the imperial hierarchy. Galerius's mother, Romula, was bitterly anti-Christian, for she had been a pagan priestess in Dacia, and loathed the Christians for avoiding her festivals. Newly prestigious and influential after his victories in the Persian war, Galerius might have wished to compensate for a previous humiliation at Antioch, when Diocletian had forced him to walk {{at the front of the}} imperial caravan, rather than inside it. His resentment fed his discontent with official policies of tolerance; from 302 on, he probably urged Diocletian to enact a general law against the Christians. Since Diocletian was already surrounded by an anti-Christian clique of counsellors, these suggestions must have carried great force.|$|E
