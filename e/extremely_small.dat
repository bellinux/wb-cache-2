Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes 40°S and 60°S.

5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is <b>extremely</b> <b>small</b> (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|Blacktip reef sharks have <b>extremely</b> <b>small</b> home ranges {{and exhibit}} strong site fidelity, {{remaining}} {{within the same}} local area for up to several years at a time. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7–9, through 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.|$|E

It is found that a higher calorific value zone could be obtained using a NaCl concentrations range of 0.76 – 0.80  % and chloroform range of 196 – 198  ml, while a lower calorific value zone resulted from a NaCl concentrations range of 0.78 – 0.80  % and chloroform range of 120 – 130  ml. This curve signifies that high calorific value is more responsive to NaCl concentrations than to chloroform when temperature is kept constant.|$|R

We investigate the possibility that the square Skyrme lattice deforms to a single skyrmion with the same topological charge when the Zeeman energy is <b>extremely</b> <b>smaller</b> than the Coulomb energy. We explicitly show that the energy of a skyrmion with charge two is less than the energy of two skyrmions each with charge one when g ≤ gc.

40|$|High-hardness {{viscoelastic}} rubber dampers {{are used}} to upgrade both the habitability environment and the structural safety in high-rise buildings subjected to wind disturbances. While most of usual viscoelastic dampers have limitation on temperature and frequency dependencies, etc., the proposed high-hardness viscoelastic rubber dampers possess many unprecedented properties. High hardness, large stiffness, small temperature and frequency dependencies are examples of such properties. Mechanical modelling of the proposed high-hardness viscoelastic rubber dampers is introduced first, and the wind-induced response of high-rise buildings with and without the proposed high-hardness viscoelastic rubber dampers is computed under dynamic horizontal loads derived from wind tunnel tests. It is shown that high-rise buildings with the proposed high-hardness viscoelastic rubber dampers exhibit <b>extremely</b> <b>smaller</b> wind-induced responses (both along-wind and cross-wind responses) than those without such dampers. In particular, a remarkable reduction of acceleration has been achieved owing to sufficient hysteresis even in the small strain range.

5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The committed effective dose equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled.

The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a {{median lethal dose}} of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an <b>extremely</b> <b>small</b> amount.

5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and <b>extremely</b> <b>small</b> details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, <b>extremely</b> <b>small</b> errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.|$|E
