5|$|Bradman rested <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next {{match against}} Cambridge University, and Hassett led the {{tourists}} to another innings victory after the hosts won the toss and elected to bat. After Cambridge had made 167, Hassett scored an unbeaten 61 in a partnership of 140 with Bill Brown before declaring at 4/414 when Brown fell for 200.

5|$|The week before, Centre had {{defeated}} Transylvania 98–0 in a {{game where}} Spalding's Football Guide reported that McMillin ran back a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown. The season ended with a 14–22 upset loss to Texas A in the Dixie Classic, when Texas' 12th-man tradition originated. McMillin blamed <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss. The day before the game, McMillin got married.|$|E

5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1998–99 {{campaign}} began, Gascoigne began {{suffering from}} blackouts after blaming <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{death of a}} friend, who died after Gascoigne {{and a group of}} friends went on a night out drinking. Despite his ongoing personal problems and his spell in rehab, Gascoigne started the season in good form and helped Middlesbrough into fourth place by Christmas. They ended the season in ninth place and having scored three goals in 26 top-flight games Gascoigne was linked with a recall to the England squad, who were now managed by former teammate Kevin Keegan and lacking a creative presence in midfield.|$|E
5|$|Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, {{said the}} team {{believed}} Nevin {{was close to}} a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball {{in an effort to}} prepare <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> transition from metal bats. The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rested <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next {{match against}} Cambridge University, leaving Hassett to orchestrate another innings victory. Bradman {{returned}} {{for the following}} match against Essex, and batted first after winnings the toss. Bill Brown opened with Barnes and they put on 145 in 97 minutes before Barnes hit his own wicket and was out. Bradman came in and seized the initiative, reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch, including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore, as Australia passed 200. Bradman and Brown put on a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes before Brown was out for 153 from three hours of batting, with the score at 2/364. After Miller fell without scoring on the next ball, Ron Hamence joined Bradman and they put on another 88 before the Australian skipper was out for 187 at 4/452. Bradman had added his last 87 runs in 48 minutes, hitting a total of 32 fours. Australia was out for 721 at stumps, setting a world record for the most runs in a single day's play in first-class cricket; the record still stands. The tourists completed victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Bradman rested <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next match against Oxford University, which resulted in another innings victory.|$|E

5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs {{had no experience}} as a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming {{into the bottom of}} the ninth inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest player in the league for the year.|$|E
5|$|Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958– June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He {{researched}} Mount St. Helens in the United States {{before and}} after its 1980 eruption, and blamed <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions.|$|E

Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Brigade {{moved up}} to the line to relieve the 2nd and Rifle Brigades and {{remained}} there until the division was withdrawn to a training area in late October, following the relief of II ANZAC Corps by the Canadian Corps. The division suffered heavy losses on 12 October: about 845 men were killed and a further 1,900 wounded in the worst defeat in New Zealand military history. Although Russell blamed <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his private correspondence {{he made it clear}} that planning and preparation by Godley and his staff at II ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did not take into account the poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.|$|E

5|$|The castle formed {{part of a}} {{sequence}} of fortifications protecting the eastern route into Scotland, and in 1461 King Edward IV attempted to break the Lancastrian stranglehold on the region. Sir Ralph Percy, one of the joint constables, defended the castle until September 1461, when he surrendered it to the Yorkists. In 1462, Henry VI's wife, Margaret of Anjou, invaded England with a French army, landing at Bamburgh; Percy then switched sides and declared <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Lancastrians.|$|E
5|$|Then Turner {{entered the}} game and his first run was 35 yards to the 6-yard line, where Wiggs again scored. The next time he ran 60 yards <b>himself</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> touchdown, and the last score came on a 20-yard dash by Cutter Northcutt, Curry's substitute. The victory was overshadowed by a most unfortunate spine injury to Bennett Jared, who died a few months later. The {{starting}} lineup was Adams (left end), Cody (left tackle), Williams (left guard), Reyer (center), Putnam (right guard), Lipscomb (right tackle), Cohen (right end), Curry (quarterback), Floyd (left halfback), Zerfoss (right halfback), and Wiggs (fullback).|$|E
