40|$|Abstract- Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} (VANETs) {{have emerged}} as a prominent technology that facilitates the exciting research and application area for current era of vehicular system. As a sub class of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), VANETs provide communication by forwarding datagram over multi hop wireless links. It facilitates the communication among Vehicle to Vehicle (V 2 V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V 2 I) in wireless environment without any underlying network infrastructure. In current Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) vehicles are being equipped with embedded sensors, processing systems and wireless communication capabilities. These features in smart vehicles have opened an ocean of possibilities for safer, efficient, and comfortable <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Some characteristics of VANETs like rapid changes in network topology and sporadic communication connections make a difficult task to solve the routing deficiencies. This paper investigates the various routing algorithm of VANETs and provides a qualitative comparison of these approaches to open the opportunities for the researchers to develop efficient routing techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{planning}} of semi-autonomous vehicles in traffic scenarios {{is a relatively}} new problem that contributes towards the goal of making road travel by vehicles free of human drivers. An algorithm needs to ensure optimal real time {{planning of}} multiple vehicles (moving in either direction along a road), {{in the presence of a}} complex obstacle network. Unlike other approaches, here we assume that speed lanes are not present and that different lanes do not need to be maintained for inbound and outbound traffic. Our basic hypothesis is to carry forward the planning task to ensure that a sufficient distance is maintained by each vehicle from all other vehicles, obstacles and road boundaries. We present here a 4 -layer planning algorithm that consists of road selection (for selecting the individual roads of traversal to reach the goal), pathway selection (a strategy to avoid and/or overtake obstacles, road diversions and other blockages), pathway distribution (to select the position of a vehicle at every instance of time in a pathway), and trajectory generation (for generating a curve, smooth enough, to allow for the maximum possible speed). Cooperation between vehicles is handled separately at the different levels, the aim being to maximize the separation between vehicles. Simulated results exhibit behaviours of smooth, efficient and safe <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> in multiple scenarios; along with typical vehicle behaviours including following and overtaking...|$|E
40|$|With recent {{economic}} growth in Oman there is increased use of heavy vehicles, presenting an increase in heavy vehicle crashes, associated fatalities and injuries. Vehicle defects cause {{a significant number of}} heavy vehicle crashes in Oman and increase the likelihood of fatalities. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore factors contributing to driving with vehicle defects in the Omani heavy vehicle industry. A series of qualitative participants observations were conducted in Oman with 49 drivers. These observations also involved discussion and interviews with drivers. The observations occurred at two road-side locations where heavy vehicle drivers gather for eating, resting, vehicle check-up, etc. Data collection was conducted over a three week period. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. A broad number of factors were identified as contributing to the <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> with defects. Participants indicated that tyres and vehicle mechanical faults were a common issue in the heavy vehicle industry. Participants regularly reported that their companies use cheap, poor quality standards parts and conducted minimal maintenance. Drivers also indicated that they felt powerless to resist company pressure to drive vehicles with known faults. In addition, drivers reported that traffic police were generally in effective and lacked skill to appropriately conduct roadside inspection on trucks. Further, participants stated that it was possible for companies to avoid being fined during annual or roadside vehicle inspections if members of the company knew the traffic police officer conducting the inspection. Moreover, fines issued by police are generally directed to the individual driver rather than being applied to the company, thus providing no incentive for companies to address vehicle faults. The implications of the findings are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{has been}} {{becoming}} a reality and radar is an indispensable {{feature of this}} transportation method. However, there will be interference issues due to the multiple signals transmitted from the radars on the adjacent driving vehicles operating {{in the same area}} at the same time. Consequently, radar interference mitigation techniques will be essential in such multi-vehicle environment. In order to accurately detect and localize adjacent vehicles, several radars must be carried on each vehicle. A low-cost and highly-integrated CMOS radar sensor could be the best candidate to fulfill this growing industrial need. Linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar with constant envelopewaveform is suitable for low-power/ low-cost CMOS implementation. However, the ghosttargets due to other radars and radio interference generate false alarms and lower the probability of detection. Some interference mitigation techniques allocating frequency sub-bands at different time for different users to avoid concurrent frequency band usage have been proposed in the past. However, the number of users must trade off with the available bandwidth so does the range resolution. This dissertation presents an interference-tolerant radar which can endure multiple signals transmitted from adjacent vehicles for autonomous driving applications. The interference immunity property has been realized by applying a specific code-division multiplexing method, involved with one-coincidence frequency hopping code, to the continuous-wave radar. A radar prototype has been implemented in 65 nm CMOS for operation at 24 GHz with 1 GHz bandwidth (equivalently with 15 cm range resolution). Measurements indicate that the prototype can support up to 22 adjacent vehicles simultaneously by using the optimized Hamming correlation property of the extended hyperbolic congruential code...|$|E
40|$|Demo in Design, Automation and Test in Europe (DATE 2017). 27 to 31, Mar, 2017, 6. 8 HiPEAC: European Network on High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation. Lausanne. Nowadays, the {{prevalence}} of computing systems in our lives is so ubiquitous {{that it would not}} be far-fetched to state that we live in a cyber-physical world dominated by computer systems. These systems demand for more and more computational performance to process large amounts of data from multiple data sources, some of them with guaranteed processing response times. In other words, systems are required to deliver their results within pre-defined (and sometimes extremely short) time bounds. Examples can be found for instance in intelligent transportation systems for fuel consumption reduction in cities or railway, or autonomous <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> To cope with such performance requirements, chip designers produced chips with dozens or hundreds of cores, interconnected with complex networks on chip. Unfortunately, the parallelization of the computing activities brings many challenges, among which how to provide timing guarantees, as the timing behaviour of the system running within a many-core processor depends on interactions on shared resources that are most of the time not know by the system designer. P-SOCRATES (Parallel Software Framework for Time-Critical Many-core Systems) is an FP 7 European project, which developed a novel methodology to facilitate the deployment of standardized parallel architectures for real-time applications. This methodology was implemented (based on existent models and components) to provide an integrated software development kit, the UpScale SDK, to fully exploit the huge performance opportunities brought by the most advanced many-core processors, whilst ensuring a predictable performance and maintaining (or even reducing) development costs of applications. The presentation will provide an overview of the UpScale SDK, its underlying methodology, and the results of its application on relevant industrial use-cases. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The results of the analysis show that the daily <b>driving</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Nordic region can be met by EVs. Most <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> in the Nordic region have a short driving distance per day. The EV availability all day is quite high as most of the daily trips have a short driving distance. The availabilities are about or above 90 % for most of the time in the day.

The <b>driving</b> patterns <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> are different on weekdays and weekends in the Nordic region. The variance <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> patterns <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> under different conditions may have important impacts and need to be considered in the detailed EV integration studies.|$|R
