500|$|Hoffman {{was also}} {{discreet}} about his {{religious and political}} beliefs, but {{it is known that}} he voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: [...] "The less you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> the more interesting it will be to watch me do what I do".|$|E
500|$|Adams finds {{little value}} {{in the concept of}} celebrity, and {{maintains}} that the [...] "more that people <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> the less they'll believe me and my characters". She attracts little gossip or tabloid attention, and strives to keep a healthy work-life balance. Adams makes an effort to remain unaffected by her fame, believing that it would hinder her ability to play roles with honesty. She has spoken about suffering from insecurity and lack of confidence from a young age and about how motherhood had made her calmer. She frequently breaks into song when stressed at work. Unlike some of her female contemporaries, Adams dislikes talking about issues such as the gender pay gap, believing it to be a topic for producers and decision-makers and not actors.|$|E
500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't think all the kids in the Midwest would <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That really {{has a lot to do}} with the success of my album." [...] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed [...] "Everybody" [...] on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails. On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.' Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of [...] "Everybody" [...] to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.|$|E

If I stick where I am, if I don't travel around, {{like anyone else}} I make my inner {{journeys}} that I can only measure by my emotions, and express very obliquely and circuitously in what I write. ...

2500|$|Mark Twain {{composed}} {{the story in}} pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for Sotheby's books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, [...] "What you see is [...] attempt {{to move away from}} pure literary writing to dialect writing". For example, Twain revised the opening line of Huck Finn three times. He initially wrote, [...] "You will not know about me", which he changed to, [...] "You do not know about me", before settling on the final version, [...] "You don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter." [...] The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.|$|E

60|$|More than once, after I {{was very}} tired, I gave up taking her alive, {{and was going}} to shoot her, but I never did it, {{although}} it was my right, for I did not believe I could hit her; and besides, she always stopped and posed, when I raised the gun, and this made me suspicious that she <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and my marksmanship, and so I did not care to expose myself to remarks.|$|R

Towards the end of May (see end), up to which time I seem to see my plans, I might be up to it, or I might not; I think not myself. I have given up all idea of going on to Italy, though it seems a pity when one is so near; and Spain seems {{to me in the}} same category.

50|$|I {{remember}} that the sick had no trust in the beginning because they thought that I {{took part in the}} mass murdering. I must say that in their place, I would have had the same impression. I was locked up without interruption, couldn't go anywhere alone, and all they <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> was that I lived there where they murdered so many people. Additionally, the prisoners saw when I entered the washroom in the case of Schikovsky; they heard the woman scream and therefore assumed that I was part of the murder.|$|R
