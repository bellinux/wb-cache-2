5|$|At Berlin, Franck {{attended}} lectures by Max Planck and Emil Warburg. On 28 July 1904 <b>he</b> <b>saved</b> a pair {{of children}} from drowning in the Spree River.

On June6, <b>he</b> <b>saved</b> his 391st career game, passing Dennis Eckersley for the fourth-most saves {{in major league}} history.

On July16, Rivera achieved another milestone by becoming the fourth MLB pitcher to reach 400saves. Although a throwing elbow strain sidelined Rivera for most of September, he finished the 2006 season with 34saves in 37opportunities and an ERA of 1.80—his fourth consecutive season with a sub-2.00ERA. For a second consecutive year, fans voted him the Delivery Man of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s.

They rented the stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes around the island.|$|E

After the player successfully thwarts the Imperial invasion, Terra approaches the frozen esper, prompting her to transform into an esper-like form herself. She flies away, confused and horrified by her own transformation.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton {{followed}} up with 862 runs at 50.70 in the 1937–38 domestic season, with two centuries and six fifties. This effort placed him third in the run-scoring aggregates for the season. <b>He</b> <b>saved</b> his best for arch-rivals Victoria, scoring 59 and 160 to salvage a draw after New South Wales had conceded a first innings lead of 231.

The record would stand until Bobby Thigpen saved 57 games for the Chicago White Sox in 1990, which would also be Righetti's last season with the Yankees. Righetti retained the single-season record for left-handers until 1993, when Randy Myers saved 53 games for the Chicago Cubs; Righetti still owns the AL record for left-handers.|$|E
5|$|Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic {{historical}} period drama film {{directed and}} co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It {{is based on}} the novel Schindler's Ark by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally.

It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon Göth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Johnston {{played in the}} 1948–49 Australian season, which was purely domestic with no visiting international teams. He took a total of 32 wickets at 31.84 in nine matches. <b>He</b> <b>saved</b> his best performance for New South Wales. He took 3/47 and 5/62 and his wickets included future Test batsmen Jim Burke, Jimmy de Courcy and Jack Moroney, {{but was unable to}} stave off defeat. Apart from a 5/65 against Queensland he never took more than three wickets in an innings for the season. He also managed his highest first-class score, recording 38 against South Australia.|$|E

Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} next is {{not entirely}} clear, but Heraclius certainly won a crushing victory over Shahrbaraz {{in the fall of}} 622. The key factor was Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by feigning retreat during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite Optimatoi assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee. Thus <b>he</b> <b>saved</b> Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius had to return to Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the Avars, so he left his army to winter in Pontus.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, 1st Baronet, GCB (4 June 1746 – 14 November 1816) was {{an officer}} of the British Royal Navy, who saw action in several battles during an {{extensive}} career that was punctuated by a number of highly controversial incidents. Curtis served during the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars and was highly praised in the former conflict for his bravery under fire at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, where <b>he</b> <b>saved</b> several hundred Spanish lives at great risk to his own. His career suffered however {{in the aftermath of the}} Glorious First of June, when he was heavily criticised for his conduct by several influential figures, including Cuthbert Collingwood. His popularity fell further due to his involvement in two highly controversial courts-martial, those of Anthony Molloy in 1795 and James Gambier in 1810.|$|E
