5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User <b>Datagram</b> Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E
5|$|The Heartbeat Extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and <b>Datagram</b> Transport Layer Security (DTLS) {{protocols}} {{was proposed}} {{as a standard}} in February 2012 by RFC 6520. It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule Münster, implemented the Heartbeat Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put {{the result of his}} work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. The defect spread with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Historically, TLS {{has been}} used {{primarily}} with reliable transport protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). However, {{it has also been}} implemented with datagram-oriented transport protocols, such as the User <b>Datagram</b> Protocol (UDP) and the <b>Datagram</b> Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), usage of which has been standardized independently using the term <b>Datagram</b> Transport Layer Security (DTLS).|$|E
50|$|In IPv4, hosts {{must make}} a {{best-effort}} attempt to reassemble fragmented IP <b>datagrams</b> with a total reassembled size of up to 576 bytes. They may also attempt to reassemble fragmented IP <b>datagrams</b> larger than 576 bytes, {{but they are also}} permitted to silently discard such larger <b>datagrams.</b> Applications are recommended to refrain from sending <b>datagrams</b> larger than 576 bytes unless they have prior knowledge that the remote host is capable of accepting or reassembling them.|$|R
50|$|IP <b>datagrams</b> are {{encapsulated}} in datalink frames, and, therefore, {{the link}} MTU affects larger IP <b>datagrams</b> and {{forces them to}} be split into pieces equal to or smaller than the MTU size.|$|R
30|$|The most {{frequently}} used method to carry IP <b>datagrams</b> over MPEG TS is Multiprotocol Encapsulation (MPE);however, MPEG TS is a protocol optimized for broadcasting and not for IP services, so MPE suffers from design constrains as DVB protocol use MPEG TS at the link layer. If we consider the channel bandwidth efficiency, the encapsulation of IP <b>datagrams</b> by the MPEG TS MPE adds additional overheads to the transmitted data, thus reducing efficiency compared to GSE {{that is designed to}} carry general data, mainly over IP protocol. GSE efficiently encapsulates IP <b>datagrams</b> over variable length link layer packets, which are then directly inserted to the physical layer baseband frames. If IP <b>datagrams</b> use GSE, the reduction in overhead is more than two times compared to MPEG-TS transmission.|$|R

25|$|The {{transport}} layer performs host-to-host communications {{on either the}} same or different hosts and on either the local network or remote networks separated by routers. It provides a channel for the communication needs of applications. UDP is the basic {{transport layer}} protocol, providing an unreliable <b>datagram</b> service. The Transmission Control Protocol provides flow-control, connection establishment, and reliable transmission of data.|$|E
25|$|DNS {{primarily}} {{uses the}} User <b>Datagram</b> Protocol (UDP) on port number 53 to serve requests. DNS queries {{consist of a}} single UDP request from the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used when the response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as zone transfers. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.|$|E
50|$|IP {{protocol}} 41 indicates IPv4 packets which encapsulate IPv6 <b>datagrams.</b> Some routers or {{network address}} translation devices may block protocol 41. To pass through these devices, UDP packets {{may be used to}} encapsulate IPv6 <b>datagrams.</b> Other encapsulation schemes, such as AYIYA or Generic Routing Encapsulation, are also popular.|$|R
5000|$|The Internet Protocol is {{responsible}} for addressing hosts, encapsulating data into <b>datagrams</b> (including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing <b>datagrams</b> from a source host to a destination host across one or more IP networks. For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.|$|R
50|$|The Internet Protocol (IP) defines {{standards}} for {{several types of}} <b>datagrams.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{protocol}} {{is usually}} {{described in terms}} of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User <b>Datagram</b> Protocol (UDP) on port number 123. They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of {{a fraction of a}} second of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness. Instead the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the User <b>Datagram</b> Protocol (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they are not in widespread use.|$|E
25|$|The {{internet}} layer {{provides an}} unreliable <b>datagram</b> transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol {{is the principal}} component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.|$|E
