5|$|After the Sierra Leone Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>awareness</b> campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E

Organizations such as the International Animal Rescue (IAR) run sanctuaries that offer lifelong care to slow lorises that have had their teeth removed, while also providing <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>awareness</b> programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow lorises are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow lorises {{as if they were}} from one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in taxonomy and conservation.|$|E

25|$|Business {{marketing}} campaigns, particularly sales promotions {{for products}} that increase pollution {{or have been}} linked to the development of breast cancer, such as alcohol, high-fat foods, some pesticides, or the parabens and phthalates used by most cosmetic companies, have been condemned as pinkwashing (a portmanteau of pink ribbon and whitewash). Such promotions generally result in a token donation to a breast cancer-related charity by taking advantage of the consumers' fear of cancer and grief for people who have died to drive sales. Critics say that these promotions, which net more than US $30 million each year just for fundraising powerhouse Susan G. Komen for the Cure, do little more than support the marketing machines that produce them. Komen says that corporate sponsorships are necessary to pay for the organization's efforts: in the 2010 fiscal year it spent $175 million on public health <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>awareness</b> campaigns, $75 million on medical research and about $67 million on treatment and screenings for patients.|$|E

Topics covered have included stem cell research, cloning, do not resuscitate orders, genetic testing, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and birth control. They also host genetic testing events to help combat the high incidence of various genetic diseases in the Jewish community. The Society hosts events throughout the year, including an annual conference focused on a chosen medical ethics topic. The events are open to all those who have an interest in learning more about Jewish medical ethics.|$|E
