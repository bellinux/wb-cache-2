40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the cross-cultural <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> and highlights the need for theory development. It explores the influence of culture {{and its impact on the}} processes and outcomes of the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> The paper adopts interpretive theory to understand how participants of the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> ie the interviewer and candidate, may develop meaningful cultural experiences. It uses symbolic interactionism to examine how the different cultures of the participants may produce their differing experiences which impact on the processes and outcomes of the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> The paper concludes with a justification for the development of a grounded theory of culture in the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> by examining multiple cases of the cross-cultural <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{establishing}} a guideline for how to teach successful <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communication in a multi-cultural Business as a Lingua Franca (BELF) setting, this thesis examines authentic <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communications in the world maritime industry, compares overall features of successful and unsuccessful communications, and discusses pedagogical implications for ESP language teaching. For this purpose, authentic <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communications conducted in four different countries between non-native speakers of English (both English as a Second Language and English as a Foreign Language speaker) including India, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam were collected. The data from 40 <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> in total was transcribed for corpus analysis, and finally a Corpus of ELF <b>Job</b> <b>Interviews</b> in a Multicultural Business World (hereinafter CELF-JOIN) has been compiled for this research. Based on the analysis, {{a wide range of}} BELF <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> features were investigated in terms of contextual and schematic structures, interactional pragmatic features and lexico-grammatical characteristics. From the findings, pedagogical implications were drawn as ways to enhance learners’ schematic structural awareness, utilise diversified narrative strategies, increase interactional and presentational competency and finally to raise their multi-cultural awareness for successful business communicative outcomes in the future cross-cultural BELF <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communicative setting...|$|R
40|$|When job {{applicants}} lie in <b>job</b> <b>interviews,</b> they can deprive a more honest candidate {{of a job}} and deprive an organisation of the best employees. To better understand <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> faking, the present study examined the effect of general dispositions and domain-specific beliefs on the intention to fake <b>job</b> <b>interviews.</b> A community sample of 313 participants completed measures of personality (i. e., extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness) and self-monitoring, and a domain-specific measure of beliefs about faking <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> based on the theory of planned behaviour, which measured attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Results indicated that the measure of attitudes was the strongest predictor of intention to fake. In line with the compatibility principle, the domain-specific measures based on the theory of planned behaviour correlated much more strongly with intentions to fake <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> than did the general measures of personality or self-monitoring. Of the dispositional measures, lower conscientiousness, higher neuroticism, and higher self-monitoring was associated with greater intention to fake <b>job</b> <b>interviews.</b> The findings support a model whereby the effect of personality on intentions is partially mediated by domain-specific beliefs...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a sociolinguistic, data-driven {{study of}} authentic <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> with second language speakers of Danish. The <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> {{are part of}} a Danish governmental initiative aimed particularly at immigrants and newcomers to Denmark, who are assumed to experience linguistic and cultural difficulties at the Danish labour market. The particular designs of the <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> as well as the explicitly stated evaluations of language and culture create an unusual frame. On the one hand we deal with "traditional" <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> as institutional gatekeeping instruments; on the other hand we face a tailored selection process meant {{to address the needs of}} the vulnerable. These contradictory practices produce certain tensions: although the <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> in focus are meant to accomplish the target group's special needs, they exemplify a practice in which the good intentions are all dressed up but have nowhere to go...|$|R
30|$|If <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> access {{provides}} an imperfect assessment of hiring discrimination, {{it should be}} noted that organizing interviews is costly, which encourages recruiters to interview only those applicants who actually have a real chance of obtaining the vacancy. Moreover, studies show that hiring discrimination flows directly from <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> access (Neumark et al. 1996, Kenney and Wissoker, 1994). For all these reasons, <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> access may be taken as a relevant measure of job access.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> for both the candidate and the employer in the hiring process has been established. The <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> may be given greater weight in decisions involving recent college graduates, who often have little experience. Research has focused on behaviors related to successful interviewing, both verbal and non-verbal, and on interventions aimed at improving interview performance. Yet no intervention {{has proven to be}} significantly more effective than others. ^ The purpose of this correlational {{study was to examine the}} relationship between confidence in interviewing, knowledge of <b>interview</b> questions, and <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance. Confidence and knowledge are factors assumed to influence <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance but no research has examined the validity of this assumption or whether a relationship exists between confidence and knowledge. ^ Results showed negative relationships between knowledge of <b>interview</b> questions and <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance, and between knowledge of interview questions and confidence in interviewing. A positive relationship existed between confidence in <b>interviewing</b> and <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance. This study has significance for anyone involved in a job search, professional interviewers, and those in education [...] teachers, trainers, administrators, and curriculum planners. ...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} that graduates faced at <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> is their inability to communicate competently in English, the language most often used especially at the multinational companies and government-linked companies (GLCs) <b>job</b> <b>interviews.</b> This inability to communicate competently at <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> {{is one of the}} reasons of unemployment among graduates. This study aimed to determine the factors affecting <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communication competence of unemployed graduates in Malaysia. The present study employed the mixed method research design using questionnaires followed by a semi structured interview with thirteen respondents. The population sample comprised unemployed graduates participating in the SLIM program (Skim Latihan 1 Malaysia) launched by the government to address the unemployment problem among Malaysian graduates. Questionnaires were distributed to 506 unemployed graduates at three participating GLCs in the Klang Valley of which a total of 337 questionnaires were finally used for data analyses. The <b>Job</b> <b>Interview</b> Communication Competence Scale (quantitative instrument) consisted of items on the five factors of communication competence and also those of the dependent variable <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communication competence. Overall, findings revealed moderate to low levels of general communication skills, context knowledge, English language knowledge and attitude towards the use of English language. Meanwhile, results indicated a moderate to high level of communication apprehension. Findings from qualitative data were found to be congruent with the quantitative data and further affirmed these results. A notable finding in this study seemed to be that general communication skills were very closely and negatively related to communication apprehension as revealed throughout the study in both quantitative as well as qualitative findings. Scores on general communication skills and communication apprehension showed significant relationship with <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communication competence. The influence of general communication skills and communication apprehension on <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communication competence was further validated in the final model of the multiple regression analysis where the two factors showed to be the predictors of <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communication competence. The regression model was used to develop the Five Levels of <b>Job</b> <b>Interview</b> Communication Competence Descriptors to describe <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> communication competence in two ways - as a summary of performance at <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> and secondly as an overall assessment of abilities in communication. The findings suggested students at the tertiary level may benefit from reinforcement and enrichment of language proficiency and communication skills that can be achieved in English language classes as well as subject area classes designed to facilitate general communication skills and in tandem promotes confidence in students when using the language...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess the effectiveness of the virtual communicative training developed by us in interviewing skills training of the unemployed with the employer. Participants were randomized into control (n= 16) and experimental (n= 18) con- ditions. We have created software “Virtual Recruiter” that provides an experience with which job seekers can systematically improve their <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> skills and increase their confidence about going on <b>job</b> <b>interviews.</b> We assessed the efficacy of virtual commmunicative training in a randomized controlled trial.

Experimental group participants significantly reduced their heart rates and significantly increased their psychological willingness to <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> on the role-play at follow-up compared with baseline (p 0, 05).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 59) This {{study was}} conducted to determine whether there was a need for modification of the content in ten high school speech textbook descriptions of the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> Content emphasized in the textbooks was analyzed and then submitted to a jury of five personnel interviewers for validation. Textbook chapters were found to be short and injunctive, offering little elaboration on major aspects of the <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> especially pre-interview self-appraisal by the applicant. Jury validation of an applicant's appearance and experience coincided with textbook content emphasis. The most discrepancy was in the emphasis on an applicant's references and the application form. Jury members expressed a need for more assured applicants, indicating that improvement in textbook procedural approaches to showing an applicant how to appraise himself was in order. The investigator concluded that modification of information in the textbook chapters on the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> was necessary. A prototype chapter was devised which represents a systematic guide for teachers and students. The prototype is an original consolidation of information on the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> Students are motivated by participating in a "job campaign" in which they are the ???candidates???. The prototype elaborates on each aspect of the <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> especially self-appraisal, augmenting each suggestion with examples and practice exercises which are embedded into the chapter. Material on the <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> the investigator concluded, needs to be modified to meet the changing demands of the business world [...] and the needs of students to be adequately trained in preparing for and participating in the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> With the prevalence of competition and specialization in the job market, the educational institution must meet its responsibility to prepare students; intensive efforts to update information on the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> in speech textbooks can help accomplish this...|$|R

40|$|Vocational {{rehabilitation}} or {{integration is}} a growing concern for people with psychiatric disabilities and mental health professionals. One of the key steps towards successful vocational outcome is to be competent in <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> skills, to form a favourable impression on job interviewers and to ultimately lead to a positive hiring decision. People with psychiatric disabilities have difficulties in managing <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> effectively due to various reasons. This paper reviews seven studies on the effectiveness of <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> skills training for the sample of people with psychiatric disabilities. In view of some of the concerns identified in those previous studies, and in recent work rehabilitation literature, it is proposed that the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> skills training should address the following issues: manifested adjustment, ability to communicate, concept of self-efficacy, skills generalisation, vocational rehabilitation versus integration and social validity of training materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Unemployed {{individuals}} of pre-retirement age face significant challenges {{in finding a}} new job. This may be partly due to their lack of psychological readiness {{to go through a}} <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> We view psychological readiness as one of the psychological attitude components. It is an active conscious readiness to interact with a certain aspect of reality, based on previously acquired experience. It includes a persons’ special competence to manage their activities and cope with anxiety. We created <b>Job</b> <b>Interview</b> Simulation Training (JIST) – a computer-based simulator, which allowed unemployed job seekers to practice interviewing repeatedly in a stress-free environment. We hypothesized that completion of JIST would be related to increase in pre-retirement job seekers’ psychological readiness for <b>job</b> <b>interviewing</b> in real life. Participants were randomized into control (n = 18) and experimental (n = 21) conditions. Both groups completed pre- and post-intervention <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> role-plays and self-reporting forms of psychological readiness for <b>job</b> <b>interviewing.</b> JIST consisted of 5 sessions of a simulated <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> and the experimental group found it easy to use and navigate as well as helpful to prepare for interviewing. After finishing JIST-sessions the experimental group had significant decrease in heart rate during the post-intervention role-play and demonstrated significant increase in their self-rated psychological readiness, whereas the control group did not have changes in these variables. Future research may help clarify whether JIST is related to an increase in re-employment of pre-retirement job seekers...|$|R
