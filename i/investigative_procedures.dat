25|$|The Montana Supreme Court twice {{ruled on}} the Judicial Standards Commission's <b>investigative</b> <b>procedures.</b> In , {{the high court}} ruled that charges against judges had {{to rise to the}} level of constitutionally proscribed {{misconduct}} in office before the JSC could investigate. Following the Shea decision, the Montana Legislature clarified the procedural requirements, so that the JSC could engage in an initial investigation without a verified, written complaint. Beyond that, however, the legislature now required the JSC to obtain a verified, written complaint. In , the high court affirmed the JSC's power to subpoena documents. In that case, a preliminary JSC investigation uncovered evidence that the Montana Department of Justice was conducting a criminal investigation of a judge. The JSC obtained documents about the criminal investigation, and found they warranted a sanction against the judge.|$|E
