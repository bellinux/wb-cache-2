During videos vision, cortical and physiological activation were recorded by electroencephalography and biofeedback. Data showed an increasing of Alpha power in central brain areas, greater during social <b>issue</b> <b>advertising</b> fruition and a higher Delta power in frontal brain areas for social <b>issue</b> <b>advertising</b> except for nutrition category, in wich there is a greater activation for commercial advertising. Physiological data showed an increasing of heartbeat during commercial advertising fruition, in particular for money, technology and nutrition cathegories. Data suggest a grater disposition to action and involvement in subjects due to commercial advertising features. This is showed by heartbeat increasing during commercial videos and alpha band incrising in central areas while whatching prosocial videos, that means a de-activation of central areas, involved in movement and tension to action. During social <b>issue</b> <b>advertising,</b> instead, we can see an activation of frontal area, linked to motivation processes. Finally, starting by the point that frontal lobe is related to evolved social functions linked to adaptation to social environment, we could imagine that commercial advertising touches more ancestral and instinctual processes related to movement and action, with lower central Alpha power; social <b>issue</b> <b>advertising,</b> on the other side, with higher frontal Delta power, activates higher functions related to motivation, adaptation to the environment, and thus to prosociality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{public debate}} {{over health care}} reform in 2009 was carried out partly through issue {{advertisements}} aired online and on television. Did these advertisements alter {{the course of the}} debate over health care reform? While millions of dollars are spent each year on issue ads, little is known about their effects. Results from a natu-ralistic online experiment on the effects of issue ads suggest that they can influence the perceived importance of an issue and perceptions of politicians associated with the featured policy while influencing policy support only among those low in politi-cal awareness. <b>Issue</b> <b>advertising</b> is a common strategy for groups seeking to influence mass and elite opinion on public policy. A recent survey of print and television advertisements in the Washington, DC, area estimated that in 2003 – 2004, citizen groups spent $ 58. 2 million on print and television issue ads in the DC area alone (Falk, Grizard, and McDonald 2006). 1 Corporate sponsors spent another $ 320. 1 million. In the DC market, six out of ten top <b>issue</b> <b>advertising</b> sponsors spent more on advertising than on lobbying (ibid. : 160). Groups spend particularly large amounts on ads when major public policies are being considered; for example, the Health Insurance Association of America spent $ 14 million to air its “Harry an...|$|E

To explore public reactions to printed and televised issues advertising, a study looked into reactions of university students to the current campaign sponsored by the United States Committee for Energy Awareness (USCEA). Seventy-four female and 42 male students, divided into four groups, were exposed to a magazine advertisement and three 30 -second television advertisements on issues related to energy. One group served as control, one read the printed ad, one saw the videotapes, and one both viewed the tape and read the ad. All then responded to a questionnaire indicating their support/opposition to nuclear energy. Analysis of their answers suggests that, in some regards, issue...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} BA thesis „Representation of women on {{advertisement}} photos in women’s magazines Anne & Stiil and Pere ja Kodu in 2010 “ is to analyze how women are represented in the women magazines Anne & Stiil and Pere ja Kodu advertisements. The goal was {{to find out the}} stereotypical roles how women are represented and portrayed in women magazines. The keywords of these thesis are: women portrayal, gender stereotyping and vistual content analysis. Visual content analysis involving elements of Kress & van Leeuwen’s (2006) and Goffman’s (1979) theories was carried out among 195 advertisements from Anne & Stiil and 104 advertisements from Pere ja Kodu magazines. Prerequisite for the advertisments was that it must depict at least one woman and the woman has to be at the principal focus of the photograph. Kilbourne (2000) refers that advertising sells more than just a product, it sells values, images, and concepts of love, succsess and normalcy. Nowadays advertising tells to the women how they should look, thats why representation is a relevant <b>issue.</b> <b>Advertising</b> tells to women that most important thing about them is how they look. That is the main reason why advertising impacts women’s self confident (Kilbourne 2000). Results of this study showed that portrayal of women was quite silimar in both Anne & Stiil and Pere ja Kodu magazine, but still some remarkable differences were revealed during the analysis. For example, women in Pere ja Kodu magazine {{were more likely to be}} depicted in a mother role than women in Anne & Stiil magazine. Anne & Stiil included mostly cosmetics and beauty products advertises whereas in Pere ja Kodu magazine the women were more often depicted in medicine and health advertisements. In both magazines women were more often represented as decorative objects. According to previous researchers (Goffman 1979, Kang 1997) decorative object is one of the most stereotypical way that a woman has been portrayed in history. Decorative role claims that women has no other purpose besides looking attractive. 59 Women depicted in professional roles practically didn’t exist, that shows that the new way in sterotyping women is not popular in Anne & Stiil and Pere ja Kodu magazines. Women in both magazines were often shown in ritualized subordination positions, meaning that they were laying, sitting or bending over someone or something. Head and body cants can be read as a mark of acceptance, compliance and submissivness. Dominant race, according to research results, was european. This shows that white oriented magazines usually use in their advertisements women from the same race. In conclusion it can be said that women in Anne & Stiil and Pere ja Kodu are often represented in a traditional stereotyping way...|$|E
