I thought I {{should have gone to}} the cellar. The cook was imperatively ordered to produce food, and I, as imperatively, was commanded to eat. To my great joy this food was limited to coffee and cake: I had feared wine and sweets, which I did not like. How he guessed that I should like a petit pâté à la crême I cannot tell; but he went out and procured me one from some quarter. With considerable willingness I ate and drank, keeping the petit pâté till the last, as a bonne bouche. M. Paul superintended my repast, and almost forced upon me more than I could swallow.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model for a {{continuously}} pumped single-pass amplifier for continuous and pulsed laser beams. The model takes into account Gaussian shape and focusing geometry of pump and seed beam. As the full-wave simulation is complex we have developed a largely simplified numerical method that can be applied to rotationally symmetric geometries. With the tapered-shell model we treat (focused) propagation and amplification of an initially Gaussian beam in a gain crystal. The implementation can be done with a few lines of code that are given in this paper. With this code, a numerical parameter optimization is straightforward and example results are shown. We compare the results of our simple model with those of a full-wave simulation and show that they agree well. A comparison of model and experimental data also shows good agreement. We investigate in detail different regimes of amplification, namely the unsaturated, the fully saturated, and the intermediate regime. Because the amplification process is affected by spatially varying saturation and exhibits a nonlinear response against pump and seed power, no analytical expression for the expected output is available. For modeling of the amplification we employ a four-level system and show that if the fluorescence lifetime of the gain medium is larger than the <b>inverse</b> <b>repetition</b> rate of the seed beam, continuous-wave amplification can be employed to describe the amplification process of ultrashort pulse trains. We limit ourselves to this regime, which implies that if titanium:sapphire is chosen as gain medium the laser repetition rate has to be larger than a few megahertz. We show detailed simulation results for titanium:sapphire for a large parameter set...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} eight randomly selected, cloned, repetitive sequence elements were determined. No homologies exist among the eight sequences that are sufficient to promote cross-reaction between them under standard conditions of measurement. Thus, each sequence {{is representative of}} a different repeat sequence family. Statistically significant but short (8 to 41 nucleotides) internal direct and <b>inverse</b> <b>repetitions</b> occupy a minor fraction of the sequence length {{in five of the}} eight repeat sequences. None contains internal reverse repeats sufficiently long to permit inclusion in the “foldback” DNA fraction. The general lack of internal sequence homology means that the sequence complexity of the eight clones is approximately equal to the length of the cloned inserts. Nucleotide sequences of three different members of one particular short interspersed repeat sequence family are also reported. Comparison of these sequences reveals that both the number and order of internal sequence subelements differ among family members. The results show that both fine-scale rearrangement and sequence divergence have occurred during the evolution of this repeat family...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a technique for femtosecond time-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy that allows to scan over a nanosecond time delay at a kilohertz scan rate without mechanical delay line. Two mode-locked femtosecond lasers with approximately 1 GHz repetition rate are linked {{at a fixed}} difference frequency of Delta fR= 11 kHz. One laser delivers the pump pulses, the other provides the probe pulses. The relative time delay is linearly ramped between zero and the <b>inverse</b> laser <b>repetition</b> frequency at a rate Delta fR, enabling high-speed scanning over a 1 ns time delay. The advantages of this method for all-optical pump-probe experiments become evident in an observation of coherent acoustic phonons in a semiconductor superlattice via transient reflectivity changes. A detection shot-noise limited signal resolution of 7 × 10 (exp - 8) is obtained with a total measurement time of 250 s. The time resolution is 230 fs...|$|R
40|$|The {{solar burst}} of 21 May 1984 {{presented}} {{a number of}} unique features. The time profile consisted of seven major structures (seconds), with a turnover frequency or approx. 90 GHz, well correlated in time to hard X-ray emission. Each structure consisted of multiple fast pulses (. 1 seconds), which were analyzed in detail. A proportionality between the repetition rate of the pulses and the burst fluxes at 90 GHz and or approx. 100 keV hard X-rays, and an <b>inverse</b> proportionality between <b>repetition</b> rates and hard X-rays power law indices have been found. A synchrotron/inverse Compton model {{has been applied to}} explain the emission of the fast burst structures, which appear to be possible for the first three or four structures...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{indicated}} that the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) may not only be important for long-term memory consolidation but also for certain forms of short-term memory. In this study, we explored the interplay between short- and long-term memory using high-density event-related potentials. We found that pictures immediately repeated after an unfilled interval were better recognized than pictures repeated after intervening items. After 30 min, however, the immediately repeated pictures were significantly less well recognized than pictures repeated after intervening items. This processing advantage at immediate repetition but disadvantage for long-term storage had an electrophysiological correlate: spatiotemporal analysis showed that immediate repetition induced a strikingly different electrocortical response after 200 - 300 ms, with inversed polarity, than new stimuli and delayed <b>repetitions.</b> <b>Inverse</b> solutions {{indicated that}} this difference reflected transient activity in the MTL. The findings demonstrate behavioral and electrophysiological dissociation between recognition during active maintenance and recognition after intervening items. Processing of novel information seems to immediately initiate a consolidation process, which remains vulnerable during active maintenance and increases its effectiveness during off-line processing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesHepatitis B virus (HBV) is {{a member}} of the {{hepadnavirus}} family. The HBV genome contains four genes designated as S, C, P, and X. The HBV X (HBx) gene encodes for a 16. 5 -kDa regulatory protein that enhances HBV replication and exerts multifunctional activities. The aim of this study is to describe the rapid and easy purification of HBx using ELP (elastin-like polypeptide) fusion protein. MethodsThe ELP–HBx fusion protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Environmental sensitivity was demonstrated via turbidity and dynamic light scattering as a function of temperature. HBx was purified as an ELP fusion protein. ELPs are biopolymers of the pentapeptide repeat Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly that undergo an inverse temperature phase transition. ELP follows in temperature and salt consistency, precipitation, and solution <b>repetition</b> (<b>inverse</b> transition cycling) with polypeptide, where it purifies the protein in a simple manner. ResultsFusion proteins underwent supramolecular aggregation at 40 °C in 1 M NaCl and slowly resolubilized at subphysiologic temperatures. ELP domain proteolysis liberated a peptide of comparable size and immunoreactivity to the commercial HBx. ConclusionThis study suggests that HBx can be purified rapidly and easily using inverse transition cycling, and that this method can be applied in determination of HBx 3 D structures and HBx stability study...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this paper is “An Analysis of Figurative Language in Raja Ali Haji’s Gurindam Duabelas. The {{objectives}} of the study are to find the figurative language and to find the dominating figurative language poured in Gurindam Duabelas. In this investigation, the writer analyzes a Malay poem entitled Gurindam Duabelas by Raja Ali Haji. To understand the content of this paper, firstly, people should understand the meaning of figurative language. Figurative language is a language which used to create certain effects and to generate imaginative impression to the readers. The figurative language can be categorized into four groups. They are figure of comparison, figure of opposition, figure of correlation, and figure of repetition. Figure of comparison can be divided into four groups. They are Simile, Metaphor, Personification, and Allegory. Figure of opposition can be divided into five groups. They are Hyperbole, Litotes, Irony, Sarcasm, and Oxymoron. Figure of correlation can be divided into five groups. They are Metonymy, Synecdoche, Allusion, Ellipsis, and <b>Inverse.</b> Figure of <b>repetition</b> can be divided into nine groups. They are Pleonasm, Climax, Anticlimax, Rhetorical, Alliteration, Antanaclasis, Repetition, Parallelism, and Chiasmus. In this research, the writer found 33 metaphoric expressions, 8 personification expressions, 6 simile expressions, and 1 hyperbolic expression. The total of figurative language which is found in Gurindam Duabelas is 48. So, metaphor mostly use in this classics poem...|$|R
