40|$|A Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) {{scheme was}} {{designed}} and applied {{to a set of}} 20 Trypanosoma cruzi stocks belonging to three main <b>discrete</b> <b>typing</b> units (T. cruzi I, V and VI) from a geographically restricted Chagas disease endemic area in Argentina, 12 reference strains comprising two from each of the six main <b>discrete</b> <b>typing</b> units of the parasite (T. cruzi I–VI), and one T. cruzi marinkellei strain. DNA fragments (≅ 400 -bp) from 10 housekeeping genes were sequenced. A total of 4178  bp were analyzed for each stock. In all, 154 polymorphic sites were identified. Ninety-five sites were heterozygous in at least one analyzed stock. Seventeen diploid sequence types were identified from 32 studied T. cruzi stocks (including the reference strains). All stocks were correctly assigned to their corresponding <b>discrete</b> <b>typing</b> units. We propose this MLST scheme as provisional, with scope for improvement by studying new gene targets on a more diverse sample of stocks, in order to define an optimized MLST scheme for T. cruzi. This approach is an excellent candidate to become the gold standard for T. cruzi genetic typing. We suggest that MLST will have a strong impact on molecular epidemiological studies of Chagas disease and the phylogenetics of its causative agent...|$|R

A cointegral is a non-zero element h in the multiplier algebra M(A) such that ah=_̌t(a) h for any a∈ A. When A has a faithful set of cointegrals (now we call A of <b>discrete</b> <b>type),</b> we give a sufficient and necessary condition for existence of integrals on A. Then we consider a special case, i. e., A has a single faithful cointegral, and we obtain more better results, such as A is Frobenius, quasi-Frobenius, et al. Moreover when an algebraic quantum groupoid A has a faithful cointegral, then the dual A must be weak Hopf algebra.

40|$|Background: Several studies {{suggested}} great ape cultures, {{arguing that}} human cumulative culture presumably evolved {{from such a}} foundation. These focused on conspicuous behaviours, and showed rich geographic variation, {{which could not be}} attributed to known ecological or genetic differences. Although geographic variation within call types (accents) has previously been reported for orang-utans and other primate species, we examine geographic variation in the presence/ absence of <b>discrete</b> call <b>types</b> (dialects). Because orang-utans have been shown to have geographic variation that is not completely explicable by genetic or ecological factors we hypothesized that this will be similar in the call domain and predict that <b>discrete</b> call <b>type</b> variation between populations will be found. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined long-term behavioural data from five orang-utan populations and collected fecal samples for genetic analyses. We show that there is geographic variation in the presence of <b>discrete</b> <b>types</b> of calls. In exactly the same behavioural context (nest building and infant retrieval), individuals in different wild populations customarily emit either qualitatively different calls or calls in some but not in others. By comparing patterns in call-type and genetic similarity, we suggest that the observed variation {{is not likely to be}} explained by genetic or ecological differences...|$|R
