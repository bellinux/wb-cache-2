5|$|The US Army's basic wartime racial policy, {{established}} in 1937, dictated that both whites and African Americans {{were to be}} inducted into the Army <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> proportions and strength, but that they were to be assigned to segregated units. Black soldiers could be led by white officers, but not vice versa, and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department. The mix of combat and support service units was, in theory, to be roughly equal between both groups. This caused tension between the Department and operational commanders, with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units. In practice, almost all combat units in the pre-war period were white.|$|E

40|$|A {{two years}} field study was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of response of two sweet sorghum cultivars to different sources and time of nitrogen application during 2009 and 2010 at experimental farm Faculty of Agriculture, South Valley University at Qena Governorate, Egypt. Two cultivars viz.

The experiment was laid out in split plot design with cultivars in main plots and nitrogen fertilizers in sub-plots. Among sweet sorghum cultivars, cv Honey had the highest stalk height, stalk diameter, number of internodes per stalk, Brix value, sucrose content, apparent purity percentage and stalk and forage (leaves) yields and lowest reducing sugar content. Application of T 4 gave the highest value of the above measurements and lowest reducing sugar content. Cultivar and nitrogen treatments interaction was significant on stalk and forage yields as well as reducing sugar content. The highest stalk and forage yields and lowest reducing sugar content were obtained by planting cv Honey and application of ammonium nitrate <b>in</b> three <b>equal</b> doses (at planting, 4 leaf stage and booting). Plant height, stalk diameter, forage yield, brix and sucrose were positively and strongly correlated with stalk yield...|$|R
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its weakness is that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> measure.|$|E
