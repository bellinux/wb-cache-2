In the tourist industry, an important sector for Cyprus, Germany ranked third in 2010 with 139,000 visitors, after the United Kingdom (approximately 1 million visitors) and Russia (223,000). There is especially close cooperation between Cyprus and Germany in the shipping sector. Many German shipping companies and shipping management businesses are based in Limassol in Cyprus. According to figures presented at the Cyprus Shipping Association’s Annual General Meeting, the shipping sector accounts for between 7 and 8 per cent of the country’s GDP. Cyprus operates the world’s ten-largest fleet and a total of some 2,400 vessels are owned or operated by member companies of the Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC). Currently, the shipping industry provides 4,500 onshore jobs and employs some 55,000 seafarers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the major policy measures that influenced Romanian agriculture {{before and after the}} country’s accession to the European Union (EU) in January 2007. It analyses the volume and composition of national and EU agricultural financial support between 2002 and 2012, and assesses how much has been transferred between agricultural farm support (Pillar 1) and rural development (Pillar 2). The findings show that, as membership drew near, Romania increased its efforts to provide farm support. The level of support has continued to rise (in nominal terms) year on year, <b>from</b> <b>EUR</b> 242 <b>million</b> in 2002 to almost <b>EUR</b> 600 <b>million</b> in 2005. By 2007, over EUR 1 billion (10 per cent of the Gross Value Added of the sector) was allocated to agriculture. Moreover, preparation for accession meant also significant changes in the structure of subsidies. This was redesigned so to emulate the Common Agricultural Policy, shifting the emphasis of support on to direct farm income. Overall, Romanian agriculture benefited <b>from</b> <b>EUR</b> 16. 4 billion in subsidies between 2002 and 2012, of which almost half (EUR 7. 8 billion) came from the EU. With accession, the share of EU financial support has increased, particularly in the form of direct payments, whilst the national contribution has decreased. However, the latter remains much higher than prior to accession. Of EUR 13. 6 billion allocated for agriculture following EU accession (2007 - 2012), 46 per cent was funded from the national budget. Overall, there is a rather limited volume of investment subsidies, as compared to production and income support, which may partially explain the low economic performance of the sector. EU membership has not necessarily led to farm consolidation and a gradual disappearance of small-scale (semi-subsistence) farms, which remain a dominant characteristic of Romanian agriculture...|$|R
50|$|Trade {{exchanges between}} the two {{countries}} have doubled over the past five years, <b>from</b> <b>EUR</b> 670 <b>million</b> in 2010 to EUR 1.3 billion in 2015. Bulgaria is also traditional destination for Polish tourists as last year 260,000 Polish tourists visited Bulgarian resorts, the statement said. Statistical data from Bulgaria’s National Statistics Institute confirms the figures and also shows that the trade exchange is more or less balanced, with imports from Poland slightly exceeding exports for the same period. For example, the trade data for 2015 shows that imports and exports from and to Poland are at about the same level as those with the Netherlands, a traditional investor and trade partner for Bulgaria. Tourist visits from Poland have increased with 7% in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015. In 2015, Poland occupied the 8th spot in the top 10 ranking for most important tourist markets for Bulgaria. In January 2016, the Bulgarian Ministry of Tourism said it expects a 40% {{increase in the number of}} Poles visiting Bulgaria in 2016. Major Bulgarian cities like the capital Sofia and Varna on the Black Sea coast have purchased Polish-made trams and buses for their public transport systems. According to media reports, the total figure of the purchase is valued at about <b>EUR</b> 90 <b>million.</b> Finally, for those observers careful enough to notice, apart from the gross figures, a couple of visits at Bulgarian supermarkets will show the large number of Polish-made goods available for sale.|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{discussion}} of the declining importance of deposits as banks' major source of funding we investigate which factors determine funding costs at local banks. Using a panel data set of more than 800 German local savings and cooperative banks for the period from 1998 to 2004 we show that funding costs are not only driven by the relative share of comparatively cheap deposits of bank's liabilities but among other factors especially {{by the size of}} the bank. In our empirical analysis we find strong and robust evidence that, ceteris paribus, smaller banks exhibit lower funding costs than larger banks suggesting that small banks are able to attract deposits more cheaply than their larger counterparts. We argue that this is the case because smaller banks interact more personally with customers, operate in customers' geographic proximity and have longer and stronger relationships than larger banks and, hence, are able to charge higher prices for their services. Our finding of a strong influence of bank size on funding costs is also in an in international context of great interest as mergers among small local banks - the key driver of bank growth - are a recent phenomenon not only in European banking that is expected to continue in the future. At the same time, net interest income remains by far the most important source of revenue for most local banks, accounting for approximately 70 % of total operating revenues in the case of German local banks. The influence of size on funding costs is of strong economic relevance: our results suggest that an increase in size by 50 %, for example, <b>from</b> <b>EUR</b> 500 <b>million</b> in total assets to <b>EUR</b> 750 <b>million</b> (exemplary for M&A transactions among local banks) increases funding costs, ceteris paribus, by approximately 18 basis points which relates to approx. 7 % of banks' average net interest margin...|$|R

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the planning horizon, no surpluses from operations are available to the investor. Putting the new distribution location in Volketswil into operation requires <b>EUR</b> 1.175 <b>million</b> (<b>EUR</b> 1 <b>million</b> for opening + EUR 0.175 million for making related capacities available). Furthermore, initial capacity changes (capacity expansions in Lahr and Hemer that require <b>EUR</b> 4 <b>million</b> in each year of the investor’s engagement, and can be balanced with annual cash inflows of <b>EUR</b> 2 <b>million</b> resulting <b>from</b> capacity downsizing at the production location in Porta Westfalica until {{the beginning}} of 2010) need to be considered. As financing through two credits (summed up to <b>EUR</b> 1 <b>million,</b> which is equal to the credit limit of this period) is not sufficient for the purposes mentioned above, the investor is advised to provide additional funds of <b>EUR</b> 2.175 <b>million</b> to the company to obtain increasing FTEs in the future. The credits must be repaid after 2  years (<b>EUR</b> 0.25 <b>million)</b> and 3  years (<b>EUR</b> 0.75 <b>million),</b> respectively. After the first period (i.e., at {{the beginning of}} the year 2009), the net operating profit after taxes is <b>EUR</b> 60.447 <b>million.</b> It is adjusted for regular payments of the aforementioned ongoing capacity changes (balanced to cash outflows of <b>EUR</b> 2 <b>million).</b> Taking into account two new credits (<b>EUR</b> 0.25 <b>million</b> for 1  year and <b>EUR</b> 0.75 <b>million</b> for 2  years, interest rates contain risk premium due to the current total debt of <b>EUR</b> 2 <b>million),</b> a cash outflow to the investor of <b>EUR</b> 59.447 <b>million</b> is possible. After the second time period (i.e., at {{the beginning of the}} year 2010) the tax shield becomes relevant for determining the net operating profit after taxes of <b>EUR</b> 61.994 <b>million,</b> as interests of <b>EUR</b> 0.058 <b>million</b> must be paid for two expiring loans (repayment amount of <b>EUR</b> 0.5 <b>million).</b> Simultaneously, a new loan (credit amount of <b>EUR</b> 0.75 <b>million,</b> interest rate 2  % p.a. + risk premium 7.5  % p.a. due to a current total debt of <b>EUR</b> 2.25 <b>million</b> and the debt limit of <b>EUR</b> 3 <b>million)</b> is taken out. The FTE of <b>EUR</b> 60.244 <b>million</b> results. After the following time period, the engagement of the investor ends. Last decisions on the adjustment of the network structure are possible at this point in time (end of the year 2010). In particular, there are cash inflows of <b>EUR</b> 2.7 <b>million</b> resulting <b>from</b> the liquidation of the production location in Porta Westfalica. As the rest of the configuration remains untouched (i.e., there are no further closings of locations), ongoing operations are ensured after the investor’s engagement. Three outstanding loans (summed up to <b>EUR</b> 2.25 <b>million)</b> are repaid, the related interests (summed up to <b>EUR</b> 0.319 <b>million)</b> are relevant for the calculation of the tax shield. Due to a net operating profit after taxes of <b>EUR</b> 57.735 <b>million,</b> a last cash outflow to the investor of <b>EUR</b> 54.185 <b>million</b> is possible. Using the given network structure that would be available to the new holders after the investor’s engagement, a net operating profit after taxes of <b>EUR</b> 62.125 <b>million</b> could be generated per year. As the latter is assumed to be a perpetuity, a residual value of <b>EUR</b> 460.19 <b>million</b> (valid at the end of the year 2010) can be calculated.|$|R
