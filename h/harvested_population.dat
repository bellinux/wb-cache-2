Survival rates vary by geographic region, exposure to trapping, habitat quality, and age. In an unharvested population in northeastern Oregon, the probability of survival of American marten ≥9 months old was 0.55 for 1 year, 0.37 for 2 years, 0.22 for 3 years, and 0.15 for 4 years. The mean annual probability of survival was 0.63 for 4 years. In a <b>harvested</b> <b>population</b> in east-central Alaska, annual adult survival rates ranged from 0.51 to 0.83 over 3 years of study. Juvenile survival rates were lower, ranging from 0.26 to 0.50. In Newfoundland, annual adult survival was 0.83. Survival of juveniles from October to April was 0.76 in a protected population, but 0.51 in areas open to snaring and trapping. In western Quebec, natural mortality rates were higher in clearcut areas than in unlogged areas.|$|E

Lethal removal is {{commonly}} used to reduce the density of invasive-species populations, presuming it reduces population growth rate; the actual effect of lethal removal on the vital rates contributing to population growth, however, is rarely tested. We implemented a manipulative experiment of feral pig (Sus scrofa) populations at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA, to assess the demographic effects of harvest intensity. Using mark–recapture data, we estimated annual survival, recruitment, and population growth rates of populations in a moderately harvested area and a heavily harvested area for 2004 – 06. Population growth rates did not differ between the populations. The top-ranked model for survival included a harvest intensity effect; model-averaged survival was lower for the heavily <b>harvested</b> <b>population</b> than for the moderately <b>harvested</b> <b>population.</b> Increased immigration and reproduction likely compensated for the increased mortality in the heavily <b>harvested</b> <b>population.</b> We conclude that compensatory responses in feral pig recruitment can limit the success of lethal control efforts...|$|E

However, the impacts of harvesting practices are rarely quantified, with as yet insufficient generic rules across species and life forms.

We address this impact in two scenarios. Firstly, in terms of a <b>harvested</b> <b>population,</b> where extinction must be prevented whilst maximising the yield obtained. Secondly, we address the impact of disturbance in an epidemic model, where the aim of the control strategy is to eradicate an endemic pathogen, or to prevent the invasion of a pathogen into a susceptible population. The movement of individuals between patches is modelled as both a constant rate, and a function which is increasing with population density. Finally, we discuss the `optimal' control strategy in this context.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Decision Support System (DSS) to {{estimate}} {{the values of the}} growth parameters from the yield effort data of a <b>harvested</b> <b>population.</b> The software is developed using Visual C# programming language in windows form application. Several softwares are used to check the validity of the multiple linear regression computational output in the DSS. The multiple linear regression computation is done using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method and its computation comes from the discretization of two most known growth models, namely Logistic growth model and Gompertz growth model. We discretize the models in terms of yield effort variables and used the resulting equations as the bases for computing the intrinsic growth rate r and the carrying capacity K parameters which are the main ingredients in the MSY formula. Those models are also used as two selection tools placed in the main menu of the software. We use an existing published data as an example to estimate the growth parameters. We also compute the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) for each model which represents the maximum amount of allowable biomass extracted from the fish population without harming the sustainability of the fisheries. Technically it suggests the value of the maximum sustainable yield as a decision to the harvester in managing the population and is often represented in a function of the growth parameters of the <b>harvested</b> <b>population.</b> Knowing the right growth parameters of the population is critical in determining the MSY, since the MSY is not stable. Hence, using an inaccurate values of growth parameters is likely detrimental in applying the MSY to the real fisheries.

Although harvest indices may be readily collected from hunters, the reliability of harvest indices for monitoring demography and abundance of the harvested species is rarely examined, particularly amongst large carnivores. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to assess whether cougar (Puma concolor) harvest statistics collected by wildlife managers were correlated with changes in cougar demography, mainly survival rates and abundance. We estimated key demographic parameters for 2 cougar populations in Utah over 17 years during which we monitored 235 radio-collared cougars. We then compared these demographic parameters to harvest statistics provided by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources over the same time period for the Oquirrh-Stansbury (lightly <b>harvested</b> <b>population)</b> and Monroe (heavily <b>harvested</b> <b>population)</b> harvest management units. In the Oquirrh-Stansbury unit, the percent of harvested cougars 3 ̆e 6 years old was positively correlated with annual survival, indicative of a population experiencing several years of high survival resulting in an older age structure. Percent of permits filled and cougar abundance were also significantly correlated, suggesting higher hunting success with increased density. In the Monroe management unit, the annual percent of permits filled was correlated with changes in overall annual survival and male and female annual survival. Of utmost importance, pursuit success (cougars treed/day) increased with the number of cougars on the unit suggesting that pursuit indices may be an informative metric for wildlife managers to determine cougar population trends. Because both management units were subjected to contrasting mortality regimes, results provided by this assessment could potentially be applied to additional management areas sharing similar ecological characteristics and harvest metrics.

Harvest of Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) {{has been}} {{frequently}} studied {{as a means}} to conserve forests and provide income to user communities, often with the assumption that harvest has relatively little ecological impact. Cycas circinalis L. and Cycas swamyi Singh & Radha are such NTFPs extensively harvested from the Western Ghats, South India. They are harvested for bark, leaves, seeds and male cones by indigenous people for medicinal, food and ornamental purposes, while commercially harvested for the medicinal and floricultural industries. Although indigenous people have a long association with Cycas spp, harvest for sale in informal regional markets has been uncontrolled over the past 15 years. Cycas circinalis is now regionally listed as 'critically endangered' and internationally listed as an 'endangered' species. In an attempt to understand the uses and responses of these species to harvest pressures, this study aims to document the trade, ethnobotany, life history, and population dynamics of Cycas spp. My study shows there is a large scale trade of leaves and pith and peak leaf sales occurs shortly after new leaf production in cycad habitats. The pith of C. circinalis and C. swamyi are collected for the herbal medicinal industry however, they are adulterants and don't provide the necessary constituents of the herbal drug, vidari. Demographical studies confirm that <b>harvested</b> <b>populations</b> are on a decline as the projected population growth rate over the long term λ, was < 1 for all <b>harvested</b> <b>populations.</b> Cycas spp have ancient lineages from the Jurassic age, being long-lived and slow-growing, and this coupled with intensive extraction reduces the chances for populations to rapidly withstand the induced stress of harvest.

While experimental and wild <b>harvested</b> <b>populations</b> often exhibit clear shifts in body size and maturation associated with fishing pressure, the relative contributions of genetic {{and environmental factors}} to these shifts remain uncertain and have been much debated. To date, observations of so-called fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) have been based solely on phenotypic measures, such as size data. Genetic data are hitherto lacking. Here, we quantify genetic versus environmental change in response to size-selective harvesting for small and large body size in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) across three generations of selection.
