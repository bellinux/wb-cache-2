40|$|The Brazilian {{arbitration}} law of 1996 {{has greatly}} facilitated the {{recognition and enforcement}} of foreign arbitral awards. Its rules are remarkably more efficient than the previous ones and those still governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign state court decisions. Out of the eighteen requests for recognition of foreign arbitral awards that were made since the constitutional reallocation of the recognition procedure in December 2004 with the Superior Federal Court, only four were rejected. The Superior Federal Court has shown an encouraging level of deference to arbitral awards by limiting its scrutiny to merely formal aspects. A request for recognition {{must be accompanied by}} the award and the written arbitration agreement; the latter is dispensable if the adversary participated in arbitration proceedings without raising an objection to the tribunal's jurisdiction. If the adversary refused to participate in proceedings, the award is not recognized if the adversary had not been correctly summoned to participate. The proceedings for obtaining recognition are free of charge; the prevailing party can recover its legal fees from the unsuccessful party insofar as they are considered reasonable by the Court. The duration of these proceedings varies between 1 and 3 years, depending on the circumstances of the case. <b>Interim</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> during this period are granted only in very exceptional cases. All in all, the Court's handling of requests for recognition can be summarized as quite efficient, and even more so if compared to the some of the disappointing tendencies in other Latin-American countries.

5000|$|The {{first and}} {{foremost}} welcome amendment introduced by the ordinance is with respect to definition of expression 'Court'. The amended law makes {{a clear distinction between}} an international commercial arbitration and domestic arbitration with regard to the definition of 'Court'. In so far as domestic arbitration is concerned, the definition of [...] "Court" [...] is the same as was in the 1996 Act, however, for the purpose of international commercial arbitration, 'Court' has been defined to mean only High Court of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, in an international commercial arbitration, as per the new law, district court will have no jurisdiction and the parties can expect speedier and efficacious determination of any issue directly by the High court which is better equipped in terms of handling commercial disputes.Amendment of Section 2(2): A proviso to Section 2(2) has been added which envisages that subject to the agreement to the contrary, Section 9 (<b>interim</b> <b>measures),</b> Section 27(taking <b>of</b> evidence), and Section 37(1)(a), 37(3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitrations, even if the seat of arbitration is outside India, meaning thereby that the new law has tried to strike a kind of balance between the situations created by the judgments of Bhatia International and Balco v. Kaiser. Now Section 2(2) envisages that Part-I shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India and that provisions of Sections 9, 27, 37(1) (a) and 37 (3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitration even if the seat of arbitration is outside India unless parties to the arbitration agreement have agreed to the contrary.Amendment to Section 8: (Reference of parties to the dispute to arbitration): In Section 8, which mandates any judicial authority to refer the parties to arbitration in respect of an action brought before it, which is subject matter of arbitration agreement [...] The sub-section(1) has been amended envisaging that notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any court, the judicial authority shall refer the parties to the arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists. A provision has also been made enabling the party, who applies for reference of the matter to arbitration, to apply to the Court for a direction of production of the arbitration agreement or certified copy thereof in the event the parties applying for reference of the disputes to arbitration is not in the possession of the arbitration agreement and the opposite party has the same.Amendment to Section 9 (Interim Measures): The amended section envisages that if the Court passes an <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> under the section before commencement of arbitral proceedings, then the arbitral proceedings shall have to commence within a period of 90 days from the date of such order or within such time as the Court may determine. Also, that the Court shall not entertain any application under section 9 unless it finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy under Section 17 efficacious..|$|R

Além da função de proteção, outra função das instituições de abrigo é zelar pela preservação dos vínculos familiares e reinserção da criança ao convívio familiar. No entanto, os motivos que levam as crianças à institucionalização, dentre os quais a violência intrafamiliar, a negligência, o abandono parental e condições socioeconômicas desfavoráveis, dificultam o retorno das crianças para suas famílias tornando-se um desafio para o trabalho preventivo. Com interesse na compreensão desse tema, a presente pesquisa teve por objetivo geral: delinear aspectos adaptativos e psicológicos de mães de crianças abrigadas, e por objetivos específicos: 1) {{investigar}} o funcionamento adaptativo das mães de crianças abrigadas; 2) averiguar a autoimagem e autoconceito dessas mães e 3) identificar fatores adaptativos e psicológicos das mães, que estariam associados ao abrigamento dos filhos. Participaram deste estudo sete mães, cujos filhos com idade entre de 0 a 10 anos e 11 meses estavam abrigados e recebiam visitas regulares das mesmas. Os instrumentos utilizados foram: a) entrevista preventiva; b) Escala Diagnóstica Adaptativa Operacionalizada (EDAO); c) Teste do Desenho da Figura Humana. Os resultados mostraram adaptação ineficaz grave em três mães, adaptação ineficaz severa em três mães e adaptação ineficaz moderada em uma mãe. Na avaliação da adequação setorial, os setores afetivo-relacional, produtividade e sócio-cultural mostraram-se os mais comprometidos. Os dados coletados nas entrevistas revelaram excessiva idealização na busca principalmente por parceiros, repetição e transmissão transgeracional da violência e do abandono vivenciados na própria infância e o empobrecimento do papel materno com falha na função de proteção e cuidados aos filhos. No Desenho da Figura Humana predominaram autoconceito e autoimagem preponderantemente negativos com sentimentos de insegurança, inadequação e inferioridade. Constatou-se que os fatores psicológicos e adaptativos, assim evidenciados, apresentaram-se fortemente associados ao abrigamento dos filhos. The shelter is <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> {{for children}} and adolescents that lives with a risk situation in your families. Beyond the protection function, another function from the shelters institutions is ensure for preservation of the family bonds and reintegration of the child to the family. However, the reasons leading the children to the institutionalization, among which the family violence, negligence, abandonment by parents and poverty economic and social, difficults {{the return of the}} children to their families becoming a challenge for the preventive work. Interested in understanding of this subject, this research had general objectives: delineate psychological and adaptive aspects of mothers with children living in shelters, and specifics objectives: 1) investigate the adaptive functioning of mothers from children sheltered; 2) investigate the self-image and self-concept of these mothers and e 3) identify factors psychological and adaptative of mothers who were associated with institutionalization of the children. Seven mothers participated from this study, whose children are aged between 0 to 10 years and 11 months and were in shelter and received regular visits from them. The instruments used were: a) preventive interview; b) Operational Adaptive Diagnostic Scale (EDAO); c) Human Figure Drawing Test. The results showed ineffective adaptation serious in three mothers, ineffective adaptation severe in three mothers and ineffective adaptation moderate in a mother. On the evaluating of adequacy from the sectors, affective-relational sectors, productivity and socio-cultural proved to be the most committed. The data collected on the interviews has revealed an excessive idealization mainly in search of partners, repetition and transgenerational transmission of violence and abandonment experienced on their own childhood and the depletion of the maternal role with failure protection function and care for children. In the human figure drawing has predominant self-concept and self-image overwhelmingly negative with feelings of insecurity, inadequacy and inferiority.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{and discuss the}} Finnish Arbitration Act and its current suitability {{to the needs of}} the international commercial arbitration and accordingly provides de lege ferenda interpretation and proposal for legislative revision with respect to the current Finnish Arbitration Act. According to the analysis provided in this thesis, the current Arbitration Act from 1992 is lacking the relevant and internationally demanded provisions concerning arbitrator-ordered <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> multiparty and multicontract arbitrations and expedited proceedings. Furthermore, it seems that the current provisions on the written form requirement of the arbitration agreement and scope of arbitrabilty are too limited and hence should be amended. The improvements suggested by this thesis are intended to modernise the current law, by making it more efficient, and to establish improved, efficient and internationally approved legislative framework for arbitration, with modern arbitral instruments in it. The five main improvements are the following: 1) In order to be consistent with the needs of contemporary international business, this thesis recommends Finnish legislators to take more flexible approach to the form requirement of the arbitration agreement and to follow the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law when drafting the provision for the new Arbitration Act. 2) The current indefined status of tribunal-ordered interim measures in Finland is lacking in terms of actual legislation and thus causes unnecessary ambiguousness. To avoid the existing uncertainty, the new Arbitration Act should confirm the arbitral tribunal's powers to grant enforceable interim measures. 3) This thesis recommends that the new Arbitration Act should provide a wider scope for arbitrability. It would be instructive for the legislators to examine if the concept of arbitrability would be defined in terms of monetary nature of the dispute. 4) Since a significant and increasing number of contemporary international arbitrations involve multi-party or multi-contract disputes the new Arbitration Act should confess their existence to improve the efficiency of arbitration process. Furthermore, the legislators should build functioning framework for multiparty and multi-contract arbitrations to avoid conflicting awards, which may arise out of separate arbitration proceedings. 5) The Finnish legislators should consider setting a time limit for rendering an award and include a ‘summary procedure’ provision to the new Arbitration Act. It would be recommended to use a sole arbitrator and limit the time for rendering the award, for instance as the FAI Rules imposes, to three months...|$|E
40|$|Arbitration is {{a private}} method of dispute {{resolution}} used mostly in commercial relationships. It provides the parties {{an efficient way to}} finally resolve their disputes outside national courts. This study presents the basic principles of international arbitration focusing on the interaction between arbitral tribunals and national courts. It is not always clear which one has the jurisdiction on certain issues and in some cases the parties may face the risk of being involved in parallel proceedings. The basis for international arbitration is the arbitration agreement, from which the jurisdiction of the tribunal is derived. Without an agreement there cannot be any jurisdiction on the arbitrators to decide the issue. The most controversial situations are when the other party contests the validity or existence of the arbitration agreement and therefore the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The principle of separability of the arbitration agreement from the main contract helps to define jurisdiction in these situations. The study is structured to present some distinct features of arbitration as the basic rules related to arbitration agreement and the general principles governing the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards under the New York Convention. An award would have no significance if it could not be enforced where needed. Through the widely accepted New York Convention arbitral awards are presumed to be enforceable, and the enforcement can be denied only on specified grounds. Enforcement is the main task of national courts concerning international arbitration. Tribunals and courts both have certain jurisdiction in arbitration based on international principles and national legislation. The tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction; this principle of competence-competence helps to define jurisdictional questions in unclear situations together with the principle of separability. A request may also be made to a national court concerning the jurisdiction of the tribunal, in which case the court must determine whether it decides the issue and in which extent, or whether it refers the parties to arbitration. National courts always have the final word on jurisdictional issues. Interests of the parties may need protection before the tribunal is constituted, which can be done by applying for <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> Interim measures may be ordered by the tribunal or a court depending on what kind of measures are needed and when. From a special emergency arbitrator parties may apply for protective measures before the constitution of the tribunal, this is otherwise possible only from national courts. Option to use emergency arbitrator may diminish the collision of jurisdictions in case of interim measures...|$|E

Next, we consider a stylized model of trade and find that the ability to raise price is a robust <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> and that protection falls significantly (for a given barrier) with the degree of product differentiation but also with the degree of rivalry. We also observe that the effects of non-tariff barriers on import values in ambiguous so that imports are not a robust <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> Our findings suggest that the distinction drawn in the case law between ‘like’ and ‘directly competitive and substitutable’ products is not helpful. Finally, we suggest a method to evaluate protection in trade disputes, which is inspired by the definition of the relevant market in antitrust. GATT; Market Definition; Protection...|$|R
