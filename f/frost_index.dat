40|$|In {{light of}} recent warming trends around the world, {{a growing concern}} is that the timing of spring phenophases in plants will occur earlier and that plants will {{therefore}} suffer from spring last-frost events more often. The changes in frost risks could have significant implications for agricultural and forestry systems. In this study, we investigated whether plant phenophases changed at a higher or lower rate compared to potentially damaging spring frost events in the temperate monsoon area of China. Based on phenological data derived from the Chinese phenological observation network and meteorological data from 15 study sites, changes in first-leaf dates and first-flowering dates for 12 deciduous woody plants were analyzed in comparison to last-frost dates. The results show that plant phenophases in spring advanced by a mean trend of - 0. 17 d yr(- 1) from 1963 to 2011. Over the same period, last-frost dates advanced at a rate of - 0. 23 d yr(- 1) (- 0. 51 to 0. 10 d yr(- 1)). Because the spring frost risk is decided by the relationship between last-frost date and plant phenophases in spring, the <b>frost</b> <b>index,</b> defined as the difference in days between the onset of spring phenophases and the last-frost date, was used to assess the frost risk. The significantly increased <b>frost</b> <b>index</b> (0. 087 d yr(- 1), p < 0. 01) suggests that the frost risk of plant phenophases in the study area declined over the nearly half-century study period.

40|$|Changes in <b>frost</b> <b>indices</b> in the New York's Catskill Mountains region, the {{location}} of water supply reservoirs for New York City, have potentially important implications. Frost day {{is defined as a}} day with T[subscript min][*]<[*] 0 °C. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate past and predicted changes in minimum temperature (T[subscript min]) and six <b>frost</b> <b>indices</b> in the Catskill Mountains covering six reservoir watersheds. Studied <b>frost</b> <b>indices</b> included (1) number of frost days, (2) number of months with frost, (3) last spring freeze date (LSF), (4) first fall freeze date (FFF), (5) growing season length (GSL), and (6) frost season length. Past changes in the <b>frost</b> <b>indices</b> were studied using observed daily T[subscript min] for each watershed for the periods 1960 – 2008. Future changes in <b>frost</b> <b>indices</b> for the periods (2045 – 2065 and 2080 – 2100) were studied for emission scenarios (A 1 B, A 2, and B 1) downscaled from global climate models GCMs). Results indicated a general increase in average Tmin and GSL and a decrease in number of frost days, months with frost, frost season length, earlier LSF, and later FFF from the historical to the future periods, and the magnitude of change varied among the watersheds and GCMs. For the period 1960 – 2000, in all watersheds (except Cannonsville), LSF occurred earlier by 2. 6 – 4. 3 [*]days/decade, FFF occurred later by 2. 7 – 3. 2 [*]day/decade, and GSL was longer by 2. 4 – 4 [*]day/decade. Among the scenarios and GCMs, LSF occurred earlier by 4 – 11 and 4. 5 – 15 [*]days/decade for the periods 2045 – 2065 and 2081 – 2100, respectively; FFF occurred later by 1 – 10 and 4 – 13 [*]days/decade for the periods 2045 – 2065 and 2081 – 2100, respectively; and GSL was longer by 10 – 25 and 13 – 40 [*]days/decade for the periods 2045 – 2065 and 2081 – 2100, respectively.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of air temperatures during cold half-year {{to a large}} extent affect all human activities. Most significant damages are caused by minimum air temperatures dropping to very low values. Due to the current ongoing climate change, air temperatures in winter in general are increasing, however, this does not necessarily mean the frequency of these very low temperatures decreases. It is not easy to express the course of air temperatures during cold periods using some simple characteristic. Meteorologists and climatologists use various characteristics, which can be referred to as <b>frost</b> <b>indexes.</b> These include the number of frost, ice or arctic days. Since these indexes not always perfectly reflect reaction of the nature to a particular temperature threshold, the analysis also included number of days with minimum air temperature below - 3, - 5, - 7, - 10, - 15, - 20 and - 25 °C. In the last 15 years (2001 - 2015), there has been a decrease in the <b>frost</b> <b>indexes</b> in comparison to the normal period 1961 - 1990, this trend however, is not always statistically significant. Significant changes were found in particular in case of the number of days with a higher temperature threshold (frost, ice days and minimum air temperature above - 3 to - 10 °C). In contrast, days with extremely low temperatures are relatively rare (sometimes only observed once in several years), so the dominant factor here is rather variability. The paper also includes an analysis of possible future development based on the most recent climatological models...|$|R

Areas of early onset also experience late cessation of frost resulting in shorter growing period of less than 240 days.

40|$|We {{perform a}} land-surface model intercomparison to {{investigate}} how the simulation of permafrost {{area on the}} Tibetan Plateau (TP) varies among six modern stand-alone land-surface models (CLM 4. 5, CoLM, ISBA, JULES, LPJ-GUESS, UVic). We also examine the variability in simulated permafrost area and distribution introduced by five different methods of diagnosing permafrost (from modeled monthly ground temperature, mean annual ground and air temperatures, air and surface frost indexes). There is good agreement (99 to 135  [*]×[*]  10 4  km 2) between the two diagnostic methods based on air temperature which are also consistent with the observation-based estimate of actual permafrost area (101  [*]×  10 4  km 2). However the uncertainty (1 to 128  [*]×[*]  10 4  km 2) using the three methods that require simulation of ground temperature is much greater. Moreover simulated permafrost distribution on the TP is generally only fair to poor for these three methods (diagnosis of permafrost from monthly, and mean annual ground temperature, and surface <b>frost</b> <b>index),</b> while permafrost distribution using air-temperature-based methods is generally good. Model evaluation at field sites highlights specific problems in process simulations likely related to soil texture specification, vegetation types and snow cover. Models are particularly poor at simulating permafrost distribution using the definition that soil temperature remains at or below 0  °C for 24 consecutive months, which requires reliable simulation of both mean annual ground temperatures and seasonal cycle, and hence is relatively demanding. Although models can produce better permafrost maps using mean annual ground temperature and surface <b>frost</b> <b>index,</b> analysis of simulated soil temperature profiles reveals substantial biases. The current generation of land-surface models need to reduce biases in simulated soil temperature profiles before reliable contemporary permafrost maps and predictions of changes in future permafrost distribution {{can be made for}} the Tibetan Plateau...|$|E

A frost day {{is defined as}} a day with T[subscript min][*]<[*] 0 °C. The long- and short-term trends in <b>frost</b> <b>indices</b> were analyzed at monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales. Probability of occurrence of the indices was analyzed at 5 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 95 %. Results indicated a general increase in T[subscript min] from 1900 through 2009 causing a decrease in nFDs. LSF and FFF occurred earlier and later than normal in the year, respectively, thereby resulting in an increase in GSL. In general, northwest Kansas recorded the greatest nFD and lowest T[subscript min], whereas southeast Kansas had the lowest nFD and highest T[subscript min]; however, the magnitude of the trends in these indices varied with location, time period, and time scales. Based on the long-term records in most stations, LSF occurred earlier by 0. 1 – 1. 9 days/decade, FFF occurred later by 0. 2 – 0. 9 day/decade, and GSL was longer by 0. 1 – 2. 5 day/decade. At the 50 % probability level, Independence in the south-eastern part of Kansas had the earliest LSF (6 April), latest FFF (29 October) and longest GSL (207 days). Oberlin (north-western Kansas) recorded the shortest GSL (156 days) and earliest FFF (7 October) had the latest LSF (2 May) at the 50 % probability level.

Based on the trend of FFD change rate in recent 45 years, the distribution of FFD in the future 50 years was projected. At the same time, those climatic indexes were applied to study the tendency of climatic change in 14 wine regions of China. By our research, we found that: in recent 45 years, especially after 80 th, the duration of FFD increased significantly, ∑Te and Tave of different span moved northwards and westwards, the bury line of- 15 ℃ moved northwards, and the variation of FFD and ∑Te were influenced significantly by the step-terrain of China, in the same step, the acreage suffered from climate change was wider, but in the areas where the step rose, the change of those <b>frost</b> <b>indexes</b> were more significantly.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsPerla Reyes CuellarA <b>frost</b> <b>index</b> is a {{calculated}} value {{that can be}} used to describe the state and the changes in the weather conditions. Frost indices affect not only natural and managed ecosystems, but also a variety of human activities. In addition, they could indicate changes in extreme weather and climate events. Growing season length is one of the most important frost indices. In this report, growing season lengths were collected from 23 long-term stations over Kansas territory. The records extended to the late 1800 s for a few stations, but many started observations in the early 1900 s. Though the start dates of the records were different, the end dates were the same (2009). To begin with, time series models of growing season length for all the stations were fitted. In addition, by using fitted time series models, predictions and validation checking were conducted. Then a regular linear regression model was fitted for the GSL data. It removed the temporal trend by doing regression on year and it showed us the relationship between GSL and elevation. Finally, based on a penalized likelihood method with least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, spatial-temporal model selection and parameter estimation were performed simultaneously. Different neighborhood structures were used for model fitting. The spatial-temporal linear regression model obtained was used for interpreting growing season length of those stations across Kansas. These models could be used for agricultural management decision-making and updating recommendations for planting date in Kansas area...|$|E
40|$|In {{frost action}} {{research}} and design most {{focus has been}} put on frost heave. There are several models available to predict frost heave and the concept of statistical re-occurrence times of <b>frost</b> <b>index</b> is commonly used in design. Less effort {{has been put on}} thaw weakening modeling and design even though thaw weakening causes a lot of damage on infrastructure such as road and railways. In e. g. Sweden the Transport Administration collects temperature data during the freezing season for frost heave design purposes on project levels but thawing effects are conventionalized by reference tables on a regional level. The aim {{of this study is to}} define and quantify the thawing event in such way that it could be applied on a project level in a similar way as temperature measurements are used for frost design. In this study thaw index has been analysed statistically based on air temperature data from 50 stations, collected from year 1951 and onwards by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI), in Sweden. The temperature thaw seasons have been correlated to the Swedish Transport Administrations frost depth measurement stations. A reference table has been developed based on reoccurrence times of thawing seasons based on the magnitude of thawing index. Based on the statistical distribution of thawing indexes Sweden was divided into three regions in this study. It seems, by statistical means, to be fully possible to develop reference values for thawing periods where thawing index is the working unit. In order to implement the results in e. g. pavement design thawing temperature measurements on a local or semi-regional level are required. Godkänd; 2016; 20160530 (tomede...|$|E
40|$|The {{improved}} process based equilibrium {{terrestrial biosphere}} model (BIOME 3 China) was run {{under the present}} climate to model the potential biomes on the Tibetan Plateau on a 10 ' grid. The simulated biome was basically in good agreement with a potential natural vegetation map based on a numerical comparison between two maps using the Delta V statistic (Delta V = 0. 38). A coupled ocean- atmosphere general circulation model including sulfate aerosols was used to drive a double greenhouse gas scenario {{to the end of}} the next century. The simulated vegetation under changed climate with a CO:! concentration of 500 ppmv and a baseline biome map were also compared using the Delta V statistic (Delta V = 0. 4). The climate change would cause a large reduction in the temperate deserts alpine steppe, desert, and ice/polar desert, a large increase in the cold-temperate conifer forest, temperate shrubland/meadow, and temperate steppe, and a general northwestward shift of ail vegetation zones. In addition to simulation of biome distribution, BIOME 3 China also predicted net primary production (NPP) of each grid cell. Comparisons between predicted annual NPP and 160 forest NPP measurements show an agreement between them with a linear regression, despite many problems, such as the quality of the field data. The pattern of predicted annual NPP in the scenario with enhanced CO 2 concentration was the same as that under the present climate; however, the NPP of each biome would increase significantly. Present permafrost simulated using the air <b>frost</b> <b>index</b> was quite similar to the actual frozen ground distribution on the Tibetan Plateau. After the change in climate, the boundary between continuous and discontinuous permafrost would shift toward the north of the plateau by about 1 - 2 degrees in latitude. The continuous permafrost would mostly disappear, whereas the no-permafrost area would greatly increase. The movement of permafrost would take place with the shift of vegetation zones to the north. The disappearance of permafrost and the expansion of no-permafrost areas would accelerate the desertification of the Tibetan Plateau. [References: 25...|$|E

In material from the high-altitude Mútne-Zákamenné trial plot, all three tested provenances showed approximately the same degree of frost injury. At- 80 °C no differences between prove-nances were observed, and the trees growing at the high-elevation site exhibited lower average frost injury than the trees at Vel’ký Lom. Most parameters of the kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence followed the same trends as frost injury, and differed significantly between plots.

40|$|The {{temperate}} monsoon area of China is {{an important}} agricultural region but late spring frosts have frequently caused significant damage to plants there. Based on phenological data derived from the Chinese Phenological Observation Network (CPON), corresponding meteorological data from 12 study sites and phenological modeling, changes in flowering times of multiple woody plants {{and the frequency of}} frost occurrence were analyzed. Through these analyses, frost risk during the flowering period at each site was estimated. Results of these estimates suggested that first flowering dates (FFD) in the study area advanced significantly from 1963 to 2009 at an average rate of - 1. 52 days/decade in Northeast China (P < 0. 01) and - 2. 22 days/decade (P < 0. 01) in North China. Over the same period, the number of frost days in spring decreased and the last frost days advanced across the study area. Considering both flowering phenology and occurrence of frost, the <b>frost</b> risk <b>index,</b> which measures the percentage of species exposed to frost during the flowering period in spring, exhibited a decreasing trend of - 0. 37 % per decade (insignificant) in Northeast China and - 1. 80 % per decade (P < 0. 01) in North China, implying that frost risk has reduced over the past half century.

40|$|Globally, {{the maximum}} {{elevations}} at which treelines are observed to occur coincide with a 6. 4 °C soil isotherm. However, when observed at finer scales, treelines display a considerable degree of spatial complexity in their patterns {{across the landscape}} and are often found occurring at lower elevations than expected relative to the global-scale pattern. There is still {{a lack of understanding}} of how the abiotic environment imposes constraints on treeline patterns, the scales at which different effects are acting, and how these effects vary over large spatial extents. In this thesis, I examined abrupt Nothofagus treelines across seven degrees of latitude in New Zealand in order to investigate two broad questions: (1) What is {{the nature and extent of}} spatial variability in Nothofagus treelines across the country? (2) How is this variation associated with abiotic variation at different spatial scales? A range of GIS, statistical, and atmospheric modelling methods were applied to address these two questions. First, I characterised Nothofagus treeline patterns at a 15 x 15 km scale across New Zealand using a set of seven, GIS-derived, quantitative metrics that describe different aspects of treeline position, shape, spatial configuration, and relationships with adjacent vegetation. Multivariate clustering of these metrics revealed distinct treeline types that showed strong spatial aggregation across the country. This suggests a strong spatial structuring of the abiotic environment which, in turn, drives treeline patterns. About half of the multivariate treeline metric variation was explained by patterns of climate, substrate, topographic and disturbance variability; on the whole, climatic and disturbance factors were most influential. Second, I developed a conceptual model that describes how treeline elevation may vary at different scales according to three categories of effects: thermal modifying effects, physiological stressors, and disturbance effects. I tested the relevance of this model for Nothofagus treelines by investigating treeline elevation variation at five nested scales (regional to local) using a hierarchical design based on nested river catchments. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that the majority of the variation in treeline elevation resided at the broadest, regional scale, which was best explained by the thermal modifying effects of solar radiation, mountain mass, and differences in the potential for cold air ponding. Nonetheless, at finer scales, physiological and disturbance effects were important and acted to modify the regional trend at these scales. These results suggest that variation in abrupt treeline elevations are due to both broad-scale temperature-based growth limitation processes and finer-scale stress- and disturbance-related effects on seedling establishment. Third, I explored the applicability of a meso-scale atmospheric model, The Air Pollution Model (TAPM), for generating 200 m resolution, hourly topoclimatic data for temperature, incoming and outgoing radiation, relative humidity, and wind speeds. Initial assessments of TAPM outputs against data from two climate station locations over seven years showed that the model could generate predictions with a consistent level of accuracy for both sites, and which agreed with other evaluations in the literature. TAPM was then used to generate data at 28, 7 x 7 km Nothofagus treeline zones across New Zealand for January (summer) and July (winter) 2002. Using mixed-effects linear models, I determined that both site-level factors (mean growing season temperature, mountain mass, precipitation, earthquake intensity) and local-level landform (slope and convexity) and topoclimatic factors (solar radiation, photoinhibition index, <b>frost</b> <b>index,</b> desiccation index) were influential in explaining variation in treeline elevation within and among these sites. Treelines were generally closer to their site-level maxima in regions with higher mean growing season temperatures, larger mountains, and lower levels of precipitation. Within sites, higher treelines were associated with higher solar radiation, and lower photoinhibition and desiccation index values, in January, and lower desiccation index values in July. Higher treelines were also significantly associated with steeper, more convex landforms. Overall, this thesis shows that investigating treelines across extensive areas at multiple study scales enables the development of a more comprehensive understanding of treeline variability and underlying environmental constraints. These results can be used to formulate new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms driving treeline formation and to guide the optimal choice of field sites at which to test these hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|Rock fill dams are {{the most}} common kind of dams at hydro power {{stations}} in Sweden. The dams consist of different zones like core, fine filter, coarse filter, rock fill and rip rap. One of the most important parts is the core of the dam, which serves as embankment. The core consists at best of fine grained moraine. Most often the core connects directly against the spillway construction of concrete, which means that the concrete is the only frost protection against the core in the longitudinal direction. The connection between the core and the concrete structure is by experience a weakness zone when it comes to rock fill dams. Geotechnical investigations close to the spillway construction has shown a very low degree of compaction of the soil, which has been explained by hang up effects and difficulties to compact the moraine closest to the concrete structure at the construction stage. Eventually a source to the low degree of compaction might be effects caused by freezing and thawing since freezing take place through the spillway construction into the core of moraine. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate if freezing take place through the concrete construction into the core, and to study effects by possible freezing. The process of freezing requires three basic conditions. The basic conditions required for frost action to occur include a frost-susceptible soil, a supply of water and soil temperatures sufficiently low to cause some of the soil water to freeze. Depending on the <b>frost</b> <b>index,</b> the amount of days with negative temperature, the frost depth will be more or less extensive. The three basic conditions required for frost action to take place are more or less fulfilled at the connection between the core and the spillway structure. Air temperature below zero degrees Celsius will create a difference of temperature per length which will cause a heat flux from the ground surface that is called a thermal gradient. Due to the 0 °C isotherm is getting deeper into the soil, the thermal gradient changes and the frost depth reaches its maximum. When the soil thaws the ice is converted to water. Since the process of freezing has agglomerated more water in the shape of ice than the volume of the pores in the soil may contain, {{there will be a lot}} of excess water in the soil. This excess water must be drained away in order to keep the balance in consideration of the water content of the soil. If the excess water is not drained the strength of the soil will be lowered. When soil freezes the geotechnical properties will be changed. Changes in density, water content and porosity are some examples of differences that might occur. When these properties of the soil are changed changes in micro structure, formation of cracks and changes due to permeability may take place. Mentioned changes will create a zone of weakness and the risk of inner erosion with potential piping will increase. By modeling the frost penetration with Temp/W, a finite element program used to calculate heat flow in geotechnical constructions, effects caused by freezing and thawing in the connection between the core and the spillway construction has been investigated. The analysis has been performed with climate data equal to a winter occurring every period of 50 and 100 year in Luleå respectively Jokkmokk. The calculations did show that freezing will occur through the concrete construction into the core of the dam. Depending on the freezing index and thermal bridges the depth of the frost penetration will differ. Freezing will already occur at a climate data equal to a normal winter for analysis of both Lulea and Jokkmokk. In Lulea the frost depth will differ between 2. 7 - 4. 0 meters depending on the climate data and the distribution of the reinforcement in the concrete structure. Regarding analysis with input corresponding to the conditions in Jokkmokk the frost depth will diversify between 3. 0 - 4. 6 meters depending on the climate data and the distribution of reinforcement at the concrete construction. To reduce the effects of freezing and thawing cut-off walls might be installed at the connection between the core and the concrete structure. In order to prevent freezing heating coils can be installed connected to the spillway structure. Since the problem of freezing and thawing is complexly some generalizations has been made to be able to investigate the three-dimensional problem with a software which handle with two-dimensional analysis, Temp/W. Further studies should be performed based of more careful investigations of the soil properties and the impact of the freezing process regarded to the amplitude of regulation and the ground water level of the dam. Even external circumstances like snow and wind relation should be considered in further analysis. A recommendation is that these investigations should be performed with software where it is possible to create a three-dimensional model in order to get a more realistic analysis.

Based on phenological data derived from the Chinese Phenological Observation Network (CPON), corresponding meteorological data from 12 study sites and phenological modeling, changes in flowering times of multiple woody plants {{and the frequency of}} frost occurrence were analyzed. Through these analyses, frost risk during the flowering period at each site was estimated. Results of these estimates suggested that first flowering dates (FFD) in the study area advanced significantly from 1963 to 2009 at an average rate of - 1. 52 days/decade in Northeast China (P < 0. 01) and - 2. 22 days/decade (P < 0. 01) in North China. Over the same period, the number of frost days in spring decreased and the last frost days advanced across the study area. Considering both flowering phenology and occurrence of frost, the <b>frost</b> risk <b>index,</b> which measures the percentage of species exposed to frost during the flowering period in spring, exhibited a decreasing trend of - 0. 37 % per decade (insignificant) in Northeast China and - 1. 80 % per decade (P < 0. 01) in North China, implying that frost risk has reduced over the past half century. These conclusions provide important information to agriculture and forest managers in devising frost protection schemes in the region...|$|R

The method used squared Euclidean distance as a similarity coefficient;Standardized variables {{were obtained for}} each of 30 environmental variables (mean monthly temperature, maximum monthly temperature, minimum monthly temperature, and monthy precipitation each from May to October; annual precipitation, growing degree days, frost free season, first Fall <b>frost,</b> average stress <b>index,</b> and plant available soil moisture capacity). The data set {{used in this study}} included means of 30 years (1951 - 1980) for each of 95 Iowa counties for the 30 variables;The cluster analysis (Ward 2 ̆ 7 s method) classified groups generally in close geographic proximity, even though geographical variables (latitude, longitude, etc.) were not used in the clustering process;The results of the analysis indicated that the method of cluster analysis (Ward 2 ̆ 7 s method) was acceptable when grouping the counties of Iowa into five regional agroclimatic zones by 30 climatic variables. Those regions were: Northwest, Northeast, Central, South, and a transitional region between central and south regions;The counties were grouped according to statistically derived relationships. Five major groupings were identified for Iowa. These groupings are expected to provide a more realistic basis for selecting experimental sites to avoid large cultivar x environment interaction when testing corn hybrids;An agroclimatic classification was produced for the state of Iowa that is complementary to earlier efforts in grouping the soil of the state. When considered together, the soil associations and climate regional groupings correlated well with observed corn yield obtained over a 30 -year period of record;Methods were developed to enable prediction models of crop suitability to be generated for locations (states or nations) where intensive cropping practices are not well-developed...|$|R
40|$|We {{compiled}} homogeneous long-term {{time series}} comprising 39 variables representing the German Bight {{and for the}} period 1975 - 2004. A diverse set of variables was selected to cover multiple trophic levels and different environmental forcing thus to examine long-term changes in this coastal region. Previous studies have hypothesised the presence of regime shifts in observations extending over the entire North Sea. Focusing on a smaller spatial scale, {{and closer to the}} coast, we investigated the major modes of variability in the compiled time series using principal component analysis. The results obtained confirm a previously identified regime shift in the North Sea in 1987 / 1988 and suggest that the German Bight is dominantly characterised by long-term modes of variability. In the German Bight, the shift of 1987 / 1988 is driven primarily by temperature, Gulf Stream <b>index,</b> <b>frost</b> days and Secchi depth. Changes in some of the ecosystem variables (plankton and fish) appear to be related to changes in these driving variables. In particular, we documented strong positive correlations between the long-term trend showed by the first principal component and herring, Noctiluca scintillans, and, to a lesser extent, Pleurobrachia pileus. Two gadoids, namely cod and saithe, showed negative correlations with the observed long-term mode of variability. Changes in the sum of five small calanoid copepods were, however, less marked. Phosphate and ammonium exhibited a decreasing trend over the last 30 years. Diatoms and Calanus helgolandicus did not show evidence of changes in concert to this trend. Specific analyses of the data divided into three different subsets (biological, climatic and chemical) characterise the climate of the German Bight as highly dynamic also on short timescales (a few years) as compared to much smoother biological and chemical components. The dynamic regime of the German Bight taken together with a low correlation between the major mode of variability and phytoplankton and zooplankton data suggests that the lower trophic levels of this ecosystem are remarkably resilient...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Over {{the past}} hundred years, human {{activity}} has significantly altered {{the atmosphere and}} increase of concentration of greenhouse gases lead to warm the earth's surface. This global warming leads to change of climatic extreme index and increases the intensity and frequency of occurrence of extreme climate events. Investigation of extreme values for planning and policy for the agricultural sector and water resource management is important. In this study, {{a comprehensive review of}} extreme indices of temperature and precipitation are discussed. This paper aims to investigate extreme temperature and precipitation indices defined in accordance with CCL, and the study of other climatic parameters in the North East of Iran. Materials and Methods: In this research, statistics and data of some stations in the North East of Iran during the period 1992 - 2012 were used. To evaluate the extreme climate indices trend, 27 indices of rainfall and temperature, were defined by the ETCCDMI. They were calculated by RClimdex software. In this software, prior to the index calculation, data by quality control software became quantitative and incorrect data were controlled and outlier data were examined. The indices were calculated by daily data. 11 rainfall and 16 temperature indices were calculated by this software. The target of the ETCCDMI process is to delineate a standardized set of indices allowing for comparison across regions. These extreme indices were classified in five categories which included the percentile-based extreme indices, the absolute extreme indices, the threshold extreme indices, the periodic extreme indices, and the other indices. They were estimated at the 0. 05 significant levels. The Mann-Kendall test was used to investigate the climatic parameters, maximum relative humidity, sunshine duration and maximum wind speed. Results and Discussion: Thermal analysis results are consistent with warming patterns, and they have showed that hot extremes indices have increased. Hot days index (SU 25), shows a significant positive trend in all studied stations. Number of tropical nights has a positive trend in all stations. Hot day frequency (TX 90 P) and hot night frequency (TN 90 P) in all stations show a positive trend, indicating {{an increase in the number}} of warm days and nights. Cold extreme indices show a decreasing trend. (TX 10 P) and (TN 10 P) show significant negative trends in all stations and indicate a decrease in cold days and nights. Number of <b>frost</b> day <b>index</b> shows a decreasing trend. Overall, the results revealed a decrease in the severity and frequency of cold events, while warm events during the study period were significantly increased. These results are consistent with the results of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and global and regional studies. Rising temperatures could lead to increase in the maximum wind speed in the area. In the study of the maximum wind speed process, this trend was observed in most stations, and incremental changes can be associated with a reduction in the maximum relative humidity (which was observed in the results). The sunshine hour parameter depicted a decreasing trend in the most station trend. In the study of all rainfall indices in all studied stations there were a decreasing and negative trend for rainfall, although few significant trends over time were observed. Comparison of years with the highest rainfall and those with the lowest, showed that the amplitude of fluctuations in precipitation in different years is very high and the distribution of rainfall at distinct stations is different. In general, due to the high dispersion and low rainfall in most stations, providing a clear and uniform regional rainfall pattern is not possible. Due to the effects of temperature and precipitation extreme indices in a wide range of human activities, such as agriculture, water management and building design, it is necessary to consider the effects of these extreme climatic events in the future planning and policies in different sectors. Conclusion The results showed that hot extreme indices, such as summer day index, the number of tropical nights, warm days and nights have increased, while, in the period of study, cold extreme indices have decreasing trend, which shows a decrease in the severity and frequency of cold events. The trend of the maximum wind speed was increased in most stations. Rainfall indices show decreasing and negative trends, although over the studied period few significant trends were observed...|$|R
