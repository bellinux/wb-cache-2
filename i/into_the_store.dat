Graham calls for Roy, but the Tiger {{gets into the}} {{building}} and attacks him, Graham barely failing to kill the tiger with both shots he fires. Sheriff Barnes arrives after being alerted about a break-in alarm and is chased <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> by the tiger.

The sheriff dives under the truck and shields the boy as the Tiger tries to attack. When the Tiger jumps into the bed of the truck, they run to the sheriff's truck. The sheriff shoots at the tiger, but hits a gasoline tank causing it to explode and kill the Tiger. Graham appears beside the building, bloody but alive. Deciding his hunting days are over, Graham returns home. Sheriff Barnes and his wife adopt the orphaned Roy.|$|E

25|$|This amplified, {{new sound}} was {{different}} from the acoustic country blues played in the South. It was popularized by blues giants such as Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Bo Diddley and Howlin' Wolf and evolved into rock & roll. From the first, the blues signified a lament or elegy for hard times, though it outgrew that limitation. When economic decline in the American South after World War I caused many Delta Blues and Jazz musicians - notably Louis Armstrong – to migrate north to Chicago, the first economically secure class willing to help them was the mostly Jewish merchants of the area around Maxwell Street, who by that time were able to rent or own store buildings. These merchants encouraged blues players to set up near their storefronts and provided them with electric extension cords to run the new high-tech instruments. Shoppers lured by the chance to hear blues music could be grabbed and hauled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> where they were sold a suit of clothes, shoes, etc. One of the regular performers was the self-styled Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis, who played in the area for over 40 years.|$|E

The fire spread quickly; Hampshire and Barron escaped, but Frazer was trapped in the store room and died in the fire. Iserbrooke was scuttled in the harbor in an attempt to control the fire, but this was only partly successful, and the portion of the ship above water level continued to burn for some time until the local fire department could extinguish. Captain Frazer′s remains eventually were recovered after the ship was pumped out and raised early in 1879. Iserbrook′s damaged hulk remained afloat in the harbor until 30 January 1880, when it sank again. Deemed not worth further salvage efforts in July 1880, the wreck was destroyed with explosives in October 1880.|$|E

Finding Mado working at Grutter's, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter.

500|$|The jump is a three-stage process. First, the {{grasshopper}} fully flexes {{the lower}} part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. [...] Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates various {{insulation}} thicknesses {{requirements for}} double-walled spherical pressure vessels for {{the storage of}} cryogenic liquids. The inner tank is suspended from the outer tank by straps or cables and the annular space between the tanks is filled with insulation. The outer tank is not subjected to the freezing temperatures and is thus {{assumed to be a}} standard carbon steel sphere. In the Finite Element Analysis model of the system, one dimensional analysis was employed. This is due to the assumption that temperature gradient does only exist along the spherical radial direction. In the developed model, once the thickness of the inner shell has been determined based on relevant standards and codes—ASME Sec VIII Div 1 or 2, BS 5500 etc and the thickness of the outer shell is known; the required insulation material thicknesses were calculated for different insulating materials. Set of equations resulting from Finite Element Analysis were solved with computer programme code which was written in FORTRAN 90 programming language. The results obtained are validated by analytical method. The results showed no significant difference (P > 0. 05) with values obtained through analytical method. The thicknesses for different insulating materials in-between inner and outer tank shells were compared. The results showed that as the insulating material thickness was increased, <b>the</b> heat flux <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> product was decreasing and at a certain thickness; it started increasing. The insulating thickness at which this happens is termed as critical thickness of insulating material—the thickness of insulation at which the heat influx to <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> products is minimal; this would therefore reduce boil-off of <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> cryogenic product. High thermal conductivity insulating materials need to be thicker than lower thermal conductivity insulating materials if the system is conditioned to have the same heat flux <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> product for all insulating materials. In the simulation, different insulating material gives different minimal heat influx <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> products...|$|R
