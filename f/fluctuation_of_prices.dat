The South's lack of development and the high level of development of the North deepen the inequality between them and leave the South a source of raw material for the developed countries. The north becomes synonymous with economic development and industrialization while the South represents the previously colonized countries which are in need of help in the form of international aid agendas.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{theoretically}} and empirically demonstrate the consequences of different imputation methods, using recent data from the International Price Program. We suppose that prices are missing due to random or erratic reporting. We consider three different imputation methods: carry-forward, which just assumes that the missing price is the same as in the previous period; cell-mean, which imputes the missing price using either the short-term or long-term index for related commodities; and linear interpolation, which uses the last and next observations for the item to linearly interpolate. Certain hybrid techniques, combining either carry-forward or cell-mean with linear interpolation, are also considered. Our conclusions are: (1) Some imputation is better than no imputation; (2) the short term cell-mean introduces some "noise" into the price index: (3) linear interpolation results in less <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> than the true series: (4) combining either carry-forward or cell-mean with linear interpolation gives similar results. ...|$|E

These overruns are caused from several factors {{which are very}} important to uncover for improving the cost performance. In Malaysia, not many research works have been carried out on studying cost performance factors. Hence, this study was conducted to identify the significant factors causing cost overrun in large construction projects in Malaysia. Questionnaire for the survey was developed based on 35 common factors of cost overrun identified from literature work. These factors were grouped in 7 categories and validated by interviewing five experienced personnel of construction industry. The feedback of from the survey resulted in receiving 262 sets of completed valid responses against 400 questionnaires distributed amongst contractors, consultants and clients involved in large construction projects. The data from the questionnaire was analyzed statistically. Relative importance index method was used for hierarchal assessment of factors and found that the top 3 most significant factors of cost overrun are <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> of material, cash flow and financial difficulties faced by contractors and poor site management and supervision.

This paper briefly explains one such attempt aimed at designing an information management and a decision support system for paddy cultivation enabling both decision making authorities and farmers to make effective decision making. Using this information system the frequent <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> of products of paddy cultivation can be avoided by setting up paddy purchasing centers to purchase the excess harvest and import the shortage of such product if any, in time. At the same time the expected price of the paddy harvest can be predicted in advance before the end of each season and they can prepare for the situation coming up by adopting counter strategies. We consider a number of parameters for the harvest prediction and we develop a classification model based on a decision tree to predict the harvest. Further individual farmers ‚Äô productivity reports, reports on fertilizer subsidiary distribution and reports on tax on paddy lands are the other useful artifacts that could be generated from the system.

30|$|The {{combined}} abandonment-reforestation and abandonment-recultivation trajectories potentially provide future {{options for}} both biofuel production and cropland expansion. The Northern Eurasian region represents a great potential to boost agricultural production (Schierhorn et al. 2014), {{and also to}} provide other ecosystem services on abandoned lands. However, climate change and socio-economic and political development may substantially limit such opportunities (Meyfroidt et al. 2016). The future of some abandoned lands is uncertain due to the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> for agricultural commodities, growing interest in biofuel production, and development of national food security programs by the successors of the former Soviet Union. In some post-Soviet countries (e.g., Ukraine), land reforms are not yet completed to this date (2017), limiting recultivation of abandoned lands. Adverse demographic conditions in Eastern Europe associated with an exodus of the rural population (Nikodemus et al. 2005; Prishchepov et al. 2013) and the depopulation of rural areas in China (Liu et al. 2010) may trigger additional land abandonment. Because of limited institutional and economic ability to adapt to changing weather patterns, the increase of weather extremes represents a real threat for future agricultural production in Northern Eurasia. This may reduce the possibility to close existing yield gaps (Dronin and Kirilenko 2010; Lioubimtseva and Henebry 2012; Schierhorn et al. 2014; Horion et al. 2016). Last but not least, the observed increases in cropping intensity (de Beurs and Ioffe 2014) without adequate application of fertilizers may reduce soil fertility and diminish yields.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} an {{agent-based}} trading model based on statistical mechanics. Agents with different resource capacities set the selling prices of their resources {{in order to}} compete in the market to satisfy their demands and reduce their cost functions. The price of each agent is updated by discrete gradient descent. We also consider the effects on the market due to the inventory level, which is the level of excess resource kept by the agents to buffer fluctuations in the market. When the model parameters (such as the inventory level, average capacity and learning rate) change, phase transitions of the stable solution to unstable ones arise. Particularly, we focus on the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices,</b> demands and cost of the agents in a network in the high connectivity limit. We study how the model parameters affect the dynamical behavior of the agents by simulation. In the mean field approximation, we derive the analytical stability condition of the system. We also suggest a simplified quantitative iterative model to predict the price dynamics. The validity of the iterative model is confirmed by comparison with the simulation results. The iterative model demonstrates various interesting chaotic behaviors in systems with different model parameters. These are discussed under the framework of nonlinear dynamics. Nonlinear dynamics analyses are useful to explain the chaos in simulation results. These findings may give us insights to understand the chaos in real markets...|$|E

(Arias, 20061201) This paper discusses Fair Trade and analyses its impact on producers and producer organisations. Fair trade was developed in reaction to the situation on the market for conventional coffee. Coffee prices on the international market fluctuate sharply and have shown a decreasing trend. In 2001 prices reached their lowest level in 30 years. The decline in prices received by producers has increased rural poverty and had negative economic, social and environmental consequences. Fair Trade affects the quality of life of producers through social, organisational and environmental work and reduces the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and secures the livelihood of producers. Fair Trade is an opportunity for the most marginalised producers in the South. However, this paper also discusses the challenges of the movement.

The thesis starts by tracing the lineage {{of the concept of}} frame as part of the traditions of cybernetic anthropology, artificial intelligence, social interactionism and science and technology studies to delineate a conceptual framework that can account for the contextualisation of data. Empirically, the project focuses on two data leaks and repurposes the materials that emerged from these as case studies that render visible how different techniques and devices make possible the formation of two distinctive data types: personal data and prices. The first case study examines the making and unmaking of search keywords as personal and {{it is based on the}} materials that arose from the leak of a search engine database in 2006. This case study looks at how techniques like reidentification demonstrations and data sequencing have contributed to define search keywords as being about and capable of signalling persons while also investigating how ethical devices like informed consent and anonymisation work to depersonalise data instead. The second case study compares compositional against disaggregated framings of prices and it is based on the materials that became available as a consequence of the attempted disclosure of the databases used to estimate a national inflation indicator in Argentina since 2006.
