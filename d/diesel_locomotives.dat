5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives,</b> resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives,</b> and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E
5|$|Cargolink has a {{fleet of}} five shunters at their port in Drammen, in {{addition}} to three Di6 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> and three TRAXX electric locomotives for main haulage.

5|$|In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western {{began to}} phase out steam {{locomotives}} in favor of <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives,</b> which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, Thistle faded in importance. Gradually the town shrank in population; the passenger depot was torn down in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in Thistle.|$|E
50|$|Originally an {{electric}} token system was used, which {{was replaced by}} half automatic signal locking and finally, as the country's first children's railroad, with automatic signal locking. The <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> TU2-029 was used since 1971 and the TU2-127 since 1982. In 2009 the <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> TU7A-3351 and several new carriages were acquired and in 2011 the <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> TU10-005.|$|R

The Capitol Limited had four crew, fourteen service personnel, and 164 passengers on board.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s {{a number}} of {{heritage}} railways had been established in Victoria on closed branch lines. These railways serve both as tourist attractions, and to preserve the railway past. The work of railway preservation groups has since expanded to retired railway carriages, electric multiple units, rail motors, and <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b> In 2006 heritage railways carried 542,000 patrons over 161km of track; with 28 operational steam locomotives, 47 diesels, 14 railmotors, and 192 carriages.|$|E

5|$|DM {{eventually}} assigns {{names to}} all of its locomotives when they are repainted, usually after locations along its right-of-way, but a few exceptions have been named for people (like road number 550, named after Senator Larry Pressler). All of the first-generation <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> purchased from Chicago and North Western and Milwaukee Road have since been replaced with more recent locomotives, although the newer locomotives were also bought used.|$|E
5|$|Ross disagreed, {{reasoning}} {{this would}} only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and more. There was much at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual £48million trade surplus with Portugal, and Portuguese Railways {{was in the}} process of buying 50 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> from English Electric. In the Azores archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it.|$|E
5|$|Served by steam {{locomotives}} {{from opening}} {{until the late}} 1950s, passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel-electric multiple units built to the line's loading gauge. <b>Diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> handled freight, also built to fit the loading gauge. The diesel-electric multiple units served on the line until 1986, when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single.|$|E
50|$|Both {{trains are}} hauled by a Abu Road Loco Shed based WDM 3A <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> from Old Delhi to Jodhpur. From Jodhpur trains are hauled by a Abu Road Loco Shed based WDM 3A <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> uptil Barmer and vice versa.|$|R

25|$|A <b>diesel</b> <b>{{locomotive}}</b> {{is a type}} of railway locomotive {{in which}} the prime mover is a diesel engine. Several types of <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> have been developed, differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the driving wheels (drivers).|$|R
5|$|TFM traded 22 of the E60C-2s to GE for GE AC4400CW <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Three {{were sold}} to Texas Utilities to serve the company's Martin Lake line, {{displacing}} GE E25Bs. The E25Bs, smaller versions of the E60, had been in use since 1976. Another six went to the Black Mesa and Lake Powell, replacing its aging E60Cs. Five went to the Deseret Power Railroad. Texas Utilities discontinued electric operation in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{company had}} five Di 3 <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{and a single}} El 13 {{electric}} locomotive. Ofotbanen had 22 B3 passenger carriages, used for charter trains. These were supplemented by three two-car Class 68 electric multiple units. The 48 freight cars the company used were owned by Nord-Norsk Spedisjon. Of these, 19 were timber cars. All stock was painted dark green. All motorized stock was used stock that NSB has chosen to take out of service.|$|E
5|$|The line {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 15 July 1933. The section from Haxey Junction to Epworth was closed on 1 February 1956, {{by which time}} most of the traffic was peat, supplemented by seasonal sugar-beet. The branch to Hatfield Moors was rarely used from 1962, when small <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives</b> had replaced steam traction, and was closed on 30 September 1963. The rest of the system closed on 5 April 1965.|$|E
50|$|The train {{employs a}} <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> WDM3A (Prabal) of Lucknow Shed. In the early days, it used a <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> from Shaktinagar/Singrauli to Chunar Jn (CAR) on the UP journey and an {{electric}} locomotive from Allahabad Jn. to Chunar on the Down route.|$|R
50|$|SM03 is {{the name}} of a Polish <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> class in the PKP railway {{operator}} designation. The letters SM describe a <b>diesel</b> shunting <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{line has}} six steam {{locomotives}} for passenger trains and four <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives,</b> which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable {{at the same}} time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul. The railway also owns 23carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the route}} east of New Haven is {{electrified}} under Amtrak's 60 Hz traction power system, Shore Line East currently operates entirely with <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Once the full order of M8 railcars are in service, and Amtrak tests and approves the M8s for usage east of New Haven, ConnDOT {{plans to use}} 24 to 32 cars for electric SLE service to reduce diesel emissions. The diesel trainsets will be moved to service on the Danbury or Waterbury branches, or to the planned Hartford Line from New Haven to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of most intercity rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To operate these intercity services the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotives.</b> The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E
