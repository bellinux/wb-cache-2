40|$|ABSTRACT: Apparently no {{analytical}} method {{is available to}} analyze the bolt tension in a <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint subjected to flexure {{taking into account the}} actual stress distribution at the joint. Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that bolt tension is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition. In this paper, an investigation has been carried out to find the effects of various parameters relating to <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint connection, so that a definite guideline on determining the bolt tension can be developed. In addition, results are compared with the conventional analysis. To carry out the investigation, a <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint subjected to bending has been modeled using finite element method, which also includes contact simulation. In this analysis, shell element has been used for the modeling of <b>pipe</b> and <b>flange.</b> Non-linear spring has been used to model contact surface and bolt. Non-linear finite element method has been used to find out results till failure by yielding of pipe. Joint has been subjected to ultimate moment and under this moment; the maximum bolt tension has been evaluated. Based on the study, an attempt has been made to present a guideline to find out bolt tension that is structurally effective for a <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint. The whole process is carried out under various parametric conditions within certain range. It has been found that some parameters like flange thickness...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>flange</b> {{connections}} with gaskets in chemical plants, electric {{power plants and}} other industrial plants are usually exposed to elevated internal pressure with cyclic thermal condition. It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> {{connections with}} smaller nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress was the smallest in the restart condition. On other hand, the minimum contact gasket stress in the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection with larger nominal diameter was depending on the materials of connection. In the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection with larger nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress distributed and changed in the radial direction due to the flange rotation.

From previous comparative reliability studies of both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints, generally it is found that both the joints types are of high integrity and perform well in excellent service under appropriate installation and maintenance conditions.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{resonance}} can quickly lead to failure in vibrating bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints. Condition monitoring is performed {{time to time}} in some industries for smooth operation of a system, whereas mostly trial-and-error tests are performed to control vibration. During all this process, the inherent design problems are not considered. A bolted flange joint in piping system is not a simple problem, being the combination of flange, gasket, bolts, and washers. The success of a bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint is defined by the “static mode of load” in the joint. However, it has been recognized that a “dynamic mode of load” governs in a gasketed bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint, which leads to its failure due to flange rotation, providing flange yielding, fatigue of bolts, and gasket crushing.

This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique rivet and incorrect rivet position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe rivet. The lap shear strength of the joint with a <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet is higher than that of a joint with a conventional rivet. In this research, a <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch riveting machine. The <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet was done by DEFORM software.

Simultaneously, some riveting experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different rivet heights and chamfer angles.

The design and manufacture of a “pipe-flange connections” by use of composite materials is within the current technology. However, {{a number of major}} material challenges are questionable. This study will examine the structural design for <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections made of composite through experimentation and test results are compared with Finite Element Study. It will also identify advantages and disadvantages of this composites structure compared with the traditional materials (metals). In summary, this thesis is concerned with an experimental investigation which was conducted to study the mechanical behaviour of a <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections subjected to tensile loading. The tests have been used to verify the numerical investigation of finite element analysis. The analysis section consists of the elasticity theory, finite element study and microstructure of the composite fibres that were used to develop a model to predict the collapse loads of the pipe-flange interface. The distribution of contact stresses which governs the sealing performance of pipe-flange interface is analysed as a contact problem, using theory of elasticity. The effects of the maximum stress caused in bolts are also analysed with the aid of Finite Element Analysis. For verification, experiments are carried out. These results from the model, the analytical results, were then compared to the experimental loads results and they are satisfactorily consistent...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the gasket stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s.
