5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> defensive role, and was used more as a military prison than a military fortification. Numerous people were executed or held captive in the prison, including Cossack starshynas (officers), haidamakas, and even the three-year-old pretender to the Polish throne, Stanisław August Poniatowski.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, it was {{reported}} that the tree <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> leaves, though others suggest a date of 1913, and it was completely dead by 1915. Scots pines have a natural lifespan of up to over 700 years, depending on the region.|$|E
5|$|In taking {{leadership}} of the diocese, Archbishop Le Hunsec noted that the island of Carabane, heavily populated when trading was concentrated there, <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> influence and now had fewer than 500inhabitants. He considered transferring the mission to Oussouye, which became a reality in 1927. Starting in 1937, the mission in Oussouye also performed baptisms and funerals in Carabane.|$|E

40|$|Information {{literacy}} (IL) {{has arisen}} {{as a response}} to the reification of information. As information has been commodified, it <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> fluidity as a term and an idea. Librarianship, as a result, <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> footing, its philosophy. IL seeks to restore method to librarianship and, as a result, return subjectivity to information...|$|R
5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{across the}} world from the conflict, the Australian colonies were {{affected}} by the American Civil War both economically and by immigration. The Australian cotton crop became more important to England, which <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> American sources, and it served as a supply base for Confederate blockade runners. Immigrants from Europe seeking a better life also found Australia preferable to war-torn North America.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October, the JNA Banja Luka Corps {{initiated}} probing {{attacks in}} western Slavonia, presaging {{a major effort}} employing {{the bulk of the}} corps three days later. The advance established defensive positions just outside Novska and Nova Gradiška, and captured Jasenovac on 8 October. Lipik and a part of Pakrac were captured four days later. By that time, the JNA campaign in western Slavonia <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> momentum.|$|E

5|$|Sierra's Betrayal at Krondor (1993) {{was based}} upon author Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia setting. It {{featured}} turn-based, semi-tactical combat, a skill-based experience system, and a magic system {{similar to that of}} Dungeon Master, but suffered due to outdated, polygonal graphics. Feist was heavily consulted during development, and later created his own novelization based upon the game. The sequel Betrayal in Antara (1997) re-used the first game's engine but—as Sierra <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> license for Krondor—was set in a different universe. Return to Krondor (1998) used a new game engine, but returned to Feist's setting.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{material}} {{used to create}} the bricks for the castle was margosa limestone (a type of sedimentary rock composed of limestone and clay). The front of the castle is oriented to the east, {{and there was a}} ditch around the entire perimeter, including between the castle and the Plaza de Armas (Weapons Square). As of 2008 the building <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> parapets and shelters, but the main defensive structures and walls have been preserved. The fort housed a garrison of 250 soldiers, and was the residence of the governor of the Province of Cumaná.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was {{cancelled}} after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100million with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development. It was {{settled out of court}} by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> financial backers. Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express, Nintendo DS and L'Oréal since the age of 18.|$|E

5|$|This was Arsenal's 10th Shield {{appearance}} and Liverpool's 14th. The two clubs {{had met in}} the last game of the previous season, in a title decider at Anfield which Arsenal won 2–0 with a late goal from Michael Thomas. Both clubs also faced {{each other in the}} Makita International Tournament at Wembley the previous month; Arsenal won the match 1–0. Journalists previewing the game argued this year's Shield <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> spectacle given Liverpool's recent successes in the event as well as the prospect of Arsenal beating Liverpool for a third time.|$|E
5|$|Though {{sometimes}} productive, no {{nineteenth century}} iron mine on the Brendon Hills was profitable and the venture {{as a whole}} was financially ruinous. Furthermore, the industry {{as a whole was}} prone to boom and bust, with a sharp decline from the early 1880s. The railway continued in operation after the end of mining, although it <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> primary traffic. A second-hand Robey semi-portable steam engine was installed {{at the head of the}} incline to power the drums, hauling wagons up in the absence of a regular downhill flow.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{several groups}} were {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} relocate the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from Minneapolis, Minnesota to New Orleans, Louisiana. The proposed relocation would have been the second involving a Minneapolis-based franchise in the span of two years, as Minneapolis <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to Dallas in 1993. Timberwolves owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner were considering selling the team due to problems with the mortgage on the Target Center, the team's arena that had been built only four years earlier as part of Minneapolis' 1989 entry into the NBA. The events of the attempted relocation resulted in Glen Taylor, businessman and former Minnesota State Senator, purchasing the team and keeping it in Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, ore output was renewed in the region, briefly revitalizing Chiprovtsi {{through the}} influx of young and highly educated people. On 12 September 1968, Chiprovtsi was officially proclaimed a town by the National Assembly of Bulgaria. In Socialist times, the town had a factory that {{produced}} AK-47 magazines and employed about 400 people. After the democratic changes in 1989, mining was discontinued again {{due to a lack}} of funds, the factory was closed and the carpet industry has been in decline as it <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2014, the {{low-level}} circulation {{centre of}} Qendresa formed near Kerkennah Islands. As {{the system was}} moving north-northeastwards and combining with an upper-level low from Tunisia early on 7 November, the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically with an eye-like feature, thanks to favourable conditions. Qendresa directly hit Malta when it <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> fronts with a more well-defined eye, with ten-minute sustained winds at 110.9km/h (68.9mph) and the gust at 153.7km/h (95.5mph). The central pressure was presumed to be 978 hPa (28.88 inHg). Interacting with Sicily, the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an anticlockwise loop. On 8 November, Qendresa crossed Syracuse {{in the morning and}} then significantly weakened. Turning southeastwards then moving eastwards, Qendressa moved over Crete, before dissipating over the island on November 11.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{apparently}} {{retained its}} independence from Copán and continued to flourish {{until the beginning of}} the 9th century. Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a k'atun-ending ritual. However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre. After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the Classic Maya collapse– it <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.|$|E

5|$|The Allies had {{confidently}} {{expected that}} victory {{in a major}} set-piece battle would compel LouisXIV to accept peace on Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> validity: Villars had only to avoid defeat for a compromise peace settlement to become inevitable. In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> offensive capabilities after countless attempts {{to break the}} U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>its</b> UK title, Razer still reigned as {{champion}} of the Extreme All-Stars tournament. Its first battle to defend this title was against twice UK champion Chaos 2 and dual-spinner 13 Black. Razer and 13 Black joined forces to eliminate Chaos 2, in what was its last ever fight on Robot Wars. Razer's next battle against Spawn Again was a rematch from the series five semi-finals. Razer was again the aggressor: it repeatedly punctured Spawn Again's body panels, prompting its constructors to seek safety by driving themselves into the pit. Razer's next battle was one-on-one versus 13 Black. Following an impact with the arena wall, 13 Black stopped spinning for long enough that Razer could lift it with the arm and lower it into the pit. In the All-Stars grand final, Razer faced Firestorm4. Razer manoeuvred its wedge underneath Firestorm4, lowered the arm and immobilised its opponent. Razer was All-Stars champion {{for a second time}} running.|$|E
