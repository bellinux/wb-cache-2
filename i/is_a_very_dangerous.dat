500|$|In the Florida Panhandle, Governor Jeb Bush warned [...] "This is serious. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> storm." [...] As Bush {{announced}} {{that hundreds of}} tractor-trailers would be carrying ice, water and generators to staging areas in north central Florida, he stated [...] "Here we go again", referring to {{the large number of}} storms which had threatened Florida in the years prior to Dennis. 700,000people in the Florida panhandle were evacuated in the days prior to Dennis, 100,000of them in Escambia County alone. As a result of the large evacuations, more than 200truckloads provided about [...] of gasoline.

Then a steady pressure is achieved and held until the [...] "topping-off" [...] phase when the tanks are nearly full. Topping off <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> time in handling oil, and the procedure is handled particularly carefully. Tank-gauging equipment is used to tell the person in charge how much space is left in the tank, and all tankers {{have at least two}} independent methods for tank-gauging. As the tanker becomes full, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the pumping facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.|$|E
500|$|Small Heath {{opened their}} second {{season in the}} Football League with a visit to Walsall, who were playing at Wednesbury because their new ground was not yet ready. Former Small Heath full-back Tom Bayley {{was one of several}} {{newcomers}} for the hosts, but their visitors had few changes in personnel. Teddy Jolley came in at full-back, and replacing Billy Walton was Jack Lee, who [...] "dribbles cleverly, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> forward round goal". In the presence of 4,000 spectators, Lee scored twice as Small Heath won 3–1. Fred Wheldon opened the scoring for Small Heath in the first 30seconds of their next match, at home to Rotherham Town; 15minutes later the visitors were 3–2 ahead, but by half-time the home side had regained the lead. Unsurprisingly the tempo dropped in the second half, but a game played in a [...] "friendly and sportsmanlike spirit" [...] was marred towards the end by Rotherham forward Alf Pickering suffering a fracture of his right leg just below the knee in an accidental collision with Bernard Pumfrey, [...] "the snap of the bone being heard all round the ground". Initial reports suggested the break was such that he was [...] "almost certain" [...] never to play football again. This was followed by a comfortable 6–1 defeat of Burton Swifts, in which Jolley moved to inside right in Jack Hallam's absence through illness, giving Gilbert Smith his debut at full back.|$|E

In [...] "Trash-O-Madness", a family photograph depicts Rocko with a mother, father, and a younger sibling. [...] "Wimp On the Barby" [...] shows Rocko's family again, revealing that his younger sibling is a sister. Murray created a narcoleptic older sister character named Magdalane [...] "Maggie" [...] and an episode, [...] "Wake Up Maggie", about her, but chose to never air the episode and never use the character. Magdalane was created as a mother with two children.|$|E

2500|$|Concern about [...] {{health effects}} of tobacco has a long history. Gideon Lincecum, an American naturalist and {{practitioner}} of botanical medicine, wrote in the early 19th century on tobacco: [...] "This poisonous plant has been used a great deal as a medicine by the old school faculty, and thousands have been slain by it. ...
