A simpler version exists, most commonly found on small motorcycles and dirt bikes, where the slide and needle is directly controlled by the throttle position. The most common variable Venturi (constant depression) type carburetor is the sidedraft SU carburetor and similar models from Hitachi, Zenith-Stromberg and other makers.

These carburetors are also referred to as [...] "constant velocity" [...] or [...] "constant vacuum" [...] carburetors. An interesting variation was Ford's VV (Variable Venturi) carburetor, which was essentially a fixed Venturi carburetor with one side of the Venturi hinged and movable to give a narrow throat at low rpm and a wider throat at high rpm. This was designed to provide good mixing and airflow over a range of engine speeds, though the VV carburetor proved problematic in service.|$|E

40|$|The <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> {{angle of}} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an {{important}} parameter for determining {{the characteristics of the}} progenitor, and the information contained in the opening angle gives insight into the relativistic outflow and the total energy that is contained in the burst. Unfortunately, a confident inference of the <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angle usually requires broadband measurement of the afterglow of the GRB, from the X-ray down to the radio and from minutes to days after the prompt gamma-ray emission, which may be difficult to obtain. For this reason, very few of all detected GRBs have constrained jet angles. We present an alternative approach to derive <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angles from the prompt emission of the GRB, given that the GRB has a measurable Epeak and fluence, and which does not require any afterglow measurements. We present the distribution of derived <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angles for {{the first two years of}} the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) operation, and we compare a number of our derived opening angles to the reported opening angles using the traditional afterglow method.

Finally, we show that the use of the derived <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angles results in a tighter correlation between the rest-frame Epeak and E_γ than has previously been presented, which places long GRBs and short GRBs onto one empirical power law.

40|$|The gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{efficiency}} of converting kinetic energy into γ-rays {{is a very}} important quantity, which can potentially confirm or rule out the commonly accepted internal-shocks model. Several authors have been estimate the efficiency from the afterglow and GRB emission.

We re-consider the efficiency estimating formula, and find the usually used formula is right only for the case that the <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angle is the same during the prompt and afterglow phases. However, in fact the <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angle will enlarge increasingly from GRB phase to afterglow one due to the expanding sideways of the ejecta.

Quantitative comparisons are made of the influence of the <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angle on the above parameters of the radio knots, as would be estimated for two widely discussed variants of relativistic nuclear jets, namely, those having uniform bulk speed and those in which the bulk Lorentz factor of the flow decreases with distance from the jet axis (a `spine [...] sheath' flow). Our analysis shows that for both types of jet velocity distributions the expectation value of the jet orientation angle at first falls dramatically with increases in the (central) jet Lorentz factor, but it levels off {{at a fraction of the}} opening angle for extremely relativistic jets. We also find that the effective values of the apparent speeds and Doppler factors of the knots always decline substantially with increasing <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angle, but that this effect is strongest for ultra-relativistic jets with uniform bulk speed. We suggest that the paucity of highly superluminal parsec-scale radio components in TeV blazars can be understood if their jets are highly relativistic and, being intrinsically weaker, somewhat less well collimated, in comparison to the jets in other blazars.

The influence of the <b>jet</b> <b>opening</b> angle on these radio knot parameters are found for the usually considered types of relativistic nuclear jets: those with uniform bulk speeds and those where the bulk Lorentz factor of the flow decreases with distance from the jet axis, known as “spine–sheath” flows.
