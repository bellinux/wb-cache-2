40|$|AbstractHigher {{value of}} {{intensity}} of radiation on absorber plate of solar air heaters and effective heat removal from the plate by the carrier fluid, air, enhances thermal performance of solar air heaters. The paper deals with the experimental results of enhancing the {{intensity of radiation}} by means of booster mirrors and that of heat transfer by means of providing artificial roughness on the air flow side of the absorber plate. An enhancement in radiation of about 40 % have been found over the normal incident radiation by means of booster mirrors leading to higher rate of heat collection. The thermal performance parameters FR and F’ {{have been found to}} increase in the range of 90 % to 130 % and 92 % to 135 % respectively in comparison to those of smooth solar air <b>heaters</b> without booster <b>mirrors</b> and in the range of 10 % to 15 % in comparison to roughened solar air <b>heater</b> without booster <b>mirrors</b> for the same pressure drop due to artificial roughness within the range of the parameters investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{output port}} of GEO 600 is {{dominated}} by unwanted high order modes (HOMs). The current thermal actuation system, a ring heater {{behind one of the}} folding mirrors, causes a significant amount of astigmatism, which produces HOMs. We have built and installed an astigmatism correction system, based on heating this folding mirror at the sides (laterally). With these side heaters and the ring <b>heater</b> behind the <b>mirror,</b> it is possible to tune its radius of curvature in the horizontal and the vertical degree of freedom. We use this system to match the mirrors in the two arms of GEO 600 to each other, thereby reducing the contrast defect. The use of the side heaters reduces the power of the HOMs at the output of GEO 600 by approximately 37 %. 1...|$|R

25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included flow-through ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, day-night rearview mirror, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, electric clock, 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside <b>mirrors,</b> <b>heater</b> with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper guards, bumper tubes, and a locking gas cap, among others. Sales the two-door hardtop body style declined in 1970.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. This paper represents the results on data collected under actual outdoor conditions for artificially roughened and smooth solar air heaters with and without booster mirrors. The {{results show that the}} effect of boosting of solar radiation is appreciable and consequently, the thermal efficiency of the roughened collectors with booster mirrors increases further over the roughened ones without any further increase in the pressure drop over that in the roughened ones. The values of the collector heat removal factor and collector efficiency factor of roughened solar air <b>heaters</b> with booster <b>mirrors</b> have been found to increase by 12. 6 % and 11. 9 % respectively over the roughened ones without booster mirrors and 45. 6 % and 46. 5 % respectively over the smooth ones with booster mirrors and 144. 1 % and 141 % respectively over the smooth ones. For a given value of relative roughness height of 0. 022 and relative roughness pitch of 15,the value of thermal performance of roughened collector with booster mirror and without booster mirror have been found out to be about 54 % and 46 % respectively. A maximum of 1. 865 % of uncertainty in the value of thermal performance have been found. Such solar air heaters are thermally useful quantitatively and qualitatively both...|$|R
40|$|Atomic {{gyroscopes}} have {{a potential}} for good performance advantages and several attempts are being made to miniaturize them. This thesis describes the efforts made in implementing a Folded MEMS based NMRG. The micro implementations of all the essential components for NMRG (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Gyroscope) are described in detail in regards to their design, fabrication, and characterization. A set of micro-scale Helmholtz coils are described and the homogeneity of the generated magnetic field is analyzed for different designs of <b>heaters.</b> The dielectric <b>mirrors</b> and metallic mirrors are compared in terms of reflectivity and polarization change up on reflection. A pyramid shaped folded backbone structure is designed, fabricated, and assembled {{along with all the}} required components. A novel double-folded structure 1 / 4 th the size of original version is fabricated and assembled. Design and modeling details of a 5 layered shield with shielding factor > 10 ^ 6 and total volume of around 90 cc are also presented. A table top setup for characterization of atomic vapor cell is described in detail. A micro vapor cell based Rb magnetometer with a sensitivity of 108 pT/√Hz is demonstrated. The challenges due to DC heating are addressed and mitigated using an AC heater. Several experiments related to measuring the relaxation time of Xe are provided along with results.

40|$|The Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) {{preliminary}} design concept {{consists of an}} 8 meter diameter monolithic primary mirror enclosed in an insulated, optical tube with stray light baffles and a sunshade. ATLAST will be placed in orbit about the Sun-Earth L 2 and will experience constant exposure to the sun. The insulation on the optical tube and sunshade serve to cold bias the telescope which helps to minimize thermal gradients. The primary mirror will be maintained at 280 K with an active thermal control system. The geometric model of the primary mirror, optical tube, sun baffles, and sunshade was developed using Thermal Desktop(R) SINDA/FLUINT(R) {{was used for the}} thermal analysis and the radiation environment was analyzed using RADCAD(R). A XX node model was executed in order to characterize the static performance and thermal stability of the mirror during maneuvers. This is important because long exposure observations, such as extra-solar terrestrial planet finding and characterization, require a very stable observatory wave front. Steady state thermal analyses served to predict mirror temperatures for several different sun angles. Transient analyses were performed in order to predict thermal time constant of the primary mirror for a 20 degree slew or 30 degree roll maneuver. This paper describes the thermal model and provides details of the geometry, thermo-optical properties, and the environment which influences the thermal performance. All assumptions that were used in the analysis are also documented. Parametric analyses are summarized for design parameters including primary mirror coatings and sunshade configuration. Estimates of <b>mirror</b> <b>heater</b> power requirements are reported. The thermal model demonstrates results for the primary mirror heated from the back side and edges using a heater system with multiple independently controlled zones...|$|R
