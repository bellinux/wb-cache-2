We discuss {{the formulation of}} several alternative multiscale models for a <b>drum</b> <b>granulator.</b> All combine a vessel scale population balance model with a granule scale discrete element method (DEM) model, but they are linked using different multiscale integration frameworks.

For the agglomeration tests, a laboratory <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> and a balling disc were utilized.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the influence of process variables on granulation of ordinary super phosphate. The experiments were performed in a drum with an internal volume of 25 l and the evaluated variables were rotation speed, liquid phase, granulation time and fill level of the <b>drum</b> <b>granulator.</b> Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to choose the experimental conditions. The correlation between data and process variables was established using Multiple Regression. The granulation products were analyzed using standard separators and the Haver CPA photo-optical particle size measurement system. The tendency toward granulation and formation of coarse or fines could be predicted according to the specific surface of the granulation product and the granulation size distribution was found to be greatly dependent on the variable studies...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of wet granulation {{in a continuous}} granulator is carried out using Discrete Element Method (DEM) to discover the possibility of formation of seeded granules in a continuous process {{with the aim of}} reducing number of experimental trials and means of process control. Simple and scooped <b>drum</b> <b>granulators</b> are utilized to attain homogenous seeded granules in which the effects of drum rotational speed, particles surface energy, and particles size ratio are investigated. To reduce the simulation time a scale-up scheme is designed in which a dimensionless number (Cohesion number) is defined {{based on the work of}} cohesion and gravitational potential energy of the particles. Also a mathematical/numerical method along with a MATLAB code is developed by which the percentage of surface coverage of each granule is predicted precisely. The results show that use of continuous granulator is promising provided that a high level of shear is considered in the granulator design, e. g. it is observed that using baffles inside the <b>drum</b> <b>granulators</b> is essential for producing seeded granules. It is observed, moreover, that the optimum surface energy for scooped granulator with rotational speed of 50 rpm is 3 J/m 2 which is close to the number predicted by Cohesion number. It is also shown that increasing the seed/fine size ratio enhances the seeded granulation both quantitatively (60 % increase in seeds surface coverage) and qualitatively (more homogeneous granules) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{is focused on}} the iron ores {{granulation}} process in a laboratory-scale batch <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> using water as a binder, and on the investigation of the influence of raw material properties (morphology and wettability of the primary particles) on its kinetics. Nowadays processing of iron ores often requires a modification of particle size by means of granulation in order to improve further processability. A comparison of the granulation behaviour of three types of iron ores (magnetite, hematite and goethite) has been carried out. The wettability of the powders has been characterised by contact angle measurement. The results confirm the hydrophobic and hydrophilic characters of magnetite and goethite respectively. The granulation kinetics (evolution of particle size distribution as a function of time) of each type of iron ores was measured. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{a dynamic}} model is {{presented}} for the granulation process, employing a three-dimensional Population balance framework. As a {{first attempt to}} account for the multi-scale character of the process, the nucleation and aggregation kernels used in the population balance model are derived using mechanistic representations of the underlying particle physics such as wetting kinetics and energy dissipation effects. Thus, the fundamental properties of the powder and the liquid were used as parameters in the model to predict the granulator dynamics and granule properties. The population balance model is validated against experimental data from a calcite/PVOH-H 2 O recipe obtained using a lab-scale <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> for granule size, fractional binder content and porosity. A reasonably good agreement between experimental and simulation results were obtained for the granule size distribution under different experimental conditions. In addition, accurate model predictions were made for the evolution of the average properties (i. e., size, fractional binder content and porosity) for various operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{nucleation}} {{model that}} includes nuclei breakage/fragmentation is proposed. The model {{is based on}} the nucleation model of Hapgood and the Stokes deformation number calculated from the granule dynamic yield strength from the previously reported granule breakage work. It is proposed that breakage or fragmentation of primary nuclei from binder spray will occur if the Stokes deformation number exceeds a certain critical number. In the case where breakage occurs the model for secondary nuclei size distribution is proposed. To validate the model, the characteristics of the primary nuclei formed from nickel laterite ores with diluted sulphuric solutions as a binder were investigated. The nuclei were produced by dropping the binder solution onto a stationary powder bed. The mechanical integrity of the primary nuclei formed, the relationship between the nuclei diameter and binder drop diameter were studied. The Stokes deformation numbers for nickel laterite powders with different particle size in a lab scale <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> were calculated and the nuclei size distributions with different nickel laterite feed powders are predicted...|$|E

The knowledge base of the system is organized in a hierarchical way following the hierarchy levels of the multi-scale model of the process system. This supports the focusing of the fault detection and loss prevention and thus decomposes the otherwise computationally hard problem.

40|$|In modern ironmaking, {{granulation}} is {{the first}} step of the sintering process. It is typically carried out in continuous drum granulators using water as a binder, and involves multiple components besides iron ores, such as return fines and other recycled materials (dusts, mill scale, sludges), solid fuel (coke breeze or anthracite) and fluxes (limestone, lime, olivine, dunite or dolomite) (Ball, 1973). As it is necessary to maintain a consistent quality of the granules (size distribution, porosity, strength, etc.) despite of the varying iron ore origins, the question arises as to how the properties of the iron ore particles (size and shape) influence the granulation process. The granulation process is partly influenced by the characteristic of the feed and partly by the action of cohesive force inside the <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> (Newitt et al. 1958). The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the effect of raw material properties on the kinetics of iron ore granulation considering in particular the mechanisms ruling wet granulation for two iron ores and to know the factors which determine the texture, shape, porosity and mechanical strength of the granules...|$|E
30|$|Drum {{granulation}} {{of three}} different formulations for pot trials were carried out. Urea was ground into a powder and hand-mixed in weight ratios urea to wet coal of 1 : 3 (i.e. high N urea-brown coal blend, hereafter referred to as UBC-H) and 1 : 10 (low N urea-brown coal blend, UBC-L). A third formulation contained no urea. Some additional water {{was used as a}} binder in the granulation process. For batches made with urea, 500 ¬†g of wet coal was used with the appropriate addition of urea. The coal only batch used 1500 ¬†g of wet coal and additional water. The granulation was carried out in a stainless steel <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> with an internal diameter of 37 ¬†cm. The drum speed was set at 34 ¬†rpm. Granulation of coal with urea occurred very quickly, in less than 10 ¬†min; the product granules appeared very wet on the surface. Granulation of coal alone typically took 45 ‚Äì 60 ¬†min. Granules were air dried for at least 72 ¬†h at ambient conditions. Product granules with a typical size of 4 ¬†mm were used for further pot trials.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDynamic process {{simulators}} {{are widely}} used in the chemical and petrochemical industries for operator training, plant design, and optimization; {{but there is a}} lack of rigorous simulators in the phosphate fertilizer industry. Some of the many difficulties encountered in phosphate fertilizer simulation include: lack of knowledge of thermodynamic properties, presence of many phases (gas, liquid, and solids), high levels and variation of impurities in phosphate rock producing unknown effects, complexity in modeling particle size distribution, etc. Dynamic training simulators were successfully developed for sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, and DAP production units of OCP Group's Jorf Lasfar complex using a commercial simulation platform. A new thermodynamic property package was developed for sulphuric acid and oleum to correctly predict vapor pressure, density, enthalpy, and SO 2 solubility. Also, a rotary <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> was developed to consider the reaction chemistry of DAP production and the stochastic nature of solids created. The granulator can accurately predict particle size distribution, moisture content, ammonia and dust losses, and gas/solid temperatures. It was shown that the simulators could precisely reproduce control room and field operations to model plant start-ups, emergency or normal shutdowns, process upsets, and normal operations...|$|E
30|$|Granulation is a size {{enlargement}} process, where fine particles are agglomerated into larger granules [16]. Methods of granulating coal dust {{have been investigated}} {{as a means to}} reduce losses and optimise the use of this resource and more recently, the potential of improving the handling properties of brown coal has been investigated [17]. During the granulation process a binder is often required to enable the particles to adhere and form larger particles. In the case of brown coal, it has been found that the water contained within the pores of the coal structure provides most of the binder requirements for the granulation process to occur. As the brown coal particles are subjected to mechanical forces within the <b>granulator</b> <b>drum,</b> the inherent water is forced {{to the surface of the}} particle and is available as binder. Additional binder may be required, depending on the brown coal used and the desired properties, such as particle strength, of the final granules. After granulation the brown coal granules still contain water that must be removed to reduce transportation cost, although the location of some of the inherent water has moved from the interior of the coal particle to the surface of the coal granules.|$|R
40|$|Batch {{granulation}} {{experiments on}} a lab-scale <b>drum</b> <b>granulator</b> for a Calcite/Polyvinyl alcohol in water (Calcite/PVOH‚ÄìH 2 O) system {{are presented in}} this study. Experimental {{studies were carried out}} to study the aggregation kinetics and mechanism for this granulation recipe, whilst investigating the effects of binder-to-solids ratio and drum load on the granule size, binder content and porosity distributions. In particular, the effect of formulation properties and the granulation operating conditions on the batch process dynamics and the end-granule properties are studied. The formulation properties considered include liquid surface tension, powder-liquid contact angle, dynamic yield stress, powder shape and liquid viscosity. The operating variables include the binder-to-solids ratio, binder addition duration and the binder addition mode. The sensitivity in the process and the non-homogeneity of key particle attributes (size, binder content, and porosity) is evident. The important process manipulations for feedback control and potential disturbances are identified, formulating a comprehensive control configuration for batch and continuous granulation, with the latter case being exemplified in Glaser et al. [T., Glaser, C. F. W., Sanders, F. Y., Wang, I. T., Cameron, R., Ramachandran, J. D., Litster, J. M. -H., Poon, C. D., Immanuel, F. J. Doyle, III, 2007. Model predictive control of drum granulation. Manuscript in preparation. ]. The importance of multi-scale process models that link fundamental material properties with the granulation mechanisms and end-granule properties is also evident from the experiments. A three-dimensional population balance equation structure in terms of the particle size, binder content and porosity is confirmed to be an ideal framework for the process model...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{fine coal}} {{recovery}} and characteristic improvement are attracting increasing attention. To exemplify this attention this thesis reports {{an investigation into}} the application of a size enlargement process to fine coal preparation. The application of this process was considered appropriate to overcome the existing problems associated with the storage and flow of fine coal. In particular this investigation aimed to identify the requirements for and characteristics of granulated fine coal produced from coal washery waste using a <b>drum</b> <b>granulator.</b> To this end this investigation included the examination of techniques to produce suitable granulator feed, the variables affecting granule strength and characteristics, the identification of optimal binders and additive addition rates, assessment of granule characteristics and an economic assessment of the process. Of particular concern was the assessment of the storage and flow properties of the granulated product. In this investigation, which utilized the pilot plant scale feed preparation and granulation test facility at the University of Wollongong, it was found that a saleable high quality product could be generated at high recovery rates. The production of this product required classifying the waste coal slurry at 75 Œºm by use of a hydrocyclone and processing the underflow and overflow by froth flotation and oil agglomeration processes, respectively. This processed material, when dried to about 18 % moisture content and mixed with suitable binders, produced granules of adequate mechanical strength and durability. The latter mechanical strength and durability was assessed by measurement of granule compressive strength, impact strength, standard properties including density and particle size, flowability as assessed using a Durham Cone tester, water immersion testing, friability or abrasion resistance and dustiness. In particular it was identified that strong and stable granules could be produced by the addition of 1. 5 % guar gum or 1 % guar gum + 0. 5 % bentonite. It is subsequently shown that these granules have superior properties relative to those exhibited by the source fine coal. In addition it is found that the granules possess sufficient strength and durability to withstand the stresses imposed during storage, handling and transportation. This investigation identifies that optimum feed conditions result in optimum granule size which in turn yields optimum granule characteristics. In particular when using guar gum binder optimum granules have good characteristics including relatively low water disintegration, low friability or high abrasion resistance, low dustiness and insensitivity to ambient humidity. These characteristics are further improved by optimum bentonite addition rate. These favourable characteristics in combination with the suggested favourable process economics suggest that granulation be applied to actual coal preparation plants. Such application will attract long term economic, environmental and utilization benefits. The full scale application of which warrants further investigation...|$|E
