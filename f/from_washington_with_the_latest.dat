50|$|Aside from {{drafting}} Ponder, the Vikings {{also had}} to deal with a highly unpopular league lockout that lasted from March to July. As soon as it ended, unrestricted free agents Tarvaris Jackson and Sidney Rice both found new homes in Seattle.

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1997, Young and a friend, Justin Samuel, set off <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plan to release animals from fur farms in the Midwest {{on their way to}} Florida. A two-week period in October saw the release of at least 8,000 mink and fox from six fur farms in Iowa, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{destruction}} of the breeding records at each farm. On October 28, police officers pulled over Young and Samuel in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, after officers received a call from fur farmers who suspected that the two were surveying farms. Their vehicle was impounded, and a search warrant application was granted the following day. The search of their vehicle yielded animal rights literature, fur farm addresses, and other suspicious items.|$|R
50|$|The {{allegation}} {{made some}} 12 years later during a Parliamentary Select Committee Inquiry established in March 2003 to again {{look into the}} murder of Dr Ouko, that Dr Ouko had been banished by President Moi whilst on the visit to Washington, stripped of his ministerial rank, sent home on a different flight, his bodyguards dismissed, his passport removed on arrival in Nairobi, would also seem to be without foundation. Passenger manifests and witness testimony prove that Dr Ouko travelled back <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Kenyan delegation to Nairobi. The delegation's return was a public event reported by the Kenyan media and newspaper reports, which are still available, carried photographs of President Moi and Dr Ouko {{coming out of the}} plane together and doing the welcoming rounds at Jomo Kenyatta airport.|$|R
5000|$|The mansion was {{the site}} of General George G. Meade's {{takeover}} of command of the Army of the Potomac of the Union Army from General Joseph Hooker immediately before the Battle of Gettysburg, under last-minute orders from President Abraham Lincoln. Hooker had been defeated by General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville, in Virginia, a few weeks earlier. A messenger had been sent out <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new orders but the courier had difficulty finding the command headquarters in the night. A large rectangular carved granite boulder from the Gettysburg battlefield engraved <b>with</b> details of <b>the</b> historical event was placed on the northeast corner of the property near the entrance driveway.

5000|$|Yerger's conservatives, who {{stressed}} States' rights, {{replaced the}} former Black and Tan contingent, which had governed the state party <b>from</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., <b>with</b> <b>the</b> African-American lawyer Perry Wilbon Howard {{as the national}} committeeman and the past dispenser of the limited federal patronage in the state. At the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Howard led an all-black delegation pledged not to Eisenhower, but U.S. Senator Robert A.

5000|$|In 1993 the Navy allowed studio {{executives}} {{researching the}} movie to embark aboard Trident submarine [...] <b>from</b> Bangor, <b>Washington,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Gold Crew. Those embarked included Hollywood Pictures president Ricardo Mestres, director Tony Scott, producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, screenwriter Micheal Schiffer, and writer Richard Henrick. While aboard, the Navy allowed the film crew to videotape the Floridas Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander William Toti, performing {{many of the same}} actions (Executive Officer's response to fire, flooding, missile launch sequence, etc.) that actor Denzel Washington eventually performed as Executive Officer in the movie. Washington's remarkably accurate portrayal of a Trident submarine Executive Officer in the movie may have been due to the fact he studied these videotapes of Toti to prepare for the role.|$|R

50|$|The Union {{assembled}} {{an army of}} 35,000 men (the {{largest ever}} seen in North America up to that point) {{under the command of}} General Irvin McDowell. With great fanfare, these untrained soldiers set out <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> DC <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea that they would capture Richmond in six weeks and put a quick end to the conflict. At the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, however, disaster ensued as McDowell's army was completely routed and fled back to the nation's capitol. Major General George McClellan of the Union was put in command of the Army of the Potomac following the battle on July 26, 1861. He began to reconstruct the shattered army {{and turn it into a}} real fighting force, as it became clear that there would be no quick, six-week resolution of the conflict. Despite pressure from the White House, McClellan did not move until March 1862, when the Peninsular Campaign began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> purpose of capturing the capitol of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia. It was initially successful, but in the final days of the campaign, McClellan faced strong opposition from Robert E. Lee, the new commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. From June 25 to July 1, in a series of battles known as the Seven Days Battles, Lee forced the Army of the Potomac to retreat. McClellan was recalled to Washington and a new army assembled under the command of John Pope.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of June 27, Lincoln sent orders {{relieving}} Hooker. Hooker had argued with Halleck about defending the garrison at Harpers Ferry and petulantly offered to resign, which Halleck and Lincoln promptly accepted. George Meade, a Pennsylvanian who was commanding the V Corps, was ordered to assume command of the Army of the Potomac early {{on the morning of}} June 28 in Frederick, Maryland. Meade was surprised by the change of command order, having previously expressed his lack of interest in the army command. In fact, when an officer <b>from</b> <b>Washington</b> woke him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> order, he assumed he was being arrested for some transgression. Despite having little knowledge of what Hooker's plans had been or the exact locations of the three columns moving quickly to the northwest, Meade kept up the pace. He telegraphed to Halleck, in accepting his new command, that he would [...] "Move toward the Susquehanna, keeping Washington and Baltimore well covered, and if the enemy is checked in his attempt to cross the Susquehanna or if he turns toward Baltimore, to give him battle." ...|$|R
