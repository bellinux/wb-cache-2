500|$|In 2014, Olander told The Arizona Republic {{that the}} group was no longer signed to Word Records and planned to release new {{material}} independently. [...] "I will say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of the material, but maybe it's not the best version of Diamond Rio," [...] Olander told the publication. [...] "We were kind of in a no-man's land. We didn't fit in with country radio and we didn't fit with Christian radio. It was something that wasn't fully realized." [...] The band began releasing records independently, starting with a live album in 2014 and following in 2015 with the studio album I Made It.|$|E
500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E

500|$|During the tour, filmmaker Baz Luhrmann {{commissioned}} Radiohead {{to write}} a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: [...] "When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt [...]45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately." [...] Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape {{the direction of the}} rest of the album; Yorke said it [...] "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin—something <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the sixth}} season the {{development}} of the character was praised, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy.", in addition to praising Pompeo's performance. In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote [...] "I felt for Meredith, but after Lexie's heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside. Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of her for giving up part of her liver—her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone." [...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received among television critics. Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that Perry's character was [...] "the {{man of the}} hour", in addition to praising Pompeo's performance, writing: [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." [...] Diaz also called Yang not having a surgery [...] "hilarious", and praised the chemistry between Ramirez's and Capshaw's characters. PopSugar called {{the title of the}} episode appropriate, and also praised Pompeo's performance, adding: [...] "I felt for Meredith, but after Lexie's heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside.

[...] PopSugar also enjoyed Oh's performance, commenting that they enjoyed her [...] "vulnerable" [...] side, and writing that overall the episode felt [...] "lackluster".

500|$|According to the 25th Infantry Division's Tropic Lightning Museum, 14 {{different}} American {{pilots were}} able to take off during the surprise attack and record 10 Japanese aircraft kills. Air Corps records credit Welch with four kills and Taylor with two, yet new research of Japanese combat reports confirms Taylor got four kills (when the two probable kills are included). Taylor claimed in an interview: [...] "I know for certain I shot down two planes or perhaps more; I don't know." [...] On the 13th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States Air Force stated that they could not determine which of the two pilots shot down the first Japanese bomber: [...] "Each of them in his first attack shot down an enemy bomber, so the difference in time would have been but a few seconds in any case." [...] While in the air during the dogfight, the two pilots agreed that whoever survived the battle would claim credit to the title for the first kill. However, both pilots survived and because Welch outranked Taylor (he was a 41A, Taylor a 41C) and was the lead aircraft in the fight, he was credited with the first kill. The efforts of the two pilots’ dogfights {{were able to}} divert the Japanese from destroying the Haleiwa air field, which the Japanese intelligence did not know about prior to the attack. Taylor later reacted to the attack, saying [...] "I believed I was a better-trained pilot than the enemy. I had good equipment, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two {{hit it off}} and {{discussed}} putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979. According to Iyall, the name Romeo Void referred to [...] "a lack of romance" [...] and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline [...] "Why single women can't get laid in San Francisco." [...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the company was}} {{preparing}} to stage Agnes de Mille's Rodeo, or The Courting at Burnt Ranch, an early example of balletic Americana. One day, de Mille suggested that Tallchief change her name. It was a sensitive subject for Tallchief–Dunham had previously suggested Tallchief change her surname to a Russian-sounding name such as Tallchieva, a practice common among ballet dancers at the time. She refused: [...] "Tallchief was my name, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of it." [...] However, de Mille had a more acceptable idea– using {{a modified version of}} her middle name. Tallchief agreed and was known as Maria Tallchief for the remainder of her career.|$|E

2500|$|Lambert's {{association}} with Thames and Euston Films {{continued into the}} 1980s. In 1982, she rejoined the staff of parent company Thames Television as Director of Drama, and was given {{a seat on the}} company's board. In November 1982 she left Thames, but remained as Chief Executive at Euston until leaving in November of the following year to take up her first post in the film industry, as Director of Production for Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment. Her job here was somewhat frustrating as the British film industry was in one of its periodic states of flux, but she did produce several feature films, including Clockwise (1986). Lambert later expressed some regret on her time in the film industry in a feature for The Independent newspaper. [...] "Unfortunately, the person who hired me left, and the person who came in didn't want to produce films and didn't want me. While I managed to make some films <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of — Dennis Potter's Dreamchild, and Clockwise with John Cleese — it was terribly tough and not a very happy experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the seven}} years after she {{graduated}} college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: [...] "My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing stupid things with my life, {{and they told me}} so. I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'" [...] As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, she was able to make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond.|$|E

[...] "Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though I thought we were making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>proud</b> of what we did."

I wanted to keep that going, I never want to let that go.
