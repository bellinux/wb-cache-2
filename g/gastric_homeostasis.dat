40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the restorative effect of Pterocarpus erinaceus (P. erinaceus) and homopterocarpin, an isoflavonoid isolated from it, on indomethacin-induced disruption in <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis</b> in rats. MethodsAdult rats {{were divided into}} five groups and fasted for 48 h before treatment. Group 1 received olive oil (vehicle), group 2 received 25 mg/kg indomethacin while groups 3 – 5 received cimetidine (100 mg/kg), homopterocarpin (25 mg/kg) and P. erinaceus ethanolic stem bark extract (100 mg/kg) respectively. After 1 h, all the groups except group 2 were administered 25 mg/kg of indomethacin. One hour later, the rats were sacrificed and the ulcer index and other gastroprotective indices were evaluated. ResultsIndomethacin caused significant injury to the stomach of the rats {{as reflected in the}} ulcer indices (9. 0 ± 1. 4) as compared with that of control (2. 0 ± 0. 0). Equally, there were significant increases in gastric acid concentration and malondialdehyde level in the stomachs of the ulcerated animals compared with the control. However mucus content, reduced gluthatione level and gastric pH were significantly reduced in the ulcerated animals compared with the control. Pretreatment with either Pterocarpus bark extract or homopterocarpin reversed the effects of indomethacin on the evaluated parameters. ConclusionsThese results indicate that both homopterocarpin and Pterocarpus extract offered gastroprotection against indomethacin-induced ulcer by antioxidative mechanism and the modulation of <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> The results also suggest that homopterocarpin might be responsible for, or contribute to the antiulcerogenic property of P. erinaceus...|$|E
40|$|Gastric polyps {{are found}} in 1 % to 4 % of {{patients}} undergoing gastroscopy. The vast majority are sporadic, but some gastric polyps indicate an underlying syndrome. Gastric polyps can manifest {{in each of the}} gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes, including the recently described gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach syndrome. In addition, gastric polyps occur in Lynch syndrome and in a few rare conditions that are not primarily gastrointestinal. While some of these syndromes are clearly associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, others are not. Interestingly, even in disorders with a well-established risk of gastric cancer, the neoplastic potential and the precursor status of these gastric polyps are not always clear. Although rare, recognition of syndromic gastric polyps is important for individual patient management.

40|$|The {{integrity}} of gastric barrier {{derives from the}} balance between defending and damaging factors. In particular, prostaglandins play a relevant role in the maintenance of <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and prevention of peptic disease, at different levels. Omega- 3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentanoic acid, are the precursors of the third series of prostaglandins (with anti-inflammatory properties), also reducing {{the formation of the}} second series of prostaglandins (pro-inflammatory ones). Such a pathophysiological rationale brought to the experimental application, both in animal models and, more recently, in humans, of omega- 3 fatty acids against gastrointestinal damage. Omega- 3 fatty acids have shown interesting results in preventing different types of gastric damage in mouse models. A large retrospective case-control study on patients taking both anti-thrombotic therapy and eicosapentanoic acid showed (although only at unadjusted analysis) an inverse correlation between consumption of eicosapentanoic acid and gastrointestinal injury. Prospective, well-designed, comparative studies are warranted to clarify if omega- 3 fatty acids may represent, or not, a novel resort against gastrointestinal injury...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gastric</b> mucosal <b>homeostasis</b> {{requires}} rapid alarm {{of protective}} mechanisms {{in the face}} of pending injury. This article summarizes the evidence that spinal afferent neurons monitor insults to the gastric mucosa and activate local mechanisms of defense and repair through release of transmitter peptides from their endings in the stomach. Nowhere else in the digestive system is the mucosa more endangered than in the gastroduodenal region, where it faces potential injury by noxious chemicals of endogenous and exogenous origin. Most tissues would rapidly disintegrate if exposed to the concentrations of HCl that bathe but do not harm the gastric surface epithelium. This is because a multitude of structural and physiological factors, collectively forming the gastric mucosal barrier, prevent hydrogen ions and other molecules from entering the tissue in quantities that produce cell damage. Although autonomic neurons have long been recognized to influence gastric mucosal defense against injury, the possibility that neurons constitute a rapid alarm system {{in the face of}} pending injury was hardly thought of. In particular, nociceptive afferent neurons that innervate the stomach and whose role it is to monitor tissue damage and in turn activate mechanisms of protection have been little considered until recently. This neglect of sensory neurons is understandable, though, if judged against the multiple innervation of the gut by intrinsic enteric neurons and extrinsic autonomic and afferent neurons, which has made a dissection of the specific roles played by afferent neurons very difficult. Capsaicin as a probe for nociceptive neuron functions in the stomach The discovery that sensory neurons contribute to <b>gastric</b> mucosal <b>homeostasis</b> resulted from exploitation of a neuropharmacological trait that differentiates them from other neurons (3).

Epidermal growth factor-related growth factors are important modulators of <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis</b> in normal and damaged gastrointestinal mucosa. To evaluate expression of heparin binding epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin in antral mucosa of Helicobacter pylori-infected and non-infected dyspeptic patients and to correlate levels of heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin mRNA with mitogenic activity of gastric epithelial cells. A total of 10 Helicobacter pylori-infected and 15 Helicobacter pylori non-infected (10 with and 5 without gastritis) dyspeptic patients were studied. Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection was based on rapid urease test and histology. Heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin mRNA expression in antral mucosa were assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression and localization of both peptides were determined by immunohistochemistry. Mitogenic activity of antral gastric mucosa was assessed by determination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen labelling index by immunohistochemistry. Heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin mRNA expression increased in Helicobacter pylori-infected vs Helicobacter pylori non-infected patients. Heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin immunostaining was more intense and deeper in gastric gland compartment in infected mucosa than in non-infected mucosa. Increase in heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin mRNA expression significantly correlated with increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen labelling index. Helicobacter pylori gastritis is associated with up-regulation of heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin which correlates with increased mitogenic activity of gastric mucosa. Increased heparin binding-epidermal growth factor and amphiregulin expression is postulated to contribute to reparative response of gastric mucosa to Helicobacter pylori infection...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter heilmannii is a {{zoonotic}} bacterium {{that has been}} associated with gastric disease in humans. In this study, the mRNA expression of mucins in the stomach of BALB/c mice was analyzed at several time points during a 1 -year infection with this bacterium, during which gastric disease progressed in severity. Markers for acid production by parietal cells and mucous metaplasia were also examined. In the first 9 weeks postinfection, the mRNA expression of Muc 6 was clearly upregulated in both the antrum and fundus of the stomach of H. heilmannii-infected mice. Interestingly, Muc 13 was upregulated already at 1 day postinfection in the fundus of the stomach. Its expression level remained high in the stomach {{over the course of the}} infection. This mucin is, however, not expressed in a healthy stomach, and high expression of this mucin has so far only been described in gastric cancer. In the later stages of infection, mRNA expression of H+/K+-ATPase alpha/beta and KCNQ 1 decreased, whereas the expression of Muc 4, Tff 2, Dmbt 1, and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) increased starting at 16 weeks postinfection onwards, suggesting the existence of spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia in the fundus of the stomach. Mucous metaplasia present in the mucosa surrounding low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma-like lesions was also histologically confirmed. Our findings indicate that H. heilmannii infection causes severe gastric pathologies and alterations in the expression pattern of gastric mucins, such as Muc 6 and Muc 13, as well as disrupting <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis</b> by inducing the loss of parietal cells, resulting in the development of mucous metaplasia...|$|E
40|$|The human stomach {{normally}} contains {{high levels}} of bioactive nitric oxide (NO). This NO derives from salivary nitrate (NO 3 -) that is converted to nitrite (NO 2 -) by oral bacteria and thereafter non-enzymatically reduced in the acidic gastric lumen to NO. Nitrate is a common component in vegetables, and after ingestion it is absorbed in the small intestine. Interestingly, circulating nitrate is then concentrated by the salivary glands. Hence, intake of nitrate-rich vegetables results in {{high levels of}} NO in the stomach. The physiological effects of the high concentration of NO gas normally present in the gastric lumen have been hitherto unknown, and the present investigations were therefore conducted to address this issue. NO produced in the gastric lumen after nitrate ingestion increased gastric mucosal blood flow and {{the thickness of the}} firmly adherent mucus layer in the stomach. The blood flow and mucus layer are essential defense mechanisms that protect the mucosa from luminal acid and noxious agents. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are commonly prescribed and effective drugs for treating pain and inflammation, but are associated with severe gastrointestinal side effects. We demonstrated that a nitrate-rich diet protects against NSAID-induced gastric damage, {{as a result of the}} increased formation of NO in the stomach. We also showed that the gastroprotective effect attributed to nitrate depended completely on conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the bacterial flora colonizing the tongue, and that the oral microflora is therefore important in regulating physiological conditions in the stomach. In summary, this thesis challenges the current dogma that nitrate intake is hazardous, and on the contrary suggests that dietary nitrate plays a direct role in regulating <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> It is likely that a sufficient supply of nitrate in the diet together with the oral microflora is essential for preventing pathological conditions in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|E

40|$|The gastric {{epithelium}} is {{sustained by}} {{a population of}} stem cells that replenish the various mature epithelial lineages throughout adulthood. Regulation of stem and progenitor cell proliferation occurs via basic developmental signaling pathways, including the Notch pathway, which recently was described to promote gastric stem cell proliferation in both mice and human beings. Current cancer theory proposes that adult stem cells that maintain gastrointestinal tissues accumulate mutations that promote cancerous growth, and that basic signaling pathways, such as Notch, which stimulate stem cell proliferation, can promote tumorigenesis. Accordingly, constitutive Notch activation leads to unchecked cellular proliferation and gastric tumors in genetic mouse models. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence suggesting that the Notch pathway may be activated in some human gastric cancers, supporting a potential role for Notch in gastric tumorigenesis. In this review, we first summarize the current understanding of gastric stem cells defined by genetic mouse studies, followed by discussion of the literature regarding Notch pathway regulation of gastric stem cell function in the mouse and human beings. Notch action to maintain <b>gastric</b> epithelial cell <b>homeostasis</b> and the cellular consequences of dysregulated signaling to promote tumorigenesis are discussed, including studies associating Notch activation with human gastric cancer.

Instillation of 20 % ethanol (1 [*]ml, p. o.) effectively protected against gastric mucosal injury induced by subsequent instillation of 70 % or 96 % ethanol (1 [*]ml, p. o.). Oral administration of indomethacin (1. 25 – 20 [*]mg kg− 1) dose-dependently counteracted the protective effect of 20 % ethanol (ID 50 : 3. 5 [*]mg kg− 1). Likewise, NS- 398 (0. 1 – 1 [*]mg kg− 1), L- 745, 337 (0. 2 – 2 [*]mg kg− 1) and DFU (0. 02 – 0. 2 [*]mg kg− 1) inhibited the protective effect of 20 % ethanol in a dose-dependent manner with ID 50 values of 0. 3 [*]mg kg− 1, 0. 4 [*]mg kg− 1 and 0. 06 [*]mg kg− 1, respectively. Inhibition of mild irritant-induced protection was also found when NS- 398 (1 [*]mg kg− 1) was administered s. c. or when 96 % ethanol was used to damage the mucosa. Pretreatment with 16, 16 -dimethyl-prostaglandin (PG) E 2 at 4 [*]ng kg− 1, a dose that did not protect against ethanol (70 %) -induced mucosal damage when given alone, completely reversed {{the effect of the}} selective COX- 2 inhibitors on the mild irritant-induced protection. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (3 [*]mg kg− 1, 24 and 2 [*]h before instillation of 20 % ethanol) did not affect the protective activity of the mild irritant, indicating that enzyme induction is not involved. Indomethacin (20 [*]mg kg− 1, p. o.) did not prevent the protection conferred by sodium salicylate (100 [*]mg kg− 1), dimercaprol (30 [*]μg kg− 1), iodoacetamide (50 [*]mg kg− 1) and lithium (20 [*]mg kg− 1). Likewise, the protective effect of these agents was not counteracted by NS- 398 (1 [*]mg kg− 1, p. o.). Whereas indomethacin (20 [*]mg kg− 1, p. o.) near-maximally inhibited gastric mucosal formation of PGE 2, 6 -keto-PGF 1 α and thromboxane (TX) B 2 as well as platelet TXB 2 release, the selective COX- 2 inhibitors were ineffective. The findings show that selective COX- 2 inhibitors, although lacking in ulcerogenic activity, prevent the protection conferred by a mild irritant.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) are {{essential}} for controlling cell growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, wound healing and tumourigenesis. In mammals, there are twenty-three FGFs and five FGFRs, with each FGFR having different ligand binding specificities. FGFs are thought {{to act in a}} paracrine manner, in which they are secreted by one cell and activate FGFRs on another cell type, and such interaction helps to establish the fundamental crosstalk between epithelium and mesenchyme during development, homeostasis and tumourigenesis. This thesis aims to investigate the requirement of FGFR 2 -isoform IIIb (Fgfr 2 b) and one of its ligands, Fgf 10, in gastrointestinal (GI) development, homeostasis and injury, using loss-of-function animal models. Fgfr 2 b-/- and Fgf 10 -/- exhibit similar multi-organ defects, including intestinal atresia. While caecal and colonic atresia have been previously described, the mechanism of duodenal atresia and the role of Fgf signalling in duodenal development have not been fully established. We demonstrate that absence of Fgfr 2 b or Fgf 10 leads to decreased tissue proliferation and increased apoptosis in the duodenum, contributing to duodenal atresia. These mutants also develop gastric heterotopia in the rostral duodenum due to loss of gastric-intestinal boundary specification. In addition, we demonstrate reduced expression of Wnt targets Tcf 1 and Tcf 4 in the small intestine, with corresponding downregulation of Lgr 5, an intestinal stem cell marker, and Cdx 1, a homeobox gene involved in anterior-posterior patterning. We show by in vitro that Fgf 10 -Fgfr 2 b signalling is able to regulate Tcf 4 expression via the Grb 2 /Sos/Ras/MAPK pathway. In order to study the requirement of Fgfr 2 b in intestinal homeostasis and injury, we crossed a transgenic line bearing a progesterone antagonist (RU 486) -dependent Cre recombinase (A 33 -CrePR) expressed {{under the control of the}} intestinal-specific A 33 antigen promoter, with an existing conditional Fgfr 2 b line. Following RU 486 administration with/without administration of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) thereafter to induce ulcerative colitis (UC), the A 33 -CrePR+/Fgfr 2 bflox/flox targeted Fgfr 2 b ablation with high efficiency across the small and large intestine. We demonstrate that significant downregulation of Fgfr 2 b does not affect intestinal homeostasis, but significantly increases the susceptibility of colonic epithelium to UC and delays wound healing, contributed by reduced epithelial proliferation. In order to study the requirement of Fgfr 2 b in <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> we characterised two stomach-specific minimal promoters for trefoil factor 1 (Tff 1) and H+K+-ATPase (Atp 4 b) to generate two inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT 2) lines. Gastric surface mucous cells and acidproducing parietal cells express Tff 1 and Atp 4 b respectively, as well as Fgfr 2 b. We demonstrate by in vitro that Atp 4 b nucleotide - 1, 035 bp to + 24 bp and Tff 1 nucleotide - 641 bp to + 28 bp are optimal for driving Cre expression in the mouse stomach. Thus, our novel data provides evidence that Fgfr 2 b and Fgf 10 are required for normal duodenal morphogenesis and differentiation, and Fgfr 2 b confers protection against DSS-induced colonic injury and promotes wound repair.

Yet, despite extensive research, the active component(s) responsible for these effects has not been pinpointed and studies with single nutrients have been largely unsuccessful. Recent research from our laboratory and elsewhere suggests that the inorganic anion nitrate (NO 3 -), especially abundant in green leafy vegetables, is converted in our bodies to nitrite (NO 2 -) and then further to nitric oxide (NO). The latter is a central signalling molecule with a number of beneficial effects in the cardiovascular- and gastrointestinal systems. Ingested nitrate is absorbed to the blood and mixed with nitrate from endogenous sources formed by NO synthases (NOS). Circulating nitrate is actively transported and accumulated in the salivary glands and excreted with saliva. Oral commensal bacteria play a surprisingly important role in nitrate bioactivation by reducing salivary nitrate to the more reactive nitrite anion.

The results show that nitrite and dietary nitrate can reduce leukocyte recruitment during acute inflammation in the microcirculation. Dietary nitrate also prevented NSAID-provoked small intestinal inflammation in a process dependent on oral nitrate-reducing bacteria. Although strong anti-inflammatory effects were observed with dietary nitrate, the ability to clear an infection was not impaired. Dietary nitrate, nitrite and CLA were further demonstrated to alleviate inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. The protective effect seen with CLA involved upregulation of trefoil factor 3 (TFF 3) expression through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the colon mucosa. Furthermore, dietary nitrite also had therapeutic effects in already established colonic inflammation, possibly mediated by maintaining the colonic mucus layer and promoting healing of colon epithelial cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the firmly adherent gastric mucus layer, normally present in conventional mice, was almost absent in germ free mice. In addition, a reduced gastric mucus layer was also observed in mice treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. While treatment with nitrate increased the mucus thickness further in conventional mice it had no effects in germ free mice, again demonstrating the essential role of oral bacteria in bioactivation of nitrate. Remarkably however, when the germ free mice were fed a low dose of nitrite, resembling what would normally be generated in saliva by bacteria, the gastric mucus thickness increased dramatically. This suggests that commensal oral bacteria modulate <b>gastric</b> <b>homeostasis</b> via physiological recycling of nitrate, originally derived from NOS. In conclusion, the studies in this thesis demonstrate that dietary nitrate, nitrite and CLA play a direct role in the regulation of inflammatory responses, both locally in the microcirculation and in the gastrointestinal tract. These results may have implications for future dietary recommendations in prevention and treatment of inflammatory disorders...|$|E

Three‐month‐old NogTG mice were crossed to gastrin‐deficient (GasKO mice) to generate NogTG;GasKO mice. Morphology of the corpus of wild type, NogTG, GasKO, and NogTG;GasKO mice was analyzed by H&E staining. Distribution of PCs and zymogenic cells (ZCs) was analyzed by immunostaining for the H+/K+‐ATPase and intrinsic factor (IF). Expression of the H+/K+‐ATPase and IF genes and proteins were measured by QRT‐PCR and western blots. Cell proliferation was assessed by immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The corpus of the NogTG;GasKO mice displayed a marked {{reduction in the number of}} PCs and ZCs in comparison to NogTG mice. Further, cellular proliferation was significantly lower in NogTG;GasKO mice, than in the NogTG mice. Thus, gastrin mediates the increase in gastric epithelial cell proliferation induced by inhibition of BMP signaling in vivo.

My thesis work has focused on identifying the mechanisms by which Notch signaling regulates <b>gastric</b> epithelial cell <b>homeostasis.</b> I identified NOTCH 1 and NOTCH 2 as the key receptors contributing to the regulation of gastric epithelial cells by Notch. Using inhibitory antibodies targeting NOTCH 1 and NOTCH 2, I observed a marked reduction in proliferation of both corpus and antral epithelial cells that mimicked the reduced proliferation observed with global Notch inhibition. Inhibition of NOTCH 1 or NOTCH 2 signaling led to an intermediate reduction in proliferation in both regions of the glandular stomach. In the antrum, inhibition of both receptors resulted in a general increase in expression of markers of differentiated cells, including enteroendocrine, surface mucous, and deep mucous cells. Inhibition of both receptors also led to increased secretory granules in antral cells and expression of secretory products from other regions of the gastrointestinal tract, including the corpus and intestine. To investigate if Notch signaling is intrinsic to the epithelium, I refined the conditions for gastric organoid establishment from mouse and human antrum and corpus tissue. In mouse and human antral and corpus organoids, inhibition of NOTCH 1 and NOTCH 2 resulted in a reduction of organoid growth similar to that seen with global Notch inhibition. In corpus organoids, inhibition of either NOTCH 1 or NOTCH 2 resulted in an intermediate disruption of organoid growth. However, in antral organoids, inhibition of NOTCH 1 mimicked growth similar to that seen with global inhibition, suggesting that NOTCH 1 may play a more significant role in antral organoid growth than NOTCH 2. In summary, my thesis work has expanded the understanding of the role of Notch in <b>gastric</b> epithelial <b>homeostasis.</b> I have illustrated an important role for the NOTCH 1 and NOTCH 2 receptors in regulating gastric epithelial proliferation and differentiation in vivo and in vitro...|$|R

We analysed 41 EOGCs for RUNX 3 aberrations using loss of heterozygosity (LOH), {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. LOH of markers flanking RUNX 3 was relatively common, indicating that loss of the gene {{may play a role in}} gastric carcinogenesis. However, FISH analysis of selected cases and a panel of 14 gastric carcinoma-derived cell lines showed widespread presence of multiple copies of centromere 1. While RUNX 3 copy numbers were generally equal to or fewer than those of centromere 1, at least two copies were present in almost all cells analysed. Accordingly, a subpopulation of tumour cells in 12 / 37 cases showed RUNX 3 protein expression. However, expression was not detected in the adjacent nontumorous mucosa of any case. Together, these observations indicate that chromosome 1 aberrations occur frequently in EOGCs and are rejected in the LOH and IHC patterns found. Our findings refute a role for RUNX 3 as a TSG in EOGC...|$|R
40|$|Ghrelin is {{a stomach}} hormone that stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion, {{adiposity}} and food intake. Gastric ghrelin production and secretion are regulated by caloric intake, ghrelin secretion increases during fasting, decreases with re-feeding and {{is reduced by}} diet-induced obesity. The aim of our study was to test the hypotheses that an increase in body adiposity 1) will exert an inhibitory role in the reduction of gastric ghrelin synthesis and secretion during a chronic high fat (HF) diet; and, 2) that a chronic HF diet will suppress the rise in circulating ghrelin levels in response to acute fasting. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a standard AIN- 76 A (~ 5 - 12 % calories-fat) or a HF diet (~ 45 % calories-fat). The effect of an increased adiposity on <b>gastric</b> ghrelin <b>homeostasis</b> was assessed by comparing stomach ghrelin production and plasma ghrelin levels in obese and non-obese rats fed a HF diet. HF diet fed, non-obese rats were generated by administration of triiodothyronine (T 3) to lower body fat accumulation. Findings indicate that an increased fat mass per se does not exert an inhibitory action on ghrelin homeostasis during HF diets. Additionally, {{the magnitude of the}} plasma ghrelin increment to fasting was not blunted, indicating that a presumed, endogenous signal for activation of ingestive behavior remains intact in spite of excess stored calories in HF fed rats...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in treatment and the declining incidence, gastric cancer remains the second {{leading cause of}} cancer-related deaths in the world. Understanding the progression from inflammation to cancer in the stomach is crucial {{in the development of}} novel therapies and strategies for treating this disease. Chronic inflammation of the stomach is typically caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and resulting lesions may lead to gastric cancer. During the progression from inflammation to cancer, the stomach epithelium changes with evidence of the disruption of normal epithelial cell differentiation and infiltrating inflammatory cells. Coincident with the development of atrophic gastritis and metaplasia, is the loss of the gastric morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Given its critical role as a regulator of <b>gastric</b> tissue <b>homeostasis,</b> the disruption of Shh expression during inflammation correlates with the loss of normal epithelial cell differentiation, but this has only recently been rigorously tested in vivo using a unique mouse model of targeted gastric Shh deletion. While pre-neoplastic lesions such as atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are associated with the loss of Shh within the acid-secreting glands of the stomach, there is a clear link between elevated Shh and signaling to gastric cancers. The current review focuses on the effects of aberrant Shh expression and its {{role in the development of}} gastric cancer, specifically in response to H. pylori infection...|$|R
30|$|Cyclooxygenases (COXs) are {{responsible}} for the complex conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which exert as autocrine or paracrine messengers a wide range of physiological functions mediated through binding to prostaglandin E (EP) G-protein-coupled receptors (EP 1 -EP 4) [1]. The COX enzyme family consists of two distinct isoforms; COX- 1, which is a constitutively expressed enzyme; and COX- 2, which is the inducible form of the enzyme. COX- 1 functions as a housekeeping enzyme and is expressed in most tissues types. The enzyme is responsible for maintaining <b>homeostasis</b> (<b>gastric</b> and renal integrity) and normal production of eicosanes [1]. COX- 2 is only expressed in response to inflammatory stimuli and virtually absent in most resting tissues [2]. COX- 2 expression is usually significantly upregulated under acute and chronic inflammatory conditions [3], as well as in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s [4] and a variety of cancers [5].|$|R
40|$|Mouse {{models with}} {{conditional}} activation of K-ras (K-rasG 12 D) are used widely {{to investigate the}} role of oncogenic K-ras in a tissue-specific manner. However, the effect of ubiquitous activation of K-ras in adult mice has not been well studied. Herein, we report that systemic activation of K-ras in mice leads to rapid changes in <b>gastric</b> cellular <b>homeostasis.</b> Conditional activation of K-ras results in activation of the MAPK pathway and hyperproliferation of squamous epithelium in the forestomach and metaplasia in the glandular stomach. Parietal cells almost completely disappear from {{the upper part of}} the stomach adjacent to forestomach of K-ras activated mice. CDX 2, a caudal-related homeobox transcription factor normally expressed in the intestine, is upregulated in parts of the stomach, following activation of K-ras in mice. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2), a mediator of inflammation, is also upregulated in parts of the stomach of the K-ras activated mice with concomitant infiltration of hematopoietic cells in the hyperplastic tissue. Moreover, in K-ras activated mice, the expression of putative progenitor cell marker Dcamkl 1 is upregulated in the glandular stomach. Expression of CD 44, a candidate stomach cancer stem cell marker, is also increased in forestomach and the glandular stomach. These results suggest that cells of the stomach, potentially stem or progenitor cells, are highly susceptible to K-ras activation-induced initiation of gastric precancerous lesions. The histological changes in the K-ras activated mice resemble the pre-neoplastic changes that take place during gastric carcinogenesis in humans. Thus, a mouse model with systemic K-rasG 12 D activation could be useful for studying the early molecular events leading to gastric carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|B cells {{regulate}} autoimmune pathologies {{and chronic}} inflammatory {{conditions such as}} autoimmune encephalomyelitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The potential counterregulatory role of B cells in balancing pathogen-specific immune responses and the associated immunopathology is less well understood owing {{to the lack of}} appropriate persistent infection models. In this paper, we show that B cells have the ability to negatively regulate adaptive immune responses to bacterial pathogens. Using mouse models of infection with Helicobacter felis, a close relative of the human gastrointestinal pathogen H. pylori, we found that B cells activated by Helicobacter TLR- 2 ligands induce IL- 10 -producing CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) T regulatory- 1 (Tr- 1) -like cells in vitro and in vivo. Tr- 1 conversion depends on TCR signaling and a direct T-/B-interaction through CD 40 /CD 40 L and CD 80 /CD 28. B cell-induced Tr- 1 cells acquire suppressive activity in vitro and suppress excessive gastric Helicobacter-associated immunopathology in vivo. Adoptive cotransfer of MyD 88 -proficient B cells and Tr- 1 cells restores a normal gastric mucosal architecture in MyD 88 (-/-) and IL- 10 (-/-) mice in a manner that depends on T cellular, but not B cellular, IL- 10 production. Our findings describe a novel mechanism of B cell-dependent Tr- 1 cell generation and function in a clinically relevant disease model. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the B cell/Tr- 1 cell axis is essential for balancing the control of Helicobacter infection with the prevention of excessive Th 1 -driven gastric immunopathology, promoting <b>gastric</b> mucosal <b>homeostasis</b> {{on the one hand and}} facilitating Helicobacter persistence on the other...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{production}} by oxidative metabolism in kidney, stomach, and heart, is primarily expended in establishing ion gradients to drive renal electrolyte <b>homeostasis,</b> <b>gastric</b> acid secretion, and cardiac muscle contraction, respectively. In addition to orchestrating transcriptional control of oxidative metabolism, the orphan nuclear receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma(ERR gamma), coordinates expression of genes central to ion homeostasis in oxidative tissues. Renal, gastric, and cardiac tissues subjected to genomic analysis of expression in perinatal ERR gamma null mice revealed a characteristic dysregulation of genes involved in transport processes, {{exemplified by the}} voltage-gated potassium channel, Kcne 2. Consistently, ERR gamma null animals die during the first 72 h of life with elevated serum potassium, reductions in key gastric acid production markers, and cardiac arrhythmia with prolonged QT intervals. In addition, we find altered expression of several genes associated with hypertension in ERR gamma null mice. These findings suggest a potential role for genetic polymorphisms at the ERR gamma locus and ERR gamma modulators in the etiology and treatment of renal, gastric, and cardiac dysfunction.

40|$|In {{this work}} we re-examine an {{existing}} model of gastric acid secretion. The {{model is a}} 2 -compartment model of the human stomach accounting for regions where relevant cells (D, G, ECL and parietal cells) and proteins and acid they secrete (somatostatin, gastrin, histamine, and gastric acid, respectively) are found. These proteins compose a positive and negative feedback system that controls the secre-tion of gastric acid by parietal cells. The original model consists of 18 ordinary differential equations and yields a stable 3 -period limit cycle solution. We modify the existing model by introducing a delay into the system and assuming that the cell populations are in steady state over a short-time window (< 300 h) {{and are able to}} reduce the system to an 8 -equation delay differential equation model. In addi-tion to demonstrating congruency between the two models, we also show that a similar stability is only reproducible when the delay in gastrin transport is approxi-mately 30 min. This suggests that <b>gastric</b> acid secretion <b>homeostasis</b> likely depends strongly on the delay in gastrin transport from the antrum to the corpus...|$|R

We analysed IL- 11 expression in H. pylori infected mouse stomach, {{the site of}} gastric IL- 11 expression in mice and humans, {{and the effect of}} exogenous IL- 11 on <b>gastric</b> mucosal <b>homeostasis.</b> Methods IL- 11 protein was localised in mouse and human stomach. The impact of chronic, exogenous IL- 11 on normal mouse stomach was examined histologically and transcriptionally by microarray, confirmed by mRNA and protein analysis. Functional impact of IL- 11 on gastric acid secretion was determined. Results In mice infected with H. pylori, IL- 11 was increased in fundic mucosa with temporal expression similar to IL- 1 b. IL- 11 protein was localised predominantly to parietal cells in mouse and human stomach. Application of exogenous IL- 11 to resulted in fundic parietal and chief cell loss, hyperplasia, mucous cell metaplasia and inflammation. Coincident with cellular changes were an increased gastric pH, altered parietal cell ultrastructure and altered gene expression, particularly genes involved in immune response and ion transport which could result in compromised acid secretion. We confirmed that a single dose of IL- 11 effectively ablated the gastric response to histamine. Conclusions IL- 11 is a parietal cell cytokine that blocks gastric acid secretion, likely via reducing expression of parietal cell ion transport genes, CCKb and histamine H 2 receptors. IL- 11 expression is increased in H. pylori infected mouse stomach and treatment of wild type mice with IL- 11 induced changes in the gastric fundic mucosa reminiscent of chronic atrophic gastritis, a precursor to gastric cancer.

40|$|Background: Amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide) is {{a hormone}} with {{suggested}} {{roles in the}} regulation of glucose <b>homeostasis,</b> <b>gastric</b> motor and secretory function and gastroprotection. In the gastric mucosa amylin is found co-localised with somatostatin in D-cells. The factors regulating gastric amylin release are unknown. In this study we have investigated the regulation of amylin release from gastric mucosal cells in primary culture. Rabbit fundic mucosal cells enriched for D-cells by counterflow elutriation were cultured for 40 hours. Amylin and somatostatin release over 2 hours in response to agonists were assessed. Results: Amylin release was significantly enhanced by activation of protein kinase C with phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate, adenylate cyclase with forskolin and elevation of intracellular calcium with A 23187. Cholecystokinin (CCK), epinephrine and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) each stimulated amylin release in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal CCK-stimulated release was greater than either epinephrine or GLP- 1, even when {{the effects of the}} latter two were enhanced by isobutylmethylxanthine. Stimulated amylin release was significantly inhibited by carbachol (by 51 – 59 %) and octreotide (by 33 – 42 %). Somatostatin release paralleled that of amylin. Conclusions: The cultured D-cell model provides a means of studying amylin release. Amylin secretion is stimulated by receptor-dependent and -independent activation of Ca 2 +/protein kinase C and adenylate cyclase pathways. Inhibition involves activation of muscarinic receptors and auto-regulation by somatostatin...|$|R
40|$|Gastric exocrine secretion, both {{acid and}} non-acid, is {{required}} for micronutrients absorption, such as iron, calcium and vitamin B 12, drugs absorption, protein digestion. Clinical presentation of a gastric secretion impairment might be then characterized {{by the presence of}} both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal specific symptoms (i. e. anemia) or to a non-response to therapies. The main factor that impairs <b>gastric</b> exocrine secretion <b>homeostasis</b> is mucosal chronic inflammation that principally occurs after colonization by Helicobacter pylori (Hp). The extent and distribution of gastritis ultimately determine the clinical outcome linked to differences in gastric acid secretion status, the involvement of gastric body leading to a decrease in gastric exocrine secretion with possible progression to mucosal atrophy towards cancer. A correct clinical strategy in the management of Hp infected patients should be then to early identify body involvement, a diagnosis generally missed in that body biopsies are not routinely performed. The use of gastric serological markers, gastrin and pepsinogens, are helpful in suspecting the presence of mucosal atrophy but their diagnostic accuracy for non-atrophic chronic gastritis topography is not adequate despite a good specificity due to the low sensitivity, of all the available biomarkers. Gastric serology associated to anemia/iron-deficiency screening might nevertheless been helpful in the framing of patients that undergo endoscopy in order to highlight the need of extensive mucosal biopsies sampling...|$|R
40|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} (Shh) is a morphogen {{involved in}} {{many aspects of}} patterning of the gut during embryogenesis and in <b>gastric</b> fundic gland <b>homeostasis</b> in the adult. Intestinal metaplastic change of the gastric epithelium {{is associated with the}} loss of Shh expression, and mice that lack Shh expression show intestinal transformation of the gastric mucosa. The present study was designed to investigate the alteration of Shh expression in the stomach of an experimental model of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) colonization. Male Mongolian gerbils were inoculated with H. pylori and examined 4 and 51 weeks later. The level of Shh mRNA expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Shh protein expression was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Shh was expressed in the parietal cells, zymogenic cells, and mucous neck cells of the gastric fundic glands of gerbils. Prolonged colonization by H. pylori led to extension of the inflammation from the antrum to the corpus of the stomach, with loss of Shh expression. Loss of Shh expression correlated with loss of parietal cells, disturbed maturation of the mucous neck cell-zymogenic cell lineage, and increased cellular proliferation. Shh expression is significantly reduced in H. pylori-associated gastritis. These data show {{for the first time that}} H. pylori infection leads to down-regulation of the expression of a morphogen with an established role (Shh) in gastric epithelial differentiatio...|$|R

Nevertheless, a direct comparison between the two study drugs {{has not yet been}} performed. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the effects of a first-line therapy with either phenylephrine or norepinephrine on systemic and regional hemodynamics in patients with septic shock. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit in a university hospital. We enrolled septic shock patients (n = 32) with a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either norepinephrine or phenylephrine infusion (n = 16 each) titrated to achieve a mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg. Data from right heart catheterization, a thermodye dilution catheter, <b>gastric</b> tonometry, acid-base <b>homeostasis,</b> as well as creatinine clearance and cardiac troponin were obtained at baseline and after 12 hours. Differences within and between groups were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements with group and time as factors. Time-independent variables were compared with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: No differences were found in any of the investigated parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests there are no differences in terms of cardiopulmonary performance, global oxygen transport, and regional hemodynamics when phenylephrine was administered instead of norepinephrine in the initial hemodynamic support of septic shock...|$|R
40|$|The major {{signaling}} pathways regulating gastric {{stem cells}} are unknown. Here we report that Notch signaling is essential for homeostasis of LGR 5 + antral stem cells. Pathway inhibition reduced proliferation of gastric stem and progenitor cells, while activation increased proliferation. Notch dysregulation also altered differentiation, with inhibition inducing mucous and endocrine cell differentiation while activation reduced differentiation. Analysis of gastric organoids demonstrated that Notch signaling was intrinsic to the epithelium and regulated growth. Furthermore, in vivo Notch manipulation affected the efficiency of organoid initiation from glands and single Lgr 5 ‐GFP stem cells, suggesting regulation of stem cell function. Strikingly, constitutive Notch activation in LGR 5 + stem cells induced tissue expansion via antral gland fission. Lineage tracing using a multi‐colored reporter demonstrated that Notch‐activated stem cells rapidly generate monoclonal glands, suggesting a competitive advantage over unmanipulated stem cells. Notch activation was associated with increased mTOR signaling, and mTORC 1 inhibition normalized NICD‐induced increases in proliferation and gland fission. Chronic Notch activation induced undifferentiated, hyper‐proliferative polyps, suggesting that aberrant activation of Notch in gastric stem cells may contribute to gastric tumorigenesis. SynopsisThe Notch signaling pathway is required to maintain LGR 5 + antral stem cells and epithelial cell <b>homeostasis.</b> <b>Gastric</b> antral stem cells display active Notch 1 receptor signaling. Global Notch inhibition reduces stem and progenitor cell proliferation and increases differentiation of all lineages. Notch activation in LGR 5 + stem cells increases stem and progenitor cell proliferation and inhibits differentiation.

40|$|Calcium {{homeostasis}} involves {{mainly the}} interaction of PTH, vitamin D and CT. The stomach may be important for calcium <b>homeostasis.</b> <b>Gastric</b> acid is thought to mobilize calcium from the diet, thereby facilitating the absorption of calcium in the small intestines. In the rat, gastrectomy rapidly reduces the calcium content, the density and the trabecular volume of the bone. The gastrectomy-evoked bone loss cannot be prevented by supplementation with CaCl 2 and {{it is unlikely to}} reflect either calcium or vitamin D deficiency. It may reflect the lack of a calciotropic or osteotropic hormone, that emanates from the oxyntic mucosa. Gastrin has been suggested to release a hypocalcemic peptide hormone, gastrocalcin, from the oxyntic mucosal ECL cells, which is thought to act to enhance the uptake of Ca into bone. Gastrin has also been suggested to have a growth-promoting effect on the parathyroid gland. The present study examines the possibility that the gastrin-ECL-cell axis is integrated with known regulatory systems for calcium and bone metabolism. Omeprazole treatment, which activates the gastrin-ECL-cell axis, was associated with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the chicken parathyroid glands. Dietary calcium seems to enhance the release of gastrin without activating the ECL cells of the rat stomach. Acute perturbations in circulating calcium did not affect either the release of gastrin or the activity of the ECL cells in the rat. Short-term administration of PTH or CT had no effect on the serum gastrin concentration or on the activity of the ECL cells. Vitamin D suppressed the activity of the ECL cells, presumably via vitamin D receptors in the oxyntic mucosa. The gastrin-ECL-cell axis appears to be functionally integrated with vitamin D-dependent and PTH-dependent regulatory systems and {{may play a role in}} bone metabolism...|$|R

Bi(3 +), on the other hand, has a very strong affinity towards Cys thiol groups, and can also coordinate an additional His imidazole. In this review, the complicated pathway of nickel uptake, delivery and regulation in microorganisms is summarized. We show potential binding sites, binding geometries, protein structures and discuss the predicted thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. We focus on the numerous recent observations on the homeostasis of nickel in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa in humans, and is the causative agent of acute and chronic gastritis. peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma, and <b>gastric</b> lymphoma. The <b>homeostasis</b> of Ni(2 +) is crucial for the survival of H. pylori in the extremely acidic environment of the stomach. The metal is delivered to urease (which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia and therefore neutralizes the low gastric pH) and to hydrogenase (which permits respiratory based energy production for the bacteria in the mucosa) by a set of accessory proteins. Most of the bacterium's metal metabolism is centered upon their expression and maturation. Below, {{a detailed description of the}} structural and thermodynamic aspects of the binding of nickel ions to poly-histidyl and poly-cysteil sites of urease and hydrogenase accessory proteins is given. Because bismuth compounds are one of the treatments for peptic ulcer disease, the inhibitory effect of Bi(3 +) ions is described; the affinity of bismuth towards Cys side groups is much stronger than the affinity of nickel towards the same sites, therefore bismuth is able to displace nickel from its binding site, causing the inhibition of nickel chaperones...|$|R
