5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and <b>health</b> <b>systems,</b> abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, multiculturalism and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E

40|$|Publicly funded <b>health</b> <b>system</b> reforms {{increasingly}} {{require the}} evaluation of competing programs. However, programs are made of multidimensional attributes of value (where value refers to latent expectations of <b>health</b> <b>system</b> improvement). This paper identifies the design, implementation and validation of a methodology to elicit <b>health</b> <b>system</b> values to guide health care priority setting. The exercise suggests that the proposed mixed methods methodology is suitable for eliciting and validating <b>health</b> <b>system</b> values, and its findings show that pursuing health gain alone does not fully capture the dimensions of <b>health</b> <b>system</b> value. More specifically, we identify a list of <b>health</b> <b>system</b> values (elicited by both potential and actual users) and classify {{them in terms of}} process related values (e. g., shorter waiting lists, greater choice etc) and improvements in <b>health</b> <b>system</b> equity in addition to value derived from health gain...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has sought}} to {{illuminate}} how the operations of a national <b>health</b> <b>system</b> can be understood using a theoretical global health governance (GHG) lens. A national <b>health</b> <b>system</b> usually operates within {{the parameters of the}} government and the state. So how does it affect the operation of a national <b>health</b> <b>system</b> to receive financial and technical support from external actors? This thesis uses the Malawian <b>health</b> <b>system</b> as a case study of how ideas of global health are interpreted in a national <b>health</b> <b>system.</b> Malawi was chosen as a case because the country’s <b>health</b> <b>system</b> is largely financed by external actors, as the government is unable to finance the operation of the <b>health</b> <b>system.</b> This qualitative study is based on textual analysis of the Health Sector Strategic Plan [2011 - 2016] and interviews with important actors in the Malawian health sector. The aim of this is to gain deeper understanding of the mechanisms that are happening in the <b>health</b> <b>system</b> as a result of external influences. The main findings from this study are that external actors and partners in the Malawian <b>health</b> <b>system</b> have two main influences. The first is the enforcement of parallel <b>systems</b> of <b>health</b> care delivery in the decentralised <b>health</b> <b>system.</b> The second finding is that the external actors exert resource-based power over priorities in the health sector, through their access to financial resources...|$|R

40|$|<b>Health</b> <b>system</b> policy- and {{decision-makers}} have {{a responsibility}} to ensure that scarce <b>health</b> <b>system</b> resources are used wisely to provide the best possible health services to the public while containing current and future costs. Measuring variations in <b>health</b> <b>system</b> efficiency and learning from them could be a helpful approach for policy- and decision-makers in this regard as it could inform policies and interventions maximizing health outcomes from scarce public resources. The goal of this project is to develop an approach for measuring the technical efficiency of the <b>health</b> <b>system</b> {{in a manner that is}} relevant to federal, provincial, territorial and regional policy- and decision-makers. Consultations with <b>health</b> <b>system</b> stakeholders at federal, provincial and territorial levels were the most significant contributions in defining this approach. A review of <b>health</b> <b>system</b> data available in Canada at the provincial, territorial and regional levels helped assess the feasibility of the <b>health</b> <b>system</b> efficiency measurement model proposed. The report provides an overview of the methods used to develop the approach, describes the main decision points and concludes with a presentation of an approach to <b>health</b> <b>system</b> efficiency measurement at the provincial and regional levels. The next steps in the project are as follows: test the model, using available data to produce preliminary results of the <b>health</b> <b>system</b> efficiency measure; engage with policy-makers and <b>health</b> <b>system</b> managers at the regional level to explore possible factors leading to inefficiencies; and identify successful policies that can serve as a learning opportunity for Canadian jurisdictions...|$|R
