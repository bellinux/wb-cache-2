500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> want it now." ...|$|E

To her [...] "beloved mama", {{with whom she}} had sometimes had a difficult relationship, she wrote a poem in April 1917, while the family was still imprisoned at Tsarskoye Selo: [...] "You are filled with anguish for the sufferings of others. And no one's grief has ever passed you by. You are relentless, only towards yourself, forever cold and pitiless. But if only you could look upon your own sadness from a distance, just once with a loving soul — Oh, <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> pity yourself, how sadly you would weep." [...] In another letter from Tobolsk, Olga wrote: [...] "Father asks to… remember that the evil which is now in the world will become yet more powerful, and that it is not evil which conquers evil, but only love …" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the aphorisms which conclude Dialectic of Enlightenment, Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of Nietzsche, treated issues like emigration, totalitarianism, and individuality, as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of Charlie Chaplin and became friends with Fritz Lang and Hanns Eisler, with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films. Additionally, Adorno assisted Thomas Mann on his novel Doctor Faustus after the latter asked for his help. [...] "Would you be willing," [...] Mann wrote, [...] "to think through with me how the work—I mean Leverkühn's work—might look; <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do it {{if you were in}} league with the Devil?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian Whitaker, the Middle East {{editor for}} The Guardian {{newspaper}} at the time, {{wrote in a}} public email debate with Carmon in 2003, that his problem with MEMRI was that it [...] "poses as a research institute when it's basically a propaganda operation". Earlier, Whitaker had charged that MEMRI's role was to [...] "further the political agenda of Israel." [...] and that MEMRI's website does not mention Carmon's employment for Israeli intelligence, or Meyrav Wurmser's political stance, which he described as an [...] "extreme brand of Zionism". Carmon responded to this by stating that his employment history is not a secret and was not political, as he served under opposing administrations of the Israeli government and that perhaps the issue {{was that he was}} Israeli: [...] "If your complaint is that I am Israeli, then please say so." [...] Carmon also questioned Whitaker's own biases, wondering if Whitaker's is biased in favor of Arabs—as his website on the Middle East is named [...] "Al-Bab" [...] ("The Gateway" [...] in Arabic)—stating: [...] "I wonder <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> judge an editor whose website was called [...] "Ha-Sha-ar" [...] ("The Gateway" [...] in Hebrew)? ...|$|E
