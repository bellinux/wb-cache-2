25|$|Clutch size is {{typically}} three eggs, {{although it is}} two {{in some of the}} smaller species and only one egg for the swallow-tailed gull. Within colonies, birds synchronise their laying, with synchronisation being higher in larger colonies, although after a certain point, this levels off. The eggs of gulls are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotches and scrawl markings, and are well camouflaged. Both sexes incubate the eggs, with incubation bouts lasting between one and four hours during the day and one parent incubating through the night. Research on various bird species including the gull suggests that females form pair bonds with other females to obtain alloparental care for their dependent offspring, a behavior seen in other animal species, like the elephants, wolves, and the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{defined by}} the World Wildlife Fund, the San Joaquin River {{watershed}} {{is part of the}} Sacramento-San Joaquin freshwater ecoregion, which supports almost 40 species of freshwater fish. These include several types of lampreys, sturgeons, sunfish, perch and various anadromous fish species such as salmon and steelhead. Some of these fish are believed to have descended from fishes of the Columbia Basin in geologically ancient times, when {{the upper reaches of the}} Sacramento River watershed were connected with that of the Snake River. Up to 75 percent of the historic species were endemic to the Sacramento-San Joaquin basin. Most native fish stocks have suffered because of predation by introduced species and dam construction. In a study from 1993 to 1995, it was found that the main stem of the San Joaquin River was mainly populated by <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow,</b> red shiner, threadfin shad and inland silverside, all of which were introduced. Downstream portions of the river's main tributaries were populated mainly by largemouth and smallmouth bass, redear sunfish and white catfish, while native species have survived relatively well in the upper reaches of the river and its tributaries, which also play host to introduced brown trout.|$|E
25|$|Older offspring, {{which are}} around two years old, may also live in {{families}} and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year-olds {{will also help}} in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring. Beavers also practice alloparental care, in which an older sibling may take over the parenting duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species, such as the elephant and <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow.</b> While these helping two-year-olds help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family, and two-year-olds only stay and help their families {{if there is a}} shortage of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought. When beavers leave their natal territories, they usually do not settle far. Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell. Related beavers share more features in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beavers. Being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior, and it causes more tolerant behavior among neighboring beavers.|$|E
50|$|Ostariophysan fishes, {{which include}} <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> possess an alarm substance, or Schreckstoff, in {{distinctive}} epidermal club cells. The alarm substance is released upon mechanical damage to these club cells {{due to a}} predator attack, and can be detected by other ostariophysan fishes which then engage in antipredator behaviors such as hiding or dashing away. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> learn to recognize an animal as a potential predator when it is presented {{in conjunction with the}} alarm substance. Also, alarm substance ingested by the predator will chemically label it as dangerous to naïve <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> thereby resulting in learned predator recognition. Prey fishes with chemical predator recognition abilities can inhabit areas with low visibility and more quickly detect ambush predators like the <b>fathead</b> <b>minnow’s</b> primary predator, the northern pike.|$|R

40|$|Fishes in the {{superorder}} Ostariophysi, including <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> (Pimephales promelas), possess specialized epidermal club {{cells that}} contain an alarm substance. Damage to these cells, as would occur during a predator attack, causes {{the release of}} the alarm substance and can indicate the presence of actively foraging predators to nearby conspecifics. For nearly 70 years, research involving epidermal club cells has focused on the alarm substance and the role it plays in predator/prey interactions. However, recent studies have indicated {{that there may be a}} connection between epidermal club cells and the fish immune system. Fish increase investment in epidermal club cells upon exposure to skin penetrating pathogens and parasites. In this study I tested for differences in epidermal club cell investment by <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exposed to the immunosuppressive effects of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. In experiment 1, <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> were exposed to either a single intraperitoneal injection of corn oil or no injection at all. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether corn oil, the vehicle for cortisol injections in later experiments, had an effect on epidermal club cell density. The treatments had no effect on epidermal club cell size, cell area, or epidermal thickness. In experiment 2, skin extract was prepared from the skin of corn oil injected and non injected <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> as in experiment 1 to determine whether corn oil had an effect on the epidermal club cell alarm substance concentration. The treatments showed no significant differences in observed anti-predator behaviour, including change in shelter use, dashing and freezing. In experiment 3, <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> were exposed to either a single intraperitoneal injection of cortisol or corn oil. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether cortisol, a known immunosuppressant, had an effect on epidermal club cell investment. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exposed to a single cortisol injection had significantly reduced respiratory burst activity of kidney phagocytes indicating that there was suppression of the innate immune system. Furthermore, cortisol treated <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> showed significantly lower numbers of epidermal club cells. The treatments had no effect on individual epidermal club cell area, epidermal thickness and serum cortisol levels after 12 days. The results from this experiment suggest that pharmacological cortisol injections in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> have a suppressive effect on the fish innate immune system. Furthermore, the findings that cortisol induced immunosuppression also influences epidermal club cell investment provides support for the hypothesis that epidermal club cells may function as part of the fish immune system...|$|R

40|$|Using {{information}} from published studies, the relative sensitivity of various freshwater fish {{to a range}} of chemicals was examined. Specifically, the objectives were to: (1) determine which species are used most often in toxicity tests, (2) assess the relative sensitivity of these species to various chemicals, and (3) determine whether the two most commonly tested species exhibit differences in their relative sensitivity to different classes of chemicals. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> rainbow trout and bluegill sunfish were the three most commonly used species in 96 -h LC 50 tests. Of the nine species examined, coho salmon and rainbow trout were the most sensitive species to 190 chemicals, while goldfish and carp were the least sensitive. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> and rainbow trout were not equally sensitive to 13 different classes of chemicals; for example, while trout were significantly more sensitive to metals, <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> were more sensitive to hydrocarbons.

40|$|The {{olfactory}} {{system is essential}} for a fish {{to be successful in}} an ecological context, and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to a variety of toxicants. The current biotic ligand model (BLM) for copper is an acute-toxicity model based on the gill that is used to predict site-specific safe copper concentrations. Recently, work has been done to develop a BLM based on a more sensitive tissue, namely the olfactory epithelium. The work presented in this dissertation determines that a number of the assumptions of the current acute-toxicity gill-based BLM do not hold for the olfactory epithelium. Two techniques were employed for the work contained within this dissertation, a neurophysiological measure of olfactory acuity, electro-olfactography (EOG), and measurement of behavioural responses. For all experiments, <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> (Pimephales promelas) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were used as these species are ubiquitous in waterways across Canada. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> were exposed to low, ecologically-relevant concentrations of copper for varying exposure durations in hard and soft water. While it was determined that there was a significant of inhibition of olfactory function as measured by EOG, there was recovery, at least partially, of EOG function with increased exposure duration. It was also determined that not only does calcium have no protective effect against copper-induced olfactory dysfunction at the olfactory epithelium as it does at the gill, but calcium induces its own response. The response to calcium in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> was further investigated. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> had a strong olfactory-dependent avoidance response to calcium. The reduction in EOG response caused by calcium was demonstrated to be due to cross-adaptation with the odourant used, namely L-arginine. Different olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) classes within the olfactory epithelium respond specifically to different odourants. Exposures of <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> or yellow perch to copper demonstrated that there was a specific impairment of ciliated OSNs, while exposure to nickel resulted in impairment of microvillous OSNs. Behavioural work with <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> using an anti-predator cue demonstrated that copper impairs the response to an anti-predator cue, while nickel does not. These observations demonstrate that ciliated cells are responsible for mediating response to anti-predator cue, which is the first time response to a specific chemosensory cue has been directly connected with a specific OSN class. The work presented in this dissertation represents a significant advancement in our understanding in how copper impairs the {{olfactory system}} of fish, which will aid in the construction of models and regulations to protect fish populations...|$|R

2500|$|Fishes {{can also}} learn from others the {{identity}} of predatory species. <b>Fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> for example, can learn the smell of a predatory pike just by being simultaneously exposed to that smell {{and the sight of}} experienced minnows reacting with fear, and brook stickleback can learn the visual identity of a predator by watching the fright reaction of experienced <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> [...] Fish can also learn to recognize the odor of dangerous sites when they are simultaneously exposed to it and to other fish that suddenly show a fright reaction. [...] Hatchery-raised salmon can learn the smell of a predator by being simultaneously exposed to it and to the alarm substance released by injured salmon.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to changes across ontogeny, {{the degree to}} which schreckstoff is produced varies within the breeding season. Male <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> (Pimephales promelas) cease production of schreckstoff during the breeding season, but still exhibit antipredator behaviors in response to schreckstoff during this time. [...] Schreckstoff production may be halted at this time because male <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> often incur mechanical damage while building their nests. It would be detrimental to a male to produce schreckstoff while building a nest, as it would inadvertently repel females, thereby decreasing the likelihood of obtaining a mate. By ceasing schreckstoff production during the breeding season, males circumvent this problem. The cessation of alarm substance cell production appears to be controlled by androgens.|$|R

Steroids released into the environment have been shown to sorb to sediments in aquatic environments; however, other studies have suggested that steroids can move through sediment beds, and that fish and other aquatic organisms can facilitate this mobility. In this study, we investigated the effect of sediment-associated 17 β-estradiol and 17 β-trenbolone on vitellogenin expression in <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows,</b> a ubiquitously distributed freshwater organism. Two natural sediments were selected to represent a diversity of soil properties, one a silty loam and one predominately sand. Sediment contaminated with either 17 β-trenbolone or 17 β-estradiol was placed in a glass aquarium along with 20 sexually mature female (17 β-trenbolone) or male (17 β-estradiol) <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows.</b> Both positive (aqueous steroid) and negative (lab water) control experiments were performed. Ten fish were randomly collected from each tank at 7 days with the remaining harvested at 14 days. Livers and gonads were collected from each individual and relative hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) expression was quantified using ribosomal L 8 as a normalization standard. After exposure to 17 b-estradiol-contaminated sediments, male <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exhibited no inappropriate expression of Vtg relative to the negative control group regardless of the sediment type used. By comparison, female <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exposed to 17 β-trenbolone associated with silty loam exhibited Vtg expression that was not significantly different from either the positive or negative control fish at both 7 and 14 days suggesting an intermediate response to the spiked sediment. However, female <b>fathead</b> <b>minnows</b> exposed to 17 β-trenbolone associated with sand exhibited no inappropriate expression of Vtg relative to the negative control at 7 days but did exhibit a significant reduction in Vtg at 14 days. Taken together, we observed differential bioavailability for an estrogenic compound (17 b-estradiol) and an androgenic compound (17 β-trenbolone) when associated with sediment. Additionally, differential bioavailability was observed for 17 β-trenbolone depending on sediment type. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy was performed on sediment extracts and water samples to evaluate steroid desorption and transformation over the exposure period.
