The 9020A and 9020D CCCs carried out flight and radar data processing but needed an attached display complex to provide a plan view display to the air traffic controllers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of digital TV stations currently broadcast in the UHF band, both because VHF was already filled largely with analog TV when the digital facilities were built {{and because of}} severe issues with impulse noise on digital low-VHF channels. While virtual channel numbering schemes routinely <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> numbers like [...] "2.1" [...] or [...] "6.1" [...] for individual North American terrestrial HDTV broadcasts, these are {{more often than not}} actually UHF signals. Many equipment vendors therefore use [...] "HDTV antenna" [...] or similar branding as all but synonymous to [...] "UHF antenna".|$|E

While watching full-screen TV (with the Moxi Menu hidden), the Moxi Flip Bar (a bar that pops up on the bottom of the screen) provides programming information and ability to change channels by using the arrow keys on the remote.|$|R
50|$|The 9020As and 9020Ds were {{in service}} in North America until 1989 {{when they were}} finally {{replaced}} by IBM 3083 BX1 mainframes {{as part of the}} FAA's HOST Computer System (HCS) upgrade. The 3083s in turn were replaced with IBM 9672 RA4 parallel processing servers during the FAA's Host and Oceanic Computer System Replacement (HOCSR) completed in 1999. One reason for the 1999 upgrade was concern, probably unfounded, that the IBM 3083's microcode would not operate properly in the year 2000. At least during {{the first phase of the}} upgrade, the 9672s were running the FAA's original assembly language code in System/360 emulation mode. Because of the failure of the FAA's Advanced Automation System (AAS) project, the 9020E <b>Display</b> <b>Channel</b> Complexes lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|On the BRAVIA TVs {{that have}} the XMB, the BRAVIA version of the XrossMediaBar {{includes}} seven categories of options. These include: Settings, Photo, Music, Video, Digital, Analogue, and External Inputs. The BRAVIA XMB menu works similarly to the in-game XMB menu on the PS3, except with the [...] "Home" [...] button instead. Therefore, it lacks a background and is not BRAVIA's start up menu. Like the PSP and PS3, it {{has the ability to}} perform system updates and access the user's music and video on the TV. Unique to the BRAVIA XMB however, is the ability to view digital channel information just by scrolling through the items on the menu. Although inputs can be instantly selected through the TV, XMB also handles the devices plugged into the TV along with the TV channels. Analogue channels, unlike digital channels, do not <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> information on the XMB.|$|E
50|$|Anaglyph images may use any {{combination}} of color channels. However, if a stereoscopic image is to be pursued, thecolors should be diametrically opposed. Impurities of color channel display, or of the viewing filters, allow some of the image meant for the other channel to be seen. This results in stereoscopic double imaging, also called ghosting.Color channels may be left-right reversed. Red/Cyan is most common. Magenta/Green and Blue/Yellow are alsopopular. Red/Green and Red/Blue enable monochromatic images especially Red/Green. Many anaglyph makerspurposely integrate impure color channels and viewing filters to enable better color perception, but {{this results in a}} corresponding degree of double imaging.Color Channel Brightness % of White:Red-30/Cyan-70, Magenta-41/Green-59 or especially Blue-11/Yellow-89), the lighter <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> may be darkened or the brighter viewing filter may be darkened to allow both eyes a balanced view.However the Pulfrich effect can be obtained from a light/dark filter arrangement.The color channels of an anaglyphic image require pure color display fidelity and corresponding viewing filter gels.The choice of ideal viewing filters is dictated by the color channels of the anaglyph to be viewed.Ghosting can be eliminated by ensuring a pure color display and viewing filters that mach the display.Retinal rivalry can be eliminated by the (ACB) 3-D 'Anaglyphic Contrast Balance' method patented by that prepares the image pair prior to color channelling in any color.|$|E

40|$|The {{arrival of}} {{inexpensive}} high fidelity audio capabilities for personal computers {{has been accompanied}} by sweeping claims of enhanced educational effectiveness. Research has only served to confuse these claims with both significant and non-significant findings. This may be due partly to the single dimensional model which has been assumed when examining audio. When computer-based audio is examined as a multi-dimensional display analogous in capability and function to the more familiar visual display (computer screen), a different picture emerges. Although {{it is now clear that}} integrated audio can enhance learning, the instructional designer is still left with little guidance whether or how to use audio to best effect. This study has examined whether there are, and if so which communications filling specific educational functions (instructional text and aural examples) can be delivered through different output channels (visual <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> [computer screen] and for auditory <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> [earphones]) to best effect. Randomly selected II th and 12 th grade students from the same high school were given a computer-based instructional sequence with aural content. The treatment was varied to conform to a two-way factorial design examining both instructional narrative and aural example when offered via (a) the visual display only, (b) the auditory display only, and (c) simultaneously in both displays. All treatments were followed by an on-line, simulation-based, problem-solving examination. Outcome scores, response latency and elapsed treatment times were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance and multiple comparison procedures to identify any significant main or interaction effects. The independence of communications serving specific educational functions was confirmed. Instructional narrative was found to be more effective (p 3 ̆c. 0 I) when presented as part of the auditory display either alone or in concert with the visual display. Aural examples were most effectively (p 3 ̆c. 05) displayed simultaneously as part of the auditory and visual displays. Time required to complete instruction was not affected by the addition of an auditory display. Lack of an auditory display can be remediated by exposure to and additional practice with the targeted aural content...|$|E
40|$|AbstractActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin is {{a member}} of the {{bacterial}} RTX (repeats in toxin) toxin family, produced by a diverse group of Gram-negative pathogens. Members of this group of toxins, although similar in sequence, differ in target cell specificity with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin demonstrating a unique species-and cell-type specificity. Purified A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin added to pre-formed POPE/POPS lipid bilayers showed no spontaneous incorporation (to concentrations of 250 ng/ml). Reproducible channel activity was seen when the bilayer was reformed from lipid monolayers in the presence of toxin (50 ng/ml) in one of the aqueous chambers. Control experiments with heat-inactivated toxin did not <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> activity under the same experimental conditions. The channel behavior showed a complex pattern of multiple conductance levels of 118 262 and 406 pS in solutions containing 0. 140 M NaCL The first two states showed voltage-dependent channel gating with approximately equal but opposite apparent gating charges of 1. 4 electrons. A model accounting for the multiple conducting states and gating properties is presented...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAnnexin V, VI and VII-core (Δ 1 – 107) {{are members}} of the annexin protein family and bind to acidic {{phospholipid}} membranes in a calcium dependent manner. They also show ion channel activity under certain conditions. As annexins bind peripherally to lipid membranes, ion channel formation must consist of at least two steps: An adsorption reaction regulating the binding of annexin to the membrane surface and the opening and closing of the active species controlling the channel activity. By using the baseline current through the patch clamp seal as a probe for unoccupied binding sites at the membrane, we show that the adsorption of annexins to membranes is not only calcium dependent but also strongly voltage dependent. Whereas the free transfer energies at low calcium concentrations are similar for all three annexins, the binding of annexin V becomes much tighter with higher calcium levels, compared to annexin VI and VII-core. This correlates with the finding that annexin VI and VII-core <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> activity much more often than annexin V if one assumes that a high coverage of the membrane surface with annexins stabilizes the bilayer. At higher protein concentrations weaker binding is observed in agreement with the previously reported anti-cooperativity of membrane binding...|$|E
40|$|TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 {{constitute}} the Ca 2 + influx pathway {{in a variety}} of epithelial cells. Here, we identified S 100 A 10 as the first auxiliary protein of these epithelial Ca 2 + channels using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. This S 100 protein forms a heterotetrameric complex with annexin 2 and associates specifically with the conserved sequence VATTV located in the C-terminal tail of TRPV 5 and TRPV 6. Of these five amino acids, the first threonine plays a crucial role since the corresponding mutants (TRPV 5 T 599 A and TRPV 6 T 600 A) exhibited a diminished capacity to bind S 100 A 10, were redistributed to a subplasma membrane area and did not <b>display</b> <b>channel</b> activity. Using GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrated that annexin 2 is part of the TRPV 5 -S 100 A 10 complex. Furthermore, the S 100 A 10 -annexin 2 pair colocalizes with the Ca 2 + channels in TRPV 5 -expressing renal tubules and TRPV 6 -expressing duodenal cells. Importantly, down-regulation of annexin 2 using annexin 2 -specific small interfering RNA inhibited TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 -mediated currents in transfected HEK 293 cells. In conclusion, the S 100 A 10 -annexin 2 complex plays a crucial role in routing of TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 to plasma membran...|$|E
