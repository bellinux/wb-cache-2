25|$|The {{database}} {{features of}} the HyperCard system {{are based on the}} storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack. The database did not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no database engine or similar construct exists. Instead, the state of any object in the system was considered to be live and editable at any time. From the HyperCard runtime's perspective, {{there was no difference between}} moving a text field on the card and typing into it, both operations simply changed the state of the target object within the stack. Such changes are immediately saved when complete, so typing into a field caused that text to be stored to the stack's physical file. The system operates in a largely stateless fashion, with no need to save during operation. This is in common with many database-oriented systems, although somewhat different from <b>document-based</b> applications.|$|E
2500|$|Newfound {{goes off}} of the Summative {{assessment}} and Formative assessment continuum. Most of the teachers weigh the summatives as 90% of the overall grade for the quarter and 10% formatives for the overall grade for the quarter. Each quarter (4) is 20% of the overall grade, and exams (midterm/Test (assessment)) are 20% of the final grade. So they factor in 80% from the four quarters, and 20% from the midterm grade and the final exams. That adds up to 100% for the final grade. Formatives would be homework, short essays, and <b>Document-based</b> question. Most of the time, these materials would get you ready for the Summatives. Summatives would be quizzes (sometimes formative), projects, tests, etc. The following table shows the grading table that Newfound goes off of: ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the ensuing}} months, Jung wrote to Freud about the relationship, at first accusing Spielrein of having {{tried unsuccessfully to}} seduce him, and then admitting that he had become romantically {{involved}} with her. [...] He sent a series of letters to Spielrein's mother, writing [...] "no one can prevent two friends from doing as they wish...the likelihood is that something more may enter the relationship". [...] Spielrein also wrote to Freud, making it clear that, for a few months, their relationship had been in some fashion physical, it had involved what Spielrein again called [...] "poetry": [...] "In the end the unavoidable happened...it {{reached the point where}} he could no longer stand it and wanted 'poetry'. I could not {{and did not want to}} resist, for many reasons' [...] Eva Spielrein threatened to report him to Eugen Bleuler and came to Zurich to do so, but in the end decided not to. [...] Meanwhile, Jung had resigned his medical post at the Burghölzli, although he continued his laboratory work and university teaching. A <b>document-based</b> account of these events, including the three-way correspondence between Spielrein, Jung and Freud, appears in Launer's biography.|$|E

50|$|Cardaș {{authored}} a compendium on {{the history}} of Romanian literature. He put together numerous anthologies with good judgment and philological rigor, prefacing them with detailed studies. He devoted a good part of his activity to <b>document-based</b> literary history. He was the first to publish two works by Ion Budai-Deleanu: the second variant of Țiganiada in 1925, and the poem Trei viteji in 1928. He supervised publication of document collections, alone (Documente literare, vol. I, 1971; vol. II, 1973) or together with I. E. Torouțiu (Studii și documente literare, vol. I, 1931). He also published collections featuring poems by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and the tales of Ion Creangă and Petre Ispirescu.|$|E
50|$|Document notes {{can have}} {{parent-child}} relationships, but IBM Notes {{should not be}} considered a hierarchical database in the classic sense of information management systems. Notes databases are also not relational, although there is a SQL driver that can be used with Notes, and it does have some features {{that can be used to}} develop applications that mimic relational features. IBM Notes does not support atomic transactions, and its file locking is rudimentary. IBM Notes is a document-oriented database (<b>document-based,</b> schema-less, loosely structured) with support for rich content and powerful indexing facilities. This structure closely mimics paper-based work flows that IBM Notes is typically used to automate.|$|E

For example, when reading about computers, it featured annals since 1967 of the computer industry. Encarta also supported closed captioning for the hearing impaired. A separate program, called Encarta Research Organizer was included in early versions for gathering and organizing information and constructing a Word <b>document-based</b> report. Later versions included Encarta Researcher which was a browser plugin to organize information from Encarta articles and web pages into research projects. Content copied from Encarta was appended with a copyright boilerplate message after the selection. The user interface allowed for viewing content with only images, videos, sounds, animations, 360-degree views, virtual tours, charts and tables or only interactivities.|$|E

However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen.
