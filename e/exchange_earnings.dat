For instance, Eagle's £19 proposed fare to Malta compared with BEA's £52.60 and its £199 Singapore fare compared with a £351 fare charged by BOAC. This marked the first occasion on which a private British airline sought approval to offer scheduled fares that undercut the equivalent published fares of the state-owned airlines by a substantial margin. Eagle's low fares were designed to increase the British market share on routes the state airlines had monopolised by stimulating demand. The airline argued that the British {{economy as a whole}} would benefit if it was granted permission to offer these fares, as a consequence of additional foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>earnings</b> accruing to the UK Exchequer that resulted from boosting Britain's share of total traffic. Loss-making BEA and BOAC lodged objections with ATAC against Eagle's low-fare proposals, which were upheld.|$|E

The results show that clustering {{makes it easier for}} workers to job hop within the sector. Higher earnings levels in more agglomerated areas are partly attributable to sorting across locations among workers and firms in the industry on the basis of observable and unobservable characteristics.

Argentina's pound Sterling surpluses earned after 1946 (worth over US$200million) were made convertible to dollars by a treaty negotiated by Central Bank President Miguel Miranda; but after a year, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee suspended the provision. Perón accepted the transfer of over 24,000km (15,000mi) of British-owned railways (over half the total in Argentina) {{in exchange for the}} debt in March 1948. Due to political disputes between Perón and the U.S. government (as well as to pressure by the U.S. agricultural lobby through the Agricultural Act of 1949), Argentine foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>earnings</b> via its exports to the United States fell, turning a US$100million surplus with the United States into a US$300million deficit. The combined pressure practically devoured Argentina's liquid reserves and Miranda issued a temporary restriction on the outflow of dollars to U.S. banks. The nationalization of the Port of Buenos Aires and domestic and foreign-owned private cargo ships, as well as the purchase of others, nearly tripled the national merchant marine to 1.2million tons' displacement, reducing the need for over US$100million in shipping fees (then the largest source of Argentina's invisible balance deficit) and leading to the inauguration of the Río Santiago Shipyards at Ensenada (on line to the present day).|$|E

Hong Kong has an unique listing requirement that an underwriter issue an opinion report on the earnings forecast in the prospectus. We examine if the underwriter pressures managers to low-ball earnings forecasts in order to underprice the IPO for its institutional investors in exchange for returned trading commissions. We test the effect of the underwriterâ s commission rate, reputation, and trading commission from the IPO on the forecast bias in the prospectus. We find that the commission rate and reputation are negatively associated with the forecast bias. By using the 90 -day post-IPO trading volume as a proxy for future trading commissions generated from institutional investors, we find that the trading commission is positively associated with the forecast bias. We further find that underpricing is positively associated with the forecast bias, but the effect of the forecast bias on underpricing disappears after controlling for the underwriterâ s trading commission, consistent with the conflict of interest hypothesis. Overall, these results are consistent with the predicted effects of the underwriter on earnings forecast bias based on agency theories of Baron (1982) and Loughran and Ritter (2002) ...|$|R
