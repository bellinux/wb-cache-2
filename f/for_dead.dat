5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus <b>for</b> <b>dead,</b> even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E

Aue meets him in Ukraine during the German offensive against the Soviet Union. They both take part in battle of Stalingrad and successfully escape before the German surrender. They reunite in Berlin, with Hohenegg revealing to Max how he saved his life by convincing doctors at Stalingrad to operate on him and transport him back to Germany, rather than leaving him <b>for</b> <b>dead.</b> He is depicted at different points in the book.|$|E

Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of the Roses. Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475, and the duke was reported to have fallen overboard and drowned without any witnesses.|$|E

5|$|The diet {{consists}} of water-based and terrestrial insects, flying insects, such as {{various types of}} fly, and, to a lesser extent, tiny crustaceans and algae.

5|$|The emperor penguin's predators include {{birds and}} aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are the {{predominant}} land predator of chicks, responsible {{for up to}} 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges <b>for</b> <b>dead</b> chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked {{by the time of}} its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may defend their chick from attack, although it may be more passive if the chick is sickly.|$|E
5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him <b>for</b> <b>dead</b> in the burning laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Anarawd's brother, Cadell ap Gruffydd, {{took over}} {{as head of the}} family. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, rebuilt Carmarthen castle in 1145 then began a {{campaign}} to reclaim Ceredigion. He built a castle in the commote of Mabudryd, but Cadell, aided by Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd who held Ceredigion for Gwynedd, destroyed it in 1146. Rhys appears in the annals {{for the first time in}} 1146, fighting alongside his brothers Cadell and Maredudd in the capture by assault of Llansteffan Castle. This was followed by the capture of Wiston in 1147, Carmarthen in 1150 and Loughor in 1151. In 1151 Cadell was attacked while out hunting by a group of Norman and Flemish knights from Tenby, and left <b>for</b> <b>dead.</b> He survived, but suffered injuries which left him unable to play an active role, and in 1153 he left on a pilgrimage to Rome.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} <b>for</b> <b>dead</b> animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|E

Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and was providing information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a decontamination chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias <b>for</b> <b>dead.</b>|$|E

Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels {{to the other end of}} the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket.

5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood. As {{a consequence of}} its predilection <b>for</b> <b>dead</b> wood, the fungus {{is often associated with}} disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, wood chips or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows in sandy soil, near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.|$|E
