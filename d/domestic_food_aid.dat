The simulation experiments have shown that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> has unambiguous disincentive effects on <b>domestic</b> <b>food</b> production. The removal of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> caused a modest increase in food prices but this stimulated food production.

Consequently, the removal of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> led to improvements in aggregate household welfare.

40|$|Agricultural {{policy makers}} in the United States have become {{increasingly}} concerned with several facets of economic and structural developments in American agriculture. Over {{most of the last}} fifty years, technological innovations and various input substitutions have combined to bring about enormous increases in food supply. At this same period, the important characteristics that influence domestic demand of farm products such as prices and income elasticities of demand and population growth have been declining or growing at very slow rates. The interaction of these have resulted in lowered food prices, depressed farm incomes, labor migration and pressures on the rural community;Public policies designed to remedy the problems have generally taken the form of voluntary land retirement to control supply and expansion of demand through <b>domestic</b> <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> plans as well as international export promotion. Current changes in agricultural policy emphasis underscores the need for methods of policy analysis which can be initiated before proposed policies are implemented with unknown consequences;This study is concerned with the analysis of a supply control policy using a mathematical programming approach. A quadratic programming model of United States agriculture is used to evaluate the effects of a ten percent land set-aside policy on the equilibrium farm level prices and associated quantities demanded of principal crops and livestock products for 1985. The effect of this policy on the geographical distribution of potential capacity in U. S. agriculture is also considered;In the model, the 48 contiguous states of the United States, including the District of Columbia, is divided into 10 spatially separated consuming regions that coincide with livestock producing regions. Further, these regions are divided into 103 crop producing areas and 10 irrigated crop producing areas. A transportation sector is defined to facilitate commodity movements between the consuming regions;Results of the study indicate that the equilibrium farm level prices as well as the values of production of all commodities are increased with the set-aside policy. Moreover, the price increases cause the consumption of some products, particularly livestock products, to decline.

The country’s commercial cereal food import capacity {{has not been an}} exception as it has also been greatly affected by the poor performance of the agricultural sector and the shortage of foreign currency that hit the country in the past few years. Secondary data on <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> commercial cereal imports and cereal food production was obtained from World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) of Zimbabwe and from Zimbabwe Statistics (ZimSTATS) databases. This time series data was then analysed in the Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis. Trends observed in the time series data reveal that commercial cereal food imports and cereal <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> inflows to Zimbabwe had been increasing between 1988 and 2008. <b>Domestic</b> cereal <b>food</b> production levels however were observed to have been declining within the same period. The restricted VAR model which was specified to investigate the short and long term effects of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> on <b>food</b> production and on commercial food imports in the country revealed a low statistically significant positive relationship between <b>domestic</b> <b>food</b> production and <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> volumes. Results from the model also indicated a negative relationship between commercial food imports and <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> volumes. This means that as <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> volumes to Zimbabwe increase, the volume of commercial cereal food imported into Zimbabwe falls. This result therefore suggests that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> in the country had a displacement effect on commercial cereal food imports in the short term. The results of the Granger causality test and the estimation of the Impulse Response Functions also helped to confirm and reinforce these findings from the vector error correction model. The conclusions drawn from the study were that the responsiveness of <b>domestic</b> <b>food</b> supply, that is, cereal production, to <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> inflows in the short term has been elastic. That is to say, an increase in <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> inflows would influence an increase in the level of <b>domestic</b> <b>food</b> production in the short term. However, in the long term, findings confirm that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> does indeed discourage <b>domestic</b> <b>food</b> production in the country. Also, for the relationship between <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> and commercial <b>food</b> imports, it can be concluded from the study findings that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> in the short term has caused a reduction in commercial food imports whereas in the long term, <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> inflows have actually stimulated the commercial food import capacity.

Negotiating parties are concerned that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> {{has been used as}} a form of export competition policy, and they seek the use of coercive WTO legislation to prevent the disposal of surplus agricultural commodities as <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> Current Uruguay Round <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> guidelines are contrasted with the most recent Doha Development Agenda proposals, and the prospective effectiveness of new rules is assessed. <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> rules will be difficult to enforce within the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Understanding. Also, exogenous policy changes in donor countries are reducing the relevance of rules that target <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> as a means of surplus disposal. The future of international <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> governance in the event of a Doha Round collapse is also discussed. agricultural trade, development economics, export competition, <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> WTO, <b>Food</b> Security and Poverty, International Relations/Trade, O 13, O 19, Q 17, F 13,...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> {{may have}} {{important}} medium- to long-tenn effects, {{there is a}} glaring absence of empirical research on <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> dynamics. This paper applies structural vector autoregression and dynamic structural equations modeling methods to a panel of production, trade, and <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> data from eighteen countries over the period 1961 - 95. We find evidence of a J-curve effect of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> on recipient country commercial food imports, but only modest effects on food production. The implication is that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> primarily serves donor goals of export market development...|$|R

To establish a causal relationship, time variation in <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is exploited which is caused by fluctuations in U.

Some members desire increased disciplines on <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> while others are adamant that the WTO needs to fulfill past promises and meet the current need to increase the food security of developing countries. Underlying this debate are questions {{about the role of}} the WTO in <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> issues.

40|$|The Doha Round {{negotiation}} mandate {{proposes to}} minimise trade distortions and commercial displacement {{under the cover}} of international <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> without preventing genuine <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> from reaching people in need. This paper presents problematic aspects of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> for trade and competition, an overview of the international governance of <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> and the present rules on <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> embodied in Article 10. 4 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. The latest available Draft Modalities for Agriculture (December 2008) are seen as an only halfway successful implementation of the Doha mandate.

5000|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between the two countries were officially started in 1972, right after the independence of Bangladesh. [...] The relations took a turning point when Bangladesh signed a controversial agreement with Cuba to export jute bags in 1974. The deal enraged the United States who had hostile relations with Cuba and led to the suspension of US <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> to Bangladesh. This was followed by a devastating flood in July-August 1974 that submerged a large portion of Bangladesh and caused a severe damage to the <b>domestic</b> <b>food</b> production. As a result, the country got hit by a deadly famine that killed almost 1 million people through starvation. To allow the <b>food</b> and other <b>aid</b> from the United States, Bangladesh government cut all ties with Cuba and the bilateral relations reached the nadir. The relations got rejuvenated when former Bangladesh president Ziaur Rahman became the first Bangladeshi head of state to pay an official visit to Havana in 1979. Cubans can get Visa on arrival in Bangladesh.|$|R
