5|$|The {{rebel groups}} were collectively known as ḥarakat al-′iṣābāt, and each {{individual}} ′iṣābā {{was composed of}} anywhere between 30 and 100 rebels known as mujahidin and were led by a ra'īs (commander), who was often a local notable or {{the head of a}} major clan. Individual ′iṣābāt began forming in the countryside between Aleppo and Anatolia in 1919 to counter French advances, but Hananu gradually consolidated them into <b>his</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{developing}} the core {{concepts of the}} show, Abrams began to seek studios to develop the show; Abrams' past successes led to Warner Bros. Television and the Fox Television Network to quickly jump on board the project. Peter Roth, {{the chief executive of}} Warner Bros. Television, had been actively seeking to bring any Abrams' project to his studio, and heard Abrams' pitch for Fringe at a dinner meeting in August 2007. Similarly, Kevin Reilly, the entertainment chairman at Fox, knew that it was critical for him to bring the next Abrams' project to <b>his</b> <b>network,</b> and worked with Roth to assure this would happen.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned {{almost all}} of his lands fully, as an owner in fee simple, rather than having his rights diluted through {{arrangements}} with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates were administered separately from his other holdings in England and Wales. Bute continued to run <b>his</b> <b>network</b> of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend.|$|E

5|$|War now {{broke out}} between Henry and his brothers. Henry mobilised a {{mercenary}} {{army in the}} west of Normandy, but as William Rufus and Robert's forces advanced, <b>his</b> <b>network</b> of baronial support melted away. Henry focused his remaining forces at Mont Saint-Michel, where he was besieged, probably in March 1091. The site was easy to defend, but lacked fresh water. The chronicler William of Malmesbury suggested that when Henry's water ran short, Robert allowed his brother fresh supplies, leading to remonstrations between Robert and William Rufus. The events of {{the final days of}} the siege are unclear: the besiegers had begun to argue about the future strategy for the campaign, but Henry then abandoned Mont Saint-Michel, probably as part of a negotiated surrender. He left for Brittany and crossed over into France.|$|E
5|$|Washington countered Trotter's attacks with {{a variety}} of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, {{including}} at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used <b>his</b> <b>network</b> to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others. Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice. As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback.|$|E
5|$|While Morrowind {{contains}} many quests and storylines, the central plot revolves around The Tribunal, a triumvirate of god-like beings ruling over Morrowind, and their struggle against a former ally, the deity Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House – a cult of followers stretching out from Red Mountain, the volcanic center of Vvardenfell, the island {{on which the}} game is set. Dagoth Ur has used the Heart of Lorkhan, an artifact of great power, to make himself immortal and now seeks to drive the Imperial Legion occupiers from Morrowind using <b>his</b> <b>network</b> of spies, as well as Akulakhan, an enormous mechanical golem powered by the Heart of Lorkhan.|$|E

5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition looked more appealing. He was now able to control both programming content on <b>his</b> <b>network</b> and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 alone. At the same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on this growing market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul.|$|E
5|$|Edward was {{responsible}} for implementing royal justice through <b>his</b> <b>network</b> of judges and officials. It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but {{he appears to have}} involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322. Edward made extensive use of Roman civil law during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning the established principles of the English Common Law. Edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although just how widely they did so is unclear. Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local gentry; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.|$|E
5|$|For a period, the {{situation}} continued to worsen. Ranulf of Chester revolted {{once again in}} the summer of 1144, splitting up Stephen's Honour of Lancaster between himself and Prince Henry. In the west, Robert of Gloucester and his followers continued to raid the surrounding royalist territories, and Wallingford Castle remained a secure Angevin stronghold, too close to London for comfort. Meanwhile, Geoffrey of Anjou finished securing his hold on southern Normandy and in January 1144 he advanced into Rouen, the capital of the duchy, concluding his campaign. Louis VII recognised him as Duke of Normandy shortly after. By this point in the war, Stephen was depending increasingly on his immediate royal household, such as William of Ypres and others, and lacked the support of the major barons who {{might have been able to}} provide him with significant additional forces; after the events of 1141, Stephen made little use of <b>his</b> <b>network</b> of earls.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{designated}} as KBAY-TV, the construction permit for the station went through many owners from the 1950s onward. The KEMO call letters were originally assigned to U.S. Communications, a broadcaster owned by Daniel H. Overmyer, {{owner of the}} short-lived Overmyer Network (later called the United Network); Overmyer used his initials as the last three letters of the Toledo, Ohio station (WDHO-TV, now WNWO-TV), which {{was already on the}} air, and his children's initials for the remaining five stations in <b>his</b> <b>network,</b> whose licenses were not granted until December 12, 1967, after <b>his</b> <b>network</b> folded.|$|E
