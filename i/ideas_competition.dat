25|$|Whilst the {{passenger}} terminal remained an important transport hub {{in the decades}} subsequent to its completion, decline in cruise ship travel in the early 1980s meant that by 1983, the Overseas Passenger Terminal structure lay virtually empty and was derelict. As a result of this, the New South Wales Department of Public Works launched an <b>ideas</b> <b>competition</b> for the revitalisation and renovation of the terminal building. Eventually won by the conceptual work of Peter Tonkin (now of Tonkin Zulaikha Greer Architects), the project opened up the site to retail and restaurant opportunities, transforming {{the function of the}} terminal from purely infrastructure to a public place of meeting and entertainment. Introduction of these retail spaces, along with the opening of a new southern forecourt bounded by the bounding and surrounding heritage items were all part of a re-imagining and transformation of the Circular Quay West precinct from an infrastructural and commercial transport hub into a public waterfront promenade. These major renovations including the structural re-cladding and partial demolition were made by Tonkin in collaboration with prominent Australian architect Lawrence Nield and completed in 1988 for the Australian Bicentenary.|$|E

30|$|The {{success of}} <b>idea</b> <b>competitions</b> as a {{mechanism}} for acquiring ideas is challenging because very few ideas are selected from a huge pool of ideas submitted on crowdsourcing platforms (Mortara et al. 2013). However, <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> brings some benefits such as improved intelligence and public relations. Comparing 218 ideas from an <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> with 52 <b>ideas</b> from focus groups, Schweitzer et al. (2012) found that <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> yields more <b>ideas</b> with lower cost per idea than focus groups which yield, however, richer interaction with users.|$|R
30|$|<b>Idea</b> <b>competition</b> is a {{valuable}} option to generate ideas with limited costs (Weeks and Veltri 2013).

30|$|Even though {{crowdsourcing}} {{has been}} proven as a promising choice for idea generation, its potential to capture value still remains under a great debate. Crowds offer ideas that they believe to have better solution based on their experiences whereas professionals of a firm generate ideas which should compile with resources and business strategy of firms. One popular manifestation of crowdsourcing is <b>idea</b> <b>competition.</b> However, when should firms go for <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> and for what kind of problems (complex to simple) is an unanswered question in the literature.|$|R
40|$|Online {{collaboration}} {{is a powerful}} tool for boosting idea generation in large corporations. However, management may experience an overload of proposals from employees. To improve front-end innovation, the Danish industrial biotech company Novozymes implemented an internal <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> in which {{a relatively small number of}} highly motivated participants screened their colleagues' inventions through an "idea market. " The <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> fulfilled its goals of generating two ideas with high growth potential within a short time, uncovering and recombining old proposals that inventors had not previously been able to advance in the organization and focusing managerial attention on the selection process. The campaign is an effective tool to recombine existing knowledge that had not been utilized. The process demonstrated that asking participants to comment on proposals improves idea generation and screening and that active involvement of R&D management is a key success factor in any <b>idea</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|R

30|$|From a {{hands-on}} experience, Jouret (2009) discovered that crowdsourcing {{is not so}} simple rather it requires much more than simply developing an online platform and putting up reward. Running an <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> requires sheer labor and involves high complexity. Kaikati and Kaikati (2013) demonstrated cashless crowdsourcing models. They claimed that examples such as Wikipedia, Threadless – an online t-shirt selling firm, and Txteagle – cell phone for micro tasking from emerging countries are well known examples of cashless crowdsourcing. Lauto et al. (2013) argued how online collaboration is a powerful means for idea generation in large firms. Based on an <b>idea</b> <b>competition,</b> they found that asking participants to comments on ideas improve idea generation and screening. They suggest that active involvement of R&D management is a key success factor in an <b>idea</b> <b>competition.</b> Organizations can use competitions to enhance R&D portfolio and engage user communities by embracing diverse risk-takers and investors (Wagner 2011).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{implementation}} of game mechanics (like points or leadersboards) {{in a serious}} context is called “gamification”. In this explorative analysis of a single case participants of an online <b>idea</b> <b>competition</b> were asked about their motives for participation, flow, enjoyment, task involvement and their perception of game mechanics with respect to flow, enjoyment and task involvement. The results indicate that game mechanics may be a solution to address the main challenges of online <b>idea</b> <b>competitions.</b> However, the analyzed case illustrates also that if game mechanics are applied inadequately and unsophisticatedly they {{are not able to}} unfold their potential. ...|$|R
