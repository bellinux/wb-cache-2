50|$|For modern glass optical fiber, {{the maximum}} {{transmission}} distance is limited not by direct material absorption but by {{several types of}} dispersion, or spreading of optical pulses as they travel along the fiber. Dispersion in optical fibers {{is caused by a}} variety of factors. <b>Intermodal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> caused by the different axial speeds of different transverse modes, limits the performance of multi-mode fiber. Because single-mode fiber supports only one transverse mode, <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> is eliminated.|$|E
50|$|Modal {{dispersion}} is a distortion mechanism {{occurring in}} multimode fibers and other waveguides, {{in which the}} signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal {{is not the same}} for all modes. Other names for this phenomenon include multimode distortion, multimode dispersion, modal distortion, intermodal distortion, <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> and intermodal delay distortion.|$|E
30|$|<b>Intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> (also called modal dispersion) is the {{phenomenon}} {{that the group}} velocity of light propagating in a multimode fiber (or other waveguide) depends {{not only on the}} optical frequency (chromatic dispersion) but also on the propagation mode involved. The strength of <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> can be quantified as the differential mode delay (DMD). It depends strongly on the refractive index profile of the fiber in and around the fiber core. For example, for a step-index profile the higher-order modes have lower group velocities, and this can lead to differential group delays of the order of 10 ps/m = 10 ns/km. It is then hardly possible to realize data rates of multiple Gbit/s in an fiber-optic link with a kilometer length. In systems for optical fiber communications based on multimode fibers, <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> can severely limit the achievable data transmission rate (bit rate). In order to avoid strong signal distortion, it is usually necessary to keep the pulses long enough to maintain a reasonable temporal overlap of components from different modes, and this unavoidably sets a limit on the data rate. The natural way of eliminating <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> is to use fiber links based on single-mode fibers, but <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> can also be minimized by using multimode fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile, where <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> is minimized. In case of graded index fiber, critical angle condition is satisfied at different distances from the axis of the core for different modes as refractive index is decreasing from the axis up to core cladding interface. The wave which is internally reflected near axis travel less distance but will also have low velocity due to higher refractive index. On the other hand, wave reflected near the interface will travel more distance but with higher velocity due to smaller refractive index. Hence, the time to reach the other end will be same for these waves which means no <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion.</b>|$|E

Unfortunately, due to physical and computational complexity limitations, we cannot couple and detect hundreds of data streams {{into and out}} of the fiber. In order to circumvent this issue, we present input-output coupling schemes that allow the user to couple and extract a reasonable number of signals from a fiber with many modes. This approach is particularly attractive as it is scalable; i. e., the fibers do not have to be replaced every time the number of transmitters or receivers is increased, a phenomenon that is likely to happen in the near future. We present a statistical channel model that incorporates <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> chromatic dispersion, mode dependent losses, mode coupling, and input-output coupling. We show that the statistics of the fiber's frequency response are independent of frequency. This simplifies the computation of the average Shannon capacity of the fiber.

The tapered bend-insensitive fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer (BIF-MZI) is firstly fabricated and used as a fiber vibrometer. The unique double-cladding structure of bend-insensitive fiber not only provides higher mechanical strength to the sensor, but also guarantees a more uniform transmission spectrum， since only a few inner-cladding modes are left interfering with the core mode. A high sensitivity and fast response intensity demodulation scheme is employed by monitoring the power fluctuation of the BIF-MZI at the operation wavelength. Both damped and continuous vibrations are detected using the proposed sensor. It is demonstrated that this sensor responses to an extremely wide range of frequencies from 1 Hz up to 500 kHz with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The discrimination of temperature and axial strain is realized based on the dispersion effects of high-order-mode fiber (HOMF) by forming a single mode fiber-high-order-mode fiber-single mode fiber (SMF-HOMF-SMF) structure based in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Unlike some kinds of in-line MZIs such as tapered and core–offset structures whose cladding modes are excited with different types under changing temperature and strain circumstances, the HOMF is capable of supporting three stable core modes, which guarantees a reliable and repeatable measurements within a large temperature or strain range. A new method based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed to analyze the mode couplings and their chromatic dispersion and <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> properties in HOMF. The strong dispersion effects lead to a multi-peak feature in the spatial frequency spectrum. It is found that peaks that denote the waveform periods at positions that are beyond the critical wavelength possess highly sensitive and distinct phase responses to external disturbances, which provides the possibility to realize the discrimination measurements with high sensitivities and smaller errors by selecting appropriate peaks. The phase demodulation scheme is applied to quantify the temperature and strain changes in terms of phase shifts. Appropriate peak selections according to the practical needs would provide an easy access for applications where more than two parameters are required to be discriminated...|$|E
40|$|Several {{significant}} wave propagation {{problems in the}} fields of nonlinear optics and hydrodynamics are studied in this thesis. In optics, the physical model considered is the two-core optical fiber (TCF), which is an essential component of lightwave technology. In hydrodynamics, the motion of a wave packet on the free surface of water of finite depth allowing modulations from two mutually perpendicular and horizontal directions, governed by the famous Davey-Stewartson (DS) equations, is taken into account. The main contributions of this thesis are: In optics, the effects of the <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> (IMD) and the birefringence induced effects, both of which always exist in the TCFs, have been ignored in the previous studies of the modulation instability (MI) of continuous waves (CWs) in the TCFs. In this thesis, a detailed analysis of these effects on the MI spectra has been done. It is found that IMD does not seriously affect the MI spectra of the symmetric/antisymmetric CW states, but can significantly modify the MI spectra of the asymmetric CW states. In exploring the birefringence induced effects, a particular class of asymmetric CW states, which admits analytical solutions and has no counterpart in the single-core fibers, is focused on. It is found that the MI spectra of a birefringent TCF in the normal dispersion regime can be distinctively different from those of a zero-birefringence TCF especially for the circular-birefringence TCF. All the findings of MI analysis can be well verified by the wave propagation dynamics. Another contribution of this thesis is that we find the dramatic pulse distortion and even pulse splitting phenomenon due to IMD in TCFs, which is unexpected in many situations, can be effectively suppressed and even avoided by Kerr nonlinearity, which has never been reported in the literatures in the studies of TCFs. In hydrodynamics, DS equations describe the evolution of weakly nonlinear, weakly dispersive wavepackets with slow spanwise dependences on a fluid of finite depth. Generally, DS equations are divided into two types e, i. e. DSI and DSII equations, depending on the specific fluid configurations (fluid depth, wavelength of the water wave, surface tension etc). Due to the importance of DS equations, many exact solutions have been derived by different nonlinear wave methods over the years in the literature. In this thesis, two new exact doubly periodic wave patterns of DS equations are derived by the use of properties of the theta functions, or equivalently, the Jacobi elliptic functions, and the corresponding solitary waves are also deduced in the long wave limits. The new feature of the two wave patterns found is that they can be applied to both DSI and DSII systems at the same time. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} optical fibres to wideband communications demands the utilisation of fibres exhibiting very low attenuation and high bandwidth at the wavelength of operation. This thesis describes an {{experimental study of}} the homogeneous chemical vapour deposition (HCVD) technique, a convenient process for the manufacture of ultra-pure waveguide glasses. Objectives of the programme included the development of technologies which could be adopted by industry for the routine manufacture of high-quality optical fibres. Aspects of the work have included not only optimisation of the HCVD and fibre-driving processes but also the development of protective coatings which preserve the physical and optical performance of the fibres. A lathe-based system has been constructed for the manufacture of optical-fibre preforms by HCVD, and evaluation of fibres prepared by HCVD {{has led to the}} development of ternary phosphogermanosilicate glasses for use as the core glass in multimode fibres. The fibre drawing operation is described, and, in particular, it is shown that the addition of a fibre diameter measuring system led to important refinements to the preform-manufacturing and fibre-drawing processes. Multimode graded-index fibres have been produced in lengths in excess of 5 km, with numerical apertures up to 0. 25, attenuation as low as 0. 8 dB/km, and <b>intermodal</b> <b>dispersion</b> as low as 0. 3 ns/km; fibres suitable for operation in the 1. 3 µm and 1. 55 µm regions have been prepared. The versatility of the HCVD process has enabled low-loss monomode fibres to be fabricated. In addition, a monomode fibre having a linear birefringence of less than 3 °/m has been manufactured for transducer applications; this represents the lowest value reported to date for the birefringence of an optical fibre. Techniques have been developed for the application of a surface-protective coating to fibres in-line with drawing. Using a thick primary coating of a thermosetting silicone elastomer, it has been possible to maintain the high inherent strength of freshly-drawn fibres without degrading their optical performance; a median tensile strength of 5. 2 GN/m 2 was obtained in 100 m gauge-length samples. An experimental evaluation of materials suitable for providing a tough outer jacket over primary-coated fibres is described. An extrusion line has been developed for applying thermoplastic jackets, and by using nylon- 6 as the jacketing material, it has been possible to provide an excellent degree of microbending resistance and mechanical protection without compromising the fibres' performance. Suitably protected graded-index fibres have been cabled and installed in a particularly severe environment, where they form part of an optical link transmitting video signals and high bit-rate digital data. The performance of the fibres within the link surpassed initial expectations, and confirmed the capabilities of the fibre manufacturing technology...|$|E
