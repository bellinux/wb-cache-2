5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

Rock, a fan of West's, mused that he was more than happy to {{collaborate}} with West, and said, [...] "you'd be amazed at how many people want to work with you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> ask, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> make a call." [...] He had previously collaborated on other hip hop songs, such as with rappers Ludacris, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Ice Cube on the track [...] "You Ain't Gotta Lie (Ta Kick It)". Rock described his collaboration with West as exciting in nature, commenting that he was always open to working on unusual ventures.

But if you get too close, it can torch you and kill you. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> get close enough, it's warm and it's soothing, it's mesmerising and it's peaceful. It can give you everything or destroy you, depending on how smart you are." [...] The cover sleeve was shot by Joshua Jordan.|$|E
500|$|... "Open Your Heart" [...] has a {{continuous}} percussion filled structure and a chorus sounding like Belinda Carlisle, according to author Rikky Rooksby {{in his book}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna. Lyrically, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is a simple love song. According to Professor Mavis Tsai, the phrase [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] {{is a metaphor for}} the act of being vulnerable that corresponds to the behavior involved in developing an intimate or close relationship. The following lines in the song, [...] "Open Your Heart, I'll make you love me; It's not that hard, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> turn the key" [...] illustrate this metaphor vividly. The concept of the song places Madonna as a victim of love.|$|E
500|$|He cut the show's famous opening number, [...] "The Ballad of Sweeney Todd", explaining, [...] "Why have {{a chorus}} singing about 'attending {{the tale of}} Sweeney Todd' when you could {{just go ahead and}} attend it?" [...] Sondheim {{acknowledged}} that, in adapting a musical to film, the plot has to be kept moving, and was sent MP3 files of his shortened songs by Mike Higham, the film's music producer, for approval. Several other songs were also cut, and Sondheim noted that there were [...] "many changes, additions and deletions..... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> go along with it, I think you'll have a spectacular time." [...] To create a larger, more cinematic feel, the score was re-orchestrated by the stage musical's original orchestrator, Jonathan Tunick, who increased the orchestra from 27 musicians to 78.|$|E

500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, {{the lyrics}} {{seemingly}} show the evolving {{relationship between the}} couple. Carey sings Anytime you need a friend / I will be here / You'll never be alone again / So don't you fear / Even if you're miles away / I'm by your side / So don't you ever be lonely / Love will make it alright, which hints at a current friendship where more still uncovered emotions are present. Author Chris Nickson explains on the song's switch in relationship, as the lyrics change to <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> believe in me / I will love you endlessly / Take my hand / Take me into your heart / I'll be there forever baby / I won't let go / I'll never let go. The protagonist is {{willing to accept the}} relationship as only a friend, but tells her partner that no matter his feelings for her, she loves him and still wishes to be loved by him, something she will never forget or [...] "let go".|$|E

Simon has been credited as [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Ken Levine says he [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that Simon's [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon saw The Simpsons {{as a chance to}} solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> listen to the sound track, it works."

500|$|Fraser McAlpine from BBC complimented {{the song}} and Kesha for knowing her way around a strong pop chorus, giving the single {{four out of five}} stars. McAlpine noted that [...] "some {{evidence}} of range would be welcomed at this point, [...] there's a whole other side to her that you'd never know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> listened to the singles" [...] commenting that her persona was the [...] "boozy floozy card" [...] and that the power ballads on her album could have been better for a release. He went on to conclude [...] "even though her 'act' is to be far too revealing about her dirty habits, she has still managed to create something of a mystique cloud around herself". Billboard magazine's Monica Herrera was impressed with the song, calling it [...] "blissful". She went on to compliment the song for its strong chorus that has the ability to [...] "stick with the listener for days". Sara Anderson of AOL Radio called the song [...] "a playful take on a teen love obsession", complimenting [...] "Kesha's signature auto-tuned vocals and casual chatty ad-libs". Anderson commented on the chorus of the song calling it [...] "a modern Cyndi Lauper-inspired chorus". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was positive in his review of the song, calling it [...] "a fun little disco tune", and wrote that the singer [...] "isn't reinventing the wheel {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, but she has her share of catchy would-be hits." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

500|$|Simon {{has been}} {{credited}} with [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Former Simpsons director Brad Bird has described him as [...] "the unsung hero" [...] of the show, while Vitti has stated to [...] "leave out Sam Simon" [...] is to tell [...] "the managed version" [...] of The Simpsons history, because [...] "he was the guy we wrote for." [...] Writer Ken Levine called Simon [...] "the real creative force behind The Simpsons...The tone, the storytelling, the level of humor – that was all developed on Sam's watch." [...] Levine says that Simon [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that his [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon crafted {{much of the world}} of Springfield and designed the models for many of the show's recurring characters, including Mr. Burns, Dr. Hibbert, Chief Wiggum and Eddie and Lou, as well as many of the one-time and guest star roles, such as Bleeding Gums Murphy. One of his contributions to the show's character development was his proposal that Waylon Smithers should be gay, but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it; Smithers' sexuality became one of the show's longest-running gags. [...] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other.

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street {{and some of}} the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would look more like a tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of the palm trees to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia. A section of the plot is set in the Argentine coastal city of Villa Gesell, but was filmed in another province of the country with no beach but with mountains instead. Wenders]]' Paris, Texas? Hold on a little, people. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> checked with Google maps...." [...] Washington, D.C., the Mojave Desert and Fox's soundstages in Los Angeles also served as locations. The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X-Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films. Both the submarine and the X-Jet were built on hydraulic sets so that they could be rotated for the vehicles' movements. Principal photography ended in December, but additional filming, primarily in California at Los Angeles and Long Beach, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post-production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had [...] "never worked under such time pressure". The film cost approximately $160million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around $140million.|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E
