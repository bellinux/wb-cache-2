5|$|Because the {{affected}} area is extremely remote, distributing the relief supplies was difficult. Reaching some villages would require a five-hour drive over unpaved roads, some of which had collapsed or <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> by landslides during the earthquake. Helicopters were used to provide supplies to some otherwise inaccessible areas.|$|E
5|$|The second renovation, {{completed}} August 24, 1931 {{by former}} Wright assistant William Drummond, modernized {{many of the}} interior elements, including new elevators, and brought period touches to the building, such as Art Deco detailing. The third renovation, in 1992, brought the building back to much of its original splendor, reopening the light court ceiling after it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> over to protect against leaks.|$|E
5|$|During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 {{million years}} ago) the {{conifers}} flourished and became adapted {{to live in}} all the major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period. These began to dominate the conifers during the Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the globe. When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and {{the first of four}} ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> by ice, only to be driven back again in the next ice age.|$|E

50|$|Zone 3 - Areas less {{hazardous}} than zone 2 {{because of}} greater distance from recently active vents and (or) because of topography. 1-5% of zone 3 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> since 1800, and 15-75% <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> {{within the past}} 750 years.|$|R
5|$|From 1975 until 1982, $606 {{million of}} local and {{national}} community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for revitalization, uncovering the rivers (which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> by paved bridges), relocating a large section of railroad underground, creating Waterplace Park and river walks along the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the 1.4 million ft² Providence Place Mall.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the changes to the ride in 1990, the special effects began to {{deteriorate}} {{due to a lack}} of upkeep. By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> up. Blacklight reactant paint lined the walls, mostly in the form of handprints or outlines of scenes. These gave a 3-D appearance when the rider wore special glasses purchased at the beginning of the queue.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office {{investigated}} Borislav Pelević, {{a former}} SDG member {{and a member}} of the Serbian National Assembly. The investigation was ultimately dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2012, former SDG member Srđan Golubović was arrested in Belgrade at the request of the Prosecutor's Office. Golubović was charged with an indictment listing the names of 78 victims. Clint Williamson, the lead prosecutor, said that other members of the SDG could not be identified because their faces <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> with masks. As of October 2014, closing arguments had been concluded in the trial of Karadžić, the former President of Republika Srpska, for the massacre, and other crimes against humanity committed in Bijeljina, among other areas, as well as for the genocide at Srebrenica. The ICTY is expected to deliver judgment in Karadžić's case in the first quarter of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered,</b> the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th {{century the}} Lower Ward was rebuilt in stone by Reynold Mohun; this {{was paid for}} in part by Reynold {{commuting}} his tenants' ongoing duty to repair the castle walls into a single, one-off financial payment to their lord, and partially through his marriage to a rich local heiress. A survey of the castle in 1266 described the Upper Ward {{on the top of}} the motte as containing a hall with a buttery, a pantry, a kitchen, a bakehouse, the chapel of Saint Stephen and a knight's hall, guarded by three towers. The Lower Ward included a granary, two towers and a gatehouse; one of the towers, called the Fleming Tower, was used as a prison. The castle stables lay outside the defences, further down the slope. By the end of the 13th century some of the castle's roofing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> in lead, while other parts still used wooden shingles.|$|E

5|$|The first {{renovation}} in the 20thcentury {{occurred in}} 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts {{and local officials}} to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs. Severe damage {{was caused by the}} 1837 and 1927 earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E

25|$|An $18 million {{renovation}} {{began in}} 1977.

Contradictions between this affidavit and the facts as recorded {{at the time in}} Halt's memo and tape recording have been pointed out.|$|E
