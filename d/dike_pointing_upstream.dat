50|$|The keep of {{this island}} castle, a {{pentagonal}} tower with its <b>point</b> <b>upstream,</b> was erected 1326 to 1327 by King Ludwig the Bavarian. Around the tower, a defensive hexagonal wall was built between 1338 to 1340. In 1477 Pfalzgrafenstein was passed as deposit to the Count of Katzenelnbogen. Later additions {{were made in}} 1607 and 1755, consisting of corner turrets, the gun bastion <b>pointing</b> <b>upstream,</b> and the characteristic baroque tower cap.|$|R

25|$|Situated on {{the fall}} line, Georgetown was the {{farthest}} <b>point</b> <b>upstream</b> that oceangoing boats could navigate the Potomac River. In 1632, English fur trader Henry Fleet documented a Native American village of the Nacotchtank people called Tohoga {{on the site}} of present-day Georgetown and established trade there. The area was then part of the Province of Maryland, an English colony.|$|R
50|$|Beverly {{played host to}} {{hundreds}} of railroad workers from 1905-1920s when the Milwaukee Railroad was being built. The Milwaukee constructed a million-dollar bridge across the Columbia just north of Beverly, which was completed in 1909. Supplies to build the bridge were shipped via steamboat from <b>points</b> <b>upstream,</b> and were hauled in on other rail lines. The bridge took nearly two years to complete.|$|R
50|$|The Burnt River is a 98 mi {{tributary}} of the Snake River in eastern Oregon, United States. It enters the Snake near Huntington, Oregon, at a <b>point</b> <b>upstream</b> of the Powder River and downstream of the Malheur River, slightly more than 327 mi from the Snake's confluence with the Columbia River. Draining 1090 mi2 km2, it flows predominately west to east.|$|R

2500|$|A {{shock wave}} may be {{described}} as the furthest <b>point</b> <b>upstream</b> of a moving object which [...] "knows" [...] about the approach of the object. In this description, the shock wave position is defined as the boundary between the zone having no information about the shock-driving event and the zone aware of the shock-driving event, analogous with the light cone described in the theory of special relativity.|$|R
50|$|Today, two ferry {{services}} {{cross the}} Hawkesbury River {{from the town}} of Wisemans Ferry. The eponymous Wisemans Ferry crosses the river to a point down-stream of its confluence with the Macdonald River, connecting with the old Great North Road. Webbs Creek Ferry crosses to a <b>point</b> <b>upstream</b> of the confluence, connecting with the St Albans Road that follows {{the west bank of the}} Macdonald River.|$|R
50|$|Some 1300 mi {{from the}} mouth of the Congo River, Kisangani is the {{farthest}} navigable <b>point</b> <b>upstream.</b> Kisangani is the nation's most important inland port after Kinshasa, an important commercial hub point for river and land transportation and a major marketing and distribution centre for the north-eastern part of the country. It has been the commercial capital of the northern Congo since the late 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|Saint Anthony Falls or the Falls of Saint Anthony, located {{northeast}} of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{was the only}} natural major waterfall on the Upper Mississippi River. The natural falls were replaced by a concrete overflow spillway (also called an [...] "apron") after it partially collapsed in 1869. Later, in the 1950s and 1960s, a series of locks and dams was constructed to extend navigation to <b>points</b> <b>upstream.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{topographic}} maps, stream gradient can {{be easily}} approximated if {{the scale of the}} map and the contour intervals are known. Contour lines form a V-shape on the map, <b>pointing</b> <b>upstream.</b> By counting the number of lines that cross a certain segment of a stream, multiplying this by the contour interval, and dividing that quantity by the length of the stream segment, one obtains an approximation to the stream gradient.|$|R
50|$|The ferry {{is one of}} two cable ferry {{crossings}} in {{the community}} of Wisemans Ferry, the other being Webbs Creek Ferry, which crosses the Hawkesbury River to a <b>point</b> <b>upstream</b> of the confluence with the Macdonald River. Two other such ferries cross the Hawkesbury River proper, these being the Sackville Ferry and the Lower Portland Ferry, whilst a fifth ferry, the Berowra Waters Ferry, crosses a side-arm of the river.|$|R
2500|$|Aylesworth Creek is {{designated}} as an impaired stream from a <b>point</b> <b>upstream</b> of the Edgerton Reservoir downstream to its mouth. The {{causes of the}} impairment have at various times included pH, metals, and flow alterations and {{the sources of the}} impairment have included abandoned mine drainage and resource extraction. A total of [...] of the unnamed tributary UNT 28567 is impaired, with the cause being flow alterations and the source being abandoned mine drainage.|$|R
2500|$|Weirs {{can have}} a {{significant}} effect on fish migration. Any weir that exceeds either the maximum vertical height a species can jump or creates flow conditions that cannot be bypassed (e.g., due to excessive water velocity) effectively limits the maximum <b>point</b> <b>upstream</b> that fish can migrate. In some cases this can mean that huge lengths of breeding habitat are lost and over time this {{can have a}} significant impact of fish populations.|$|R

50|$|This is {{the same}} as a Donkey Flip / Airscrew, but the back of the paddler is <b>pointed</b> <b>upstream</b> the entire time. Some people claim they can do one, but {{it turns out to be}} a {{relatively}} straight back pan-am, (yet not straight enough to be a Back Airscrew) though they try to cover it up by quickly moving into a straight angle at the end. But with good practice, one can actually perform one.|$|R

50|$|In the 1870s, the Sacrow-Paretz Canal was {{constructed}} to link Paretz with the Jungfernsee, near Potsdam, thus providing a shorter navigation route to Berlin and <b>points</b> <b>upstream</b> for vessels navigating the River Havel. In the 1950s, the Havel Canal {{was constructed}} to link Paretz with Hennigsdorf, significantly further upstream than Potsdam and avoiding a {{passage through the}} reach of the River Havel that was under the political control of West Berlin. Both canals are still in use, providing shorter routes for shipping from the west to Berlin and to the Oder-Havel Canal and Poland.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Yenisei bridge, the piers of the Amur bridge had massive buttresses <b>pointing</b> <b>upstream,</b> {{designed}} as inclined planes toward the current {{for the purpose}} of preventing ice from piling up against the piers. The height of the bridge from the upper deck to the maximum water surface elevation reached 12 m. It allowed larger ships to pass underneath the bridge even at the highest summer water level in the Amur. The bridge cost the Russian treasury more than 13 million roubles — a colossal sum of money for those times.|$|R
50|$|Operation Plunder, the Rhine crossing, {{began on}} the night of 23 March 1945. As well as the Staffordshire Yeomanry, DD tanks {{equipped}} the American 736th and 738th Tank Battalions and the British 44th Royal Tank Regiment. Some tanks were lost in the river, but the crossings were considered a success. The tanks were launched from <b>points</b> <b>upstream</b> from their objectives, to take account of the Rhine's strong current. Mats laid at the objective points (carried across beforehand by Buffalos) allowed the DDs to climb the steep, muddy banks of the river.|$|R
