50|$|The 'Old Wood' {{containing}} the ice {{house has a}} good plant diversity {{due to the fact}} that it is long established and relatively undisturbed, unlike the park's plantations which are of a comparatively recent origin. Chapelholms wood shows a similar high biodiversity. Plants such as dog's mercury, tussock grass, bluebells and honeysuckle are indicators of old deciduous woodlands. Snowdrops are a highlight of spring in the park. A few specimen trees from the estate days survive, especially sycamores (Acer pseudoplatanus) or plane trees as they are traditionally known in Scotland. The park is one of the relatively few sites in Scotland where the upright <b>hedge</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium album) grows.|$|E
50|$|The open {{grassland}} {{is rich in}} herbs, with fescues Festuca ovina and Festuca pratensis, crested dog’s tail Cynosurus cristatus, spring sedge Carex caryophyllea, and locally quaking grass Briza media as dominants. Abundant herbs include ladys’ bedstraw Galium vernum, <b>hedge</b> <b>bedstraw</b> Galium mollugo, creeping thistle Cirsium acaule, fairy flax Linum catharticum, bird’s-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, horseshoe vetch Hippocrepis comosa, kidney vetch Anthyllis vulneraria, chalk milkwort Polygala calcarea and felwort Gentianella amarella and several species of orchids. There is also Rock Rose, Wild Thyme, and Clustered Bellflower. These flowers in turn provide for rare invertebrates such as Osmia bicolor, a scarce solitary bee. There is a decidedly neutral element in the flora {{which suggests that the}} soils may in part be derived from superficial drift or loess.|$|E
