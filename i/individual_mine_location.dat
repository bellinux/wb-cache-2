50|$|Since {{the onset}} of {{concerns}} regarding diamond origins, {{research has been conducted}} to determine if the <b>mining</b> <b>location</b> could be determined for an emerald already in circulation. Traditional research used qualitative guidelines such as an emerald’s color, style and quality of cutting, type of fracture filling, and/or the anthropological origins of the artifacts bearing the mineral to determine the emerald's <b>mine</b> <b>location.</b> More recent studies using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy methods have uncovered trace chemical element differences between emeralds; even emeralds mined within close proximity to one another. American gemologist David Cronin and his colleagues have extensively examined the chemical signatures of emeralds resulting from fluid dynamics and subtle precipitation mechanisms, and their research demonstrated the chemical homogeneity of emeralds from the same <b>mining</b> <b>location</b> and the statistical differences that exist between emeralds from different <b>mining</b> <b>locations,</b> including those between the three locations: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor, in Colombia, South America.|$|R
