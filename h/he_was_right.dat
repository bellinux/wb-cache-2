5|$|Irene is a Neoclassical tragedy written between 1726 and 1749 by Samuel Johnson. It has the {{distinction}} of being the work Johnson considered his greatest failure. Since his death, the critical consensus has been that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to think so.|$|E
5|$|Although one bomb did detonate, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) {{views the}} {{operation}} a success, {{as the other}} three did not, and no civilians were killed. Ben tells Lucas <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> about Jawad; he chose to become a bomber over seeing his family. Lucas receives a call from Marlin, who asks to meet with him. During the confrontation, Marlin admits {{he was forced to}} become Mr. Big when terrorists kidnapped his family. Now knowing he has failed, he commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|The four theses {{stem from}} the synod of 1637, and herein Wheelwright portrays himself as an {{orthodox}} minister {{following the lead of}} such early reformers as Calvin, Zanchi, the Synod of Dort, Beza, Perkins and others. As his theses become repetitious of his propositions, they become abbreviated, and he returns to the accusations made in Short Story. He ends his work claiming that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> all along, and that he was not an Antinomian.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union {{supported}} the Vietnamese in their 1978 invasion of Cambodia, an invasion {{considered by the}} First World, most notably the United States, and the People's Republic of China {{to be under the}} direct command of the Soviet Union. The USSR also became the largest backer of the new puppet state in Cambodia, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). In a 1979 summit Jimmy Carter complained to Brezhnev about the presence of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia, to which Brezhnev replied that the citizens of the PRK were delighted about the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge-led government; in this, as historian Archie Brown notes, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, Marvel hired Jon Favreau {{to direct}} Iron Man, with Arthur Marcum & Matt Holloway, and Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby writing {{competing}} scripts. Favreau consolidated both into one script, {{which was then}} polished by John August. Robert Downey, Jr. was cast {{in the title role}} in September 2006, after growing out a goatee and working out to convince the filmmakers <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for the part. Principal photography began on March 12, 2007, with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan, which was filmed in Inyo County, California. Production also occurred on the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California, with additional filming at Edwards Air Force Base and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater in George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008, and was released internationally on April 30, and in North America on May 2.|$|E
5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E

During the next five years he delivers every judgment absolutely convinced that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Thereafter <b>he</b> delivers his judgments with a growing indifference as to whether <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> or wrong. And they say that when the indifference becomes habitual, he should retire.” ...|$|R

25|$|Thomas Scott (1766 – 5 November 1799) was an English cricketer {{who played}} for Hampshire {{at the time of}} the Hambledon Club. He was a {{specialist}} batsman who may have been a regular opener, but it is not known if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> or left-handed. His fielding record suggests that he usually took a close catching position.|$|E
25|$|Bauer got {{his role}} without even {{audition}}ing. During the audition process, casting director Alixe Gordin saw Bauer and instantly noted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> {{for the role}} of Manny, a judgment with which both De Palma and Bregman agreed. He was the only actual Cuban in the principal cast. John Travolta was considered for the role.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Vickers won the Nextel Open {{exhibition}} race. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> behind Mike Bliss on {{the last}} lap. Rather than make a move to go around Bliss, Vickers ran {{into the back of}} the No. 0, spinning him out. Vickers went on to win. That qualified him for the annual Nextel All-Star Challenge, in which he finished third. Vickers finished the year seventeenth in Cup points with ten top tens. He also returned to the Busch Series in a limited capacity in 2005, and finished third at Watkins Glen in the No. 5. He drove five other races in the No. 57.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} Bonatti was accused and vilified by {{a part of the}} {{climbing}} community but over time the growing amount of evidence in support of his version of the facts proved his honesty. Reinhold Messner, in June 2010, said: Bonatti {{was one of the greatest}} climbers of all time – the last true Alpinist, an expert in all disciplines. But more importantly Walter was a marvellous, tolerant, loving person. He leaves a great spiritual testament: he was a clean man vilified for 50 years over what happened on K2, but in the end everyone accepted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks {{that when it}} got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
25|$|Sirius Black owned {{a flying}} motorbike, which he lent to Hagrid the night Harry's parents died. It is first seen when Hagrid {{delivers}} the baby Harry to Number 4, Privet Drive {{in the first}} book, and then again when Hagrid uses it transport Harry to a safe house in the seventh volume. In Deathly Hallows, various modifications {{have been made to}} the bike by Mr. Weasley, allowing it to create a brick wall or a net that erupts from the exhaust pipe and to shoot dragon fire from the exhaust, impelling the bike's sudden acceleration. The dragon-fire feature is used to great effect by Hagrid and Harry when being chased by Voldemort; however, Mr. Weasley did warn that he was unsure of its safety and that they should use it only in an emergency. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to say this, as the sidecar of the motorbike, unaffected by Hagrid's magic dislodged after the abrupt acceleration.|$|E
25|$|Bogan {{was placed}} in the back room of a local saloon, as there was no jail at the time, but before his shotgun wound had healed, the next day in fact, he took {{advantage}} of the poor security and made an escape during a roaring blizzard. Owens, knowing that Bogan was badly wounded, believed he could not go far. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> as two weeks later Bogan, burning up with fever and with his wound infected, sent word to Owens that he wished to surrender and receive medical attention. Bogan met with Owens sixteen miles outside of Lusk, and voiced to Owens that he feared a lynch mob would be waiting for him when they reached Lusk, as Gunn was extremely well liked and respected in the town. As they entered town, Owens backed down a mob that was intent on hanging Bogan, then Owens shackled Bogan {{in the back of the}} Sweeney Saloon. The next day, Owens left with Bogan en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by February 4 he had him secured in the Laramie County jail.|$|E
