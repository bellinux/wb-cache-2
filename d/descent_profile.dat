25|$|After the enroute {{navigation}} {{test flight}} was completed, the AAIB's test pilot flew several approaches to Campbeltown Airport {{with the same}} aircraft while investigators monitored its position on the radar equipment that was used {{the night of the}} accident. When the test aircraft flew the approach as indicated on the navigation chart that was found clipped to the pilot's control wheel, there was a small gap in radar coverage when the aircraft was at its most distant point from the airport, beginning at 10.1nm and ending on the return segment at 9.4nm from the MAC VOR. Other trials were conducted at lower altitudes, and in those trials the coverage gap was widened considerably. Investigators tried approaches at low and descending altitudes involving a steeper left turn to 157° (where the heading bug was set on the HSI), and then flying that heading until intercepting the correct course to the MAC VOR. When this track was flown at 1,400 feet, the last radar contact was at 7.9nm from the MAC VOR. The last radar contact with the accident flight was at 8.1nm from the MAC VOR, at an altitude of 1,340 feet. Flying this track with the accident flight's known and projected <b>descent</b> <b>profile</b> brought the test aircraft to within 0.2nm of the crash site at an altitude of 200 feet, which was within the margin of error for the differences in wind {{on the day of the}} accident and on the day of the test flight.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accident}} investigation board concluded that the horizontal stabilizer was set at a down angle during the training mission. The cause of the mishap was an improper stabilizer trim setting. Due {{to the lack of}} available evidence, no surviving crew members, no radio calls, no other witnesses and lack of a data recorder, the {{accident investigation}} board was unable to determine by clear and convincing evidence why the stabilizer trim was mispositioned. The investigation board felt that the most likely cause of this runaway stabilizer trim was a system malfunction that would have led the stabilizer trim to improperly run in a nose-down direction. The improper trim setting occurred somewhere between 14,000 and [...] and caused a rapid and uncontrollable descent the experienced crew could not overcome.

40|$|For an {{aircraft}} operating over a fixed range, the operating costs are basically a sum of fuel cost and time cost. While minimum fuel and minimum time trajectories are {{relatively easy to}} calculate, the determination of a minimum cost trajectory can be a complex undertaking. This computer program was developed to optimize trajectories {{with respect to a}} cost function based on a weighted sum of fuel cost and time cost. As a research tool, the program could be used to study various characteristics of optimum trajectories and their comparison to standard trajectories. It might also be used to generate a model for the development of an airborne trajectory optimization system. The program could be incorporated into an airline flight planning system, with optimum flight plans determined at takeoff time for the prevailing flight conditions. The use of trajectory optimization could significantly reduce the cost for a given aircraft mission. The algorithm incorporated in the program assumes that a trajectory consists of climb, cruise, and descent segments. The optimization of each segment is not done independently, as in classical procedures, but is performed in a manner which accounts for interaction between the segments. This is accomplished by the application of optimal control theory. The climb and <b>descent</b> <b>profiles</b> are generated by integrating a set of kinematic and dynamic equations, where the total energy of the aircraft is the independent variable. At each energy level of the climb and <b>descent</b> <b>profiles,</b> the air speed and power setting necessary for an optimal trajectory are determined. The variational Hamiltonian of the problem consists of the rate of change of cost with respect to total energy and a term dependent on the adjoint variable, which is identical to the optimum cruise cost at a specified altitude. This variable uniquely specifies the optimal cruise energy, cruise altitude, cruise Mach number, and, indirectly, the climb and <b>descent</b> <b>profiles.</b> If the optimum cruise cost is specified, an optimum trajectory can easily be generated; however, the range obtained for a particular optimum cruise cost is not known a priori. For short range flights, the program iteratively varies the optimum cruise cost until the computed range converges to the specified range. For long-range flights, iteration is unnecessary since the specified range can be divided into a cruise segment distance and full climb and descent distances. The user must supply the program with engine fuel flow rate coefficients and {{an aircraft}} aerodynamic model. The program currently includes coefficients for the Pratt-Whitney JT 8 D- 7 engine and an aerodynamic model for the Boeing 727. Input to the program consists of the flight range to be covered and the prevailing flight conditions including pressure, temperature, and wind profiles. Information output by the program includes: optimum cruise tables at selected weights, optimal cruise quantities as a function of cruise weight and cruise distance, climb and <b>descent</b> <b>profiles,</b> and a summary of the complete synthesized optimal trajectory. This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC 6000 series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 100 K (octal) of 60 bit words. This aircraft trajectory optimization program was developed in 1979...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} merge arrival flows of aircraft without using heading instructions. The principle is to achieve the aircraft sequence on a point with conventional direct-to instructions, using predefined legs at iso-distance to this point for path shortening or stretching. A series of smallscale experiments was conducted with air traffic controllers to assess benefits and limits of the method. The method was found comfortable, safe and accurate, even under high traffic load, although less flexible than today with heading instructions. Predictability was increased, workload and communications were reduced. Even under high traffic load, the inter-aircraft spacing on final was as accurate as today (runway throughput maintained), while <b>descent</b> <b>profiles</b> were improved (continuous descent from flight level 100). As heading instructions were no longer used, aircraft remained on lateral navigation. The flow of traffic was more orderly with a contained and predefined dispersion of trajectories.

It is a strategic and tactical planning tool that provides Traffic Management Coordinators, En Route and Terminal Radar Approach Control air traffic controllers the ability to efficiently optimize the arrival capacity of a demand-impacted airport while simultaneously enabling fuel-efficient descent procedures. The TAPSS system consists of four-dimensional trajectory prediction, arrival runway balancing, aircraft separation constraint-based scheduling, traffic flow visualization and trajectory-based advisories to assist controllers in efficient metering, sequencing and spacing. The TAPSS system was evaluated and compared to today's ATC operation through extensive series of human-in-the-loop simulations for arrival flows into the Los Angeles International Airport.

Alternative approach methods, such as deep stall and spin techniques, are beneficial for such environments but are less conventional and would benefit from further qualitative and quantitative understanding to improve their implementation. Flight tests of such techniques, with a representative remotely piloted vehicle, {{have been carried out}} for this purpose and the results are presented in this paper. Trajectories and flight data for a range of approach techniques are presented and conclusions are drawn as to the potential benefits and issues of using such techniques for SUAV landings. In particular, the stability of the vehicle on entry to a deep stall was noticeably improved through the use of symmetric inboard flaps (crow brakes). Spiral <b>descent</b> <b>profiles</b> investigated, including spin descents, produced faster descent rates and further reduced landing space requirements. However, sufficient control authority was maintainable in a spiral stall descent, whereas it was compromised in a full spin. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
