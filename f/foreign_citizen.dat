40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{an increasingly}} important question: When, if ever, should <b>foreign</b> <b>citizens</b> be included as members of an American class action? The existing consensus holds that courts should exclude from class membership those <b>foreign</b> <b>citizens</b> whose country does not recognize an American class judgment. Our analysis begins by establishing that this consensus is flawed. Rather, to minimize {{the costs associated with}} relitigation in a foreign forum, we must distinguish between foreign claimants who are likely to commence a subsequent foreign proceeding from those who are unlikely to do so; distinguishing between those who come from recognizing and nonrecognizing countries creates needless inefficiency. Using standard tools of economic analysis, we examine the benefits and costs of the consensus rule and compare them to {{the costs and benefits of}} other possible rules. In this comparison, the consensus rule tends to perform poorly. As a matter of theory, the most efficient rule for deciding which <b>foreign</b> <b>citizens</b> to include and exclude is evident, but real-world informational constraints frustrate the application of this rule in practice. Because no rule regarding the inclusion and exclusion of <b>foreign</b> <b>citizens</b> is the most efficient in all situations, we propose that courts use rebuttable presumptions: include <b>foreign</b> <b>citizens</b> with claims that are not individually viable and exclude <b>foreign</b> <b>citizens</b> with claims that are viable...|$|R

25|$|A dual citizen {{may have}} {{acquired}} citizenship by birth {{in a foreign}} country, by descent from a <b>foreign</b> <b>citizen</b> parent, or by naturalisation. Singapore citizens who voluntarily and intentionally acquire citizenship of a foreign country {{after the age of}} 18 may be deprived of their Singapore citizenship by the Government. Foreigners who naturalise as Singaporean citizens are required to renounce all foreign citizenships. Persons who are born outside of Singapore and have at least one parent who is a Singapore citizen may register with a Singapore consulate within a year to acquire Singapore citizenship by descent. However, such persons must renounce their foreign citizenship, if any, before reaching 22 years of age. The Constitution of Singapore is silent on a Singapore citizen who acquired citizenship by birth and is a <b>foreign</b> <b>citizen</b> by descent. So long as such a person refrains from exercising the rights of foreign citizenship, the Government has no grounds for depriving him of his Singapore citizenship and he may hold on to dual citizenship.|$|E

25|$|According to the Home Office, {{he arrived}} in Britain on 13 March 2002, on a six-month visitor's visa. After its expiry, he applied to stay on as a student, and was granted {{permission}} to remain until 30 June 2003. The Home Office said it had no record of any further correspondence, but added: 'We have seen a copy of Mr Menezes' passport, containing a stamp apparently giving him indefinite leave {{to remain in the}} UK. On investigation, this stamp was not one that was in use by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on the date given.' This was denied by the family of Menezes; and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw stated that he believed Menezes was living in the UK legally, but had no precise information to confirm this. Immigration records show that Menezes entered the Republic of Ireland from France on 23 April 2005. There are no records to show the exact date that he returned to the UK; however, under the Common Travel Area system, a <b>foreign</b> <b>citizen</b> entering the UK through the Republic of Ireland has an automatic right to remain for three months. Therefore, Menezes was lawfully in the UK on the day he was killed, even if the stamp in his passport recording indefinite leave to remain had been a forgery.|$|E
