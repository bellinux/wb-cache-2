5|$|Friedrich died in Dresden on 7 May 1840, and {{was buried}} in Dresden's Trinitatis-Friedhof (Trinity Cemetery) east of the city centre (the {{entrance}} to which he <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> some 15 years earlier).

5|$|JAL, whose fleet {{was entirely}} made of Boeing 747 {{aircraft}}, <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> {{all of its}} aircraft with tropical-influenced liveries along with Reso'cha titles. These aircraft are used on charter flights to holiday destinations in the Pacific, such as Hawaii. Reso'cha is a marketing abbreviation for Resort Charter. Reso'cha planes were formerly known as JAL Super Resort Express.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{prior to}} the Reformation <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> walls, often with murals; these were {{whitewashed}} by the reformers, and often religious texts or the Ten Commandments replaced the images. These inscriptions were in turn obliterated under the Catholic Queen Mary. At Blakeney, as elsewhere, the formerly coloured walls are now the plain white typical of English churches.|$|E

5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> all the covers {{for the first few}} years of Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam Knight won the Silver Medal in Painting {{with the}} {{painting}} Boxer (1917), {{one of the}} series she <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> at Witley in 1916. In 1929 Knight was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in June 1931 she received an honorary degree from St. Andrews University. Knight {{was elected president of}} the Society of Women Artists in 1932 and held the post until 1967. In 1936 she became the first woman since 1769 elected to full membership of the Royal Academy. The same year Knight published her first autobiography, Oil Paint and Grease Paint, which became a best-seller, with four hardback editions followed in 1941 by a Penguin paperback printing.|$|E
5|$|Pennethorne's gallery was {{demolished}} for {{the next}} phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by Frederic, Lord Leighton’s painting of Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence (1853–55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Issued by MI6 with an Aston Martin DB Mark III, Bond trails Goldfinger as {{he takes}} his vintage Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (adapted with armour plating and armour-plated glass) via air ferry to Switzerland, driven by Oddjob. Bond manages to trace Goldfinger to a {{warehouse}} in Geneva where he finds that the armour of Goldfinger's car is actually white-gold, cast into panels at his Kent refinery. When the car reaches Goldfinger's factory in Switzerland (Enterprises Auric AG), he recasts the gold from the armour panels into aircraft seats and fits them to the Mecca Charter Airline, in which he holds a large stake. The gold is finally sold in India at a vast profit. Bond foils an assassination attempt on Goldfinger by Jill Masterton's sister, Tilly, to avenge Jill's death at Goldfinger's hands: he <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> her body with gold paint, which killed her. Bond and Tilly attempt to escape when the alarm is raised, but are captured.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having been disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson, {{alongside}} Edward Elgar and H.G. Wells represented British {{culture at}} the celebrations of {{the first anniversary of}} the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson first visited New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel & Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting New York-an abstraction to The Soul of the Soulless City. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in a modernist style but in fact several British avant-garde artists <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> in the city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his father could return to Britain.|$|E

5|$|After his death, {{the court}} ruled that Van Meegeren’s estate be {{auctioned}} and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund the buyers of his works and to pay income taxes on the sale of his paintings. Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945. On 5 and 6 September 1950, the furniture and other possessions in his Amsterdam house at Keizersgracht 321 were auctioned by order of the court, along with 738 other pieces of furniture and works of art, including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection. The house was auctioned separately on 4 September, estimated to be worth 65,000 guilders. The proceeds of the sale together with the house amounted to 123,000 guilders. Van Meegeren’s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2,300 guilders, while Jesus among the Doctors (which van Meegeren <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about $800 or about $7,000 today.) Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church. The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242,000 guilders ($60,000, or about $500,000 today).|$|E
25|$|Bruegel himself <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> several minor {{paintings}} {{on the subject of}} proverbs including Big Fish Eat Little Fish (1556) and Twelve Proverbs (1558), but Netherlandish Proverbs is thought to have been his first large-scale painting on the theme.|$|E

25|$|In May 1935 {{a book by}} Lucie Delarue-Mardrus was {{published}} with 25 illustrations by Pinchon.

25|$|The {{discovery}} that the Greeks <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> their temples influenced the later {{development of the}} style. The archaeological dig at Aegina and Bassae in 1811–12 by Cockerell, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, and Karl Haller von Hallerstein had disinterred painted fragments of masonry daubed with impermanent colours. This revelation was a direct contradiction of Winckelmann's notion of the Greek temple as timeless, fixed, and pure in its whiteness.|$|E

25|$|Millais <b>had</b> <b>painted</b> Effie for The Order of Release, 1746, {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely {{with her husband and}} his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.|$|E
