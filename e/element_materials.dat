50|$|PbS {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most common {{detection}} <b>element</b> <b>materials</b> in various infrared detectors. As an infrared detector, PbS functions as a photon detector, responding directly to the photons of radiation, as opposed to thermal detectors, which respond to a change in detector element temperature caused by the radiation. A PbS element can be used to measure radiation in either of two ways: by measuring the tiny photocurrent the photons cause when they hit the PbS material, or by measuring the change in the material's electrical resistance that the photons cause. Measuring the resistance change is the more commonly used method. At room temperature, PbS is sensitive to radiation at wavelengths between approximately 1 and 2.5 μm. This range corresponds to the shorter wavelengths in the infra-red portion of the spectrum, the so-called short-wavelength infrared (SWIR). Only very hot objects emit radiation in these wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of multislice high-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) simulation can be improved by calculating the scattering potential using density functional theory (DFT) [1 – 2]. This approach accounts {{for the fact that}} electrons in the specimen are redistributed according to their local chemical environment. This influences the scattering process and alters the absolute and relative contrast in the final image. For light <b>element</b> <b>materials</b> with well defined geometry, such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride monolayers, the DFT based simulation scheme turned out to be necessary to prevent misinterpretation of weak signals, such as the identification of nitrogen substitutions in a graphene network. Furthermore, this implies that the HRTEM image does not only contain structural information (atom positions and atomic numbers). Instead, information on the electron charge distribution can be gained in addition...|$|E

40|$|High hardness, low {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion and high temperature capability are properties also suited to rolling <b>element</b> <b>materials.</b> Silicon nitride (Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }) {{has been found}} to have a good combination of properties suitable for these applications. However, much is still not known about rolling contact fatigue (RCF) behavior, which is fundamental information to assess the lifetime of the material. Additionally, there are several test techniques that are employed internationally whose measured RCF performances are often irreconcilable. Due to the lack of such information, some concern for the reliability of ceramic bearings still remains. This report surveys a variety of topics pertaining to RCF. Surface defects (cracks) in Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } and their propagation during RCF are discussed. Five methods to measure RCF are then briefly overviewed. Spalling, delamination, and rolling contact wear are discussed. Lastly, methods to destructively (e. g., C-sphere flexure strength testing) and non-destructively identify potential RCF-limiting flaws in Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } balls are described...|$|E
40|$|To {{support the}} {{on-going}} nuclear thermal propulsion effort, a state-of-the-art non nuclear experimental test setup has been constructed {{to evaluate the}} performance characteristics of candidate fuel <b>element</b> <b>materials</b> and geometries in representative environments. The facility to perform this testing {{is referred to as}} the Nuclear Thermal Rocket Element Environment Simulator (NTREES). This device can simulate the environmental conditions (minus the radiation) to which nuclear rocket fuel components will be subjected during reactor operation. Prototypical fuel elements mounted in the simulator are inductively heated in such a manner so as to accurately reproduce the temperatures and heat fluxes which would normally occur as a result of nuclear fission in addition to being exposed to flowing hydrogen. Recent upgrades to NTREES now allow power levels 24 times greater than those achievable in the previous facility configuration. This higher power operation will allow near prototypical power densities and flows to finally be achieved in most prototypical fuel elements...|$|E
40|$|Spin-orbit {{coupling}} {{results in}} technologically-crucial phenomena underlying magnetic devices like magnetic memories and energy-efficient motors. In heavy <b>element</b> <b>materials,</b> {{the strength of}} spin-orbit coupling becomes large to affect the overall electronic nature and induces novel states such as topological insulators and spin-orbit-integrated Mott states. Here we report an unprecedented charge-ordering cascade in IrTe 2 without the loss of metallicity, which involves localized spin-orbit Mott states with diamagnetic Ir 4 +-Ir 4 + dimers. The cascade in cooling, uncompensated in heating, consists of first order-type consecutive transitions from a pure Ir 3 (+) phase to Ir 3 +-Ir 4 (+) charge-ordered phases, which originate from Ir 5 d to Te 5 p charge transfer involving anionic polymeric bond breaking. Considering that the system exhibits superconductivity with suppression of the charge order by doping, analogously to cuprates, these results provide a new electronic paradigm of localized charge-ordered states interacting with itinerant electrons through large spin-orbit coupling...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{results of}} the search for {{inorganic}} fullerenes are presented. MonSm and WnSm clusters are generated with a pulsed arc cluster ion source equipped with an annealing stage. This is known to enhance fullerene formation in the case of carbon. Analogous to carbon, the mass spectra of the metal chalcogenide clusters produced in this way exhibit a bimodal structure. The species in the first maximum at low mass are known to be platelets. Here, the structure of the species in the second maximum is studied by anion photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and scanning tunneling microcopy. All experimental results indicate a two-dimensional structure of these species and disagree with a three-dimensional fullerene-like geometry. A possible explanation for this preference of two-dimensional structures is the ability of a two-element material to saturate the dangling bonds at the edges of a platelet by excess atoms of one element. A platelet consisting of a single element only cannot do this. Accordingly, graphite and boron might be the only materials forming nano-spheres because they are the only single <b>element</b> <b>materials</b> assuming two-dimensional structures...|$|E

Due to health concerns, unpasteurized cow's milk {{and a number}} of dairy products produced by unpasteurized milk may contain virulent Cb. PCR method is commonly employed for sensitive, specific and rapid test for Cb detection in biological samples including milk. Aim - In this study, six DNA purification methods for recovering Cb DNA from experimentally contaminated cow's milk were evaluated, together with three PCR-based assays targeting the IS 1111 Cb-repeated <b>element.</b> <b>Materials</b> and methods - For DNA extraction, the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method was implemented and the following commercial kits were used: QIAamp DNA Mini kit; DNeasy Mericon Food kit; NucliSENS miniMAG; NucleoSpin Food; Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit. The three assays considered were standard PCR, TaqMan real-time PCR and SYBR Green combined with the evaluation of the melting temperature of the amplicon.
