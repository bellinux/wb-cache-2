5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female <b>host</b> <b>body,</b> Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E
5|$|Odan (Franc Luz), a mediator, boards the Enterprise to {{negotiate}} a peace treaty between two hostile races. Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) is charmed by the man, and the two share a love affair during the trip. Odan refuses to use the transporter and requests that a shuttle and pilot be provided for him; Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) honors this request. During the mission, the shuttle is attacked by a dissident faction and Odan is mortally injured. While {{trying to save the}} alien in sickbay, Dr. Crusher comes to learn that Odan is a Trill, a species which symbiotically lives within its host's body. It is a further revealed by Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) that the transporter would have harmed the symbiotic lifeform. Following the death of Odan's <b>host</b> <b>body,</b> Commander Riker volunteers to allow Odan use him as a host to conduct the necessary negotiations until a new host arrives.|$|E
25|$|Stornoway {{features}} {{heavily in}} the initial stages of the X-Men comics Dark Phoenix Saga due to its proximity to the fictional Muir Island and Proteus' attempts to find a new <b>host</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
25|$|Those {{that live}} inside the host, {{including}} all parasitic worms (helminths), are called endoparasites. Endoparasites can exist {{in one of}} two forms: intercellular parasites (inhabiting spaces in the <b>host's</b> <b>body)</b> or intracellular parasites (inhabiting cells in the <b>host's</b> <b>body).</b> Coinfection by multiple parasites is common.|$|R
5000|$|The Appellaxians {{appear in}} Young Justice. The Appellaxian <b>host</b> <b>bodies</b> are shown {{on display in}} the Hall of Justice where it's {{explained}} battling their threat formed the Justice League. The <b>host</b> <b>bodies</b> on display appear to be the Wood King, the Stone God, the Crystal Creature, and the Golden Roc who are said to be the only Appellaxian <b>host</b> <b>bodies</b> actually used. In the episode [...] "Salvage", Intergang members Bruno Mannheim and Whisper A'Daire take control of the <b>host</b> <b>bodies</b> and merge them into one Appellaxian Golem which fights Superboy and Blue Beetle. The Appellaxian Golem eventually goes on a rampage, freeing itself from the duo's control. Blue Beetle manages to find a way for Superboy to reason with the Appellaxian Golem, but it is remotely killed by Black Beetle of the Reach.|$|R
50|$|The gametocytes are rounded and may {{be found}} either the gut wall or within the <b>host's</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
25|$|Parasitic castrators feed {{on their}} host's {{reproductive}} tissues, leaving other bodily processes largely intact, and therefore ensuring the host's survival {{and the freedom}} of the parasite to remain in the <b>host</b> <b>body</b> {{for as long as the}} host continues to live.|$|E
25|$|In humans, T {{helper cells}} and eosinophils respond to {{helminth}} infestation. Inflammation leads to encapsulation of egg deposits throughout the body. Helminths excrete into the intestine toxic substances after they feed. These substances then enter the circulatory and lymphatic {{systems of the}} <b>host</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom Come {{universe}} {{features a}} version of Nabu {{who is able to}} channel his consciousness through the helmet and cloak without the need for a <b>host</b> <b>body.</b> This version of Fate sides with Batman's group and is amongst the survivors {{at the end of the}} final battle.|$|E

50|$|Grassy {{muscardine}} {{is caused}} by Hirsutella necatrix. This fungus produces an enzyme that breaks down the chitin in its <b>host's</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jip has a {{grotesque}} misshapen humanoid form {{which appears to}} be formed of the decaying remains of various previous <b>host</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bradyzoites are the slowly {{dividing}} {{stage of}} the parasite that make up tissue cysts. When an uninfected host consumes a tissue cyst, bradyzoites released from the cyst infect intestinal epithelial cells before converting to the proliferative tachyzoite stage. Following the initial period of proliferation throughout the <b>host</b> <b>body,</b> tachyzoites then convert back to bradyzoites, which reproduce inside host cells to form tissue cysts in the new host.|$|E
25|$|Pentastomids live in {{the upper}} {{respiratory}} tract of reptiles, birds, and mammals, where they lay eggs. They are gonochoric (having 2 sexes), and employ internal fertilisation. The eggs are either coughed out by the host or leave the <b>host</b> <b>body</b> through the digestive system. The eggs are then ingested by an intermediate host, which is commonly either a fish or a small herbivorous mammal.|$|E
25|$|When the JSA {{looks for}} Hector, {{they find the}} helmet, amulet & cloak. Sand dons the helmet to speak with Nabu. At the same moment, Mordru appears and removes the helmet from Sand, {{allowing}} Nabu to manifest through the helmet without needing a <b>host</b> <b>body.</b> Nabu defeats Mordru and the JSA offers him membership, which Nabu declines. Sensing his impending demise, Nabu gives the helmet to Detective Chimp {{to pass on to}} a new wearer, telling him it would still have certain abilities without Nabu's spirit inside. Nabu is then killed by the Spectre.|$|E
5000|$|... autoimmunity, {{in which}} the immune system attacks its own <b>host's</b> <b>body</b> (examples include {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's disease and myasthenia gravis).|$|R
5000|$|Graft-versus-host disease, an {{autoimmune}} {{condition that}} occurs {{as a result}} of bone marrow transplants in which the immune cells from the transplanted bone marrow attack the <b>host's</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nematodes are {{infected}} by C. rosea when the fungus' conidia attach to their cuticle and germinate, {{going on to}} produce germ tubes which penetrate the <b>host's</b> <b>body</b> and kill it.|$|R
25|$|Star Sapphire is {{the name}} of several fictional {{characters}} in DC Comics; many of them are villainous, and all connected in origin. Within DC continuity, an immortal race of warrior women (the Zamarons) were depicted as having the ancient tradition of choosing physically identical mortals from across the cosmos to serve as the <b>host</b> <b>body</b> for their queen. The woman chosen to serve this queen is called Star Sapphire. She is given the queen's symbolic weapon; a crystal resembling an actual star sapphire that grants the user powers similar to the power ring of Green Lanterns.|$|E
25|$|In {{the comic}} book The Savage Dragon by Erik Larsen (published by Image Comics), it is {{revealed}} that Hitler did not die in 1945, but after a fight against Hellboy in Romania in 1952. His body ruined, the brain is transplanted {{to the body of}} a large gorilla. Suffering amnesia and calling himself Brainiape, the chimera possesses great psionic powers and joins the Chicago, IL criminal organization known as the Vicious Circle, eventually becoming its leader. He remembers his past only in 1996 when he encounters Hellboy again, alongside the Vicious Circle's enemy, the meta-talented policeman called Dragon. The ape body is killed, and it is revealed that Hitler's brain had mutated and could live unaided by any technology or <b>host</b> <b>body,</b> ambulatory on tiny legs.|$|E
25|$|After {{locating}} a bird, {{the parasite}} penetrates {{through the skin}} (usually the feet), dropping the forked tail in the process. Inside the circulatory system, the immature worms (schistosomula) develop into mature male and female worms, mate and migrate through the host’s circulatory system (or nervous system in case of T. regenti) to the final location (veins feeding the gastrointestinal tract) within the <b>host</b> <b>body.</b> There they lay eggs in the small veins in the intestinal mucosa from which {{they make their way}} into the lumen of the gut, and are dumped into the water when the bird defecates. One European species, Trichobilharzia regenti, instead infects the bird host’s nasal tissues and larvae hatch from the eggs directly in the tissue during drinking/feeding of the infected birds.|$|E
50|$|Those {{that live}} inside the host are called endoparasites (including all {{parasitic}} worms). Endoparasites can exist {{in one of}} two forms: intercellular parasites (inhabiting spaces in the <b>host's</b> <b>body)</b> or intracellular parasites (inhabiting cells in the <b>host's</b> <b>body).</b> Intracellular parasites, such as protozoa, bacteria or viruses, tend to rely on a third organism, which is generally known as the carrier or vector. The vector does the job of transmitting them to the host. An example of this interaction is the transmission of malaria, caused by a protozoan of the genus Plasmodium, to humans by the bite of an anopheline mosquito.|$|R
50|$|Calypso {{survived by}} using voodoo {{to enter a}} series of <b>host</b> <b>bodies</b> which she used to fight Spider-Man and Daredevil. Calypso did a number of campaigns against them that {{involved}} her servant Zombie.|$|R
50|$|Nymphal H. suis {{spend most}} of their time in and around the head region of the hog, {{specifically}} the ears. As they mature, they move to other areas on the <b>host's</b> <b>body,</b> primarily the abdominal region.|$|R
25|$|During the Apocalypse Wars, the Extraordinary X-Men {{are forced}} to travel to {{thousand}} of years into Earth's future in order to rescue Colossus {{and his team of}} young mutants after they were investigating the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo. Arriving into Earth's future, the X-Men found themselves in a destroyed New York City and soon discovered that at some point Apocalypse had risen and what remained of Earth after his ascension became the Omega World, a huge structure composed of bubble worlds. The ones who survived the Great Trials lived on Omega World under Apocalypse's rule as he functioned as the Omega World's heart, keeping it alive, while his Horsemen functioned as its antibodies, cleansing the structure of anything that could harm their master. Omega World crumbled as the result of Apocalypse being fatally wounded by Nightcrawler. Storm was forced to take Apocalypse back to the present with them so they could undone the transformation of Colossus, who was turned into a Horseman, however, before he could restore Colossus back to normal, Apocalypse instead teleported him away, sending him to Clan Akkaba. Its left unknown if this Apocalypse was actually a future version Evan or Apocalypse himself using a new <b>host</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alloran-Semitur-Corrass - Andalite <b>host</b> <b>body</b> of Visser Three. Alloran was {{an officer}} under Prince Seerow, who {{relieved}} his superior of duty after {{a force of}} Yeerks stole Andalite ships and left their planet thanks to technology provided to them by Seerow. Years later, having been promoted {{to the rank of}} War Prince, Alloran was placed in command of the Andalite forces sent to fight the Yeerk invasion of the Hork-Bajir homeworld. Unfortunately, the desperate situation on the planet led Alloran to decide that wiping out the Hork-Bajir with a virus was a better alternative than allowing them to be enslaved, and countless members of the species died as a result. Alloran was subsequently disgraced, and ended up serving on the crew of the same ship that Elfangor was assigned to as a junior officer. A mission that the pair went on with Elfangor's peer Arbron and a pair of humans led to Alloran's infestation by the Yeerk who would become Visser Three, who used Alloran's morphing abilities for many vile purposes throughout the years. After an attempt by Ax to kill Visser Three, Alloran was briefly left free to communicate with him, and encouraged him to continue the fight. Eventually he was freed from his infestation.|$|E
25|$|Supposedly lost diaries of the mutant seer Destiny surfaced, {{telling of}} twelve beings that could defeat Apocalypse {{once and for}} all. Various mutants, all listed in the prophecy, are {{abducted}} by Apocalypse's Horsemen including a faction of the Skrulls. The Twelve legend {{was in fact a}} ruse, orchestrated by Apocalypse himself: once the Twelve are assembled, Apocalypse intended to use them to transform himself into a deitylike entity beyond the Celestials. It is revealed {{at the end of this}} story arc, that Apocalypse's physical form has been burned out due to the vast amount of energies he has under his control, forcing him to wear a bio-armor (like his future counterpart) and now plans to use Nate Grey as a <b>host</b> <b>body</b> for him to move his energy and consciousness into. The X-Men confront Apocalypse as he is close to merging with Nate, but are unable to stop him. Cyclops pushes Nate Grey out of the way, merging with Apocalypse instead. While the merge is successful, Apocalypse's aim for unlimited power is not and he attempts to complete the transformation by warping reality into various scenarios (see Ages of Apocalypse). Apocalypse hoped to lure the Twelve into empowering him with their energy, but eventually, the mutants realize their true predicament and Apocalypse teleports away.|$|E
50|$|Copepod {{distribution}} {{of a similar}} species Clausidium dissimile on ghost shrimp were positively correlated to the <b>host's</b> <b>body</b> size, but <b>host</b> sex did not affect distribution. C. vancouverense sticks to the branchial cavity of its host via suckers.|$|R
50|$|A Pee Fah can be {{banished from}} its host by the {{performance}} of a special dance, in which the exorcist moves in whirlpool-like motions. The ghost is drawn out by the whirling effects, and so leaves the <b>host's</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many {{other species}} inject eggs into the <b>host's</b> <b>body,</b> using the extensible, {{penetrating}} {{part of their}} ovipositor, sometimes called the oviscapt, which literally means something like [...] "egg digger". Species in the genera Ocyptera, Alophora, and Compsilura are examples.|$|R
500|$|In this episode, Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) {{falls in}} love with Odan (Franc Luz), a Trill mediator. But after he is mortally injured, she discovers that [...] "Odan" [...] is {{actually}} a symbiotic creature that lives inside a humanoid <b>host</b> <b>body.</b> Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) volunteers to act as a temporary host, complicating the relationship between Crusher and Odan. The mediation proves successful, but after Odan is transferred to a new, female Trill host (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), Crusher chooses not to continue the relationship.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in mid-September 2009 in Vancouver. Due to the Russian {{lettering}} {{on many of}} the episode props, director Cassar joked during shooting, [...] "Can we get a translator and find out what this writing means, specifically? Maybe it says 'Do not open until Christmas' or 'Watch The Simpsons on Sunday night,' knowing Fox." [...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' was a really good episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had some movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if he sounded like a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a <b>host</b> <b>body</b> to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the <b>host</b> <b>body,</b> or to keep him there in the first place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E
500|$|Burnet {{began to}} switch his focus to {{immunology}} in the 1940s. In 1941 {{he wrote a}} monograph called [...] "The Production of Antibodies", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book {{is seen as a}} key publication in immunology—it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of [...] "self" [...] and [...] "non-self" [...] to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self {{was an integral part of}} Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the [...] "self" [...] of the <b>host</b> <b>body</b> as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.|$|E
50|$|Dream Self: She {{takes the}} form of a {{parasitic}} face that attaches itself to the body of other dreamers. When the parasite is cut off from the <b>host's</b> <b>body,</b> Ebizawa returns to her real appearance, but stays in the dream world.|$|R
50|$|The lice {{predominantly}} eat algae that {{settle on}} the <b>host's</b> <b>body.</b> They usually feed off the flaking skin of the host and frequent wounds or open areas. They cause minor skin damage, {{but this does not}} lead to significant illness.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional Chinese {{medicine}} {{links the}} mythological Three Corpses/Worms with the intestinal jiuchong 九蟲 [...] "Nine Worms", which [...] "correspond to parasites such as roundworms or tapeworms, weaken the <b>host's</b> <b>body</b> and cause {{a variety of}} physical symptoms" [...] (Cook 2008:844).|$|R
