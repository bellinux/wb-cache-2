40|$|The idea of {{a common}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently {{referred to in the}} political discourses and practices of the EU. The {{idea of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage elevates the ideas of ownership and inheritance beyond the local, regional, or national frameworks and transforms the heritage sites and objects into a ‘common good’ belonging to all Europeans and into a source of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> identity. Scholars have debated the possibility of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, and in case such could exist, what it could be grounded upon. Critical scholars have asked what might be the trans-border European dimension of heritage that goes beyond the mere sum of national, regional, or local icons, or questioned the possibility of common European heritage practices {{due to the lack of}} a singular European people. Some scholars have, however, found a possible common ground for a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage for example in urbanity, European cities and their historical environment, and the styles and movements of art and architecture. Functions and uses of the idea of <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and the contexts in which it becomes important and meaningful have changed over the course of time and are constantly transforming. The recent societal, political, and cultural changes in Europe have influenced the notions on heritage and made the concept of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage more problematic. What is a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and how has it been approached in recent scholarly discussions? How can a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage be made sense of in relation to the ideas of universalism, cosmopolitanism, particularism, transnationalism, translocalism, transculturalism, and pan-Europeanism? The paper aims to clarify the meanings of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and critically discuss the problematic related to its foundations...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>cultural</b> <b>parks</b> has been {{steadily}} increasing in recent years throughout the world. But what is a <b>cultural</b> <b>park?</b> The aim of this dissertation is to provide an {{answer to this question}} or at least to set out the basis for an academic debate that moves beyond technical narratives that have prevailed to date. It is important to open up the topic to academic scrutiny given that <b>cultural</b> <b>parks</b> are becoming widespread devices being employed by different institutions and social groups to manage and enhance cultural and natural heritage assets and landscapes. The main problem to deal with is the predominant lack of theory-grounded, critical reflection in the literature about <b>cultural</b> <b>parks.</b> These remain largely conceived as technical instruments deployed by institutions in order to solve an array of problems they must deal with. Also, <b>cultural</b> <b>parks</b> are overally regarded as positive and constructive tools whose performance is associated with the preservation of heritage, the overcoming of the nature/culture divide, the reinforcing of identity and memory and the strengthening of social cohesion and economic development. This dissertation critically explores these issues through the analysis of the literature on <b>cultural</b> <b>parks.</b> Also, it provides a novel theoretical conceptualization of <b>cultural</b> <b>parks</b> that is connected and underpins a tentative methodology developed for their empirical analysis.

40|$|The vague {{concept of}} a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently referred to – but rarely explicitly defined – in scholarly discussion. The use of the concept in academia constructs a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage as a category in research and explicitly and implicitly produces its focuses and outlines. Thus, {{the use of the}} concept can be considered as scholarly engineering of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. To {{be able to have a}} scholarly discussion about a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, the meanings and uses of the concept need to be clarified. This article examines the meanings and uses of the concept in recent scholarly articles published in various disciplines. In the study, the concept analysis by Walker and Avant is applied and expanded with a discourse theoretical aspect: different recurring characteristics brought to the fore in the use of the concept are perceived as varying discourses on a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage...|$|R
