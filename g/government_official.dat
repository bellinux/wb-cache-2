In other words, the central government’s performance-based motivation for provincial <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> (q) must exceed θp(c 1). This makes the amount of tax revenue from protecting property rights of businesses that provincial <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> share (qay) exceed that of the private benefits that provincial <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> gain from extracted rents bp(c 1), motivating provincial <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> to protect the property rights of businesses. In this instance, q is relatively larger than p(c 1), indicating that the more that the central government incentives towards economic growth, the tighter that they control provincial level <b>government</b> <b>officials,</b> and therefore the latter has even more motivation and pressure to restrict their behavior.|$|R
