5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas.

5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 2012 {{outbreak}} of meningitis in the U.S, very little was known about E. rostratum including methods for diagnosing and treating infected individuals. Only 30% of 372 patient specimens sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed PCR evidence of the fungal infection. β-D-glucan assays were suggested as a potential method for early detection. The β-D-glucan assay detects (1,3)-β-D-glucan, a major component of many fungal cell walls released during cell growth. In the case of a 44-year-old man, the galactomamman assay successfully facilitated <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> E. rostratum.

In the majority of cases it is too late for a successful therapy if the patient develops first symptoms (e.g. chronic croakiness or hemoptysis). But if the lung cancer is detected early (mostly by chance), there is a survival rate at 47% according to the American Cancer Society.|$|E
40|$|Three {{children}} who {{presented with a}} Fanconi syndrome induced by the chemotherapeutic drug ifosfamide {{were found to have}} renal abnormalities on sonogram examinations. Renal echographic changes consisted in hyperechogenicity of the parenchyma with good corticomedullar differentiation. After discontinuation of the chemotherapy, the serum and urine metabolic abnormalities due to proximal tubulopathy were completely or greatly improved. Imaging studies at that time showed a complete resolution of the renal hyperechogenicity.

In these patients, urine and serum monitoring as well as prospective echographic follow-up kidney abnormalities may lead to <b>earlier</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> ifosfamide-induced Fanconi syndrome as well as <b>earlier</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> disease reversibility.

25|$|In animals, intravital {{diagnosis}} is based predominantly on faeces examinations and immunological methods.
