40|$|Policy {{debates over}} {{proposed}} legislative labor policy changes include contentions that business investment will negatively respond to labor laws that favor labor. Research on labor policy, however, often assumes that investment is fixed. We present a sequential bargaining {{model in which}} labor policies that increase labor’s bargaining power and reduce management’s options during strikes are predicted to reduce investment. Using provincial data on investment for 1967 to 1999, a strike replacement ban and protections for workers who refuse to handle struck work are estimated to reduce new investment, especially within {{the first few years}} after the policy change.

The study is cross-sectional by stratified representative sample; 3485 people were interviewed in their residence. The prevalence of reported impacts was 46 %, mostly physical health. Female gender <b>and</b> long-term <b>medical</b> <b>leave</b> are two impact risk indicators in people < 65 years of age. Low income and air conditioning at home are risk indicators at all ages. Results for having ≥ 2 diagnoses of chronic diseases, particularly for people self-describing as in poor health (odds ratio, OR< 65 = 5. 6; OR≥ 65 = 4. 2), and perceiving daily stress, are independent of age. The prevalence of reported heat-related health impacts is thus very high in those inner cities, with notable differences according to age, stress levels <b>and</b> long-term <b>medical</b> <b>leave,</b> previously unmentioned in the literature...|$|R
