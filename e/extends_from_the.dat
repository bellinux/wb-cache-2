The integrated bell tower has been built {{on top of the}} narthex, as was customary in contemporary Byzantine church architecture, and <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rectangular main structure. The bell tower was originally rectangular, though it is now partially ruined. It was reached from the south by means of a stone staircase.|$|E

5|$|A one-story kitchen addition, {{built in}} 1961–1962 and {{measuring}} about , <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northwest {{side of the}} original 1855 house. The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast side and a door (adjoining {{the wall of the}} 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition. The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Early Haifa is {{believed}} to have occupied the area which <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> present-day Rambam Hospital to the Jewish Cemetery on Yafo Street. The inhabitants engaged in fishing and agriculture. Under Byzantine rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance. Following the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s-40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of 'Akka. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to develop. In the 9th century under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, Haifa established trading relations with Egyptian ports and the city featured several shipyards. The inhabitants, Arabs and Jews, engaged in trade and maritime commerce. Glass production and dye-making from marine snails were the city's most lucrative industries.|$|E

5|$|Geologically the East Riding {{district}} is split into three parts. The western {{part is the}} eastern section of the Vale of York with the southern extension into the Humberhead Levels. In this area there is a belt of sandstones overlain by glacial and lake deposits formed {{at the close of}} the last ice age. The middle part is the Yorkshire Wolds, a chalk formation which <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Humber at North Ferriby to the coast at Flamborough Head, a chalk headland. The south-east of the {{district is}} the low-lying coastal plain of Holderness, which faces east to the North Sea, and to the south drains into the Humber estuary. South of Flamborough Head is Bridlington, which features several beaches, and at the far south-east of the district is the Spurn peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Guyana is {{a former}} British colony that <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} coast of South America. It is adjacent to Venezuela, Brazil, and Suriname, and is within {{the vicinity of the}} island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. Athletes from Guyanese delegations have appeared at the Olympics since the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and have participated at every Summer Olympic games between 1948 and 2008 except for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal. Guyana declared independence from the British Empire in 1966, and participated in all previous games (from 1948 to 1964) under its colonial name, British Guiana. Overall, Guyana's appearance in Beijing marked its fifteenth Olympic appearance. The country has not sent delegations to participate in any Winter Games.|$|E

The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E

A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|In the Indian Ocean, hawksbills are {{a common}} sight along {{the east coast of}} Africa, {{including}} the seas surrounding Madagascar and nearby island groups, and all along the southern Asian coast, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the coasts of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They are present across the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia. Their Pacific range is limited to the ocean's tropical and subtropical regions. In the west, it <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southwestern tips of the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago south to northern New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} {{with a small group of}} related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Alaska–Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caspian Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Northern England or the North of England, {{also known}} simply as the North, is the {{northern}} part of England, considered as a single cultural area. It <b>extends</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Scottish border in the north to near the River Trent in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.
