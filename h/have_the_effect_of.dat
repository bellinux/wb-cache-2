5|$|A Sudoku {{will remain}} valid under {{the actions of}} the Sudoku {{preserving}} symmetries (see also Jarvis). Some Sudokus are special in that some operations merely <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> relabelling the digits; several of these are listed below.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's ring system. They <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably {{formed as a}} result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E

5|$|The Barra estates of MacNeil (including all the Barra Isles) {{were sold}} to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of {{consideration}} for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances seemed to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> increasing Mingulay’s population as families evicted from Barra sometimes chose to re-settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840–45. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E

5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E

50|$|Logical shifts can {{be useful}} as {{efficient}} ways to perform multiplication or division of unsigned integers by powers of two. Shifting left by n bits on a signed or unsigned binary number <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> multiplying it by 2n. Shifting right by n bits on an unsigned binary number <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> dividing it by 2n (rounding towards 0).|$|R
50|$|Banning of a book, {{ironically}} often <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{making people}} {{seek out the}} book.

25|$|Changes in {{appetite}} or weight {{are common}} among antidepressants, but largely drug-dependent and {{are related to}} which neurotransmitters they affect. Mirtazapine and paroxetine, for example, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> weight gain and/or increased appetite, while others (such as bupropion and venlafaxine) achieve the opposite effect.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{considered}} {{under what}} circumstances federal courts can enjoin enforcement of abortion laws if in some cases such laws would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> regulating abortion more strictly than is consistent with Supreme Court precedent, as the New Hampshire law did in some circumstances.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, the High Court has {{the power}} to issue {{prerogative}} orders. These include mandatory orders which <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> directing public authorities to take certain actions, prohibiting orders that forbid them from acting, and quashing orders that invalidate their acts or decisions. The High Court also {{has the power}} to grant declarations to strike down unconstitutional legislation.|$|E

25|$|Motives for criticizing Israel in the UN may {{stem from}} {{legitimate}} concerns over policy or from illegitimate prejudices. (...) However, regardless of the intent, disproportionate criticism of Israel as barbaric and unprincipled, and corresponding discriminatory measures adopted in the UN against Israel, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> causing audiences to associate negative attributes with Jews in general, thus fueling anti-Semitism.|$|E
25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} {{are helpful}} in visualizing laws. The commutativity laws for ∧ and ∨ {{can be seen}} from the symmetry of the diagrams: a binary operation that was not commutative would not have a symmetric diagram because interchanging x and y would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> reflecting the diagram horizontally and any failure of commutativity would then appear as a failure of symmetry.|$|E
25|$|A law's purpose {{can limit}} the right either through {{limiting}} the content or form of expression. Limits on content are where {{the meaning of}} the expression is specifically forbidden by the law, such as hate-speech law, and is the most easily identifiable form of limitation. Limiting the form of the expression can often invoke section 2(b) as it will often <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> limiting the content as well.|$|E

25|$|Head harnesses, {{like many}} other forms of bondage, also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{creating}} a sense of objectification and erotic helplessness in the wearer, which can be erotic for the wearer, or for those observing them.

25|$|Scientists at {{a meeting}} of the American Geophysical Union on December 13, 2007, {{revealed}} that NASA satellites observing the western Arctic showed a 16% decrease in cloud coverage during the summer of 2007 compared to 2006. This would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> allowing more sunlight to penetrate Earth's atmosphere and warm the Arctic Ocean waters, thus melting sea ice and contributing to the opening the Northwest Passage.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{that he did}} consider practical was tightened government fiscal policy, based on using tax revenue to reduce the national debt. Tightened fiscal policy would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> slowing economic growth, thereby slowing coal consumption, {{at least until the}} debt was erased. Still, Jevons admitted that the overall impact of such a measure, even if it were implemented, would be minimal. In short, the prospect that society would voluntarily reduce consumption was dim.|$|E
