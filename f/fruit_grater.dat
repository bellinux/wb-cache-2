40|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>grater</b> and peeler {{are needed}} in the {{processing}} of fruits {{in order to reduce}} the time required for fruits grating and peeling. Grating is important especially to make salad and for decoration purpose. A suitable grater is needed for specific decoration process. It is crucial for food (processing) industry to operate at minimal operating cost. Peeling using hands is time consuming and may require several workers to perform the operation and thus may increase the operating cost. Therefore in this study, a machine was designed to combine the process of grating and peeling in one device. This new designed machine is suitable to be used domestically. The machine is small-sized and lightweight and is convenient to carry and store. It is comprised of a clamping mechanism, grater, peeling blade, movable arm and also a pair of end-cutting blade. The prototype was tested for automatic grating and peeling process and manual peeling was also performed to peel the skin of selected fruits and vegetable. The prototype was able to grate several fruits and vegetables and also reduce the peeling time by 94 % when compared to manual peeling...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{the present}} work, fruits of Piper longum, Semecarpus anacardium, and whole plant of Achyranthus aspera have been {{screened}} for their cytotoxic constituents {{based on their}} traditional and Ayurvedic uses. Materials & Methods: Brine shrimp lethality (BSL) bioassay {{was used as a}} prescreening method to select the secondary metabolites with cytotoxic effect. Petroleum ether, chloroform, alcohol and water extracts of three Indian medicinal plants were tested by using this method. Results: Petroleum ether and chloroform extracts of Piper longum <b>fruits</b> showed <b>grater</b> cytotoxicity with LC 50 values of 0. 104 and 5. 719 g/ml, and various fractions of petroleum ether extract of Piper longum fruits showed the significant cytotoxicity. Conclusion: The activity guided isolation of the active principles from Piper longum fruits have given us with five biologically active, cytotoxic fractions one of them was identified as -sitosterol. This method of BSL bioassay can be successfully used as a cheaper, reliable and quicker tool for isolating the biologically active fractions especially antitumor (cytotoxic) agents from the natural sources...|$|R
