5|$|Albrecht Goštautas (Olbracht Gasztołd), Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of Vilnius, {{is barely}} {{visible in the}} top right of the {{painting}}. <b>His</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> the painting is intended to symbolize {{the wisdom of the}} king as a legislator.|$|E
5|$|As a {{byproduct}} of <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, Iwata became {{the public face of}} Nintendo. Iwata enjoyed conversing with reporters and would prepare stories in advance to entertain them. Even when time did not allow, he would mingle with interviewers and chat casually.|$|E

5|$|Cody made an {{immediate}} impact for the Crimson Tide defensive line, recording four tackles—one for loss—in a 34–10 rout of the Clemson Tigers. He {{and the rest}} of the defense also held the Tigers, which included running backs James Davis and C. J. Spiller, to zero net rushing yards. With <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the Crimson Tide defensive line, Cody earned himself the nickname of “Mount Cody.” By mid-season he was already considered the No. 1 nose tackle prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft by league scouts.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{is married}} to his high school {{sweetheart}} Melinda (Mel) Gilchrist (née Sharpe), a dietitian, and they have three sons, Harrison, Archie and Ted, and a daughter, Annie Jean. His family came under the spotlight {{in the months leading up}} to the 2007 Cricket World Cup as Archie's impending birth threatened <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> the squad; Archie was born in February and Gilchrist was able to take part in the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Johnson fell {{unconscious}} {{after this}} duel and was dragged from the battlefield; {{in addition to}} his five wounds, twenty other bullets had hit his horse and gear. But the war in the Northwest was over. Although there was no organized resistance to <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems. (The Canadians would not feed his men.) Johnson eventually recovered, except for a crippled hand, but he was still suffering from his wounds {{when he returned to the}} House in February 1814.|$|E
5|$|Marischal {{then joined}} with the Engager faction, who had {{made a deal with}} the king, and led a troop of horse to the Battle of Preston (1648) in support of the royalists. Following the {{execution}} of Charles I in 1649, the Engagers gave their allegiance to his son and heir: Charles II was proclaimed king, arriving in Scotland in June 1650. He visited Dunnottar in July 1650, but <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> Scotland prompted Oliver Cromwell to lead a force into Scotland, defeating the Scots at Dunbar in September 1650.|$|E
5|$|Now outside Parliament, Odlum {{maintained}} <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> {{the public}} eye through meetings {{and the work of}} his newspaper, The Crusader. His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election, when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory. In 1995 he accepted the position of Ambassador to the United Nations from Compton, his old enemy, holding it for only a year. When Compton resigned in 1996, Odlum chose to stand for election against his successor and lost the contest.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. <b>His</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|Fellow linebacker Ken Brown {{was named}} a first-team All-Big East selection, {{signifying}} his status {{as one of the}} best players at his position in the conference. He finished the season with 93 tackles, including six for loss and two sacks, enough for No. 3 on the team in tackles. Despite that success, Brown suffered a pulled hamstring before Virginia Tech's final regular-season game and <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> the Gator Bowl was doubtful. Virginia Tech sophomore defensive end Cornell Brown was named the best defensive college player in the state of Virginia by the Roanoke Times after earning 20 tackles for loss, including 11 sacks, and 35 quarterback hurries during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|With Speaker Schuyler Colfax’ {{election}} to the Vice Presidency in 1868, {{the leadership of the}} House became vacant. Blaine had only been a member of Congress since 1863, but he had developed a reputation for parliamentary skill and, aside from a growing feud with Roscoe Conkling of New York, was popular with his fellow Republicans. He was elected with the unanimous vote of the Republican members {{at the start of the}} 41st Congress in March 1869. Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House. He enjoyed the job and made <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> Washington more permanent by buying a large residence on Fifteenth Street in the city. At the same time, the Blaine family moved to a mansion in Augusta.|$|E

5|$|After {{an anxious}} journey of nine days {{during which they}} were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem. They stayed until Metternich regained his strength, then reached Amsterdam and The Hague, where they waited to hear {{the results of a}} {{demonstration}} by English chartists, planned for 10 April. On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar, famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed. (In all likelihood Metternich's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy.) Meanwhile, as he was denied his pension, Metternich was ironically reliant on loans.|$|E
5|$|During his {{slump in}} form, D'Oliveira was {{contacted}} by Tienie Oosthuizen, a {{director at the}} tobacco company Carreras, which was, alongside Rothmans, part of the South African Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation. Rembrandt {{had set up a}} group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately {{at the end of the}} 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.|$|E
5|$|King James rewarded Robert Cecil, whom {{he made a}} Privy Councillor and {{secretary}} of state, with the granting of the title of Earl of Salisbury in 1605 and Lord High Treasurer in 1608, making him {{the most powerful man}} at the royal court. As Cecil rose, Calvert rose with him. Calvert's foreign languages, legal training, and discretion made him an invaluable aide to Robert Cecil who, no lover of Catholics, seems to have accepted Calvert's conformity as beyond question. Working at the centre of court politics, Calvert exploited his influence by selling favours, an accepted practice for the times. Calvert accumulated a number of small offices, honours, and sinecures. In August 1605, he attended the King at Oxford, and received an honorary master-of-arts degree in an elaborate ceremony at which the Duke of Lennox (Ludovic Stewart), the earls of Oxford and Northumberland, and Cecilius received degrees. Given the prestige of the other graduates, Calvert's was the last awarded, but <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> such company signalled his growing stature.|$|E

5|$|Kruger {{and others}} in the Transvaal {{government}} disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts—to the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting <b>his</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations.|$|E
