5|$|Specter has {{received}} a 61% rating from the AFL-CIO. He voted for cloture on the Employee <b>Free</b> <b>Choice</b> Act in 2007. In early 2009, Specter announced {{he would not be}} voting for cloture on the same act in the 111th Congress. After Specter switched parties, he changed his position on the issue again, and {{wrote a letter to the}} unions indicating he supported card check legislation.|$|E
5|$|Solis was not {{a member}} of the Education and the Workforce Committee, but championed the Employee <b>Free</b> <b>Choice</b> Act and was the only member of Congress on the board of American Rights at Work, a pro-union {{organization}} that strongly supports the act, for whom she served as treasurer starting in 2004. On trade she voted against both the Dominican Republic–Central America trade agreement and the U.S.-Peru trade agreement, and also expressed opposition to a purposed bilateral U.S.-Colombia trade agreement, citing concerns about human rights violations. Solis opposed legislation that would soften job safety requirements. She received 100percent ratings from several pro-labor groups for the years 2005 through 2007, and was a major recipient of union political donations. United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta is one of Solis's role models.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our <b>free</b> <b>choice,</b> and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the <b>free</b> <b>choice</b> of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) {{criticized the}} {{argument}} on its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's existence {{has to be}} shown {{on the basis of}} the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed incompatible with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as incompatible with the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's <b>free</b> <b>choice</b> can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.|$|E
5|$|The two brothers' good {{relationship}} deteriorated after King Andrew had the child Solomon crowned king in 1057 or 1058. The coronation was {{the consequence of}} the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Empire, because the Germans did not acquiesce in a marriage between Solomon and Judiththe sister of the young German monarch, Henry IVuntil Solomon's right to succeed his father was declared and publicly confirmed. Thereafter Andrew was determined to secure the throne for his son. He invited Béla to his manor in Tiszavárkony, where the King offered his brother a seemingly <b>free</b> <b>choice</b> between a crown and a sword (which were the symbols of the royal and ducal power, respectively). However, he had ordered that Béla be murdered if he chose the crown. Having been informed of his brother's secret plan {{by one of his}} own partisans in the royal court, Béla opted for the sword, but he departed for Poland after the meeting.|$|E
5000|$|Molinism {{argues that}} God not only knows the {{singular}} outcomes {{of all our}} future <b>free</b> <b>choices,</b> but also knows what singular <b>free</b> <b>choices</b> would have eventuated in any possible circumstance. Truths of the latter sort are called [...] "counterfactuals of freedom," [...] and God's knowledge thereof {{is referred to as}} his [...] "middle knowledge." [...] This view holds an Ockhamist conception of foreknowlege, in which there are singular truths about what inevitably happens in the future despite the plurality of future contingents which may and may not come to pass. Molinists say that such foreknowlege can't determine such outcomes, because that's {{not the kind of thing}} foreknowledge can do.|$|R

5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} {{so early in the}} primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee <b>Free</b> <b>Choice</b> Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee <b>Free</b> <b>Choice</b> Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E

For Roemer, strict equality of opportunity obtains when people, irrespectively of circumstances beyond their control, have the same ability to achieve advantage through their <b>free</b> <b>choices.</b> To implement this idea, Roemer sorts people with similar circumstances into types and takes their <b>free</b> <b>choices</b> to be represented by their behaviour relative to other members of the same type or, as Roemer calls it, by their `relative e#ort'.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{synthesis}} of serial chain spatial mechanisms with revolute joints in which the rotations about the joints are coupled via cables and pulleys. Such coupled serial chain mechanisms offer a middle ground between the more versatile and compact serial chains and the simpler closed chains by combining some {{of the advantages of}} both types of systems. In particular, we focus on {{the synthesis of}} single degree-of-freedom, coupled serial chains with two revolute joints. We derive precision point synthesis equations for two precision points by combining the loop closure equations with the necessary geometric constraints in terms of the unknown mechanism parameters. This system of equations can now be solved linearly for the link vectors after a suitable selection of <b>free</b> <b>choices.</b> We optimize over the <b>free</b> <b>choices</b> to generate an end effector trajectory that closely approximates a desired end effector trajectory for motion generation and path following applications...|$|R
40|$|A recent proof, {{formulated}} in the symbolic language of modal logic, claims {{to show that}} contemporary quantum theory, viewed {{as a set of}} rules that allow us to calculate statistical predictions among certain kinds of observations, cannot be imbedded in any rational framework that conforms to the principles that (1) the experimenters' choices of which experiments they will perform can be considered to be <b>free</b> <b>choices,</b> (2) outcomes of measurements are unique, and (3) the <b>free</b> <b>choices</b> just mentioned have no backward-in-time effects of any kind. This claim is similar to Bell's theorem, but much stronger, because no reality assumption alien to quantum philosophy is used. The paper being commented upon argues that some such reality assumption has been smuggled in. That argument is examined here and shown, I believe, to be defective.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{dimensional}} synthesis of a spatial two-link, two revolute-jointed serial chain for path following applications, focussing on the systematic {{development of the}} design equations and their analytic solution for the three precision point synthesis problem. The kinematic design equations are obtained from the equations of loop-closure for end-effector position in rotation- matrix/vector form at the three precision points. These design equations form a rank-deficient linear system in the link-vector components. The nullspace of the rank deficient linear system is then deduced analytically and interpreted geometrically. Tools from linear algebra are applied to systematically create the auxiliary conditions required for synthesis and to verify consistency. An analytic procedure for obtaining the link-vector components is then developed after a suitable selection of <b>free</b> <b>choices.</b> Optimization over the <b>free</b> <b>choices</b> is possible to permit the matching of additional criteria and explored further. Examples of the design of optimal two-link coupled spatial R-R dyads are presented where the end-effector interpolates three positions exactly and closely approximates an entire desired path...|$|R
40|$|Are social inequalities {{in health}} unjust when {{brought about by}} {{differences}} in lifestyle? A widespread idea, luck egalitarianism, is that inequality stemming from individuals' <b>free</b> <b>choices</b> {{is not to be}} considered unjust, since individuals, presumably, are themselves responsible for such choices. Thus, to the extent that lifestyles are in fact results of <b>free</b> <b>choices,</b> social inequality in health brought about by these choices is not in tension with egalitarian justice. If this is so, then it may put in question the justification of free and equal access to health care and existing medical research priorities. However, personal responsibility is a highly contested issue and in this article we first consider the case for, and second the case against, personal responsibility for health in light of recent developments in philosophical accounts of responsibility and equality. We suggest—but do not fully establish—that at the most fundamental level people are never responsible {{in such a way that}} appeals to individuals' own responsibility can justify inequalities in health.
