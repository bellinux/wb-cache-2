Other sources have reported positive results treating dogs with moxidectin, imidacloprid, or milbemycin oxime.|$|E
40|$|Eye drops {{containing}} <b>ecothiopate</b> <b>iodide,</b> {{a potent}} anticholinesterase, produced symptoms simulating intestinal obstruction and prolonged the neuromuscular action of suxamethonium. The {{side effects of}} some drugs may simulate clinical conditions unrelated to the patient's origi-nal disease. In the following case it escaped our attention that a patient admitted as an abdominal emergency was receiving eye drops containing <b>ecothiopate</b> <b>iodide</b> (Phospholine Iodide), a strong anticholinesterase agent, because of glau-coma, and that the abdominal symptoms could {{have been caused by}} these eye drops. Previous knowledge about the eye drops and their strong anticholinesterase property would have saved the patient from surgical intervention and fro...|$|E
40|$|Mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragms were stimulated {{in vitro}} in the {{presence}} of the anticholinesterase <b>ecothiopate</b> <b>iodide</b> and prepared for light and electron microscopy at different times during and after the appearance of prolonged contractions localized at the endplate. The earliest changes were at the subsynapse, without damage to the plasma membrane, and comprised hypercontraction of the sarcomeres, dilatation and vesiculation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria, and dissolution of the Z-lines. Later there was damage to the plasma membrane. Also appearing later in the junctional region, but separated from the subsynapse by apparently normal muscle, were extrasynaptic hypercontractions, with a plasma membrane initially undamaged, but which became permeable after the contractile material divided into contraction clots. A hypothesis is proposed for the formation of such hypercontractions by abnormal mechanical factors arising from different contractile states along the length of the fibre, and is discussed with the role of prolonged transmitter action in the aetiology of myopathy...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} organophosphorus {{compounds}} which form a rapidly-ageing complex with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (e. g. pinacolyl S-(2 - trimethylaminoethyl) methylphosphonothioate (BOS)) and hence exert a persistent anticholinesterase (anti-ChE) action have been {{compared with other}} compounds with a shorter time course of inhibition (e. g. <b>ecothiopate</b> <b>iodide</b> (ECO)). Although the inhibition of AChE produced by BOS lasted longer than that seen with ECO, {{the time course of}} the myopathy appeared very similar. BOS also possessed a number of properties which have been seen with other anti-ChEs. BOS and ECO produced significant increases in neuromuscular "jitter" 5 days after injection, not only in the diaphragm but also in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Increases in "jitter" produced by ECO could be prevented by pyridostigmine prophylaxis or rapid treatment with pyridine- 2 - aldoxime methiodide. Some protection from the BOS-induced increases in "jitter" could be gained by repeated treatment with pyridine- 2 -aldoxime methiodide, an effect which could not be accounted for simply by enzyme reactivation. From experiments performed in Rej 129 mice it was determined that increases in "jitter", although demonstrated in some dystrophic muscles, could not be used as an early diagnostic tool. Because sequalae of inhibition were present some time after intoxication, by which time AChE appeared biochemically normal, experiments were performed to investigate inactivation of physiologically important AChE. The time course of extracellular MEPPs was utilised as an indicator of physiologically important AChE and compared with the AChE activity measured by the technique of Ellman et al. (1961). It was concluded that the degree of persistence of anti-ChE action was unimportant for the induction of myopathy with a time course of 3 - 24 hours, but had some importance in events of longer duration...|$|E
