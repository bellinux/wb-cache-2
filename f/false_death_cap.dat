5|$|This {{species is}} a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{widespread in the}} Americas and Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is a toxic mushroom that has muscarine, the same toxin as Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina {{as well as many}} species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera. It is often confused with various other European species. A.gemmata resembles the <b>false</b> <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> tawny grisette and panther cap mushrooms. Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two.|$|E
50|$|Amanita manginiana, {{also known}} as Mangin's <b>false</b> <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> is a species of the genus Amanita.|$|E
50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodlands in Autumn in Europe. It {{is also found in}} North American oak and pine forests.|$|E
50|$|Closely {{related to}} the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> (A. phalloides) {{they are among the}} most toxic known mushrooms, {{containing}} amatoxins as <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> do.|$|R
50|$|They {{resemble}} poisonous <b>death</b> <b>caps,</b> but can {{be distinguished}} by their pink spore print; the spore print is white for <b>death</b> <b>caps.</b> The two mushrooms have different distributions, with the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> generally not found where the straw mushroom grows natively, but many people, particularly immigrants from Southeast Asia to California and Australia, have been poisoned making this mistake.|$|R
50|$|Amanita subjunquillea, {{also known}} as the East Asian <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> is a {{mushroom}} of the large genus Amanita, which occurs in East and Southeast Asia. Deadly poisonous, it is a member of section phalloideae and related to the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> A. phalloides.|$|R
50|$|Edible {{species of}} Amanita include Amanita fulva (grisette), Amanita vaginata, Amanita calyptrata (coccoli), Amanita crocea, Amanita rubescens (blusher), Amanita caesarea (Caesar's mushroom), Amanita jacksonii (American Caesar's mushroom), and Amanita citrina (<b>false</b> <b>death</b> <b>cap).</b>|$|E
50|$|Known as the <b>false</b> <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> or Citron Amanita, Amanita citrina (previously {{also known}} as Amanita mappa), is a basidiomycotic mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It grows in {{silicate}} soil {{in the summer and}} autumn months. It bears a pale yellow or sometimes white cap, with white stem, ring and volva. Though it is not poisonous, its similarity to the lethal death cap (Amanita phalloides) precludes its use in cooking.|$|E
50|$|Amanita pseudoporphyria, {{also known}} as Hongo's <b>false</b> <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> is a species of agaric fungus from the genus Amanita that grows solitarily or gregarious in {{coniferous}} forests. Originally described from Japan, it is now also known in Northern India, Thailand, and Nepal. It is quite a common species in southern China and is sold in free markets, along with the similar mushroom, Amanita manginiana. It differs only slightly by having more abundant inflated cells of its volva, and its ellipsoid to broad ellipsoid spores.|$|E
50|$|Amanita arocheae, {{also known}} as the Latin American <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> is a {{mushroom}} of the large genus Amanita, which occurs in Mexico, Central America and South America. Deadly poisonous, it is a member of section Phalloideae and related to the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> A. phalloides.|$|R
50|$|Deadly {{poisonous}} species include Amanita abrupta, Amanita arocheae, Amanita bisporigera (eastern NA destroying angel), Amanita exitialis (Guangzhou destroying angel), Amanita magnivelaris, Amanita ocreata (western NA destroying angel), Amanita phalloides (<b>death</b> <b>cap),</b> Amanita smithiana, Amanita subjunquillea (East Asian <b>death</b> <b>cap),</b> Amanita verna (fool's mushroom), and Amanita virosa (European destroying angel).|$|R

500|$|Amanita phalloides , {{commonly}} known as the <b>death</b> <b>cap,</b> is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Widely distributed across Europe, A.phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in colour with a white stipe and gills. [...] Cap colour is variable, including white forms (see Taxonomy below) and thus not a reliable identifier.|$|R

5|$|Consumption of the <b>death</b> <b>cap</b> is {{a medical}} {{emergency}} requiring hospitalization. The four main categories of therapy for poisoning are preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and liver transplantation.|$|R

50|$|This {{mushroom}} is edible and good, although {{care must}} be taken as it is very like the deadly Amanita phalloides (<b>death</b> <b>cap)</b> when young. It is also prone to slug attacks.|$|R

5|$|The case of Claudius' {{poisoning}} is more complex. Claudius {{was known}} to have been very fond of eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of <b>death</b> <b>caps</b> instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from <b>death</b> <b>caps,</b> with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness.|$|R
50|$|Blaberus discoidalis, {{commonly}} known as the discoid cockroach, tropical cockroach, West Indian leaf cockroach, <b>false</b> <b>death's</b> head cockroach, Haitian cockroach, and drummer, is a cockroach native to Central America of the “giant cockroach” family, Blaberidae.|$|R
60|$|You see, therefore, that {{in either}} case, be Christianity true or <b>false,</b> <b>death</b> is demonstrably certain {{to us in}} refusing it. As philosophers, we can expect only death, and as unbelievers, we are {{condemned}} to it.|$|R
50|$|This mushroom's {{toxicity}} {{and symptoms}} are similar, if not {{identical to that}} of the <b>death</b> <b>cap.</b> Like other members of the subfamily Phalloideae, the fool's mushroom has been implicated in a number of serious or fatal poisonings.|$|R
