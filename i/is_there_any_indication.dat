2500|$|In the United States Navy's deed of custody {{given to}} the city of Baltimore in 1954 to repair and display Constellation, Rear Admiral John R. Hefferman assured Baltimore of its {{unbroken}} provenance, stating that [...] "Nowhere in these records, however, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> that the original Constellation, launched in 1797, was in fact broken up, stranded, scrapped or otherwise disposed of, nor is there any statement authorizing or sanctioning the disposal of the ship by any means whatsoever."

Herbert Gilliland wrote, [...] " [...] For much of the twentieth century, this ship was believed to be the 1797 frigate Constellation. In fact, however, when the 1797 frigate was being dismantled at the Gosport Navy Yard near Norfolk, Virginia, work was beginning on the 1854 sloop, likely reusing some timber from the old ship in building this very new one. The misidentification was maintained by deliberate deception, apparently to enhance the likelihood of the ship's being preserved as a historic relic.

2500|$|For example, Shakespeare {{must have}} used Hall for {{the scene where}} Gloucester is {{attempting}} {{to gain access to}} the Tower, and Woodville tells him that the order not to admit anyone came from Winchester. Dismayed, Gloucester refers to Winchester as [...] "that haughty prelate,/Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne're could brook" [...] (1.3.23–24). Only in Hall <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> that Henry V had a problem with Winchester. In Holinshed, there is nothing to suggest any disagreement or conflict between them. Another example of Shakespeare's use of Hall is found when Sir Thomas Gargrave is injured by the artillery strike at Orléans (1.5). In the play, he dies immediately, and the rest of the scene focuses on the death of the more senior soldier Salisbury. Likewise, in Hall, Gargrave dies immediately after the attack. In Holinshed, however, Gargrave takes two days to die (as he did in reality). The semi-comic scene where the French leaders are forced to flee Orléans half-dressed (dramatised in 2.1) also seems based on an incident reported only in Hall. When discussing the English retaking of Le Mans in 1428, Hall writes, [...] "The French, suddenly taken, were so amazed in so much that some of them, being not out of their beds, got up in their shirts.") Another incident involving Gloucester and Winchester is also unique to Hall. During their debate in Act 3, Scene 1, Gloucester accuses Winchester of attempting to have him assassinated on London Bridge. Hall mentions this assassination attempt, explaining that it was supposed to have taken place at the Southwark end of the bridge in an effort to prevent Gloucester from joining Henry V in Eltham Palace. In Holinshed however, there is no reference to any such incident. Another incident possibly taken from Hall is found in Act 3, Scene 2, where Joan and the French soldiers disguise themselves as peasants and sneak into Rouen. This is not an historical event, and it is not recorded in either Hall or Holinshed. However, a very similar such incident is recorded in Hall, where he reports of the capture of Cornhill Castle in Cornhill-on-Tweed by the English in 1441.|$|E

40|$|The {{share of}} {{flexible}} jobs on the Dutch labour market {{is among the}} highest in Western countries, in particular for recent graduates. In this study we examine why recent graduates enter into temporary contracts and whether flexible jobs match their qualifications worse than permanent jobs do. Graduates that enter into flexible jobs face large wage penalties, a worse job match and less training participation than those entering into permanent jobs, even after correcting for ability differences. When the labour market situation for a particular field of education deteriorates, a larger share of recent graduates is forced into flexible jobs, which may threaten their position on the labour market in the long run. Flexible work among graduates is unrelated to their willingness to take risks.

Moreover, the prediction of aggregate outcomes, using aggregate data, is less accurate than the prediction based on micro equations, and policy evaluation based on aggregate data ignoring heterogeneity in micro units can be grossly misleading.

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{evolutionary}} divergence of phenotypes between habitats is predominantly {{the result of}} the balance of differential natural selection and gene flow. Lava lizards (Microlophus albemarlensis) on the small island of Plaza Sur in the Galápagos archipelago inhabit contrasting habitats: dense vegetation on the western end of the island thins rapidly in a transitional area, before becoming absent on the eastern half. Associated with these habitats are phenotypic differences in traits linked to predator avoidance (increased wariness, sprint speed, and endurance in lizards from the sparsely vegetated habitat). This population provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis that reduced gene flow is necessary for phenotypic differentiation. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no evidence of any differences among habitats in allele frequencies at six out of seven microsatellite loci examined, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> of congruence between patterns of genetic variability and the change in vegetation regime.

We have the following suggestions, comments and concerns. The optimal anesthetic management of patients with LVHT is unknown as it may depend {{on the presence of}} additional cardiac abnormalities, underlying neuromuscular disorders (NMD), chromosomal abnormalities, or on the presence of pulmonary diseases. It may also depend on the previous medical history, especially on systolic dysfunction, em-bolism, arrhythmias, or previous adverse reac-tions to anesthesia. A family history positive for sudden cardiac death, heart failure, cardio-embolism, or ad-verse reactions to anesthetics could indicate that LVHT is familial and possibly associated with a NMD. Since LVHT is frequently associated with my-opathy, all patients should be investigated by a myologist before general anesthesia to prevent malignant hypertheremia, malignant hyper-thermia-like reactions, worsening of myopathy, fatigue, or confusional state.

The persecution of the Catholic Church was especially severe in the province of Tabasco, under anti-clerical governor Tomás Garrido Canabal.

5000|$|Both views {{believe that}} the Church of today is based on Paul's unique ministry. This belief is {{referenced}} in Scripture {{in what may be}} referred to as the [...] "Pauline Distinctive" [...] and the [...] "Gospel of the Grace of God", and marks an unmistakable shift away from the Mosaic law and the beginning of a completely new Church, called the [...] "Body of Christ" [...] consisting of both Jews and Gentiles [...] "in one body." [...] It is this distinction, rather than eschatology as such, that marks both camps. The Acts 2 camp says that the mystery of the church was merely first revealed through Paul rather than actually starting with Paul. The Mid-Acts and Acts 28 camps point out that Acts 2 was merely the beginning of the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy concerning the New Covenant made only with Israel. Nothing new that was not prophesied was going on there nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>indication</b> of the equality found in the church which is Christ's body in which Jew and Gentile are joint-heirs. Rather the men of Israel were being addressed concerning their king, kingdom, and their restoration unto it. Both the Mid-Acts and Acts 28 camps hold that all prophecy belongs to Israel and their literal kingdom and is not for the church. The New Covenant is with Israel and not the church. Christ's shed blood is the basis for redemption for all, as well as, the New Covenant for Israel. The New Covenant is not the cause of redemption, rather the shed blood is the cause for both. Thus the Acts 2 camp is inconsistent in failing to maintain the dispensational distinction between [...] "prophecy" [...] and [...] "mystery," [...] i.e., the earthly kingdom program for Israel from the heavenly program for the church.|$|E
