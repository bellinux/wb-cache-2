5|$|Media {{attention}} {{revolving around}} Selena's death helped increase sales of <b>Entre</b> a Mi Mundo, {{as well as}} her back catalogue. The album re-entered the Top Latin Albums chart, peaking at number four. <b>Entre</b> a Mi Mundo debuted at number 179 on the US Billboard 200, and peaked at number 97 on May 6, 1995. At the end of 1995, it was the seventh best-selling US Latin album and the fourth best-selling US Regional Mexican Album. In June 1995, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), due to having shipped 500,000 units. By 1994, the album had sold 200,000 units in Mexico. As of 1997, it had sold 385,000 units in Mexico, and had sold 1,000,000 copies in the United States. As of December 2002, the album had been certified six-times platinum (Latin), denoting shipments of 600,000 units in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay, Brazil and the Argentine {{provinces of}} <b>Entre</b> Rios and Corrientes joined in an {{offensive}} Alliance against Rosas on 29 May 1851. The {{text of the}} treaty declared that the objective was to protect Uruguayan independence, pacify its territory, and expel Oribe's forces. Urquiza would command the Argentine forces and Eugenio Garzón would lead the Colorado Uruguayans, with both receiving financial and military aid from the Empire of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Selena's {{full-length}} Spanish albums Selena (1989) and Ven Conmigo (1990), which included Tejano and other Mexican pop styles, she decided that her next recording would feature an English-language song.

EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career. In spite of this, Selena included the song on <b>Entre</b> a Mi Mundo.|$|E

5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a fair trial for the rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years in opposition and having lost much of his influence within his own party, Paraná accepted the post, believing he could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and <b>Entre</b> Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{reasonable}} assumption to make that anyone with a passing knowledge of British history will have heard of Samuel Pepys, the seventeenth-century ‘man about town’. His diary {{has been the subject}} of extensive research by scholars over three centuries and represents a spectacular primary source which is testament to a life lived to the full, in one of the most turbulent periods in British history. However, there is now competition for the title of most influential news- gatherer of the seventeenth century, in the form of Roger Morrice, a Presbyterian minister who acted as what today might be described as a political or investigative journalist for the period 1677 - 1691. His reporting activities serviced the informational needs of a network of Presbyterian patrons through manuscript newsletters which eventually he termed his <b>Entring</b> Book. The edited version of the <b>Entring</b> Book was published in 2007 under the auspices of Mark Goldie. Described by Goldie as a political work, there is no doubt that the emphasis of the <b>Entring</b> Book is distinctly politico-religious in nature and successfully captures the forces at work during the second half of the seventeenth century, ranging from the Restoration, the Popish Plot and the Exclusion Crisis to the Glorious Revolution. Notwithstanding this strong political bias and in spite of allusions to what today’s historians might describe as ‘social history’ in the edited <b>Entring</b> Book, much of the Book’s content can properly be termed as ‘social’ in nature, embracing significant subject-matter as wide-ranging as duelling, mortality, playhouses and the sexual mores of the period, alongside subjects such as diverse as child kidnap, urban violence, fire, weather and cases of suicide, to name but a few. With the political angles of the <b>Entring</b> Book well covered by Goldie et al, the purpose of this dissertation is two-fold. Firstly, to review the culture in which Morrice practised information-gathering for his patrons and, secondly, to shed more light on the so far neglected social dimensions of the <b>Entring</b> Book...|$|R
60|$|The {{times of}} the Birth and Passion of Christ, with such like niceties, being not {{material}} to religion, were little regarded by the Christians of the first age. They who began first to celebrate them, placed them in the cardinal periods of the year; as the annunciation of the Virgin Mary, on the 25th of March, which when Julius Cæsar corrected the Calendar was the vernal Equinox; the feast of John Baptist on the 24th of June, which was the summer Solstice; the feast of St. Michael on Sept. 29, which was the autumnal Equinox; {{and the birth of}} Christ on the winter Solstice, Decemb. 25, with the feasts of St. Stephen, St. John and the Innocents, as near it as they could place them. And because the Solstice in time removed from the 25th of December to the 24th, the 23d, the 22d, and so on backwards, hence some in the following centuries placed the birth of Christ on Decemb. 23, and at length on Decemb. 20: and for the same reason they seem to have set the feast of St. Thomas on Decemb. 21, and that of St. Matthew on Sept. 21. So also at the entrance of the Sun into all the signs in the Julian Calendar, they placed the days of other Saints; as the conversion of Paul on Jan. 25, when the Sun <b>entred</b> [Aquarius]; St. Matthias on Feb. 25, when he <b>entred</b> [Pisces]; St. Mark on Apr. 25, when he <b>entred</b> [Taurus]; Corpus Christi on May 26, when he <b>entred</b> [Gemini]; St. James on July 25, when he <b>entred</b> [Cancer]; St. Bartholomew on Aug. 24, when he <b>entred</b> [Virgo]; Simon and Jude on Octob. 28, when he <b>entred</b> [Scorpio]: and if there were any other remarkable days in the Julian Calendar, they placed the Saints upon them, as St. Barnabas on June 11, where Ovid seems to place the feast of Vesta and Fortuna, and the goddess Matuta; and St. Philip and James on the first of May, a day dedicated both to the Bona Dea, or Magna Mater, and to the goddess Flora, and still celebrated with her rites. All which shews that these days were fixed in the first Christian Calendars by Mathematicians at pleasure, without any ground in tradition; and that the Christians afterwards took up with what they found in the Calendars.|$|R

5|$|In 1953 the {{collection}} of 17 short stories El trueno <b>entre</b> las hojas (1953; Thunder Among the Leaves) was published and circulated internationally, {{but it was not}} until the 1960 publication of the novel Hijo de hombre (Son of Man) that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success. The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative perspectives and historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, Yo, el Supremo, written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted Hijo de hombre into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication.|$|E
5|$|Isolationist Paraguay {{was more}} {{difficult}} to win over. Brazil made the initial overtures, becoming the first country to formally recognise Paraguayan independence in 1844. This soon led {{to the establishment of}} excellent diplomatic relations. The Brazilian ambassador in Paraguay, Pimenta Bueno, became a private councilor to President Carlos Antonio López. A defensive alliance was signed on 25 December 1850 between Brazil and Paraguay, in which López agreed to supply the Empire with horses for its army. But Paraguay refused to contribute troops to fight Rosas, believing that Justo José Urquiza (who had invaded Uruguay in 1839 and in 1845), the ruler of the Argentine <b>Entre</b> Rios province, secretly wished to annex Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Brazil, now {{ascendant}} under Emperor Dom PedroII, provided {{support to}} the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, {{as well as to}} the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in <b>Entre</b> Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Months before <b>Entre</b> a Mi Mundo was {{scheduled}} to be released, Pérez was booked on charges for driving under the influence, assaulting police officers, resisting arrest, and initiating a high-speed chase with police. In December 1992, Pérez was convicted and was ordered to pay $670 (1992 USD) in fines, court costs, and attorney fees. Pérez wrote that he felt guilty for the crimes that he was charged with, noting that Selena tried to convince Abraham that Pérez was a well-rounded person. Pérez later told Abraham about his wrongdoing, but was dumbfounded when Abraham forgave him, a reaction that Pérez was not expecting. After the band completed the recording sessions for <b>Entre</b> a Mi Mundo, several members of the band and their friends went to a hotel in San Antonio, Texas to celebrate. According to Pérez, he, along with several of his friends, trashed the hotel. The next morning, Abraham was contacted by the manager of the hotel where the incident took place; Abraham immediately fired two road crew members. Pérez believed that Abraham would come for him next and fire him, but found that after he had apologized, Abraham accepted his apology and allowed him to continue being the band's guitarist.|$|E
5|$|The {{customs law}} set trade {{barriers}} to products {{produced in the}} country, and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods, together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of {{the control of the}} port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces, and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of <b>Entre</b> Ríos has grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.|$|E
