In this study, the performance of a <b>DLC</b> <b>coated</b> tool is assessed and its tool wear mechanisms investigated. For the cutting conditions used during these trials, it has been identified that the <b>DLC</b> <b>coated</b> tool exhibited severe tool wear due to delamination and diffusion in comparison with the uncoated carbide tools.

The hydrogen content of former DLC was 14. 5 % and that of latter was 14. 7 %.

The {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) {{diamond and}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are deposited on the cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) cutting tools respectively using the hot filament {{chemical vapor deposition}} (HFCVD) technique and the vacuum arc discharge with a graphite cathode.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the cutting performance of three different coated tips by the material removal rate (MRR) measurement and the temperature rise (TR) investigation in ultrasonic osteotomy. Materials and methods: Three stainless steel tips with different coated treatments to have the coefficients of friction of 0. 5, 0. 4, and 0. 1 for uncoated tip, titanium nitride (TiN) coated tip, and diamond-like carbon (<b>DLC)</b> <b>coated</b> tip, respectively, were tested. The tip was fixed in the hand-piece and powered by an ultrasonic device (Cur scale, Bonart, Taiwan) with power mode of 40, 45 and 50. The ultrasonic hand-piece was mounted on the column of the X-Y table, and a uniform down force of 3  N was provided by the voice coil motor. A groove on the bovine bone specimen was obtained as a result of the downward action together with ultrasonic vibration of the tip. The MMR and TR were measured and evaluated. Results: The average MMR for the <b>DLC</b> <b>coated</b> tip under the operation mode 50 of the ultrasonic device was 0. 164  mm 3 /s as compared with 0. 153  mm 3 /s of TiN coated tip and 0. 147  mm 3 /s of the uncoated tip. The average TR in 60 seconds operation was 8. 1 °C for the uncoated tip, 6. 8 °C for the TiN coated tip, and 4. 5 °C for the <b>DLC</b> <b>coated</b> tip. Conclusion: The <b>DLC</b> <b>coated</b> tip leads to the highest material removal rate and least temperature rise among the three types of tip under study. This is due to its low coefficient of friction and less power is needed to overcome the friction force in ultrasonic osteotomy...|$|R

Severe friction and wear in some machine parts consumes high amount of energy, which makes the process energy inefficient.

Some important process variables that affect the tribological characteristics of <b>DLC</b> <b>coating</b> are adhesion promoter intermediate layer, substrate surface roughness, hydrogen incorporation or hydrogen non involvement, and coating deposition parameters (e. g., bias voltage, etching, current, precursor gas, time, and substrate temperature). Working condition of DLC-coated parts also affects the tribological characteristics, such as temperature, sliding speed and load, relative humidity, counter surface, and lubrication media (DLC additive interaction). Different types of lubricated oils and additives are used in engine parts to minimize friction and wear.

Samples were tested in two different force conditions of 1900 N and 2400 N, and in four different impact cycles as per 1000, 10000, 100000, 500000, then surfaces of these specimens were analyzed both macroscopically and microscopically and achieved results were documented. Finally a comparison among {{the size of the}} biggest appeared surface ring cracks, number of appeared surface ring cracks that were above 40 µm, indentation radius and penetration depth of the impacted surface areas after applying cyclic impact force were made, and results were shown. As the final result of the introduced impact fatigue test it is concluded that samples designated as I and H (Ovako steel grade 804 Q_DLC coated, 528 Q_DLC respectively) had the same and best impact fatigue resistance among the tested samples, following by <b>DLC</b> <b>coated</b> samples designated as G (803 J), these samples were followed from the best to worst as per samples E (528 Q_induction hardened), samples B (256 G_carburized), samples J (804 Q_through hardened), samples D (277 Q_nitrided), samples C (225 A_nitrided), and worst achieved results were from samples designated as A (804 Q_annealed).

40|$|AbstractTo {{differentiate}} between the roles of surface topography and chemical composition on influencing friction and transfer in sliding contact, {{a series of tests}} were performed in situ in an SEM. The initial sliding during metal forming was investigated, using an aluminum tip representing the work material, put into sliding contact with a polished flat tool material. Both DLC-coated and uncoated tool steel was used. By varying the final polishing step of the tool material, different surface topographies were obtained. The study demonstrates the strong influence from nano topography of an unpolished <b>DLC</b> <b>coated</b> surface on both coefficient of friction and material transfer. The influence of tool surface chemistry is also discussed...|$|R
