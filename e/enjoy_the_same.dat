5|$|The medieval aristocratic {{household}} was not {{fixed to}} one location, {{but could be}} more or less permanently on the move.

5|$|Many scholars, however, have {{disagreed}} with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism {{did not begin}} with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy. In Milan, Venice and Florence, the small city-state governments {{led to the development}} of the earliest forms of capitalism. In the 16th century, Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland. Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the labour theory of value.|$|E
