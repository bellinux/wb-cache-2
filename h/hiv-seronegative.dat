40|$|Background: The {{dynamics}} of CD 4 + T cell reconstitution {{and changes in}} immune activation and inflammation in HIV- 1 disease following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are incompletely defined and their underlying mechanisms poorly understood. Methods: Thirty-nine treatment-naïve patients were treated with raltegravir, tenofovir DF and emtricitabine. Immunologic and inflammatory indices were examined in persons with sustained virologic control during 48 weeks of therapy. Results: Initiation of ART increased CD 4 + T cell numbers and decreased activation and cell cycle entry among CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell subsets, and attenuated markers of coagulation (D-dimer levels) and inflammation (IL- 6 and TNFr 1). These indices decayed at different rates and almost all remained elevated above levels measured in <b>HIV-seronegatives</b> through 48 weeks of viral control.

We provide results on this test derived from 1, 549 subjects (<b>HIV-seronegatives</b> (HIV-) and seropositives (HIV+) classified according to ADC stage). Timed Gait was found to be a useful screening and assessment tool for evaluating ADC and correlated with clinical ADC staging as well as more extensive structured neurological and neu-ropsychological evaluations. Analysis of covariance results (with age and education as covariates) revealed symptomatic HIV+(SX) and AIDS groups having significantly slower Timed Gait scores than those in the HIV – and asymptomatic HIV+(ASX) groups. The SX group obtained significantly slower timed gait scores than those in the AIDS group. There was a significant increase in Timed Gait scores with each increase in dementia staging with the HIV- subjects having the fastest mean Timed Gait scores and the HIV+ dementia stage 2 + having the slowest. These normative data should prove useful in both recognition of ADC and treatment response.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of herpes zoster, the relationship between herpes zoster and immunological markers, and the prognostic value of herpes zoster for progression of HIV disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 966 homosexual participants in The Amsterdam Cohort Study were studied. Herpes zoster was defined by its characteristic clinical presentation. Incidence was calculated using Poisson regression, cumulative incidence by the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and the prognostic value was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The incidence of first episodes of herpes zoster was 3. 31 per 1000 person-years (PY) in <b>HIV-seronegatives</b> and 51. 51 per 1000 PY in HIV- 1 -seropositive individuals. Recurrences only occurred in HIV- 1 -positive patients (25. 6 %). Cumulative incidences of first episodes increased linearly with the duration of follow-up. In HIV- 1 -seropositives the incidence was 31. 2 per 1000 PY at CD 4 + cells > or = 500 x 10 (6) /l, 47. 2 per 1000 PY [relative risk (RR), 1. 51; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 78 - 2. 94] at CD 4 + cells 200 - 499 x 10 (6) /l and 97. 5 per 1000 PY (RR, 3. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 54 - 6. 32) at CD 4 + cells < 200 x 10 (6) /l. Besides CD 4 + cell counts, CD 3 monoclonal antibodies and phytohaemagglutinin-induced T-cell reactivity were independent predictors for herpes zoster. The hazard ratio for AIDS after herpes zoster was 1. 6 (95 % CI, 1. 1 - 2. 4) and for death 1. 7 (95 % CI, 1. 1 - 2. 5), but these were not independent from CD 4 + cell counts.

40|$|Abstract Background Currently, T-cell based gamma {{interferon}} (IFNγ) release assays (IGRAs) are acknowledged {{as the best}} methods available for the screening of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and also as aid for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB). To our information, the performance of these diagnostic tests has not been evaluated in Ethiopia. Therefore, {{the intent of this}} study was to evaluate the performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFTGIT) in patients clinically suspected of active pulmonary TB (PTB) as well as in healthy subjects prior to its utilization for the epidemiological study of active TB and LTBI in Afar pastoralists. Methods The sensitivity of QFTGIT was evaluated in 140 subjects who were clinically suspected of PTB using the cut-off value recommended by the manufacturer (≥ 0. 35 IU/ml) and disease-specific cut-off value. Sputum culture result was used as a gold standard. The specificity of the test was evaluated both in patients and in 55 tuberculin skin test (TST) negative healthy subjects. Results Out of the 140 study participants, 37 (26. 4 %) were positive for active PTB by culture. Out of the 37 subjects who had positive results by culture, 6 individuals were HIV-seropositive. Out of the 103 subjects who were negative by culture, 6 subjects had indeterminate results and 21 were HIV-seropositive. The performance of the test was assessed using data from 107 (31 culture positive and 76 culture negative) individuals who were clinically suspected of PTB and <b>HIV-seronegatives.</b> Using the manufacturer recommended cut-off value, the sensitivity of the test was 64. 5 % (20 / 31), while its specificity was 36. 8 % (28 / 76). The sensitivity of the test was increased to 77. 4 %, while the specificity was reduced to 23. 7 % using a cut-off value ≥ 0. 1 IU/ml of IFNγ as disease-specific cut-off value. In TST negative healthy subjects, the specificity of the test was 58. 2 %. Conclusion Our findings revealed a low sensitivity of QFTGIT in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in the present study area using the cut-off value recommended by the manufacturer. Nevertheless, the sensitivity increased from 64. 5 % to 77. 4 % by lowering the cut-off value recommended by the manufacturer to ≥ 0. 1 IU/ml of IFNγ level. Hence, it is of practical importance to evaluate the performance of QFTGIT in population under different settings prior to its application either for the diagnosis of active TB or LTBI. </p...|$|R

Objectives: This study aimed {{to determine whether there}} was any difference in radiological presentation of pulmonary TB between HIV-seropositive and <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients. Patients and Methods: Information on 204 patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of pulmonary TB to the infectious ward of Razi Hospital, Ahvaz, between 2004 and 2008 was obtained from their records. They were divided into HIV-seropositive and <b>HIV-seronegative</b> groups.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the outcome of}} HIV-seropositive patients under highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) with anal cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy (CT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical outcome of 81 <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients (1988 - 2003) and 10 consecutive HIV-seropositive patients under HAART (1997 - 2003) that were treated with 3 -D conformal RT of 59. 4 Gy and standard 5 -fluorouracil and mitomycin-C were retrospectively analysed. 10 TNM-stage and age matched <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients (1992 - 2003) were compared with the 10 HIV-seropositive patients. Pattern of care, local disease control (LC), overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and toxicity were assessed. RESULTS: RT with or without CT resulted in complete response in 100 % of HIV-seropositive patients. LC was impaired compared to matched <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients after a median follow-up of 44 months (p = 0. 03). OS at 5 years was 70 % in HIV-seropositive patients receiving HAART and 69 % in the matched controls. Colostomy-free survival was 70 % (HIV+) and 100 % (matched HIV-) and 78 % (all HIV-). No HIV-seropositive patient received an interstitial brachytherapy boost compared to 42 % of all <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients and adherence to chemotherapy seemed to be difficult in HIV-seropositive patients. Acute hematological toxicity reaching 50 % was high in HIV-seropositive patients receiving MMC compared with 0 % in matched <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients (p = 0. 05) or 12 % in all <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients. The rate of long-term side effects was low in HIV-seropositive patients. CONCLUSION: Despite high response rates to organ preserving treatment with RT with or without CT, local tumor failure seems to be high in HIV-positive patients receiving HAART. HIV-seropositive patients are subject to treatment bias, being less likely treated with interstitial brachytherapy boost probably due to HIV-infection, and they are at risk to receive less chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|We {{infected}} 11 HIV-seropositive volunteers whose CD 4 + cell counts were 1350 cells/mL (7 of {{whom were}} receiving antiretrovirals) with Haemophilus ducreyi.

No subject experienced a sustained change in CD 4 + cell count or HIV RNA level. The cellular infiltrate in biopsy samples obtained from the HIV-seropositive and <b>HIV-seronegative</b> subjects did not differ with respect to the percentage of leukocytes, neutrophils, mac-rophages, or T cells.

METHODS: The presence and concentration of anti-A 60 IgG antibodies was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 208 HIV-seropositive and 91 <b>HIV-seronegative</b> Zaïrian patients with smear-positive pulmonary TB. The relationship between anti-A 60 IgG levels and HIV serostatus, CD 4 + lymphocyte counts, presence of clinical AIDS, and tuberculin skin test results was verified. RESULTS: Only 36. 5 % of the HIV-seropositive, compared with 69. 2 % of the <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients had a positive anti-A 60 IgG test (P < 0. 00001).

OBJECTIVE: To determine if a KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is present in both endemic <b>HIV-seronegative</b> and HIV-seropositive KS lesions from African patients. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from Ugandan patients with KS and non-KS tumor control patients attending a university-based oncology clinic were examined in a blinded case-control study. Tissue DNA specimens were examined for detectable KSHV genome by nested polymerase chain reaction performed at two independent laboratories. RESULTS: We identified KSHV in 17 (85 %) of 20 KS tissue specimens from <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients and 22 (92 %) of 24 KS tissue specimens from HIV-infected persons. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions from four HIV-infected persons and four <b>HIV-seronegative</b> persons were positive for KSHV. Unlike previous studies in North America and Europe, three (14 %) of 22 non-KS cancer control patients' tissue specimens were also positive for KSHV that resulted in an overall odds ratio of 49. 2 (95 % confidence interval, 9. 1 to 335) for detecting KSHV in KS lesions from patients in Uganda.

Generally, they rarely cause disease in the immunocompetent host but are highly oncogenic when associated with immunosuppression. Although the high prevalence of HHV- 8, CMV and EBV {{has been well documented}} in Africa, such data are sparse from Ghana. Methods Serum samples from 3275 <b>HIV-seronegative</b> healthy blood donors and 250 HIV-AIDS patients were tested for antibodies specific for HHV- 8, CMV and EBV by IgG ELISA assays. Differences in seropositivity rates by gender and age were evaluated using the Chi-square test with Yates correction. Results Of the 3275 <b>HIV-seronegative</b> healthy blood donors tested, 2573 (78. 6 %) were males and 702 (21. 4 %) were females, with ages ranging from 18 to 65 years (median 32. 6; mean 31. 2; mode 30).

40|$|Background. We {{studied the}} {{efficacy}} of a short-course regimen of chemotherapy for pulmonary tuberculosis in Kinshasa, Zaire. We also assessed whether, among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, treatment should be extended from 6 to 12 months. Methods. HIV-seropositive and <b>HIV-seronegative</b> outpatients with pulmonary tuberculosis were treated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol daily for two months, followed by rifampin plus isoniazid twice weekly for four months. The HIV-positive patients who had no evidence of tuberculosis were then randomly assigned to receive either rifampin plus isoniazid or placebo twice weekly for a further six months. We also followed a comparison group of <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients who received no further treatment for tuberculosis after six months. Results. After six months, 260 of 335 HIV-seropositive and 186 of 188 <b>HIV-seronegative</b> participants could be evaluated, and their rates of treatment failure were similar: 3. 8 and 2. 7 percent, respectively.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether vaccination {{of healthy}} <b>HIV-seronegative</b> and HIV- 1 -seropositive antiretroviral therapy-treated subjects with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing an HIV- 1 immunogen (MVA. HIVA) induced MVA-specific T cell responses. Using IFN-γ Elispot assays, we observed new or increased responses to MVA virus in 52 % of <b>HIV-seronegative</b> subjects and 93 % HIV- 1 seropositive subjects; MVA-specific T cell frequencies were generally low and correlated poorly with T cell {{responses to the}} HIV- 1 immunogen. In two vaccinees, responses were mapped to CD 8 + T cell epitopes present in replication-competent vaccinia virus. These data support further evaluation of MVA as a viral vector for HIV- 1 immunogens...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) has been detected in cervical secretions from HIV-infected women. We report {{the isolation of}} HIV from four cervical biopsy specimens. Cervicitis was shown by immunohistochemical staining in cervical biopsy specimens from four HIV-seropositive women; cervicitis was not found in cervical biopsy specimens from four <b>HIV-seronegative</b> women. We found HIV antigens in monocyte-macrophages and endothelial cells within the submucosa of three of these cervices by specific immunohistochemical staining. Small numbers of HIV-infected cells resembling lymphocytes also {{were found in the}} cervical mucosa. The virus was not shown by culture or immunohistochemistry in cervical biopsy specimens from the four <b>HIV-seronegative</b> women. These findings suggest that HIV enters cervical secretions fro...|$|E
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{retinitis}} occurs predominantly in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -infected patients. It {{was also}} reported in <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients with systemic autoimmune disorder requiring systemic immunosuppression, organ or bone marrow transplantation, haematological or breast malignancy receiving chemotherapy, ocular diseases following intraocular or periocular corticosteroid injection, diabetes mellitus and Good syndrome. However, CMV retinitis {{in patients with}} concurrent dermatomyositis and malignancy has not been previously reported. It has not been reported in cancer other than haematological or breast malignancy, or in cancer patient prior to chemotherapy. We report a case of 40 -year-old <b>HIV-seronegative</b> woman with underlying dermatomyositis and lung malignancy who developed right CMV retinitis which relapsed after recommencement of immunosuppressant. Both episodes of CMV retinitis were successfully treated after taken her immunocompromised state into consideration...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} plasma {{concentrations of}} soluble receptors for IL- 2 (sIL- 2 R) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in 149 haemophilia patients. Soluble IL- 2 R levels were elevated in 37 % of 62 <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients (mean 570 +/- 27 U/ml versus 361 +/- 17 U/ml {{in the control}} group, P less than 0. 0001), in 78 % of 68 HIV-seropositive patients (928 +/- 49 U/ml, P less than 0. 0001), and in 95 % of 19 AIDS/ARC patients (1578 +/- 199 U/ml, P less than 0. 0001 compared with controls and with <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients; P less than 0. 005 compared with HIV-seropositive asymptomatic patients). A negative correlation was observed between sIL- 2 R, relative and absolute numbers of CD 4 + cells (P less than 0. 0001), and CD 4 /CD 8 ratios (P less than 0. 0001). There was also a negative correlation between sIL- 2 R in plasma and the cellular expression of IL- 2 R (P less than 0. 001). We found a significant association of sIL- 2 R and plasma neopterin (P less than 0. 0001). With progression of the disease from <b>HIV-seronegative</b> to seropositive without symptoms and to full manifestation of AIDS/ARC, sIL- 2 R plasma levels increased. The highest levels were found {{at the time of}} diagnosis of AIDS/ARC, but the levels decreased again during the following 18 months. Eight per cent of <b>HIV-seronegative</b> patients, 32 % of HIV-seropositive patients, and 24 % of patients with AIDS/ARC had increased plasma TNF-alpha. We conclude that sIL- 2 R and TNF-alpha plasma levels are elevated in HIV-infected haemophilia patients and that sIL- 2 R is a marker for disease progression from asymptomatic HIV-seropositive to AIDS/ARC...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{enumeration}} of CD 4 + T-lymphocytes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -infected {{individuals is}} an essential tool for staging HIV disease, to make decisions for initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), for monitoring response to ART and to initiate chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Therefore, {{it is important to}} know the level of immunocompetence of a particular geographical region by enumerating the baseline CD 4 + T-lymphocytes in <b>HIV-seronegative</b> healthy adults. Aim: The aim was to enumerate CD 4 + T-lymphocytes counts of healthy <b>HIV-seronegative</b> adults in eastern India. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were obtained from hundred <b>HIV-seronegative</b> healthy adults (mean age 32. 6 ± 11. 3 years) who attended integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC- 1) for HIV information. Immunophenotypic enumeration of CD 4 + T-lymphocytes was carried out using flow cytometer. Results: The mean absolute CD 4 + T-lymphocytes count was 823. 9 (± 243. 4) cells/μl. The established range of CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts for men and women were 338 – 1292 cells/μl (mean 793. 4 ± 243. 5 cells/μl) and 402 – 1321 cells/μl (mean 885. 9 ± 234. 8 cells/μl) respectively. Women had significantly higher absolute CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts (p< 0. 001) when ompared to men. The distribution of mean absolute CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts among different age groups showed that individuals within 18 to 27 years of age group had significantly higher CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts of 893. 3 ± 43. 4) cells/μl. Conclusions: Our findings of CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts among <b>HIV-seronegative</b> adults in east India adds to the emerging data supporting the presence of significant differences in reference to CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts between different populations within and outside the country...|$|E
