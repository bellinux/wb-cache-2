30|$|However, {{what most}} people buy is a {{relatively}} low security level of basic <b>endowment</b> <b>insurance</b> for urban and rural residents. Before this, there was no <b>endowment</b> <b>insurance</b> system for the urban unemployed population and the rural population. In September 2009, China launched the pilot project for a new rural social endowment insurance; in July 2011, China launched the pilot project for an urban resident <b>endowment</b> <b>insurance.</b> In 2014, these two pilot projects were combined to create an integrated basic <b>endowment</b> <b>insurance</b> system for urban and rural residents. By the end of 2014, {{the number of people}} participating in basic <b>endowment</b> <b>insurance</b> for urban and rural residents had reached 501.07 million. But the security level of such social insurance is relatively low. In 2013, the monthly per capita pension provided by the basic <b>endowment</b> <b>insurance</b> for urban and rural residents was only 82 yuan; in 2014, it was 90 yuan (14 USD per month) (Caijing Net 2015), which is far from enough to pay for someone’s daily needs.

40|$|As wives {{generally}} are younger than their husbands, {{and as they}} also have a higher life expectancy, wives generally have larger incentives to save for old age than their husbands. This paper analyses the household members? attitudes towards saving for old age, and the relation with the household saving and portfolio choice behaviour. Based on a panel of two-person households (e. g. with a husband and a wife) from the Dutch CentER Savings Survey, we find that wives find saving for old age more important than their husbands. In a special high-income subsample we find that for this group the household members find saving for old age equally important. The major determinant of both household members? attitudes is the husband?s mandatory pension rights. Both household members? attitude relate to the probability of holding annuity and <b>endowment</b> <b>insurances,</b> while only the husband?s attitude relates to the probability of holding stocks. Concerning discretionary household wealth we find evidence for an impact of the husband?s attitude, but no evidence for an impact of the wife?s attitude...|$|R
