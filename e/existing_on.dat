5|$|Its {{name has}} been {{attributed}} to the Nativity of John the Baptist, when John Cabot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497 and to a Basque fishing town with the same name. <b>Existing</b> <b>on</b> maps as early as 1519, {{it is one of the}} oldest European settlements in North America. It was officially incorporated as a city in 1888. With a metropolitan population of approximately 214,000 (as of July 1, 2015), the St. John's Metropolitan Area is Canada's 20th largest metropolitan area and the second largest Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Atlantic Canada, after Halifax.|$|E

5|$|The {{expressway}} {{portion of}} M-63 is {{a relic of}} a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, {{and one of the}} two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002. Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> this stretch of expressway.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s Terry-Thomas began {{appearing}} in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in {{films such as}} Bachelor Flat, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder Your Wife. From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He {{spent much of his}} fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} been {{described}} as unique because of the reluctance of the victims to come forward. It has been said that there are difficulties in determining the guilt of particular offenders, due to their behaviour <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> a moral continuum and the law being dichotomous in nature, being an 'absolute concept'. Therefore, even though the victims may have actually consented to the relationships, the law still deems it as criminal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Existing</b> <b>on</b> the West Lancashire Coastal Plain, most of {{the town}} is only {{slightly}} above sea-level and thus parts of Southport used to be susceptible to flooding.

But in February 1997, new sea defences started being constructed and in 2002 the whole project was completed.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of {{what came to}} be known as the Prague Castle began near the end of the 9th century, with a fortified settlement already <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> the site in the year 800. The first masonry under Prague Castle dates from the year 885 at the latest. The other prominent Prague fort, the Přemyslid fort Vyšehrad, was founded in the 10th century, some 70 years later than Prague Castle. Prague Castle is dominated by the cathedral, which was founded in 1344, but completed in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Some {{settlements}} do show a clear {{continuity of}} occupation from pre-Roman times into the provincial period, such as Cetea and Cicau. Archaeological evidence taken from pottery show a continued occupation of native Dacians {{in these and}} other areas. Architectural forms native to pre-Roman Dacia, such as the traditional sunken house and storage pits, remained during Roman times. Such housing continued to be erected well into the Roman period, even in settlements which clearly show an establishment after the Roman annexation, such as Obreja. Altogether, approximately 46 sites have been noted as <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> a spot in both the La Tène and Roman periods.|$|E
25|$|In {{coherent}} sheaf theory, {{pushing to}} the limit {{of what could be}} done with Serre duality without the assumption of a non-singular scheme, the need to take a whole complex of sheaves in place of a single dualizing sheaf became apparent. In fact the Cohen–Macaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this is far from the general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to reformulate. With it came the idea that the 'real' tensor product and Hom functors would be those <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} was the price of coffee, Colombia's largest export and {{the main source of}} its foreign exchange. The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) attempted to have the maximum price of coffee frozen at the level <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, Colombia objected on the basis that the cost of producing and transporting coffee had increased due to wartime conditions, and, if the price was not adjusted to factor in these conditions, the economy would decline. The OPA relented, and agreed to raise prices immediately and to adjust them in the future based on increased production and transportation costs.|$|E
25|$|The 1789 Montgomerie Estate Plan by Ainslie shows a farm by {{this name}} <b>{{existing}}</b> <b>on</b> {{the other side}} of the road from the existing East Lambroughton, reached by a lane branching off the toll road. Its lands encompass all of the field running down to the woods. It appears that this farm was demolished and East Lambroughton was built to replace it, recycling worked stones from the old farm can be seen in the present building (2010). The 'footprint' and some foundations stones of the old Lambroughtonend Farm can still be seen in the field (2010), next to the site of a small burn, now piped down to the Lochrig Burn. William Roy's map of 1745 - 47 shows a roughly 'L' shaped farm and tree belts at this location.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} script, {{which was}} designed for Swampy Cree, had ten such letter forms: Eight for syllables based on the consonants p-, t-, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y- (pronounced /p, t, ts, k, m, n, s, j/), another for vowel-initial syllables, and finally a blended form, now obsolete, for the consonant cluster sp-. All were written with a light line to show the vowel was short and a heavier line to show the vowel was long: ᑲ ka, ᑲ kâ. (A hand-written variant, a superscript dot for vowel length, is now used in printing as well.) One consonant, w, had no letter form of its own but was indicated by a diacritic on another syllable; this is because it could combine {{with any of the}} consonants, as in ᑿ kwa, as well as <b>existing</b> <b>on</b> its own, as in ᐘ wa.|$|E
