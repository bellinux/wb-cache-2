50|$|Frazer v Walker (1967) is a {{landmark}} New Zealand court case {{that went to}} the Privy Council on appeal. The case upheld the concept that an owner of interest in land which was originally obtained from the rightful owner through fraud, still obtains an <b>indefeasible</b> <b>interest</b> in that title if they were unaware of the fraud.|$|E
5000|$|In both {{of these}} {{countries}} statutory reform has altered {{the manner in which}} real property dealings are conducted. What is termed a [...] "mortgage" [...] is a legal interest that is registered against the fee simple title of the property. Since in both countries, the Torrens title system of land registration is used, being registered as proprietor or as a mortgagee creates an <b>indefeasible</b> <b>interest</b> (unless the acquisition of the registration was by land transfer fraud). The mortgagee therefore never holds the fee simple, and there is a statutory process for initiating and conducting a mortgagee sale in the event that the mortgagor defaults. In New Zealand, as in England, say, the land title database is now electronic so there are no paper [...] "title documents".|$|E
40|$|In 2007 and 2008 {{there were}} a series of cases in New South Wales, and two cases in Queensland, dealing with the {{enforceability}} of registered mortgages where the mortgagor’s (purported) execution of the instrument had been forged. In none of these cases was the mortgagee found to have been guilty of fraud, which meant that the mortgagee obtained an <b>indefeasible</b> <b>interest</b> in the relevant land. However, as Campbell J has pointed out, ‘[n]otwithstanding that registration confers indefeasibility on a mortgagee, {{there is still a}} question “indefeasibility for what?”’. This article examines the consequences for the mortgagor and the mortgagee following the registration, without fraud {{on the part of the}} mortgagee, of a mortgage where the mortgagor’s execution has been forged...|$|E
40|$|Someone forges the {{mortgagor}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{signature on}} a mortgage over Torrens title {{land and the}} instrument is registered. If the mortgagee {{did not participate in}} the fraud and had no knowledge of it, the mortgagee acquires an <b>indefeasible</b> <b>interest</b> in the land by way of a charge. A series of cases in New South Wales has clarified the position as to whether that charge is effective to secure the amount advanced by the mortgagee to the person posing as the mortgagor. If the registered mortgage itself expressly states that the mortgagee has lent the mortgagor a particular amount (a mortgage in the 2 ̆ 2 traditional form 2 ̆ 2), then the mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s charge effectively secures that specified principal amount, together with appropriate interest and costs, against the mortgagor 2 ̆ 7 s land...|$|E
