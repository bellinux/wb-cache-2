5000|$|Humanity {{continues}} the <b>eugenic</b> <b>practice</b> started long ago (in this regard, {{the novel is}} reminiscent of Lukyanenko's short story The Road to Wellesberg). Even {{as far back as}} the 21st century, methods were developed allowing the alteration of a human's genotype to adapt him or her to a particular position. Such operation (or [...] "specification") is performed on a just-conceived fetus at the request of the parents, who, by doing this, forever decide the future of their child. Specified humans are called [...] "specs", while non-modified humans are labeled [...] "naturals". The cost of specification, the possibility of getting a credit for the procedure, and other conditions depend on the planet's demand in the requested profession. Specs are genetically compatible with naturals, as the former retain their non-modified genotype, and specified genes are only passed on if both parents possess them; however, the latter case still remains a choice on the parents' part. This allows the retention of specification without the help of geneticists (but only if the speshes wish for their children to have the same specification) but also allows the return to the original genotype in just one generation.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} American {{writers in the}} 1920 s demonstrated the eugenic influence on motherhood through fictional representations of violent resistance. My project charts {{the ways in which}} fictional, dramatic, and cinematic texts displayed negative visualizations of maternity {{as a response to the}} early twentieth-century preoccupation with eugenics. In this project, I argue that these methods of opposition took place through actions of child abuse, maternal neglect, and infanticide. Part of this dissertation identifies eugenically motivated cultural discourse, including various forms of the media, that used both overt and subliminal messages to encourage pronatalism among the white upper and middle classes while promoting sterilization and the use of birth control for minority populations. By addressing this rhetoric, I draw attention to the pervading dialogue that influenced and shaped the texts used in the dissertation. In addition, to analyze depictions of positive and negative eugenics is to reveal a social policy powerful enough to go beyond issues of class and race and drastically impact American mothers as a united group; instead of being labeled as a problem of race, color, or class, I argue instead that these American modernist writers interpreted eugenic rhetoric as a problem of gender, common to any woman who found herself with child. While many studies exist on eugenics and literature, as well as on motherhood and literature, the combination of the two topics is one that has previously gone unanalyzed. Therefore, addressing the problems raised by this subject also highlights how both male and female writers were compelled to construct situations of subversive mothering. By situating my project in the 1920 - 1930 time frame, I limit my commentary to how writers approached eugenics during its most popular and influential time period in the United States. My chapters argue that these constructs of subversive motherhood appear through cinematic portrayals of dysgenic children and the negative effects on their maternal figures (The Phantom of the Opera and The Black Stork), unhappiness in the role of mother and outward expressions of anger toward the offspring in question (Edith Summers Kelley 2 ̆ 7 s Weeds), decisive participation in the act of abortion and infanticide (Nella Larsen 2 ̆ 7 s Quicksand), and daughters who refuse to participate in the act of mothering because of their negative upbringings (Edith Wharton 2 ̆ 7 s The Children). By incorporating the genres of fiction, drama, and cinema alongside historical and cultural documents, I inform my audience of the threatening and harmful realities of childbearing during this time period, and will show that the connection between eugenics and motherhood reflects a desire of American writers to reveal the grim repercussions of <b>eugenic</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|E

Central among those targeted by such <b>eugenic</b> <b>practices</b> were people {{with a variety of}} disabilities, … single mothers, First Nations and Metis people, eastern Europeans, and the poor.” [...] In Alberta, roughly 2,800 were performed under its 1928 Sexual Sterilization Act before it was repealed in 1972.

The present paper attempts to show that this pretension would lead to the future dissolution of those very characteristics of current eugenics that distinguish it from the classic form. we therefore propose an epistemological analysis of present and/or future scientific practices in order to redefine those parameters that prevent their identification with the eugenic movement of the past century...|$|R

40|$|There {{is concern}} that human {{applications}} of modern genetic technologies may lead inexorably to eugenic abuse. To prevent such abuse, {{it is essential}} to have clear, formal principles as well as algorithms for distinguishing genetics from eugenics. This work identifies essential distinctions between eugenics and genetics in the implied nature of the social contract and the importance ascribed to individual welfare relative to society. Rawls's construction of 'justice as fairness' is used as a model for how a formal systems of ethics can be used to proscribe <b>eugenic</b> <b>practices.</b> Rawls's synthesis can be applied to this problem if it is assumed that in the original condition all individuals are ignorant of their genetic constitution and unwilling to consent to social structures which may constrain their own potential. The principles of fairness applied to genetics requires that genetic interventions be directed at extending individual liberties and be applied to the greatest benefit of individuals with the least advantages. These principles are incompatible with negative eugenics which would further penalize those with genetic disadvantage. These principles limit positive <b>eugenics</b> to those <b>practices</b> which are designed to provide absolute benefit to those individuals with least advantage, are acceptable to its subjects, and further a system of basic equal liberties. This analysis also illustrates how simple deviations from first principles in Rawls's formulation could countenance eugenic applications of genetic technologies...|$|R

40|$|Although, the {{histories}} of forced sterilizations and <b>eugenics</b> <b>practices</b> have been all but forgotten by most, these subjects gained national attention again when the state of North Carolina repealed its sterilization law in 2003. The history of forced sterilization in the United States began with a eugenics based demand to wipe out populations that were constructed as inferior. The evolution of who was sterilized shifted in accordance to changing national social perception of who was ‘unfit’ to reproduce, from the developmentally disabled to ‘immoral’ and ‘irresponsible’ women. North Carolina has also taken unprecedented steps towards providing reparations for the living victims of the statute. The history, current sentiments, and unique components of compulsory sterilization in North Carolina help to illustrate why the government has taken such proactive steps in offering restitution while others have not.

40|$|Abstract: Between 1928 and 1972, {{a unique}} {{chapter in the}} history of {{eugenics}} developed in Western Canada, directly affecting a number of individuals believed to be “defective, ” resulting in their sterilization and institutionalization under legislative law. These individuals included many marginalized groups, {{but the vast majority of}} those targeted had developmental disabilities. The history of eugenics in Western Canada, therefore, is an important legacy of disability studies. The Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) project, Living Archives on Eugenics in Western Canada joins some 30 research scholars and sterilization survivors, and 12 community partners across Western Canada, in order to engage communities in developing accessible resources to investigate and create awareness surrounding the history of eugenics in Canada, including its social and political contexts. These resources include interviews and narrative videos with individuals directly affected by <b>eugenic</b> <b>practices,</b> now mostly in their 60 s and 70 s.
