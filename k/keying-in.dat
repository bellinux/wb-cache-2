5000|$|Registry of Scripless Securities (RoSS) is the {{official}} record of absolute ownership, legal or beneficial title or interest in GS. Upon award of GS to a GSED at the auction, the securities award record are downloaded electronically into the GSED’s Securities Principal Account in RoSS. Every sale of GS by a dealer reduces its Securities Principal Account in RoSS. Conversely, every purchase of GS by a GSED increases its Securities Principal Account in RoSS. The ownership/interest of secondary market buyer, trustee, pledgee, etc. of GS is recorded in the Securities Client Account in RoSS. The recording is done by merely <b>keying-in</b> the trade at the respective BIS terminals of the trade counter-parties and within seconds the trade information is received by the RoSS. At the end of trading hours, all matched trades (confirmed by both counterparties) are referred to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) for settlement (debit of GSED buyer and credit of GSED seller Demand Accounts). This completes the process of trading in the secondary market. This effectively conforms with the G-30 Recommendations of Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) through Netting but Same-Day-Settlement.

40|$|Abstract: Transliteration editors are {{essential}} for <b>keying-in</b> language scripts into the computer using QWERTY keyboard. Applications of transliteration editors {{in the context of}} Universal Digital Library (UDL) include entry of meta-data and dictionaries for many languages both local and International. In this paper we propose a simple approach for building transliteration editors for International languages such as Arabic, Persian and Urdu using Unicode and by taking advantage of its rendering engine which is called Unicode rendering engine. We demonstrate the usefulness of the Unicode based approach to build transliteration editors for International Languages, and report its advantages needing little maintenance and few entries in the mapping table, and ease of adding new features such as adding letters, to the transliteration scheme. We also explain {{how easy it is to}} add any language and build a transliteration editor using Unicode and its mapping tables. We demonstrate the transliteration editor for 3 International languages and also explain how this approach can be adapted for any foreign language...|$|E
40|$|HISP) {{based in}} South Africa is widely {{implemented}} {{in many developing}} countries as a health data analysis tool. Through the HISP Tanzania project, the DHIS was piloted in five districts in Tanzania. The objective {{of this study was to}} qualify and quantify the extent to which district health workers consider the adaptation of the DHIS software to the needs of the routine health management information system. In a period of 14 months (from June 2003 to August 2004) data were collected from health workers trained to use the software through a triangulation of various qualitative data collection techniques including interview, questionnaire, participant observations and retrospective testing. The software was evaluated in terms of reliability, usability and user satisfaction. In general the reliability of the software was rated high but its usability was rated to be low. The software was found not to accommodate some health data from various health programmes and there was a mismatch between the implemented online data entry forms/reports and their respective paper-based forms/reports. The study recommends improved design of the DHIS user interface (forms) and reports to replicate the paper-based forms in order to assure usability and reduce the incidences and impact of human errors in the <b>keying-in</b> of health data...|$|E
40|$|Designs of human-computer systems {{intended}} for time-critical multitasking {{can benefit from}} {{an understanding of the}} human factors that support or limit multitasking performance and a detailed account of the human-machine interactions that unfold in a given task environment. An integrated, computational cognitive model can test and provide such an understanding of the human factors related to multitasking and reveal the dynamic interactions that occur in the task at the level of hundreds of milliseconds. This dissertation provides such a detailed computation model of human multitasking, built for a time-critical, multimodal dual task experiment and validated by the eye tracking data collected from the experiment. This dissertation also develops new approaches to conducting cognitive modeling, which enable efficient and systematical exploration of multitasking strategies, as well as principled model comparisons. The dual task experiment captures many key aspects of real-world multitasking scenarios such as driving. In the experiment, the participant interleaved two tasks: one requires tracking a constantly-moving target with a joystick, and the other requires <b>keying-in</b> responses to objects moving across a radar display. Peripheral visibility and auditory conditions of the experiment were manipulated to assess the influence of peripheral visual information and auditory information on multitasking performance. Detailed eye tracking data were collected, and this dissertation presents a detailed analysis of this set of data, which provides the bases for model development and validation. The cognitive model presented in this dissertation, built based on the Executive Processes-Interactive Control cognitive architecture, accurately accounted for the eye movement data and other behavioral data of each participant using systematic explorations of task strategies and parameters configured for each individual participant. A parallelized cognitive modeling system was developed to accommodate the much increased computational demand of strategy exploration and individualized model building. New model comparison techniques were proposed to determine which strategy best accounts for the empirical data. Payoff analyses were applied, and they revealed people’s tendency to locally optimize task performance based on task payoff as well as instantaneous feedback. The results point to new approaches for building a priori models that predict multitasking performance. This dissertation includes previously published coauthored material...|$|E
