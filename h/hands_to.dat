5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence.

5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of <b>Hands</b> <b>to</b> the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{non-contact}} variants of American football, such as flag football. In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim {{to pull a}} flag tied around his waist. Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier to be touched to be considered downed. A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with either one or two <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> be considered down, depending on the rules used.|$|E

These range from simple {{exercise}} (such as jumping as high {{out of the water}} as possible with two <b>hands)</b> <b>to</b> drills not specifically used in water polo; rather they are used to improve the goalkeeper's core muscles (such as catching a ball dropped from the side into the water).|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied from his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> a {{post in the}} ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{inherited}} {{an aging}} and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained in private <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> operate the various commuter services which, by law, {{did not pass}} to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that they turn their <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E
5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E

5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> make contact with and manipulate the object.

Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E
5|$|Later American explorers, some of {{whom were}} {{originally}} part of the Lewis and Clark expedition, journeyed into the Snake River watershed and records show a variety of names have been associated with the river. The explorer Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition named the river as Mad River. Others gave the river names including Shoshone River (after the tribe) and Saptin River. Eventually, the name Snake River was derived from an S-shaped gesture the Shoshone tribe made with their <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> represent swimming salmon. Explorers misinterpreted it to represent a snake, giving the river its present-day name.|$|E
