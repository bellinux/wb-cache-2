40|$|T HE {{mitochondrial}} encephalomyopathies are a di-verse {{group of}} disorders {{that result from}} the struc-tural, biochemical, or <b>genetic</b> <b>derangement</b> of mito-chondria. 1 Since mitochondrial dysfunction can affect virtually all organ systems (Fig. 1), physicians in many specialties see patients with mitochondrial diseases. Despite a bewildering array of clinical manifestations (Tables 1 and 2) and variations {{in the mode of}} onset, course, and progression of disease, many mitochondri-al disorders share prominent systemic effects (Table 2) that contribute to their morbidity. Our understanding of the role of mitochondrial DNA in certain diseases has evolved rapidly since 1988, when the first mutations in mitochondrial DNA were discovered...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a multifactorial disease that {{develops}} {{as a result of}} interactions among genetic, environmental, and hormona l factors. Multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>derangements</b> are believed {{to be involved in the}} pathogenes is of breast cancer, including the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and/or the disregulation of proto-oncogenes. Age, hormones, and environmental factors further in uence these <b>genetic</b> <b>derangements.</b> Spontaneous and chemically induced animal models of breast cancer have been limited in their usefulness. The advent of targeted gene mutations has allowed for a more speci c exploration of the pathogenes is of breast cancer by creating mouse models that mimic single or multiple gene alterations found in human mammary tumors. The genes targeted in these models include mouse mammary tumor integration sites and genes that encode for growth regulators, signal transduction proteins, cell cycle proteins, and cell matrix proteinases. In this review, I summarize tumor morphology and the relevance of each model to the pathogenes is and progression of human breast cancer. These models have great potential for elucidating the multistep process of mammary gland carcinogenesis and for contributing to the identi cation of novel therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{alterations}} {{frequently are}} involved {{in the development of a}} pituitary adenoma in young age. We here characterize the functional role of a deletion in CDKN 1 B 5 '-UTR region (c. - 29 _- 26 delAGAG) identified in an acromegalic patient that developed a growth hormone in pituitary adenoma during childhood. Our results show that the identified novel heterozygous deletion in the CDKN 1 B 5 '-UTR region associates with a reduction in CDKN 1 B mRNA levels, a predicted altered secondary mRNA structure, and a reduced CDKN 1 B 5 '-UTR transcriptional activity in vitro. The patient displayed loss of heterozygosity in the same CDKN 1 B 5 '-UTR region at tissue level and the 5 'UTR region containing the deleted sequence encompasses a GRE. These findings indicate that the identification of functional alterations of newly discovered <b>genetic</b> <b>derangements</b> need to be fully characterized and always correlated with the clinical manifestations...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{molecular}} abnormalities {{contribute to}} the <b>genetic</b> <b>derangements</b> involved in tumorigenesis. Chromosomal translocations are a frequent source of these derangements, producing unique fusion proteins with novel oncogenic properties. EWS/ETS fusions in Ewing sarcoma are {{a prime example of}} this, resulting in potent chimeric oncoproteins with novel biological properties and a unique transcriptional signature essential for oncogenesis. Recent evidence demonstrates that EWS/FLI, the most common EWS/ETS fusion in Ewing sarcoma, upregulates gene expression using a GGAA microsatellite response element dispersed throughout the human genome. These GGAA microsatellites function as enhancer elements, are sites of epigenetic regulation and are necessary for EWS/FLI DNA binding and upregulation of principal oncogenic targets. An increasing number of GGAA motifs appear to substantially enhance EWS/FLI-mediated gene expression, which has compelling biological implications as these GGAA microsatellites are highly polymorphic within and between ethnically distinct populations. Historically regarded as junk DNA, this emerging evidence clearly demonstrates that microsatellite DNA plays an instrumental role in EWS/FLI-mediated transcriptional regulation and oncogenesis in Ewing sarcoma. This unprecedented role of GGAA microsatellite DNA in Ewing sarcoma provides a unique opportunity to expand our mechanistic understanding of how EWS/ETS fusions influence cancer susceptibility, prognosis and transcriptional regulation...|$|R
40|$|Endocrine tumors {{arise from}} {{endocrine}} glands. Most endocrine tumors are benign but malignant variants exist. Several endocrine neoplasms display loss {{of parts of}} chromosome 11 or 18, produce hormones and responds poorly to conventional chemotherapeutics. The multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes are mainly confined to endocrine tumors. This opens the question if there exists a single or several endocrine tumor genes. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe <b>genetic</b> <b>derangements</b> in endocrine tumors. Paper I: Investigation of mutational status of SDHAF 2 in parathyroid tumors. SDHAF 2 is located in the proximity of 11 q 13, a region that frequently displays loss in parathyroid tumors. We established that mutations in SDHAF 2 are infrequent in parathyroid tumors. Paper II: Study of SDHAF 2 gene expression in a cohort of benign pheochromocytomas (PCC) (n= 40) and malignant PCC (n= 10). We discovered a subset ofÂ  benign PCC (28 / 40) and all malignant PCC (10 / 10) with significantly lower SDHAF 2 expression. Benign PCC with low SDHAF 2 expression and malignant tumors consistently expressing low levels of SDHAF 2 were methylated in the promoter region. SDHAF 2 expression was restored in vitro after treatment with 5 - aza- 2 -deoxycytidine. Paper III: HumanMethylation 27 array (Illumina) covering 27578 CpG sites spanning over 14495 genes were analyzed in a discovery cohort of 10 primary small neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) with matched metastases. 2697 genes showed different methylation pattern between the primary tumor and its metastasis. We identified several hypermethylated genes in key regions. Unsupervised clustering of the tumors identified three distinct clusters, one with a highly malignant behavior. Paper IV: Loss of chromosome 18 is the most frequent genetic aberration in SI-NETs. DNA from SI-NETs were subjected to whole exome capture sequencing and high resolution SNP array. Genomic profiling revealed loss of chromosome 18 in 5 out of 7 SI-NETs. No tumor-specific somatic mutation on chromosome 18 was identified which suggests involvement of other mechanisms than point mutations in SI-NET tumorigenesis. Paper V: The cost for diagnostic genetic screening of common susceptibility genes in PCC is expensive and labor intensive. Three PCC from three patients with no known family history were chosen for exome capture sequencing. We identified three variants in known candidate genes. We suggest that exome-capture sequencing is a quick and cost-effective tool...|$|R
40|$|As {{the main}} iron storage {{site in the}} body and the main source of the iron-regulatory hormone, hepcidin, the liver plays a pivotal role in iron homeostasis. A {{variable}} degree of hepatic iron accumulation has long been recognized in a number of chronic liver diseases. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis display increased iron deposits in the liver, with an hepatocellular, mesenchymal, or mixed pattern, and recent reports have documented a concomitant aberrant hepcidin expression that could be linked to different coincidental pathogenic events (e. g. the etiological agent itself, necroinflammation, metabolic <b>derangements,</b> <b>genetic</b> predisposition). The present study reviews the pathogenic mechanisms of iron accumulation in steatohepatitis during alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and the role of excess iron in chronic disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Human low-grade astrocytomas {{frequently}} recur {{and progress}} to states of higher malignancy. During tumor progression TP 53 alterations {{are among the}} first <b>genetic</b> changes, while <b>derangement</b> of the p 16 /p 14 ARF/RB- 1 system occurs later. To probe the pathogenetic significance of TP 53 and RB- 1 alterations, we introduced a v-src transgene driven by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) regulatory elements (which causes preneoplastic astrocytic lesions and stochastically astrocytomas of varying degrees of malignancy) into TP 53 +/- or RB- 1 +/- mice. Hemizygosity for TP 53 or RB- 1 did not increase the incidence or shorten the latency of astrocytic tumors in GFAP-v-src mice {{over a period of}} up to 76 weeks. Single strand conformation analysis of exons 5 to 8 of non-ablated TP 53 alleles revealed altered migration patterns in only 3 / 16 tumors analyzed. Wild-type RB- 1 alleles were retained in all RB- 1 +/-GFAP-v-src mice-derived astrocytic tumors analyzed, and pRb immunostaining revealed protein expression in all tumors. Conversely, the GFAP-v-src transgene did not influence the development of extraneural tumors related to TP 53 or RB- 1 hemizygosity. Therefore, the present study indicates that neither loss of RB- 1 nor of TP 53 confer a growth advantage in vivo to preneoplastic astrocytes expressing v-src, and suggests that RB- 1 and TP 53 belong to one single complementation group along with v-src in this transgenic model of astrocytoma development. The stochastic development of astrocytic tumors in GFAP-v-src, TP 53 +/- GFAP-v-src, and RB- 1 +/- GFAP-v-src transgenic mice indicates that additional hitherto unknown genetic lesions of astrocytes contribute to tumorigenesis, whose elucidation may prove important for our understanding of astrocytoma initiation and progression...|$|R
