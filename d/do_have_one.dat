2500|$|Kierkegaard says, [...] "all who {{are expecting}} <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> thing in common, {{that they are}} expecting {{something}} in the future, because expectancy and the future are inseparable ideas." [...] But many people live in [...] "conflict with the future" [...] Yet, [...] "by the eternal, one can conquer the future, because the eternal is the ground of the future, and therefore through it the future can be fathomed. What, then, is the eternal power in a human being? It is faith. What is the expectancy of faith? Victory-or, as Scripture so earnestly and so movingly teaches us, that all things must serve for good those who love God." [...] Kierkegaard writes about expectancy once more in these discourses. Expectancy {{has to do with}} hope. [...] "The healthy individual lives simultaneously in hope and in recollection, and only thereby does his life gain true and substantive continuity. Thus he has hope and therefore does not wish to go backward in time, as do those who live only in recollection. What, then, does recollection do for him, for it certainly must have some influence? It places a sharp on the note of the moment; the further back it goes, the more often the repetition, the more sharps there are. For example, if in the present year he experiences an erotic moment, this is augmented by his recollection of it in the previous year etc. … Hope hovers over it as a hope of eternity that fills out the moment.|$|E

I'd like to go sneaking around the Piedmont hills looking for you. I'd like to meander into those rooms of yours at Berkeley for the first time.

What's a married woman like that to you, or you to her; or what have you to do with understanding her position? When you've a wife of your own, if ever you <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> you'll find you'll have trouble enough then without anybody else interfering with you. Not but what I believe you're innocent as a lamb about Mrs Lupex; that is, as far as any harm goes. But you've got yourself into all this trouble by meddling, and was like enough to get yourself choked upstairs by that man. And who's to wonder when you go on pretending to be in love with a woman in that way, and she old enough to be your mother? What would your mamma say if she saw you at it?" ...|$|E
