5|$|Guinea pigs are prey animals whose {{survival}} <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mask {{pain and}} signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.|$|E
5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} {{does not seem}} to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
2500|$|When suspicious, a Kangal {{will stand}} with its tail and ears erect and give an alarm call, inciting the sheep to gather around it for protection. The Kangal’s first <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> place itself between the {{perceived}} threat and the sheep or master. Once the sheep are safely behind it, the Kangal confronts the intruder. When {{faced with a}} wolf, the Kangal sometimes is successful in intimidating the enemy, but it will resort to a physical confrontation if the predator stands its ground. Specialized wolf killers are known as [...] "kurtçul kangal" [...] in their homeland.|$|E
5000|$|His dad voted Labour, he said. He used to vote Labour, too. But he'd {{bought his}} own house now. He'd set up his own business. He was doing very nicely. [...] "So I've become a Tory" [...] he said. In that moment, he {{crystallised}} for me {{the basis of our}} failure... His <b>instincts</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> get on in life. And he thought our <b>instincts</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.|$|R

50|$|Even so, {{at first}} the {{brothers}} were not enemies, though their differing temperaments gradually became clear. When Savnok, a servant of the brothers, stole the armor of Stern Alia and used its power {{to set up a}} dictatorship in the mortal world, Hextor's <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> hide Savnok's body (after he had killed him with one of his mother's arrows), put the weapons and armor back, and pretend nothing had happened. Heironeous' <b>instincts</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> tell the truth to his mother and face the consequences, but his desire to protect his weaker brother caused him to uncomfortably acquiesce to the scheme.|$|R
2500|$|The climax to {{the film}} differs {{significantly}} from the comics, {{with the use of}} the jetpack and rocket launcher: Millar called this [...] "necessary" [...] as [...] "we're building up so much stuff that we needed some Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star moment". Comic writer Stephen Grant argued that the film [...] "cheated" [...] on its premise of a [...] "real life" [...] superhero by having these increasingly fantastic events and that this was [...] "why it works. That's where much of the humor comes from... when the film finally makes the notion [...] explicit we're already so deep into the magician's act that our <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> play along".|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{leaders of the}} major Federal {{political}} parties have demonstrated support for high level immigration (including John Howard, Peter Costello and Kim Beazley). There was, overall, an upward trend {{in the number of}} immigrants to Australia over the period of the Howard Government (1996–2007). The Rudd Labor Government (elected 2007) increased the quota again once in office. In 2010, both major parties continue to support high immigration, with former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd advocating a 'Big Australia'; and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott stating in a 2010 Australia Day speech that: [...] "My <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> extend to {{as many people as possible}} the freedom and benefits of life in Australia".|$|E
2500|$|Gail Bederman takes a {{different}} view in her Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880–1917. There she describes how various people of the time either challenged or upheld the idea that [...] "civilization" [...] is predicated on white masculinity. She closes with a chapter on 1912's Tarzan of the Apes because the story's protagonist is, according to her, the ultimate male {{by the standards of}} 1912 white America. Bederman does note that Tarzan, [...] "an instinctivily chivalrous Anglo-Saxon", does not engage in sexual violence, renouncing his [...] "masculine impulse to rape." [...] However, she also notes that not only does Tarzan kill black man Kulonga in revenge for killing his ape mother (a stand-in for his biological white mother) by hanging him, [...] "lyncher Tarzan" [...] actually enjoys killing black people, the cannibalistic Mbongans, for example. Bederman, in fact, reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane, he does so as [...] "Tarzan, the killer of beasts and many black men." [...] The novel climaxes with Tarzan saving Jane—who in the original novel is not British, but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland—from a black ape rapist. When he leaves the jungle and sees [...] "civilized" [...] Africans farming, his first <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> kill them just for being black. [...] "Like the lynch victims reported in the Northern press, Tarzan's victims—cowards, cannibals, and despoilers of white womanhood—lack all manhood. Tarzan's lynchings thus prove him the superior man." ...|$|E

50|$|Horses {{sleep better}} when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard {{to watch for}} predators. A horse kept entirely alone may not sleep well because its <b>instincts</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> keep a {{constant}} eye out for danger.|$|R
5000|$|Referee Pat McEnaney {{sought to}} punish those he deemed the worst offenders. He {{decided he would}} send off Mayo's Liam McHale and Meath's John McDermott.

5000|$|The album's success caught Young {{off guard}} {{and his first}} <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> back away from stardom.

A rougher ride but I saw more {{interesting}} people there." ...|$|R
5|$|McCormack {{starred in}} the science-fiction film Alien Trespass (2009), in which he played Doctor Ted Lewis, who gets possessed by an alien marshal, Urp, after he crash-lands on Earth. When asked about his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Pope {{said that}} when {{individuals}} have a regular workout regiment, but sustain an injury, and can't {{wait to get back}} to working out, that it has a psychiatric protective effect for them.

60|$|This is {{the true}} {{characteristic}} of genius; our destiny and <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> unriddle the world, {{and he is the}} man of genius who feels this instinct fresh and strong in his nature; who perceiving the riddle and the mystery of all things even the commonest, needs no strange and out-of-the-way tales or images to stimulate him into wonder and a deep interest.|$|E

5000|$|Retiring {{from the}} ring as a boxer {{did not mean}} {{retiring}} as a public figure for Conn. Conn, who appeared in a 1941 movie called The Pittsburgh Kid, maintained his boxing skills into his later years. He stepped {{into the middle of}} a robbery at a Pittsburgh convenience store in 1990 after the robber punched the store manager. Conn took a swing at the robber and ended up {{on the floor of the}} store, scuffling with him. [...] "You always go with your best punch—straight left," [...] Conn told television station WTAE afterward. [...] "I think I interrupted his plans." [...] The robber managed to get away, but not before Conn pulled off his coat, which contained his name and address, making the arrest an easy one. His wife said jumping into the fray was typical of her husband. [...] "My <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get help," [...] she said at the time.

60|$|He {{does not}} have to get up early and worry dumb-bells in his nightshirt; he just lies on a sofa in an elegant {{attitude}} and muscle comes to him. If his horse declines to jump a hedge, he slips down off the animal's back and throws the poor thing over; it saves argument. If he gets cross and puts his shoulder to the massive oaken door, we know {{there is going to be}} work next morning for the carpenter. Maybe he is a party belonging to the Middle Ages. Then when he reluctantly challenges the crack fencer of Europe to a duel, our <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> call out and warn his opponent.|$|E
6000|$|... "To me {{the whole}} thing was clear from the very first. When I read the account of the murder--the knife! stabbing!--bah! Don't I know enough of English crime not to be certain at once that no Englishman, be he ruffian from the gutter or be he Duke's son, ever stabs his victim in the back. Italians, French, Spaniards do it, if you will, and women of most nations. An Englishman's <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> strike and not to stab. George Higgins or Lord Arthur Skelmerton would have knocked their victim down; the woman only would lie in wait till the enemy's back was turned. She knows her weakness, and she does not mean to miss.|$|E
6000|$|Some of {{the sharp}} {{things she had}} said to him, {{subjected}} to after-reflection in solitude, failed to justify themselves. Her better sense began to reproach her. She tried to silence that unwelcome monitor by laying the blame on Alban. Why had he been so patient and so good? What harm was there in his calling her [...] "Emily"? If {{he had told her}} to call him by his Christian name, she might have done it. How noble he looked, when he got up to go away; he was actually handsome! Women may say what they please and write what they please: their natural <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find their master in a man--especially when they like him. Sinking lower and lower in her own estimation, Emily tried to turn the current of her thoughts in another direction. She took up a book--opened it, looked into it, threw it across the room.|$|E
50|$|A dogs natural <b>instincts</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> {{eliminate}} {{away from}} {{the area in which}} they eat and sleep. So if a crate is small enough that they cannot possibly defecate while having enough room to sleep well away from it, a dog will 'hold it' as long as they possibly can. It's this instinct we take advantage of when using a crate as an aid for house training.|$|R
5000|$|After {{releasing}} The Standards, {{the group}} suffered a major personnel problem when their drummer, Mike Griffin, departed without warning. Singer Bryan Foster said [...] "our first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> regroup."

The changes were described as [...] "drastic" [...] by critic Enrique Lopetegui.|$|R

60|$|He had comrades {{enough and}} went with everybody, but till he formed that {{friendship}} with the queer fellow whom I have told of, he had no friend among the boys; and I very much doubt whether small boys understand friendship, or can feel it as they do afterwards, in its tenderness and unselfishness. In fact they have no conception of generosity. They are wasteful with what {{they do not want}} at the moment; but their <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get and not to give. In the Boy's Town, if a fellow appeared at his gate with a piece of bread spread with apple-butter and sugar on top, the other fellows flocked round him and tried to flatter him out of bites of it, though they might be at that moment almost bursting with surfeit. To get a bite was so much clear gain, and when they had wheedled one from the owner of the bread, they took as large a bite as their mouths could stretch to, and they had neither shame nor regret for their behavior, but mocked his just resentment.|$|E
60|$|The {{fault that}} most people will find with this story {{is that it is}} unconvincing. Its scheme is improbable, its {{atmosphere}} artificial. To confess that the thing really happened--not as I am about to set it down, for the pen of the professional writer cannot but adorn and embroider, even to the detriment of his material--is, I am well aware, only an aggravation of my offence, for the facts of life are the impossibilities of fiction. A truer artist would have left this story alone, or at most have kept it for the irritation of his private circle. My lower <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make use of it. A very old man told me the tale. He was landlord of the Cromlech Arms, the only inn of a small, rock-sheltered village on the north-east coast of Cornwall, and had been so for nine and forty years. It is called the Cromlech Hotel now, and is under new management, and during the season some four coach-loads of tourists sit down each day to table d'hote lunch in the low-ceilinged parlour. But I am speaking of years ago, when the place was a mere fishing harbour, undiscovered by the guide books.|$|E
60|$|But if {{the child}} thus seeks the mother, does it then know the mother alone? To an infant the mother is the whole universe. Yet the child needs more than the mother. It needs as well the {{presence}} of men, the vibration from the present body of the man. There may not be any actual, palpable connection. But from the great voluntary center in the man pass unknowable communications and unreliable nourishment of the stream of manly blood, rays which we cannot see, and which {{so far we have}} refused to know, but none the less essential, quickening dark rays which pass from the great dark abdominal life-center in the father to the corresponding center in the child. And these rays, these vibrations, are not like the mother-vibrations. Far, far from it. They do not need the actual contact, the handling and the caressing. On the contrary, the true male <b>instinct</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> avoid physical contact with a baby. It may not need even actual presence. But present or absent, there should be between the baby and the father that strange, intangible communication, that strange pull and circuit such as the magnetic pole exercises upon a needle, a vitalistic pull and flow which lays all the life-plasm of the baby into the line of vital quickening, strength, knowing. And any lack of this vital circuit, this vital interchange between father and child, man and child, means an inevitable impoverishment to the infant.|$|E
50|$|When {{he first}} {{received}} word of his appointment, Albuquerque's first <b>instinct</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> marshal his forces and {{march to the}} relief of occupied Bahia, but he <b>was</b> cautioned <b>to</b> bide his time. From his base at Olinda, {{at the end of}} 1624, he sent troops to reinforce the Portuguese guerillas based at Arraial do Rio Vermelho and at Recôncavo.

500|$|Horses <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> sleep both {{standing}} up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> enter light sleep by using a [...] "stay apparatus" [...] in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.
