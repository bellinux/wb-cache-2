2500|$|During the ship's 1986 to 1987 refit, {{the steam}} {{turbines}} were removed and scrapped. The engine rooms were then fitted with nine German MAN L58/64 nine-cylinder, medium-speed diesel engines, each weighing approximately 120 tons. Using a diesel-electric configuration, each engine drives a generator, each developing 10.5 MW of electrical power at 10,000 volts. This electrical plant, {{in addition to}} powering the ship's auxiliary and <b>hotel</b> <b>services</b> through transformers, drives the two main propulsion motors, one on each propeller shaft. These motors produce 44 MW each and are of synchronised salient-pole construction, nine metres in diameter and weighing more than 400 tons each. The ship's service speed of [...] can be maintained using only seven of the diesel-electric sets.

They power four propellers in four shaft configuration, producing a total thrust of [...] at the shaft, providing a top speed of over 30 knots. Six turbo alternators and six diesel alternators generate 18 MW of electricity to power various equipment. Modern oil-water separators as well as a sewage treatment plant were incorporated to meet international standards.

2500|$|Vapour-compression {{distillers}} {{were installed}} on US submarines shortly before World War 2. Early attempts {{had been made}} with evaporators running from diesel engine exhaust heat, but these could only be used when the submarine was running at speed on the surface. A further difficulty with submarines was the need to produce high-quality water for topping up their large storage batteries. Typical consumption on a war patrol was around [...] per day for <b>hotel</b> <b>services,</b> drinking, cooking, washing etc. and also for replenishing the diesel engine cooling system. A further 500gallons per week was required for the batteries. The standard Badger model X-1 for diesel submarines could produce 1,000gallons per day. Tank capacity of 5,600gallons (1,200 of which was battery water) was provided, around 10 days reserve. With the appearance of nuclear submarines and their plentiful electricity supply, even larger plant could be installed. The X-1 plant was designed {{so that it could}} be operated when snorkelling, or even when completely submerged. As the ambient pressure increased when submerged, and thus the boiling point, additional heat was required in these submarine distillers and so they were designed to run with electric heat continuously.|$|E
