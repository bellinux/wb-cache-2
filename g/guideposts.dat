25|$|Between April and May 2005, Shields {{spoke to}} {{magazines}} (such as <b>Guideposts)</b> and appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to publicize her battle with postpartum depression, {{an experience that}} included depression, thoughts of suicide, an inability to respond to her baby's needs and delayed maternal bonding. The illness may have been triggered by a traumatic childbirth, {{the death of her}} father three weeks earlier, stress from in vitro fertilization, a miscarriage and a family history of depression, as well as the hormones and life changes which were brought on by childbirth. Her book, Down Came the Rain, discusses her experience, contributing to a greater public awareness of postpartum depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guidepost</b> {{cells are}} {{specialized}} early differentiating sensory cells. These cells are essential in providing navigational information to pioneer axons. Arrays of pioneer neurons create short segments of pioneer axons extending distal to proximal within an appendage. The resulting trajectories {{are due to}} pioneer axons growing from <b>guidepost</b> to <b>guidepost</b> cells. In addition, pioneer axons can act as <b>guidepost</b> cells to more distant pioneer neurons. Studies that involved selective destruction of <b>guidepost</b> cells resulted in pioneer axons becoming unable to navigate normally to the CNS from the PNS. Instead, the pioneer axons assumed alternate configurations and followed different trajectories. In addition, without the <b>guidepost</b> cells, the pioneer axons did not find the stereotyped route that pioneer axons would normally navigate.|$|R

50|$|To {{qualify as}} a <b>guidepost</b> cell, neurons {{hypothesized}} {{to be influenced by}} a guidance cell are examined during development. To test the guidance cell in question, neural axon growth and migration is first examined {{in the presence of the}} guidance cell. Then, the guidance cell is destroyed to further examine neural axon growth and migration in the absence of the guidance cell. If the neuronal axon extends towards the path in the presence of the guidance cell and loses its path in the absence of the guidance cell, it is qualified as a <b>guidepost</b> cell. Ti1 pioneer neurons is a common example neurons that require <b>guidepost</b> cells to reach its final destination. They have to come in contact with three <b>guidepost</b> neurons to reach the CNS: Fe1, Tr1, and Cx1. When Cx1 is destroyed, the Ti1 pioneer is unable to reach the CNS.|$|R
25|$|Any {{suggestion}} of further reading on Kant {{has to take}} cognizance {{of the fact that}} his work has dominated philosophy like no other figure after him. Nevertheless, several <b>guideposts</b> can be made out. In Germany, one important contemporary interpreter of Kant and the movement of German Idealism he began is Dieter Henrich, who has some work available in English. P. F. Strawson's The Bounds of Sense (1966) {{played a significant role in}} determining the contemporary reception of Kant in England and America. More recent interpreters of note in the English-speaking world include Lewis White Beck, Jonathan Bennett, Henry Allison, Paul Guyer, Christine Korsgaard, Stephen Palmquist, Robert B. Pippin, Roger Scruton, Rudolf Makkreel, and Béatrice Longuenesse.|$|E

The name is believed to be taken from the <b>guideposts</b> originally used to mark the route. The becks flowing from either side of the pass summit are both officially named Sticks Gill, the '(East)' and '(West)' having been added by Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells and utilised by later guidebook writers.

As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of <b>Guideposts</b> magazine and in his book Return to Earth.

6000|$|At noon {{the next}} day they left the stage at a wayside road station, and Flynn briefly {{informed}} Clarence that they must again take horses. This at first seemed difficult in that out-of-the-way settlement, where they alone had stopped, but a whisper from the driver in the ear of the station-master produced a couple of fiery mustangs, with the same accompaniment of cautious awe and mystery. For the next two days they traveled on horseback, resting by night at the lodgings of one or other of Flynn's friends in the outskirts of a large town, where they arrived in the darkness, and left before day. To any one more experienced than the simple-minded boy it would have been evident that Flynn was purposely avoiding the more traveled roads and conveyances; and when they changed horses again {{the next day}}'s ride was through an apparently unbroken wilderness of scattered wood and rolling plain. Yet to Clarence, with his pantheistic reliance and joyous sympathy with nature, the change was filled with exhilarating pleasure. The vast seas of tossing wild oats, the hillside still variegated with strange flowers, the virgin freshness of untrodden woods and leafy aisles, whose floors of moss or bark were undisturbed by human footprint, were a keen delight and novelty. More than this, his quick eye, trained perceptions, and frontier knowledge now stood him in good stead. His intuitive sense of distance, instincts of woodcraft, and his unerring detection of those signs, landmarks, and <b>guideposts</b> of nature, undistinguishable to aught but birds and beasts and some children, were now of the greatest service to his less favored companion. In this part of their strange pilgrimage it was the boy who took the lead. Flynn, who during the past two days seemed to have fallen into a mood of watchful reserve, nodded his approbation. [...] "This sort of thing's yer best holt, boy," [...] he said. [...] "Men and cities ain't your little game." ...|$|E

60|$|I beg pardon, Sir, if, when I {{speak of}} this and of other great men, I appear to digress in saying {{something}} of their characters. In this eventful history of the revolutions of America, the characters of such men are of much importance. Great men are the <b>guideposts</b> and landmarks in the state. The credit of such men at court or in the nation is the sole cause of all the public measures. It would be an invidious thing (most foreign, I trust, to what you think my disposition) to remark the errors into which the authority of great names has brought the nation, without doing justice {{at the same time}} to the great qualities whence that authority arose. The subject is instructive to those who wish to form themselves on whatever of excellence has gone before them. There are many young members in the House (such of late has been the rapid succession of public men) who never saw that prodigy, Charles Townshend, nor of course know what a ferment he was able to excite in everything by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings. For failings he had undoubtedly,--many of us remember them; we are this day considering the effect of them. But he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cause,--to an ardent, generous, perhaps an immoderate passion for fame: a passion which is the instinct of all great souls. He worshipped that goddess, wheresoever she appeared; but he paid his particular devotions to her in her favorite habitation, in her chosen temple, the House of Commons. Besides the characters of the individuals that compose our body, it is impossible, Mr. Speaker, not to observe that this House has a collective character of its own. That character, too, however imperfect, is not unamiable. Like all great public collections of men, you possess a marked love of virtue and an abhorrence of vice. But among vices there is none which the House abhors in the same degree with obstinacy. Obstinacy, Sir, is certainly a great vice; and in the changeful state of political affairs it is frequently the cause of great mischief. It happens, however, very unfortunately, that almost the whole line of the great and masculine virtues, constancy, gravity, magnanimity, fortitude, fidelity, and firmness, are closely allied to this disagreeable quality, of which you have so just an abhorrence; and, in their excess, all these virtues very easily fall into it. He who paid such a punctilious attention to all your feelings certainly took care not to shock them by that vice which is the most disgustful to you.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{corpus callosum}} (CC) {{is the major}} {{commissure}} that bridges the cerebral hemispheres. Agenesis of the CC is associated with human ciliopathies, but {{the origin of this}} default is unclear. Regulatory Factor X 3 (RFX 3) is a transcription factor involved in the control of ciliogenesis, and Rfx 3 -deficient mice show several hallmarks of ciliopathies including left-right asymmetry defects and hydrocephalus. Here we show that Rfx 3 -deficient mice suffer from CC agenesis associated with a marked disorganisation of <b>guidepost</b> neurons required for axon pathfinding across the midline. Using transplantation assays, we demonstrate that abnormalities of the mutant midline region are primarily responsible for the CC malformation. Conditional genetic inactivation shows that RFX 3 is not required in <b>guidepost</b> cells for proper CC formation, but is required before E 12. 5 for proper patterning of the cortical septal boundary and hence accurate distribution of <b>guidepost</b> neurons at later stages. We observe focused but consistent ectopic expression of Fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf 8) at the rostro commissural plate associated with a reduced ratio of GLIoma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 3 (GLI 3) repressor to activator forms. We demonstrate on brain explant cultures that ectopic FGF 8 reproduces the <b>guidepost</b> neuronal defects observed in Rfx 3 mutants. This study unravels a crucial role of RFX 3 during early brain development by indirectly regulating GLI 3 activity, which leads to FGF 8 upregulation and ultimately to disturbed distribution of <b>guidepost</b> neurons required for CC morphogenesis. Hence, the RFX 3 mutant mouse model brings novel understandings of the mechanisms that underlie CC agenesis in ciliopathies...|$|R
