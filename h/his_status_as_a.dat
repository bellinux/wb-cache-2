5|$|Although McCain {{was seriously}} wounded and injured, his captors refused to treat him. They beat and interrogated {{him to get}} information, and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese {{discovered}} {{that his father was}} a high-ranking admiral. <b>His</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of major newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo {{recognised}} Philip, duc d'Anjou, as Carlos's successor, whose administration {{refused to}} sanction the Trattamento Reale {{reserved for the}} royal family. The Grand Duke, soon after the royal altercation, accepted the investure of the nominal Spanish fief of Siena from Philip, thereby confirming <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Spanish vassal.|$|E
5|$|Gambira was {{released}} during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 {{as part of}} the 2011–2012 Burmese political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{his role}} in the series, Kain has also {{featured}} in tie-in comics, and in Crystal Dynamics' Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. In all of his voiced appearances, he has been played by actor Simon Templeman. He has been favorably received by video game critics and enthusiasts, with praise attributed to his antagonistic role in , and <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong example of a memorable, nuanced antihero in the medium.|$|E
5|$|Living in the Material World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> superstar, {{as well as}} for what many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using a core group of musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E
5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and {{an eye for an eye}} were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home, Hinton {{initially was}} indecisive {{about what to}} do with his life. Like many of his fellow soldiers who had returned home, he struggled to adapt to civilian life. He was also extremely uncomfortable with the public attention he received because of <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> VC recipient. He eventually found work managing hotels on behalf of Dominion Breweries. He was initially based at the Thistle Hotel, a notorious drinking establishment in Auckland, for three years, during which he received a belated mention in despatches for his escape attempts while a POW. In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up and down the country to manage hotels.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the World War I, he became the subject of anti-German attacks in the Press. In 1915, Speyer offered to resign from the Privy Council and to {{relinquish}} his baronetcy, but the Prime Minister turned down the offer. He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy during the war, and had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> British subject. Speyer denied the charges, but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the Privy Council.|$|E
50|$|Originally a {{competitor}} for Great Britain, Charles changed nationalities to Irish in 1992. In 2007, he relinquished <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Irish rider {{and once again}} began representing Great Britain.|$|R

5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E
5|$|His 1555 {{election}} for Marlborough was similar, but {{more dependent on}} influential connections. Pleydell's father had once leased the lands of Thomas Seymour in the nearby parish of Eastrop (and possibly Preshute), establishing a relationship of trust between the families. After Seymour's brother Edward was executed in 1552, his widow Anne inherited the responsibility of maintaining the vast estates. The Duchess appointed Pleydell as chief ranger of Savernake Forest (then under her ownership) before 1554 and as her receiver general that year. His position as ranger probably led to the acquisition of property in Chippenham and Preshute, and <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Preshute landholder assisted him in becoming Member for Marlborough. Pleydell, serving with Sir Andrew Baynton, replaced Peter Taylor alias Perce and John Broke of the 1554 session; they were succeeded by William Daniell and William Fleetwood in 1558 after a parliamentary hiatus {{following the death of}} Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|In April 1964, with {{financial}} {{help from his}} half-sister Ella Little-Collins, MalcolmX flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as {{the start of his}} Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so. He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Muslim to be questioned. He had received Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam's book The Eternal Message of Muhammad with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning MalcolmX learned that Prince Faisal had designated him as a state guest. Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, MalcolmX had an audience with the prince.|$|E
5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extravagant {{artist was}} put to use in several {{publicity}} campaigns for Lanvin chocolates, [...] "If you got it, flaunt it!" [...] for Braniff International Airlines (1968), and Iberia Airlines.|$|R
50|$|His overall work in {{both the}} symphonic and the choral genres contributed to some {{neglected}} stages {{in the development of}} Bulgarian music and thus further established <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> outstanding figure in Bulgarian musical culture.|$|R
50|$|Following seminary, Bixler became {{pastor of}} the Pittsburgh Church of the Brethren and {{completed}} thirteen years there as pastor before resigning in 1972. He continued <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ordained minister in the Church of the Brethren.|$|R
5|$|In {{his inaugural}} season of {{competitive}} football, Liddell confirmed <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> regular {{and contributed to}} Liverpool's first championship since 1923. Positioned on the left wing, he appeared in 34 matches, scored seven goals, and supplied strikers Albert Stubbins and Jack Balmer with numerous assists. Severe conditions in the winter disrupted the league's schedule and Liverpool did not secure the title until 14 June 1947. The club won its final game away against Wolves 2-1, with Liddell setting {{up one of the}} goals, but the championship was decided by Sheffield United defeating contenders Stoke in the season's last fixture. The game coincided with the Senior Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton at Anfield, where tannoys announced the result during the match. As a strict teetotaler, Liddell refrained from accepting glasses of champagne to celebrate the success.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{retired from}} his {{surveying}} work in 1800, for reasons unknown. Various reasons have been suggested; Jones {{was known as}} an extremely hard worker, and may have wanted less strenuous work as a farmer, his ties to Joseph Brant may have been politically problematic as Brant was frequently in conflict with Upper Canada authorities, and <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> loyalist to the British Empire may have come into question as it became known his brother in law, James Gage, had fought with the Americans during the revolution, and his brother Ebenezer may have as well. Whatever {{the cause of his}} retirement, Jones returned to his farm in Saltfleet Township and began life as a farmer.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette, when captured, {{had tried}} to use the American {{citizenship}} he had been granted to secure his release, and contacted William Short, United States minister in The Hague. Although Short and other U.S. envoys very much wanted to succor Lafayette for his services to their country, they knew that <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> French officer took precedence over any claim to American citizenship. Washington, who was by then president, had instructed the envoys to avoid actions that entangled the country in European affairs, and the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with either Prussia or Austria. They did send money {{for the use of}} Lafayette, and for his wife, whom the French had imprisoned. Secretary of State Jefferson found a loophole allowing Lafayette to be paid, with interest, for his services as a major general from 1777 to 1783. An act was rushed through Congress and signed by President Washington. These funds allowed both Lafayettes privileges in their captivity.|$|E
50|$|His {{career at}} County was {{interrupted}} by a broken leg sustained at Birmingham in January 1998. This injury ended <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> automatic choice and he made just 17 further appearances for the club over the following two seasons.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1950s, in {{part because}} of <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> expert on China, he was branded a {{communist}} sympathizer by Senator Joseph McCarthy, an accusation which took years to fight off - a feat at which he was ultimately successful.|$|R
50|$|Smith's {{appearance}} changes slightly once {{he loses}} <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Agent. <b>His</b> sunglasses {{take on an}} angular shape that is an approximation of the rounded lenses Neo uses. In addition, he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo <b>as</b> <b>a</b> warning.|$|R
5|$|Pleydell's initial {{entrance}} to the Parliament of England in March 1553 as a member for the market town of Wootton Bassett was, at least in part, made possible by <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wealthy landholder. Although {{he had not yet}} inherited the lease on the family estate of Midgehall, his purchases of land and property surrounding the manor (one mile from the constituency) in 1561 and 1562 suggest that his assets facilitated a seat in the House of Commons. The constituency was eventually abolished by the Reform Act 1832. Surviving records note Pleydell's returning to Parliament solely by his Christian name, deemed sufficiently unusual to identify him outright. Succeeding members John Seymour and Robert Huick from the 1547–52 session, Pleydell served with William Garrard for just 30 days in March until a dissolution of Parliament. They were replaced in October by Henry Poole and John Throckmorton.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was briefly}} {{stationed}} in Britain {{before he was}} posted to No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron in western Germany in April 1945. He flew combat missions there until Germany surrendered in May. He remained with No. 130 Squadron {{for the rest of}} his service, and returned home at the end of 1945. After completing his studies at Rhodes, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for his birthplace, Selukwe, in 1948. He became Prime Minister in 1964, during his country's dispute with Britain regarding the terms for independence; Smith was influenced as a politician by his wartime experiences, and Rhodesia's military record on behalf of Britain became central to his sense of betrayal by post-war British governments. This partly motivated his administration's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. <b>His</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Second World War RAF veteran helped him win support, both domestically and internationally.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the Organization of American States hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized {{by the number of}} days {{that he was in the}} country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E
50|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> up-and-coming UFC fighter {{he was not}} {{included}} in the UFC 2009 Undisputed video game due to technical issues caused by his long hair. He was even offered $10,000 by Dana White to cut it, but he refused.|$|R
5000|$|As Bonser {{continued}} {{to pitch in}} the minors without any further breakout seasons, <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> elite prospect faded, but after a fast start at Rochester in [...] in which he posted an ERA of 2.01, Bonser was promoted to the majors.|$|R
50|$|Teamwork {{and group}} effort is the Loach modus operandi. Loach has denied <b>his</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> auteur director.
