5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E
5|$|After he {{was married}} in December 1933, Cooper {{remained}} faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during the production of For Whom the Bell Tolls. Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming Saratoga Trunk in June 1943. In 1948, after finishing work on The Fountainhead, Cooper began an affair with actress Patricia Neal, his co-star. At first they kept their affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, and Cooper's wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were true. He also confessed {{that he was in}} love with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with Kirk Douglas, and that he arranged <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper's child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper was rumored to have had affairs with Grace Kelly, Lorraine Chanel, and Gisèle Pascal.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{argument}} against Meritaten either as Krauss's pro tempore Ankh-et-kheprure before marriage to Smenkhkare or as Akhenaten's coregent King Neferneferuaten {{is that she}} is well attested as wife and queen to Smenkhkare. <b>For</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> later ruled as king means necessarily, and perhaps incredibly for her subjects, that she stepped down from King to the role of King's Wife. This view places Smenkhkare after Neferneferuaten which requires the Meryre depiction to be drawn 5–6 years after the 'Durbar' depiction it is alongside and several years after work on tombs had stopped.|$|E

25|$|Kahlo {{spent the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{traveling}} in Mexico and the United States with Rivera {{who was working}} on commissions. During this time, she developed her own style as an artist, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture and painting mostly small self-portraits, which mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic mythology. Although always overshadowed by Rivera, her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist André Breton, who arranged <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938. The exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939. While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.|$|E

Ngata became very close to Te Puea, the Waikato kingite leader, who {{was supported by the}} government in her attempt to improve living conditions for Waikato. Ngata transferred four blocks of land to Te Puea and her husband and arranged extensive government grants and loans. Ngata sacked the pakeha farm development officer and replaced him with Te Puea. He arranged <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a car to travel around the various farms. Te Puea's husband was also given a large farm at Tikitere near Rotorua. The public, media and parliament became alarmed at the flow of funds from government to Te Puea during the recession. A Royal Commission was held in 1934 that found Ngata guilty of maladministration and misappropriation of funds to the value of 500,000 pounds. Ngata was forced to resign.|$|E

25|$|Fox Film {{songwriter}} Jay Gorney {{was walking}} out of the viewing of Temple's last Frolics of Youth picture when he saw her dancing in the movie theater lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, he arranged <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a screen test for the movie Stand Up and Cheer! Temple arrived for the audition on December 7, 1933; she won the part and was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox Film Corporation. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was ushered into corporate offices almost immediately after finishing Baby Take a Bow, a song and dance number she did with James Dunn. On December 21, 1933, her contract was extended to a year at the same $150/week with a seven-year option and her mother Gertrude was hired on at $25/week as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, Stand Up and Cheer! became Shirley's breakthrough film. Within months, she became the symbol of wholesome family entertainment. In June, her success continued when she was loaned out to Paramount for Little Miss Marker.|$|E

It was written by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and produced by Josh Abrahams, Ammo and Oligee. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles and is a power ballad, incorporating a piano and synth-driven melody. The lyrics consist of Lewis informing her past lover that enough time has passed since their relationship <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> moved on and to have developed as a person. Critics praised Lewis' vocal performance, likening her technical abilities to those of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.

However, Jonah starts screaming horribly, necessitating that everyone leave his company. In a voiceover, Gwen reveals that the scream lasts for 20 hours every day because Jonah looked into the heart of a dark star, which had the effect of driving him insane. Gwen visits Nikki a week later, who implores her not to show the island to anyone else. Nikki states {{that it would have been}} better <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> remembered her son as he was, rather than to know of his true fate.

500|$|McCartney's {{first serious}} girlfriend in Liverpool was {{seventeen}} year old Dorothy [...] "Dot" [...] Rhone (a bank clerk or a cashier at a chemist's, according to varying accounts), {{whom he had}} met at The Casbah Club in 1959. McCartney picked out the clothes he liked Rhone to wear and told her which make up to use, also paying <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her blonde hair done {{in the style of}} Brigitte Bardot, whom both he and John Lennon idolised. He disliked Rhone seeing her friends, and stopped her from smoking, even though he did so himself. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with The Beatles he wrote regular letters to Rhone, and she accompanied Lennon's girlfriend, Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when the group played there again in 1962. According to Rhone, McCartney bought her a gold ring in Hamburg, a leather skirt, took her sightseeing, and was very attentive and caring. For the time Rhone was there, the couple lived in a bungalow by the Hamburg docks that belonged to Rosa, a former cleaner at the Indra club. McCartney admitted that he had other girlfriends in Hamburg when Rhone was in Liverpool, admitting that they were usually strippers, who knew a lot more about sex than Liverpool girls.|$|E

500|$|... "Lovebird" [...] {{was written}} by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and {{produced}} by Josh Abrahams, Oligee, and Coleman (under his production name, Ammo). The song was engineered by Ryan Williams, assisted by Daniela Rivera. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta, Georgia and mastered by Colin Leonard at SING Mastering using SING Technology, both located in Atlanta. The song was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles. [...] "Lovebird" [...] is a power ballad of three minutes and thirty seconds. The song's musical structure bears strong resemblances to one of Lewis' previous singles, [...] "Bleeding Love", from her début studio album Spirit (2007). The track opens with a piano introduction similar to that on [...] "Bleeding Love", and features an [...] "instantly hummable chorus". Lewis informs her lover in the lyrics – with the lines [...] "But the time went on, the wind has blown, and I have grown" [...] – that enough time has passed since their relationship started <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> developed as a person.

500|$|Angelou {{comes into}} {{intimate}} contact with whites {{for the first}} time—whites {{very different from the}} racist people she encountered in her childhood. She discovers, as Cudjoe puts it, that her stereotypes of Whites were developed to protect herself from their cruelty and indifference. As McPherson states, [...] "Conditioned by earlier experiences, Angelou distrusts everyone, especially whites. Nevertheless, she is repeatedly surprised by the kindness and goodwill of many whites she meets, and, thus, her suspicions begin to soften into understanding". Cudjoe states that in Singin' and Swingin' , Angelou effectively demonstrates [...] "the inviolability of the African American personhood", as well as her own closely guarded defense of it. In order <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any positive relationships with whites and people of other races, however, McPherson insists that Angelou [...] "must examine and discard her stereotypical views about Whites". Lyman agrees and points out that Angelou must re-examine her lingering prejudices when faced with the broader world full of whites. As Hagen also states, however, this is a complex process, since most of Angelou's experiences with whites are positive during this time. Cudjoe states that as the book's main protagonist, Angelou moves between the white and Black worlds, both defining herself as a member of her community and encountering whites in [...] "a much fuller, more sensuous manner".|$|E
