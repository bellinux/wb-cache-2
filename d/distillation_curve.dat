40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: We have {{recently}} introduced several important {{improvements in the}} measurement of distillation curves for complex fluids. The modifications include a composition-explicit data channel for each distillate fraction and temperature measurements that are true thermodynamic state points that can be modeled with an equation of state. The composition-explicit information is achieved with a sampling approach that allows precise qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of each fraction, on the fly. We have applied the method (called the advanced <b>distillation</b> <b>curve</b> technique) {{to a variety of}} fluids, including simple n - alkanes, rocket propellants, gasoline, jet fuels, diesel and biodiesel fuels and crude oils (both petroleum-and bio-derived crude oils). Approach: In this study, we present the application of the method to new, recycled and resourced heavy oils. The ultimate purpose of this work is waste reduction and energy utilization, by placing the reprocessing steps on a more fundamental footing. First, we present measurements on four unused automotive crankcase oils and then four samples of used oils: automotive oil, cutting oil, transformer oil and a commingled lubricant waste stream. Using the advanced <b>distillation</b> <b>curve</b> metrology, we can distinguish between the different weights (viscosity ranges) of crankcase oils and compare them to the sample of used crankcase oil. The distillation curves also provide valuable information regarding {{the presence or absence of}} low-boiling contaminants in the recycled automotive oil, such as water and gasoline. Results: Additionally, we demonstrate the evaluation of all four used lubricant oils. Then, we apply the advanced <b>distillation</b> <b>curve</b> method to a sample of crude oil prepared using a plastic waste stream from an automotive plant. Conclusion: Overall, we conclude that the composition-explicit advanced <b>distillation</b> <b>curve</b> metrology is important for understanding the boiling behavior of the various oils streams and is a valuable diagnostic for future re-refining of the used lubricant oils. This information will be essential in the development of models for the thermophysical properties of such fluids. </FONT...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} combustion characteristics of higher alcohols/gasoline (UTG 96) blends is presented. Lower alcohols (methanol and ethanol) {{have been used}} in the past as fuel extenders by mixing them with gasoline, but relatively little work has been reported on higher alcohols (propanol, butanol, and pentanol). All of these alcohols can be produced from coal derived syngas. Given the abundant coal reserves in the United States, use of such higher alcohols offers an attractive alternative to alleviate the country's growing needs for transportation fuels. Comparisons of knock limits, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), emissions, and fuel characteristics between higher alcohol/gasoline blends and neat gasoline were made to determine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} blending alcohol with gasoline. All tests were conducted on a single-cylinder Waukesha Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine operating at steady state conditions and stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio. The data show that higher alcohol/gasoline blends have a greater resistance to knock than neat gasoline, as indicated by the knock resistance indicator (KRI) and the (RON+MON) / 2 antiknock index. Ignition delay and combustion interval data show that higher alcohol/gasoline blends tend to have faster flame speeds.

Three pure hydrocarbons (n-hexane, n-heptane, and isooctane), three gasolines of known <b>distillation</b> <b>curve</b> and a commercial 95 RON gasoline from a gas station were utilized. The tests were performed at four chamber pressures (atmospheric, 80 kPa, 60 kPa and 40 kPa) and the fuel temperature was varied from 30 °C to 110 °C. The results for n-hexane and gasolines were very similar, while n-heptane and isooctane showed a different behavior. The ratio between the fuel saturation pressure at the operating temperature and the air pressure (ps/pa) is confirmed as a fundamental parameter for spray angle data reduction.

An approximated method to deduce the gasoline saturation pressure curves starting from the <b>distillation</b> <b>curve</b> is presented. Using the calculated saturation pressures for the reduction of near field spray angle data for the gasolines, a unique curve is obtained, coincident with that of the tested pure hydrocarbons.

40|$|Achieving robust {{combustion}} {{while also}} yielding low hydrocarbon (HC) emissions {{is difficult for}} the first cycle of cranking during the cold start of a Port Fuel Injected (PFI) Spark Ignition (SI) engine. Cold intake port wall and valve temperatures, near-atmospheric manifold pressure, and low port air velocity combine to create an adverse environment for fuel delivery - the process of injecting and vaporizing liquid fuel to create a combustible air-fuel mixture. As a result, {{only a small fraction}} of the injected fuel mass contributes to the combustible mixture; the fraction is less than 10 % at cold ambient temperatures. With fast light off catalysts, the first cycle produces a significant portion of the total trip emissions. The low fuel delivery fraction results in high residual liquid fuel in both the port and cylinder; this fuel contributes significantly to the exhaust HC emissions. Since the first cycle engine control is open-loop, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) must determine how much fuel to inject under given conditions - temperature, pressure, and for a given fuel. Fuel properties play a significant role in first cycle fuel delivery, since the energy available for vaporization is a limiting factor in fuel delivery. The effect of fuel properties on fuel delivery for the first cycle was quantified at a wide range of cold start temperatures by using a skip-firing strategy to simulate the first cycle of cranking on a production PFI engine. Four fuels between 1083 and 1257 Driveability Index (DI) were tested, and the fuel delivery results have been correlated to properties of the ASTM <b>distillation</b> <b>curve.</b> The fractional distillation point that correlates to fuel delivery is a function of temperature - at colder temperatures, the results(cont.) correlate with the more volatile end of the <b>distillation</b> <b>curve.</b> Fuel delivery results for the fuels were also simulated with a thermodynamics-based fuel delivery model based on partial equilibrium with the charge air. by Kevin R.

40|$|High-pressure {{multi-hole}} injectors for direct-injection spark-ignition engines {{offer some}} great benefits {{in terms of}} fuel atomisation, as well as flexibility in fuel targeting by selection of the number and angle of the nozzle’s holes. However, very few data exist for injector-body temperatures representative of engine operation with various fuels, especially at low-load conditions with early injection strategies that {{can also lead to}} phase change due to fuel flash boiling upon injection. The challenge is further complicated by the predicted fuel stocks which will include a significant bio-derived component presenting the requirement to manage fuel flexibility. The physical/chemical properties of bio-components, like various types of alcohols, can differ markedly from gasoline and it is important to study their effects in direct comparison to liquid hydrocarbons. This work outlines results from an optical investigation (high-speed imaging and droplet sizing) into the effects of fuel properties, temperature and pressure conditions on the extent of spray formation. Specifically, gasoline, iso-octane, n-pentane, ethanol and n-butanol were tested at 20, 50, 90 and 120 °C injector body temperatures for ambient pressures of 0. 5 bar and 1. 0 bar in order to simulate early homogeneous injection strategies for part-load and wide open throttle engine operation; some test were also carried out at 180 °C, 0. 3 bar. Droplet sizing was also performed for gasoline, iso-octane and n-pentane using Phase Doppler and Laser Diffraction techniques {{in order to understand the}} effects of low- and high-volatility components on the atomisation of the multi-component gasoline. The boiling points and <b>distillation</b> <b>curves</b> of all fuels, their vapour pressures and bubble points, as well as density, viscosity and surface tension were obtained and the Reynolds, Weber and Ohnesorge numbers were considered in the analysis...|$|R
