5|$|A {{snowflake}} {{consists of}} roughly 1019 water molecules, which {{are added to}} its core at different rates and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through {{on its way to}} the <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> a result, snowflakes vary among themselves, while following similar patterns.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a spring.|$|E

5|$|In the 2009–10 season, West Ham started {{strongly}} with a 2–0 win over newly promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers with goals from Mark Noble and newly appointed captain Matthew Upson.

5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, {{often at}} the side of a river or in flat <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and Gothenburg {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home <b>ground,</b> <b>as</b> IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing a wartime blackout exercise.|$|E
5|$|Built in the {{vicinity}} of an older church, the Church of St Demetrius is a crossed-dome stone building. According to several legends, the church was dug into the <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria, so that it may be protected from desecration. It was only unearthed {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when it was dedicated to Saint Demetrius. It was proclaimed a monument of culture of national importance in 1956.|$|E
5|$|By 1 December the {{fighting}} for Jerusalem was almost over. The Ottoman Army {{had failed to}} win any <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of their}} counterattacks, and the advancing British troops were successfully replacing their tired comrades who were well entrenched close to Jerusalem. On 2 December the relief of the XXI Corps by the XX Corps was completed when the 10th (Irish) Division relieved the 52nd (Lowland) Division. And each side began to adjust and improve their lines, leaving insecure or hard to defend places. The British increased the number of soldiers in their line to create a powerful concentration. Over four days the 10th (Irish) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions extended their positions, while the extended position held by the 60th (2/2nd London) Division was shortened.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, the Cardiff Football <b>Ground,</b> <b>as</b> it {{was then}} known, had a new south stand and {{temporary}} stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground. The south stand was covered, while the north terrace was initially without a roof. The improvements were partly funded by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The opening ceremony took place on 5 October 1912, with a match between Newport RFC and Cardiff RFC. The new ground was opened by Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart. This new development increased the ground capacity to 43,000 and much improved the facilities at the ground compared to the earlier stands.|$|E
5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider rail gauge than {{most of the rest of}} Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E

Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to {{the order in which}} the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings. Many of the buildings are connected above <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.|$|E

5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|In 335 BC, Alexander {{fought against}} the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons and along the Danube, forcing their {{surrender}} on Peuce Island. Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian king Cleitus of the Dardani threatened to attack Macedonia, but Alexander took the initiative and besieged the Dardani at Pelion (in modern Albania). When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he placed under siege. After breaching the walls, Alexander's forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as prisoners of war, and burned {{the city to the}} <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, cubeb {{was one of}} the {{valuable}} spices during the Middle Ages. It was <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a seasoning for meat or used in sauces. A medieval recipe includes cubeb in making sauce sarcenes, which consists of almond milk and several spices. As an aromatic confectionery, cubeb was often candied and eaten whole. Ocet Kubebowy, a vinegar infused with cubeb, cumin and garlic, was used for meat marinades in Poland during the 14th century. Cubeb can still be used to enhance the flavor of savory soups.|$|E
