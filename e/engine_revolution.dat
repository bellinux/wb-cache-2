50|$|A {{particularly}} large speedometer (a quick-reading five inch dial), matching <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> counter, and ten inch headlights were supplied {{as part of}} {{the complete}} kit for the coachbuilder. The large headlights were supported by braced mountings included in the kit.|$|E
50|$|The {{chartroom}} {{was located}} on the main deck. It contained the chart table, a casual berth and a second steering position. On the forward bulkhead a navigational switchboard was fitted, which included a duplicate set of <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> indicators, switches for the navigation lights, clear view screens and the “action-stations” alarm.|$|E

50|$|The Wind 125 feature front {{disk brake}} and the {{conventional}} transmission (one down and four {{up with a}} clutch) {{as compared to the}} rotary transmissions found on most underbone and tricycle model motorcycles. The front head cowl conceals a set of functional clocks that provide motorcycle speed, <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> counter, odometer and fuel gauge. The Wind 125 retails for P54,000.|$|E
5000|$|From the 4B1 {{engine family}} onward, MIVEC {{has evolved into}} a {{continuous}} variable valve timing (CVVT) system (dual VVT on intake and exhaust valves). Many older implementations only vary the valve timing (the amount of time per <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> that the intake port is open) and not the lift. Timing is continuously independently controlled to provide four optimized engine-operating modes: ...|$|E
50|$|Under M mode, {{sequential}} gear shifts {{can be made}} {{by changing}} the gear to M+ and M-. Under M mode, the gear selected will be displayed as one of M1/M2/M3/M4/M5/M6 on the dashboard. Under M mode, the gear will not change even if the <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> reaches the red-zone, which will lead to engine damage. However, the user is prevented from excessively downshifting to a gear that exceeds the maximum revolution possible for the engine, or excessively up-shifting to a gear that may lead the engine to stall. When the car is braked to a complete stop, the M1 gear is automatically selected.|$|E
50|$|They {{are also}} {{commonly}} used in snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) continuously variable transmissions (CVT), both to engage/disengage vehicle motion and to vary the transmission's pulley diameter ratio {{in relation to the}} <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> per minute.|$|R
5000|$|... "Gears" [...] - {{refers to}} the final drive ratio, which is {{typically}} around 3.0 for production automobiles, and up to 7.0 for high-performance cars (the number {{refers to the}} number of <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> for each rotation of the driven axle).|$|R
50|$|Porsche has {{introduced}} magnetorheological engine mounts in the 2010 Porsche GT3 and GT2. At high <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions,</b> the magnetorheological <b>engine</b> mounts get stiffer {{to provide a}} more precise gearbox shifter feel by reducing the relative motion between the power train and chassis/body.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as being}} a {{considerable}} part of the weight savings, the manufacturing facility for this transaxle contributed to the below mentioned financial crisis. But when John Cooper looked for a light transaxle case for Formula One rear <b>engine</b> <b>revolution,</b> Traction Avant unit was about the only candidate, as Volkswagen magnesium alloy transaxle was much smaller and lacking the space needed to house heftier gears needed for Formula One. The Traction Avant transaxle was used on Cooper T43 which won a F1 championship race as the first mid-mounted engine car {{to do so in}} 1958, and on its successors Cooper T45, T51 and T53. Cooper T51 won the GP World Championship in 1959.|$|E
5000|$|The Motronic {{units have}} 2 {{injection}} outputs, and the injectors {{are arranged in}} 2 [...] "banks" [...] which fire once every two engine revolutions. In an example 4-cylinder engine, one output controls the injectors for cylinders 1 and 3, and the other controls 2 and 4. The system uses a [...] "cylinder ID" [...] sensor mounted to the cam-shaft to detect which cylinders are approaching {{the top of their}} stroke, therefore which injector bank should be fired. During start-up (below 600 RPM), or if there is no signal from the cylinder ID sensor, all injectors are fired simultaneously once per <b>engine</b> <b>revolution.</b> In BMW vehicles, this Motronic version did not have a cylinder ID and as a result, both banks of injectors fired at once.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) allows vacuum into the {{actuator}} by powering a solenoid valve when the engine rotation speed is low. At higher engine speeds (e.g. 4,200 rpm), vacuum is cut off and a spring inside the actuator causes the butterfly valve to fully open. The idea behind the system {{is that in the}} lower engine speed band, the speed of the intake air will be increased because the intake runner cross section per cylinder is smaller. However, when engine speed increases, the second runner is opened, decreasing airflow speed, but increasing the airflow volume, better matching the engine's airflow needs at higher revolutions. With modified engines it may be desirable to have the T-VIS open earlier than stock, because modifications that improve an engine's power output may do so by increasing airflow per <b>engine</b> <b>revolution,</b> resulting in a high airflow at a lower rpm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed of}} the propeller, and thus the {{distance}} that it travelled between the firing of the gun {{and the arrival of}} the bullet at the propeller disc, varied, of course, with <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions.</b> Where muzzle velocity was very high, and the guns were situated well forward, so that the bullets had a very short distance to reach the disc of the propeller, this difference could be largely ignored, {{but in the case of}} relatively low muzzle velocity weapons, or any gun situated well back from the propeller, the question could become critical, and in some cases the pilot had to consult his tachometer, taking care that his <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> were within a [...] "safe" [...] range before firing, otherwise risking speedy destruction of his propeller.|$|R
50|$|The marine {{distributor}} {{does not}} have a vacuum advance. Vacuum advance is normally actuated at high <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> per minute (rpm) in low load situations - and this situation generally does not occur in the marine environment. Under normal operation, high rpm generally means high engine load.|$|R
5000|$|Overdrive is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the operation of an automobile [...] at sustained speed with reduced <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> per minute (RPM), leading to better fuel consumption, lower noise, and lower wear. Use of the term is confused, as it is applied to several different, but related, meanings.|$|R
50|$|Two {{of these}} engines, the {{enlarged}} single-row Hornet B described {{here and the}} R-1830 Twin Wasp, were of near-identical displacement (1860 vs. 1830), although the fourteen-cylinder Twin Wasp was more complex and costly than the nine-cylinder, single-row Hornet B. The Twin Wasp {{was by far the}} more powerful engine though, even in its early versions it produced 800 bhp to the Hornet B's 575 bhp. Having more cylinders per the same displacement also creates a smoother engine, since the individual pistons are smaller and lighter, and the stroke is shorter, which reduces the vibration of reciprocation, and therefore crew and mechanical fatigue. The reduced stroke also allows for a higher maximum RPM limit, since the mean piston speed is reduced, the distance the piston has to cover per each <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> being shorter. Having a shorter stroke but a higher rpm limit for the same displacement reduces the peak torque levels, but allows for a higher maximum horsepower rating. A further advantage was the reduced diameter of the Wasp: 48 inches compared to 57. This reduced drag, and the relatively large diameter of the Hornet would also have been a serious drawback for visibility if used in a small single-engined aircraft.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the resistance against the machine and the cutters when operated at different drive forward and <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speeds during planing, combinations of three different <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speeds and three different drive forward speeds were tested on five specimens from each of the six different types of wood-based panels, for a total of 270 samples. The resulting data were statistically analyzed.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study the strains that particleboard, medium density fiberboard (MDF), blockboard, okoume (Aucoumea klaineana) plywood, poplar (Populus × euramericana) plywood, and oriented strand board (OSB) show against the machinery and the cutters during a process where three different <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speeds and three different drive forward speeds {{were used in the}} milling machine. The strain values were determined by the power the engine used according to <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed and drive forward speed. Using the experimental data obtained and the data derived from wood-based panels, <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed, and drive forward speed, several regression analysis equations were developed in order to anticipate probable strains for each of the wood-based panels and a multi-linear regression analysis was made.|$|E
50|$|The engine, {{although}} well developed, {{suffered from}} secondary vibration. This was minimal in the three-cylinder K100 derived K75, and minimised in the K100 through introduction of well designed vibration suppression. On the sporting inspired K1, {{the engine was}} directly mounted onto the frame, which led to secondary vibrations problems at certain mid-range <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{used the}} term [...] "SelectShift" [...] because placing the gear {{selector}} in second gear forced the transmission to start and remain in second gear only, regardless of <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions,</b> or torque {{being sent to the}} unit. If the transmission was placed in third gear, the transmission would start in first gear, then shift to second and third gear as normal.|$|R
50|$|Any {{transmission}} {{that requires}} the operator to manually synchronize <b>engine</b> crank-shaft <b>revolutions</b> (RPM) with drive-shaft revolutions is non-synchronous.|$|R
30|$|A multi {{variance}} analysis {{was made in}} order to determine the effects of wood-based panels, <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed, and drive forward speed on the current values that were experimentally derived. In order to compare and contrast the variances between the groups, the Duncan multi-comparison analysis was also made. Additionally, modal equations were made to predict the required current values by making a multi-linear regression analysis for each wood-based panel type according to <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed and drive forward speed.|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{determine}} the strains on the machinery and the cutters during the planing of various wood-based panels at different <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speeds and drive forward speeds.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed, the lowest strains shown against the cutters {{and the machine}} were seen at 4.188  A at 2900 rev/min speed {{followed}} by 4.805  A at 6000 rev/min and 5.426  A at 10000 rev/min, consecutively.|$|E

50|$|With the {{utilization}} of a redesigned exhaust port valve and the ARC (Advanced Radical Combustion) system engaged, the engine would produce a pre-ignited combustion effect at low throttle that would completely burn all fuel in the chamber compared to how a conventional two-stroke engine would lose part of the intake charge. The result decreased two major drawbacks of two-stroke technology of both incomplete combustion of fuel at low <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> (RPM) and expulsion of unburned fuel at high RPM.|$|R
40|$|NASA {{has been}} researching new {{technology}} and system concepts {{to meet the requirements}} of aeropropulsion for 21 st Century aircraft. The air transportation for the new millennium will require revolutionary solutions to meet public demand for improving safety, reliability, environmental compatibility, and affordability. Whereas the turbine <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> will continue during the next two decades, several new revolutions are required to achieve the dream of an affordable, emissionless, and silent aircraft. This paper reviews the continuing turbine <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> and explores the propulsion system impact of future revolutions in propulsion configuration, fuel infrastructure, and alternate energy systems. A number of promising concepts, ranging from the ultrahigh to fuel cell-powered distributed propulsion are also reviewed...|$|E

It {{was clearly}} seen {{that it is}} {{possible}} to anticipate the required current values in advance with 1.6 – 4.3  % error ratios according to each wooden materials’ determination coefficient depending on <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed and drive forward speed according to the realized regression analysis equation [13].|$|E
3000|$|In this study, strains {{that are}} caused by wood-based panels on {{horizontal}} milling machines and other cutting devices were examined. In order to fulfill this aim, samples of wood-based panels such as particleboard, medium density fiberboard (MDF), blockboard, okoume (Aucoumea klaineana) plywood, poplar (Populus × euramericana) plywood, and oriented strand board (OSB) were examined. The strains that milling machines and planer head with reversible knives suffered were measured by an amperemeter using an experimental mechanism with six different wood-based panels, three different <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speeds (rev/min), and three drive forward speeds (m/min). Using the experimental data and the data derived from wood-based panels, <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed, and drive forward speed, several regression equations were developed in order to anticipate probable strains {{for each of the}} wood-based panels. As a consequence, the utmost strains observed on machinery during planing were caused by okoume plywood, followed by MDF, OSB, particleboard, blockboard, and poplar plywood in decreasing order of intensity. It was also observed that the spent current values (A) increased during planing in which <b>engine</b> <b>revolution</b> speed and drive forward speed are always kept high. It was also clearly seen that the wood-based panels were more resistant to the machinery and the knives when they were operated at higher speeds. The results of experiments correlated well with the predicted values produced by the anticipation regression models (R [...]...|$|E
50|$|Major {{development}} {{changes were}} made to the RC45’s engine, one of the first differences seen is the bore and stroke, which are much different from the RC30’s. The RC45 had a reduced stroke compared to the RC30, the RC30 having used a bore and stroke of 70 mm x 48.6 mm, whereas the RC45 was changed to a more rev-happy bore and stroke combination of 72 mm x 46 mm. This allowed higher <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> than the RC30 whilst maintaining equal pistons speeds.|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} {{it became clear}} that the Fiat team had superior speed; Sunbeam axle ratio were lowered to improve speed. In the race, the Sunbeams could not match the performance of the Fiats, safe <b>engine</b> <b>revolutions</b> were exceeded and the inlet valves fractured; the Sunbeams were ‘put out of running’. Jean Chassagne in car No.9, the team leader and winner of that year’s IoM T.T. with a modified 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam retired after only five laps as did K. Lee Guinness in car No.16.|$|R

Additional weight {{will be added to}} the car in the form of success ballast, increasing the weights of cars finishing in the top three positions in each race over the course of an event. Additionally, a seeded drivers list will be drawn up by CAMS based on past racing history and drivers on that list will have added additional weight.|$|R
