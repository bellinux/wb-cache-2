5|$|The {{means by}} which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into {{radiation}} remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 {{there was still no}} generally accepted model for how this process occurs. Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics. Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into <b>gamma-rays.</b> Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB 990123 and to GRB 080319B, whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra, have suggested that inverse Compton may be the dominant process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy photons are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into <b>gamma-rays.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally <b>gamma-rays</b> from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E

25|$|Because quasars are distant objects, {{any light}} which reaches the Earth is redshifted {{due to the}} metric {{expansion}} of space.

This radiation is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum, almost uniformly, from X-rays to the far-infrared with a peak in the ultraviolet-optical bands, with some quasars also being strong sources of radio emission and of <b>gamma-rays.</b>|$|E
25|$|The flux of {{secondary}} particles and X-ray and <b>gamma-rays</b> of atmospheric origin {{produced by the}} interaction of the cosmic rays is very low. This low background, in the presence of which one has to detect the feeble signal from cosmic sources is a major advantage in conducting hard X-ray observations from India. The second advantage is that many bright sources like Cyg X-1, Crab Nebula, Scorpius X-1 and Galactic Centre sources are observable from Hyderabad due to their favourable declination. With these considerations, an X-ray astronomy group was formed at TIFR in 1967 and development of an instrument with an orientable X-ray telescope for hard X-ray observations was undertaken. The first balloon flight with the new instrument was made on 28 April 1968 in which observations of Scorpius X-1 were successfully carried out. In a succession of balloon flights made with this instrument between 1968 and 1974 a number of binary X-ray sources including Cyg X-1 and Her X-1, and the diffuse cosmic X-ray background were studied. Many new and astrophysically important results were obtained from these observations.|$|E

25|$|As of 2007, {{there is}} almost {{universal}} agreement in the astrophysics community that the long-duration bursts {{are associated with the}} deaths of massive stars in a specific kind of supernova-like event commonly referred to as a collapsar or hypernova. Very massive stars are able to fuse material in their centers all the way to iron, at which point a star cannot continue to generate energy by fusion and collapses, in this case, immediately forming a black hole. Matter from the star around the core rains down towards the center and (for rapidly rotating stars) swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into the black hole drives a pair of jets out along the rotational axis, where the matter density is much lower than in the accretion disk, towards the poles of the star at velocities approaching the speed of light, creating a relativistic shock wave at the front. If the star is not surrounded by a thick, diffuse hydrogen envelope, the jets' material can pummel {{all the way to the}} stellar surface. The leading shock actually accelerates as the density of the stellar matter it travels through decreases, and by the time it reaches the surface of the star it may be traveling with a Lorentz factor of 100 or higher (that is, a velocity of 0.9999 times the speed of light). Once it reaches the surface, the shock wave breaks out into space, with much of its energy released in the form of <b>gamma-rays.</b>|$|E

500|$|Core {{collapse}} can {{be caused}} by several different mechanisms: electron capture; exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; pair-instability; or photodisintegration.

[...] Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with very similar results. [...] Electron-positron pair production in a large post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability supernova. [...] A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate <b>gamma-rays</b> energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly, which will cause a complete collapse of the core.|$|E

We show in this article that for bursts in the BATSE data set, this property {{as measured by the}} E-peak value is not an instrumental effect, but a physical property of <b>gamma-ray</b> bursts. 1. The Characteristic Photon Energy of Bursts The prompt emission of <b>gamma-ray</b> bursts is observed predominately at several hundred keV. This {{is one of the most}} interesting features of <b>gamma-ray</b> bursts, since it is not easily explained by most theories of prompt <b>gamma-ray</b> emission. In particular, the internal and external shock theories predict a wide variation in the characteristic <b>gamma-ray</b> energy both during a burst and between bursts. It is therefore imperative to know whether this is a physical characteristic of bursts, or a consequence of an instrumental effect. In this article, we discuss the instrumental effects that arise when observing <b>gamma-ray</b> bursts with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton <b>Gamma-Ray</b> Observatory (CGRO).

It is found that most of the <b>gamma-ray</b> line flares produced intense, type II and IV radio bursts, and that the time profiles of the high energy hard X-rays are delayed for several seconds relative to those of low energy hard X-rays.

[...] If a GRB progenitor, such as a Wolf-Rayet star, were to explode within a stellar cluster, the resulting shock wave could generate <b>gamma-rays</b> by scattering photons from neighboring stars. [...] About 30% of known galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, are located in dense clusters of O stars with intense ultraviolet radiation fields, and the collapsar model suggests that WR stars are likely GRB progenitors.
