5000|$|Beam lead {{technology}} is a method of fabricating a semiconductor device. Its original application was to high-frequency silicon switching transistors and high-speed <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> It eliminated the labor-intensive wire-bonding process used for <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> at the time, and allowed automated assembly of semiconductor chips onto larger substrates to produce hybrid <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
5|$|Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP): {{similar to}} glow {{discharge}} plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHz.

50|$|The Minuteman-II {{program was}} the first mass-produced system to use a {{computer}} constructed from <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> (the Autonetics D-37C). The Minuteman-II <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> were diode-transistor logic and diode logic made by Texas Instruments. The other major customer of early <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> was the Apollo Guidance Computer, which had similar weight and ruggedness constraints. The Apollo <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> were resistor-transistor logic made by Fairchild Semiconductor.

5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit.</b> Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (IC) model, the Concorde, in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained drawbars and a built-in rotating speaker. Spinet organs included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, a portable solid-state clone of the B-3.|$|E
5|$|In VLSI <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> design, if a {{collection}} of modules must be connected by wires that can each bend at most once, then again there are two possible routes for the wires, {{and the problem of}} choosing which of these two routes to use, {{in such a way that}} all wires can be routed in a single layer of the circuit, can be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a secure supply chain, it is not {{possible}} to fully trust the integrity of electronic devices. Current methods of verifying <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> are either destructive or non-specific. Here we expand upon prior work, in which we proposed a novel method of reverse engineering the finite state machines that <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> are built upon in a non-destructive and highly specific manner.

5|$|The {{calculator}} was {{powered by}} a Texas Instruments TMC1802NC, a metal oxide semiconductor <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> with 7000 transistors. This CPU normally consumes 350 milliwatts, but by pulsing the power this requirement was reduced to 20 milliwatts. It was discovered that an early prototype continued to work if the batteries were disconnected and then reapplied quickly enough, as the capacitors in the circuit could hold a charge {{for up to five}} seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E

5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit,</b> usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

5|$|The AN/APG-68, an {{evolution}} of the APG-66, was introduced with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, as well as 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for semi-active radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuit</b> (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.|$|E
