In brass images, Banai is depicted holding a lamb and offering water to Khandoba, while Mhalsa rides with Khandoba on his horse. In metal plaques worshipped by the Dhangars, Banai accompanies Khandoba on <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> is depicted with sheep.|$|E
5|$|The winning {{names were}} those {{submitted}} by the Planetario de Pamplona, Spain. Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547-1616) was a famous Spanish writer and author of El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha. The planets are named after characters of that novel: Quijote was the lead character; Dulcinea his love interest; Rocinante <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> Sancho his squire.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{fight and}} a stagecoach chase, Crane {{eventually}} thwarts Lady Van Tassel by throwing the skull to the Horseman, who reattaches his head to his body and breaks Lady Van Tassel's curse. The Horseman, no longer under her control, hoists Van Tassel up on <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> gives her a bloody kiss against her will. He then rides to Hell, taking her with a smile, fulfilling her end of the deal with the Devil. Crane returns home to New York City with Katrina and Young Masbath, {{just in time for}} the new century.|$|E

5|$|Johnson fell {{unconscious}} {{after this}} duel and was dragged from the battlefield; {{in addition to}} his five wounds, twenty other bullets had hit <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> gear. But the war in the Northwest was over. Although there was no organized resistance to his presence in Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems. (The Canadians would not feed his men.) Johnson eventually recovered, except for a crippled hand, but he was still suffering from his wounds {{when he returned to the}} House in February 1814.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|When the Scott family awoke {{the next}} morning, Beauchamp {{emerged from his}} quarters. He feigned {{surprise}} when told of the murder and was apparently believed at the time. After being told there were no suspects yet, he called for <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, he told his wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.|$|E

5|$|Anderson visited Confederate sympathizers as he traveled, {{some of whom}} viewed him as a {{hero for}} {{fighting}} the Union, whom they deeply hated. Many of Anderson's men also despised the Union, and he was adept at tapping into this emotion. The Union soldier held captured at Centralia {{was impressed with the}} control that Anderson exercised over his men. Although many of them wished to execute this Union hostage, Anderson refused to allow it. On October 6, Anderson and his men traveled to meet General Price in Boonville, Missouri. Price was disgusted that Anderson used scalps to decorate <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> would not speak with him until he removed them. He was, however, impressed by the effectiveness of Anderson's attacks. Anderson presented him with a gift of fine Union pistols, likely captured at Centralia. Price instructed Anderson to travel to the Missouri railroad and disrupt rail traffic, making Anderson a de facto Confederate captain.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{international}} affairs intervened. Louis XI {{declared war on}} Burgundy, and Duke Charles responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14March Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, {{who were supposed to}} bring reinforcements from France, but were kept on the continent by bad weather. At this point Edward received the support of his brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians. Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field, but was struck off <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1841 Lady Maria died, and Bute blamed his {{excessive}} {{focus on}} the dock programme for exacerbating his wife's illness. As {{a result of the}} original marriage agreement, Bute continued to draw the incomes from his late wife's property for the remainder of his life, even though officially the estates would ultimately pass to Maria's sister, Lady Susan, on his own death. He was created a Knight of the Thistle in 1843 by Queen Victoria. In 1845 Bute fell from <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> injured his eyes further in the accident, making it still harder for him to read and write. Bute remarried the same year, this time to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, the daughter of the Marquess of Hastings. Sophia was obsessive, hard to please and did not get on well with John's family, especially his brother. She soon became pregnant, but gave birth to a stillborn child; the couple's second child, whom they named John, was successfully born in 1847.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his difficult relationship with Price, Reeves {{had to deal with}} a few production problems during the shooting. On the first day, Price was thrown from <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> sent back to his hotel to recover. The actor returned to work the following day. Towards the end of filming, a strike was called when the British technicians union learned the production company was not hiring a large enough crew as required by union rules. After an extra man was hired, the crew resumed working. On two occasions, Reeves was short of actors. Waddilove replaced an absent actor as a Roundhead officer during Wymark's one-day scene. Waddilove's wife, Susi, played one {{of the women in the}} animal enclosure during the witch-burning sequence.|$|E
5|$|In autumn Lord Hastings, {{the owner}} of the 1885 Derby winner Melton issued a {{challenge}} to Jack Hammond for a £1,000 match race between <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> St. Gatien, with Melton to receive nine pounds. The challenge was declined, as St. Gatien had already been heavily backed for the Cambridgeshire Handicap, a race in which he had been assigned 136 pounds and Hammond did not want to disrupt the horse's preparation. St. Gatien returned to the racecourse after a break of four months in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles at Newmarket on October 12. The race proved meaningless as a contest, his only opponent being a three-year-old filly called Jane who had finished runner-up in the 1000 Guineas. St. Gatien started at odds of 1/33 and won with predictable ease by twenty lengths.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1806, Cabell {{learned that}} his father was sick. Not long after, however, he {{received}} word {{that his father was}} improving and expected to meet him in Virginia en route to the capital. Although a rendezvous location had not been set, he assumed it would be in Lynchburg, where the Breckinridges had relatives. In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but he never came. Disappointed, he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term, unaware that his father's recovery had been short-lived. Later he {{learned that his}} father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806.|$|E

5|$|Montevideo, a royalist stronghold {{during the}} Argentine War of Independence, was under siege by José Gervasio Artigas. Those {{in the city}} raided {{population}} centres along the nearby rivers for supplies. José de San Martín, who shortly before had arrived in Buenos Aires and formed the regiment, followed the royalist ships to San Lorenzo. The area around San Lorenzo formed a large empty plain, so the regiment hid inside the San Carlos convent during the night and San Martín studied the battlefield and the enemy ships from the tower. The battle started at dawn, when the grenadiers made a surprise pincer movement to trap the enemy forces. One column was led by San Martín, and the other by Justo Germán Bermúdez. San Martín fell from <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> was nearly killed, but Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria intervened and saved him. The royalists were defeated, but continued to raid villages for some more time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, the Byzantines {{increased}} their forces in Lazica, but failed to achieve decisive success; Gubazes quarreled with their generals, and wrote to Emperor Justinian accusing them of incompetence following a defeat by the Persians. Bessas was recalled, but the other two, Martin and the sacellarius Rusticus, resolved {{to get rid of}} Gubazes. They sent a message to Constantinople accusing Gubazes of dealings with the Persians. Emperor Justinian, intending to question Gubazes himself, authorized the two generals to arrest him, using force if necessary. The two Byzantine generals then (September/October 555) invited Gubazes to observe the siege of a Persian-held fort, but when they met, John, Rusticus's brother, stabbed the king with his dagger. Gubazes fell from <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> one of Rusticus's servants gave him the finishing blow.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of the Earl of Gloucester's death at the Battle of Bannockburn is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi. This account is written as a moral tale, expounding on the earl's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions. For this reason, its historical accuracy must be taken with some caution. According to some accounts, Gloucester rushed headfirst into battle {{in the pursuit of}} glory, and fell victim to his own foolishness. The Vita, on the other hand, claimed that, as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks, he was knocked off <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue. It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation. According to one account, Gloucester rushed into battle without a distinguishing coat of arms, exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers, who otherwise would have been eager to secure a valuable ransom.|$|E
60|$|All {{the next}} day he did {{scarcely}} anything but watch <b>and</b> look after <b>his</b> <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> watch and drag the hours out and dream despite his dread. But no one visited him. The cabin was left to him that day.|$|R

5|$|The peace {{lasted until}} the end of the Muslim civil war in 661, from which Mu'awiya and his clan emerged victorious, {{establishing}} the Umayyad Caliphate. From the next year, Muslim attacks recommenced, with pressure mounting as Muslim armies began wintering on Byzantine soil west of the Taurus range, maximizing the disruption caused to the Byzantine economy. These land expeditions were sometimes coupled with naval raids against the coasts of southern Asia Minor. In 668, the Arabs sent aid to Saborios, strategos of the Armeniac Theme, who had rebelled and proclaimed himself emperor. The Arab troops under Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd arrived too late to assist Saborios, who had died after falling from <b>his</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> they spent the winter in the Hexapolis around Melitene awaiting reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of the powerful confederation of the Hun tribes included about 400 AD the lands of southern Poland, where burial and treasure sites have been investigated. A woman's grave in Jędrzychowice, Strzelin County contained fancy feminine ornaments and a nicely preserved bronze kettle, which gave a name ("Jędrzychowice") {{to one of the}} two basic Hun kettle types, while a burial of a young warrior-aristocrat including <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> precious harness, attire and weaponry elements (gold sheet covered ritual bow and sword sheath) was found in Jakuszowice, Kazimierza Wielka County. Still further east, in Świlcza near Rzeszów a hidden Hun treasure was located; this last find dates from the mid-5th century, when the Hun empire was about to crumble.|$|E
5|$|Although legal {{accounts}} do {{not describe}} {{the course of}} the combat, contemporary chroniclers have left several records of the day's battle. According to the chronicles, the claimants entered the field last and before all present repeated their accusations against the other and swore oaths guaranteeing their honesty before the King, Parlement and God. Before they remounted, the marshal of the duel performed a brief ceremony in which he knighted Jacques Le Gris. This ceremony was traditional before battle but also performed a part in maintaining the social structure of medieval France. With both men on the same social footing, there would be no defeat of a senior rank by a lesser one. Having been raised to the status of a knight, Sir Jacques regained <b>his</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> the arena was cleared. Both knights were heavily armed and armoured, protected by a hide and wood shield bearing their coat of arms and thick plate armour, riding a heavy warhorse and wielding a lance, longsword, heavy battle axe and long dagger known as a misericordia.|$|E

50|$|Coming from a farming family, Shimabuku {{had always}} been poor, {{but he was very}} {{innovative}} and opportunistic. He had a natural talent for adapting things. As a young man in Kyan (Chan) (チャン) Village, he discovered a way to bind tiles to the roofs of homes without using mud, which had been the traditional way. During World War II, as part of the Boetai, he was forced to help construct the airfield in Kadena with <b>his</b> <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> carts.
