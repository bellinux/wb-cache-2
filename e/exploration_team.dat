25|$|In 1928, Commander Rupert Gould made {{a survey}} of the area and {{declared}} that Ritchie Reef was definitely the Tryal Rocks. Final confirmation of this came in 1969, when an <b>exploration</b> <b>team</b> found the wreck of the Tryall there.|$|E
50|$|The Baliem Valley was {{previously}} explored in 1938 by Richard Archbold, flying in a PBY-2. Although the press believed {{the survivors of}} the Gremlin Special crash to be the first outsiders to encounter the Dani people who inhabited the area, Archbold had sent two <b>exploration</b> <b>teams</b> into the valley in 1938.|$|R

50|$|Shaybah was {{developed}} {{for the purposes of}} exploiting the Shaybah oilfield. It was established by Saudi Aramco during the 1990s, and, prior to this, only the rough tracks used by early <b>exploration</b> <b>teams</b> existed in this isolated desert region. All materials for the establishment and construction of Shaybah were transported the 800 kilometres from Dhahran to Shaybah by road.|$|R
25|$|In the Yucatán, the 1980s {{ended with}} the discoveries of the Dos Ojos and Nohoch Nah Chich cave systems which led into a long {{competition}} of which <b>exploration</b> <b>team</b> had the longest recorded underwater cave {{system in the world}} at the time.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} sighting {{of the crash}} site was on November 9, 1958 by a British oil <b>exploration</b> <b>team</b> working for British Petroleum (BP) in the northeast of Libya's Kufra District. The team contacted authorities at Wheelus Air Base, but no attempt to examine the aircraft was made as no records existed of any plane {{believed to have been}} lost in the area. The location of the wreckage was however marked on maps to be used by oil-prospecting teams that were due to set out to explore the Calanshio Sand Sea the next year.|$|E

Their mineral <b>exploration</b> <b>teams</b> extract contaminant-free samples that accurately reflect the underlying mineral deposits. Also, Layne is able to drill deep injection wells to facilitate the disposal of treated wastewater.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, mining <b>explorations</b> <b>teams</b> {{discovered}} {{pink and}} reddish diamonds, quite rare at the time, at Smoke Creek and at Barramundi Gap, {{which happens to}} be a key site in Gija female dreaming. Subsequently the Argyle diamond mine was established. Employment of local people remained low, a mere 10% in 2003, when strategies changed. Now a quarter of the workforce is recruited from local indigenous people.|$|R

Hurdles facing in-space transportation include affordable power sources, crew health and safety, optimized robotic and human operations and space systems performance. Topics covered include: exploration of Earth's neighborhood, Earth's neighborhood architecture and elements, Mars mission trajectory options, delta-v variations, Mars mission duration options, Mars mission architecture, nuclear electric propulsion advantages and miscellaneous technology needs...|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, the Submerged Cultural Resources <b>Exploration</b> <b>Team</b> (SCRET) {{discovered}} a wreck in Lake Washington {{of a wooden}} steamer [...] long, in [...] feet of water,which they judged to be either Acme or L.T. Haas (which was destroyed by fire in 1909). [...] The vessel contained a small steam engine and a propeller shaft, which made the wreck unique. [...] Normally machinery would have been salvaged from a vessel if possible.|$|E
2500|$|Lady Be Good was an USAAF B-24D Liberator that {{disappeared}} {{without a}} trace on its first combat mission during World War II. The plane, which was from 376th Bomb Group, was {{believed to have been}} lost – with its nine-man crew – in the Mediterranean Sea while returning to its base in Libya following a bombing raid on Naples on April 4, 1943. However, the wreck was accidentally discovered [...] inland in the Libyan Desert by an oil <b>exploration</b> <b>team</b> from British Petroleum on November 9, 1958.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{generally}} recognized boundary of space is the Kármán line 100km above sea level. (NASA alternatively defines an astronaut {{as someone who}} has flown more than [...] above sea level.) It is not {{generally recognized}} by the public that the increase in potential energy required to pass the Kármán line is only about 3% of the orbital energy (potential plus kinetic energy) required by the lowest possible Earth orbit (a circular orbit just above the Kármán line.) In other words, it is far easier to reach space than to stay there. On May 17, 2004, Civilian Space <b>eXploration</b> <b>Team</b> launched the GoFast Rocket on a suborbital flight, the first amateur spaceflight. On June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne was used for the first privately funded human spaceflight.|$|E
50|$|In August 1938, Archbold {{dispatched}} two <b>exploration</b> <b>teams,</b> each {{consisting of}} Dutch soldiers, convicts, and Dayak porters, into the Baliem Valley. One {{team led by}} Captain C.G.J. Teerink started {{at one end of}} the valley while the other, led by Lieutenant J.E.M. Van Arcken, started at the other end with the goal of meeting in the middle of the valley. On August 10, 1938, an incident occurred near the valley's center resulting in the death of a Dani tribesman.|$|R
50|$|The United Nations {{forms the}} United Nations Interdimensional Survey Service (UNISS) along with IDET (Inter-Dimensional <b>Exploration</b> <b>Teams)</b> {{to oversee the}} {{administration}} of the Fringepaths and their exploration. As a member of IDET, characters help explore other worlds, help other alternate worlds with their problems, and face down the menaces that exist on the Fringepaths. Players play characters with the 1-in-100,000 ability to use the equipment left behind by a race named the Tehrmelern. They created the pathways, called the fringes, that lead to other worlds and other places.|$|R
25|$|Some paramedics {{have begun}} to {{specialize}} their practice, frequently {{in association with the}} environment in which they will work. Some early examples of this involved aviation medicine and the use of helicopters, and the transfer of critical care patients between facilities. While some jurisdictions still use physicians, nurses, and technicians for transporting patients, increasingly this role falls to specialized senior and experienced paramedics. Other areas of specialization include such roles as tactical paramedics working in police units, marine paramedics, hazardous materials (Hazmat) teams, Heavy Urban Search and Rescue, and paramedics on offshore oil platforms, oil and mineral <b>exploration</b> <b>teams,</b> and in the military.|$|R
2500|$|At Liaohe, Zhou met Wang Shuhua (...) , {{a factory}} worker from Hebei province, whom he later married. As the Liaohe <b>exploration</b> <b>team</b> grew, Zhou {{eventually}} became responsible for over 2,300 employees in his department. His work consisted mainly of leading teams to unexplored, barren territory to conduct site surveys {{to assess the}} potential for future oil drilling. He {{was known to be}} great at maintaining good interpersonal relationships with his superiors and subordinates, and gained significant personal clout. During some years, Zhou did not go back to his home in Jiangsu even during the Chinese New Year holiday period, which is a time traditionally reserved for family reunions. Instead, Zhou would visit his colleagues who were working in harsh winter conditions in remote areas. Beginning in the 1970s, Zhou would gain rapid career advancement. He owed much of his career growth to his mentors from the Beijing Institute of Petroleum, who were working in executive positions at the Liaohe oil fields at the time. In particular the university's president was known to be fond of Zhou's skills and was eager to promote him. In 1983, with the director of the Liaohe Oil Field Management Bureau being transferred for a job in Beijing, Zhou was promoted to manage day-to-day affairs of the oil field. Moreover, given the oil field's prominence in the municipal affairs of the city of Panjin, Zhou became concurrently the Mayor of Panjin and the city's deputy party secretary. Zhou's stint as mayor was his first major role in government.|$|E

2500|$|After {{high school}} in Niagara Falls, Ballard {{attended}} Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, studying geological engineering. Here he met his future wife, Shelagh, and they married and graduated the same year, in 1956. Ballard secured a position at Shell Oil in Alberta, leading <b>exploration</b> <b>teams</b> on horseback. He left Shell for Mobil Oil and travelled {{around the world on}} exploration trips. During these trips his advice was often ignored as he was [...] "only" [...] a BSc (difficult enough in 1950s), and after several such incidents he decided to leave industry and pursue a doctorate in earth and planetary sciences from Washington University in St. Louis.|$|R

40|$|Pain {{symptoms}} {{have been}} addressed {{with a variety of}} therapeutic measures in the past, but as we look to the future, we begin encountering new options for patient care and individual health and well-being. Recent studies indicate that computer-generated graphic environments - virtual reality (VR) - can offer effective cognitive distractions for individuals suffering from pain arising from a variety of physical and psychological illnesses. Studies also indicate the effectiveness of VR for both chronic and acute pain conditions. Future possibilities for VR to address pain-related concerns include such diverse groups as military personnel, space <b>exploration</b> <b>teams,</b> the general labor force, and our ever increasing elderly population. VR also shows promise to help in such areas as drug abuse, at-home treatments, and athletic injuries...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} how {{scientific}} collaborations share data is bound up in {{the ways in which}} they produce and acquire that data. We draw on ethnographic work with two robotic space <b>exploration</b> <b>teams</b> to show how each community’s norms of “data-sharing ” are best understood as arising not from the context of the use or exchange of data, but from the context of data production. Shifting our perspective back to the point of production suggests that digital artifacts are embedded in a broader data economy. We present implications for analysis of data in interactional context, and for introducing systems or policies that conflict with the value of data in its context of production.

40|$|Informal {{and formal}} {{mechanisms}} affect choices between exploitation and <b>exploration</b> in <b>team</b> design. We {{argue that the}} status differentiation of team members and differences in organizational structure limit exploration {{in the form of}} introducing newcomers to teams and creating new combinations of team members. High- and low-status team members and one- and three-layer organizational structures were expected to be positively related to <b>exploration,</b> and middle-status <b>team</b> members and two-layer structures were expected to be negatively related to it. We used data on 6, 446 motion pictures produced by the Hollywood film industry in the period 1929 - 58 to test our hypotheses...|$|R
