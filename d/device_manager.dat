This list may be known in advance (e.g. on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally called plug and play). In a plug and play system, a <b>device</b> <b>manager</b> first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) or Universal Serial Bus (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft {{released}} Windows 2000 on February 17, 2000. It has {{the version}} number Windows NT 5.0. Windows 2000 has had four official service packs. It was successfully deployed {{both on the}} server and the workstation markets. Amongst Windows 2000's most significant new features was Active Directory, a near-complete replacement of the NT 4.0 Windows Server domain model, which built on industry-standard technologies like DNS, LDAP, and Kerberos to connect machines to one another. Terminal Services, previously only available as a separate edition of NT 4, was expanded to all server versions. A number of features from Windows 98 were incorporated also, such as an improved <b>Device</b> <b>Manager,</b> Windows Media Player, and a revised DirectX {{that made it possible}} for the first time for many modern games to work on the NT kernel. Windows 2000 is also the last NT-kernel Windows operating system to lack product activation.|$|E

40|$|In the {{relational}} model {{the order of}} fetching data does not affect query correctness. This flexibility is exploited in query optimization by statically reordering data accesses. However, once a query is optimized, it is executed in a fixed order in most systems, {{with the result that}} data requests are made in a fixed order. Only limited forms of runtime reordering can be provided by low-level <b>device</b> <b>managers.</b> More aggressive reordering strategies are essential in scenarios where the latency of access to data objects varies widely and dynamically, as in tertiary devices. This paper presents such a strategy. Our key innovation is to exploit dynamic reordering to match execution order to the optimal data fetch order, {{in all parts of the}} plan-tree. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach and the impact of our optimizations, we report on a prototype implementation based on Postgres. Using our system, typical I/O cost for queries on tertiary memory databases is as much as an order of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} VirtualExplorer, a customizable plugin-based {{virtual reality}} framework for immersive scientific data visualization, exploration and geometric modeling. The framework is layered {{on top of}} a run-time plugin system and reconfigurable virtual user interface and provides a variety of plugin components. The system provides access to scene-graphbased APIs, including Performer and OpenInventor, direct OpenGL support for visualization of time-critical data as well as collision and generic <b>device</b> <b>managers.</b> Plugins can be loaded, disabled, enabled or unloaded at any time, triggered either through pre-defined events or through an external Python-based interface. The virtual user interface uses pre-defined geometric primitives that can be customized to meet application-specific needs. The entire widget set can be reconfigured dynamically on a per-widget basis or as a whole through a style manager. The system is being developed with a variety of application areas in mind, but its main emphasis is on user-guided data exploration and high-precision engineering design...|$|R
