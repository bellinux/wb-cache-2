Between 1923 and 1926 Marquis practiced medicine privately on the Crow Reservation but then tried to make writing his permanent career. Throughout his life Marquis was often in debt; his writing was sometimes interrupted by the need to earn money at medicine, or even his original career of typesetting. From 1926 he returned to his contacts among the Cheyenne, interviewing them in depth. The trust he developed with them allowed them to open up to him in a way they had not with any other outsiders. The result formed the bulk of Marquis' most important works.|$|E

Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of allmusic {{notes that the}} song is narrated {{by a man who}} imagines a relationship with the woman he loves but is canny <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> his daydreams are fiction, yet is overwhelmed by them. The lyrics capture his resignation to his fantasies. The song as a whole captures their full emotional effect on him. [...] The first two verses establish the theme and explore the narrator's daydreams, in which he and the object of his affections are lovers preparing to be married, to [...] "raise a family" [...] and build [...] "a cozy little home / out in the country / with two children, maybe three." [...] In the bridge, the narrator prays that he will never lose her love to another, or he will surely die." [...] By introducing this doubt, the musical bridge simultaneously bridges the movement from dream to reality, completed when the final lines shift from imagery to bald statement: [...] "But in reality / she doesn't even know me." [...] For Erlewine, [...] "the Temptations' performance has a dream-like quality, quietly drifting through the singer's hopes and desires." [...] We must add that just as the lyrics track the movement from dream to reality, the chorus goes on to anchor the drifting melody in a robust and highly memorable rhythm.|$|E

This spurs Aldaris to rebellion; Raszagal consequently orders his death. Kerrigan and Samir Duran later kidnap Raszagal from Shakuras, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the second Overmind.

[...] "Mshak" [...] ("The Tiller") was founded as a weekly in 1872 by Grigor Artsruni. It {{played an important role in}} awakening the Armenian people from the lethargy that had overcome the majority of them since the loss of Armenian independence at the end of the 14th century. Raffi’s patriotic writings were read by virtually all Armenian youth of the time and of subsequent generations. In his novels, Raffi depicted characters of national heroes and Armenian revolutionaries. In fact, there is a well-known Armenian phrase that goes: [...] "there are no Armenian freedom fighters (Feddayines) that have not read Raffi".Raffi considered that teaching the population the Armenian language was a fundamental and vital measure, but he felt they were bereft of a secular literature attractive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> help <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> goal. It was to fill that void that he set out from 1874 to 1888 to create a complete and varied body of fiction. It was through these works that generations of Armenians learned to read Armenian, became acquainted with their history, and acquired the critical standards by which they could assess their lives and society. From 1880-1888, Raffi lived at present day Chonkhadze Str. 3, in the Sololaki area of Tbilisi, Georgia.Raffi died in 1888 in Tiflis, and his funeral attracted an unprecedented crowd. He was buried in the Pantheon of Armenians at the Khodjivank cemetery in Tbilisi, where Hovhannes Tumanyan, Gabriel Sundukian, Ghazaros Aghayan and Grigor Artsruni were also buried.|$|R
