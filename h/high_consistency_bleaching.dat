40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{a widely}} used bleaching chemical for mechanical pulps and is particularly useful when high brightness levels are required. The objective of this work was to study fines as a limiting factor for reaching higher brightness levels in <b>high</b> <b>consistency</b> hydrogen peroxide <b>bleaching</b> of Norway spruce (Picea abies) thermomechanical (TMP) and stone groundwood (SGW) pulps. The hydrogen peroxide bleaching efficiency (i. e. light absorption coefficient reduction) was studied {{as a function of}} temperature, alkali charge and fines content using an experimental design based on MODDE software (Umetrics AB). It is known that all types of fines contain more lignin, hemicelluloses, pectins, metals and less cellulose than long fibres. The light absorption coefficient was greater for unbleached TMP than for unbleached SGW pulp and an increased quantity of fines increased the light absorption coefficient for both pulp types. The increase was, however, most pronounced for the TMP. Furthermore, the data suggests that both the fibre fraction and the fines fraction are more coloured in the thermomechanical pulp. In most cases, increased amounts of fines in the pulp had a negative impact on the bleached pulp brightness in spite of the improved light scattering ability accompanying the addition of fines. A level of fines exceeding 50 % was especially detrimental resulting in lower pulp brightness due to a higher light absorption coefficient. Increasing the bleaching temperature did not improve the bleaching efficiency. The optimal bleaching temperature at a hydrogen peroxide charge of 4. 5 % was found to be 70 °C within the tested interval of 70 - 110 °C. For a fines content of 25 %, the stone groundwood pulp displayed a brightness of 83 % whereas the thermomechanical pulp achieved a brightness of 79 %...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the mechanisms involved in cellulosedegradation {{in general and}} Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleachingof pulp in particular. The thesis shows that the cellulosedegradation during <b>high</b> <b>consistency</b> ozone <b>bleaching</b> is explainedby free radical chain reactions. By simulation, {{it has been shown}} that the number, weight andviscosity average of liner polymer chain length can be used tocalculate the number of random scissions in a linear polymer ofany molecular weight distribution, provided that there is acalibrated Mark-Houwink equation. A model describing partialdegradation of molecular weight distributions of linear polymersmeasured with viscometry was developed and verifiedexperimentally. The model predicts viscometric measurement ofchemical cellulose degradation by a rapidly reacting reagent tobe strongly dependent on cellulose accessibility. The role of free radical reactions in cellulose degradationwas studied by varying the amount of ferrous ions and ozone addedto the cotton linters. The result was compared to the resultsobtained from cellulose of lower crystallinity (cellulose beads) by measuring average chain length. When a ferryl ion reacted withcotton linters in the presence of ozone, the very formation ofone glycosidic radical was more significant to degradation thanthe final step of forming one oxidised glycoside. The inefficientdegradation observed of the oxidation step is explainable by theamount of accessible glycosides being too small to influenceviscometry. The efficient degradation observed in associationwith the glycosidic radical formation is explained by initiationof free radical chain reactions that are propagated as long asthere is ozone in the system. As none of these phenomena werefound in the less crystalline cellulose, cellulose structureappears to be important for how free radical mediated cellulosedegradation develops. The theory of free radical chain reactions coupled withdiffusion suggests a concentric expansion of the chain reactionsoutwards from the initial site of radical formation duringozonation of carbohydrates. This was confirmed by demonstratingfree radical chain reactions spreading from a spot of initiationoutwards during ozonation of a filter paper, using a pH-indicatorto monitor acid formation. Furthermore, the interior and exteriorof cellulose fibres doped with initiator were shown to bepermeated by small holes after ozonation. Ethylene glycol was shown to improve the selectivity duringozone bleaching of oxygen bleached kraft pulp at pH 3. Optimalconditions were obtained at pH 3 for 25 wt% ethylene glycol. Theinfluence of ethylene glycol on selectivity is explained by aproportion of the free radical chain reactions being carried bythe ethylene glycol instead of the cellulose during ozonebleaching. The observations were summarised in the form of amodel where the observed degradations for pulp, bleached pulp andcotton fibres during both ozone bleaching and ethylene glycolassisted ozone bleaching were shown to agree with each other. From g-irradiation of ozonised aqueous solutions of alcohol,the rate constant of superoxide formation from the peroxylradical of methanol was estimated to be 10 s- 1. Rate constants of the reactions between ozone andalkylperoxyl radicals were determined to be around 104 M- 1 s- 1. The possibility of the reaction betweenalkylperoxyl radicals and ozone contributing significantly tofree radical chain reactions during ozonation of carbohydratesand alcohols could therefore be ruled out.

40|$|Unbleached {{kraft pulp}} for making sack paper is usually first refined in a <b>high</b> <b>consistency</b> process {{followed}} by low consistency refining {{in order to}} achieve desired paper properties, such as high strain at break and high tensile energy absorption at low airflow resistance. Conventional atmospheric <b>high</b> <b>consistency</b> refining is compared to treatments using two types of compressive screw equipment, Bivis equipment and the pressure expansion (PREX) plug screw feeder, commonly used in thermo mechanical pulp (TMP) plants. The plug screw pretreatments were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 120 °C and 130 °C. Treatment in the Bivis equipment was performed under different compressive and shear conditions. After the Bivis and plug screw treatments, the pulp samples were refined in a low consistency process using the Escher-Wyss refiner. Paper properties were evaluated on freely dried sheets which were produced in order to simulate paper made under industrial sack paper drying conditions. The highest levels of the tensile energy absorption index and strain at break were achieved from curled and kinked fibres, pre-treated under the most compressive and highest shear stress conditions before low consistency refining. These results were obtained at very low airflow resistance, which is advantageous for sack paper, and with very low energy consumption during pre-treatment with the plug screw. The pulp samples pre-treated at <b>high</b> <b>consistency</b> in a plug screw feeder under steam-pressurised conditions or in the Bivis equipment showed, after low consistency refining, increased shrinking ability compared to the pulp samples pre-treated in <b>high</b> <b>consistency</b> refining under atmospheric conditions...|$|R

We proposed multi-level voltage method (MVM) to implement the addressable E-jet printing using multiple parallel nozzles with <b>high</b> <b>consistency.</b> The fabricated multi-nozzle printhead for MVM consists of three parts: PMMA holder, stainless steel capillaries (27 G, outer diameter 400 μm) and FR- 4 extractor layer. The key of MVM is to control the maximum meniscus electric field on each nozzle. The individual jetting control can be implemented when the rings under the jetting nozzles are 0 kV and the other rings are 0. 5 kV. The onset electric field for each nozzle is ∼ 3. 4 kV/mm by numerical simulation. Furthermore, a series of printing experiments are performed to show the advantage of MVM in printing consistency than the “one-voltage method” and “improved E-jet method”, by combination with finite element analyses. The good dimension consistency (274 μm, 276 μm, 280 μm) and position consistency of the droplet array on the hydrophobic Si substrate verified the enhancements. It shows that MVM is an effective technique to implement the addressable E-jet printing with multiple parallel nozzles in <b>high</b> <b>consistency...</b>|$|R
