5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Amherst, Beecher had {{his first}} taste of public {{speaking}} and, setting aside his early dream of going to sea, resolved to join the ministry. He met his future wife, Eunice Bullard, {{the daughter of a}} well-known physician, and on January 2, 1832, became engaged to her. During his Amherst years, he also developed an interest in the new pseudoscience of phrenology—an attempt to link personality traits with features of the human skull—and befriended Orson Squire Fowler, who later became the theory's best-known American exponent.|$|E
5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Boston, Lowe {{developed}} a reputation both as a hitter and a fielder. Listed at 5ft 10 in (1.78 m), 150 pounds (68kg), he hit right-handed and {{was considered one of}} the best second baseman of the 19th century. He was one of only three (along with Kid Nichols and Herman Long) to play on all five of the Beaneaters teams that won pennants in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the law, Mercer {{used his}} {{substantial}} income {{to support the}} arts and amassed a large art collection including many pieces by Carl Ahrens, of whom Mercer {{was a close friend}} and admirer. This art collection was auctioned off in 1925 and was found to contain a selection of art, porcelain, sculpture and antique furniture from around the globe. Mercer was also a keen amateur painter himself and was also an excellent sportsman who represented Canada and the Canadian Army in shooting contests both at home and in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Haakon Steen Lie (22 September 1905 – 25 May 2009) was a Norwegian {{politician}} {{who served as}} party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party from 1945 to 1969. Coming from humble origins, he {{became involved in the}} labour movement at an early age, and quickly rose in the party system. After actively working for the resistance movement and the exiled government during World War II, {{he was elected to the}} second-highest position in the party after the war, and <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> office were the most successful in the party's history.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his French chansons, he wrote at least three pieces {{in the manner of}} the Italian frottola, a popular Italian song form which he would have encountered during <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Milan. These songs include Scaramella, El grillo, and In te domine speravi. They are even simpler in texture than his French chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and homophonic, and they remain among the most frequently sung portions of his output.|$|E
5|$|McGinnity {{finished}} his MLB career with 246 career wins, seven 20-win seasons, and two 30-win seasons.

5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{more scientific}} items during his decade in the United States than during all <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> England: some 45 papers, not counting reprintings, and four pamphlets, not counting subsequent editions, {{but in general}} his science was now anticlimactic. Few of his papers contributed anything significantly new {{to the field of}} chemistry; most were committed to combatting the new chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Several of Josquin's masses {{feature the}} {{paraphrase}} technique, and they {{include some of}} his most famous work including the great Missa Gaudeamus. The relatively early Missa Ave maris stella, which probably dates from <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; {{it is also one of}} his shortest masses. The late Missa de Beata Virgine paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary; it is a Lady Mass, a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{final years}} of Bahá'u'lláh's life (1879–1892) were spent in the Mansion of Bahjí, just outside Acre, {{even though he was}} still {{formally}} a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Acre and Bahjí, since `Abdu'l-Bahá, his eldest son, had taken care of the organizational work, Bahá'u'lláh was able to devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, his book of laws. His other works included letters outlining his vision for a united world, as well as the need for ethical action; he also composed many prayers.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea of a {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Years later, El Hatillo's founder also {{believed}} that Santa Rosalía had protected him from an infection. During the Guipuzcoana scandal in Venezuela, Baltasar's father, Juan Francisco de León, and his sons were held prisoners in Cádiz. Juan Francisco died {{as a consequence of}} smallpox, but Don Baltasar completed <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> prison and then moved to El Hatillo. Baltasar brought the legacy of Santa Rosalía de Palermo to El Hatillo, believing she protected him from the pestilence that killed his father in Cádiz.|$|E

5|$|At the 1920 elections, {{domestic}} interests aligned {{against those}} of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, gives him {{the credit for the}} victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with a clear vision, principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC.|$|E
5|$|Bok {{has testified}} before the United States Senate and met with George W. Bush, Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice, telling them his story of slavery.

Francis now lives in the U.S. state of Kansas, where he works for the American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) and Sudan Sunrise, an organization that works for peace in Sudan. Bok's autobiography, Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America, published by St. Martin's Press, chronicles his life, from his early youth, <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> captivity, to {{his work in the}} United States as an abolitionist.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>his</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} {{as president}} in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of}} the potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
