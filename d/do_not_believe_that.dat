5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|The {{lives of}} Elves only endure {{as the world}} endures. It is said in the Second Prophecy of Mandos {{that at the end}} of time the Elves will join the other Children of Ilúvatar in singing the Second Music of the Ainur. However it is disputable whether the Prophecy is canon, and the {{published}} Silmarillion states that only Men shall participate for certain in the Second Music, and that the ultimate fate of the Elves is unknown. However, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Eru will abandon them to oblivion.|$|E

5000|$|According to Iōannēs Polemēs, the {{important}} Orthodox theologian Gregory Palamas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sinners would experience the divine light: [...] "Unlike Theophanes, Palamas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sinners {{could have an}} experience of the divine light ... Nowhere in his works does Palamas seem to adopt Theophanes' view that the light of Tabor is identical with the fire of hell." ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the police}} station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Hank, an {{upstanding}} {{member of the}} community, {{would be capable of}} such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{introduces}} his illegitimate son, Donald (Michael Benjamin Washington), to the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff. Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{suspect that}} Donald is embezzling from Tracy as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Donald is twenty-one years old, which Donald claims to be. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate {{and gives it}} to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy knew all about Donald's scam, explaining {{he decided to go}} along with it because Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing good for the community.|$|E
5|$|Ælfric {{was the son}} of an earl of Kent {{and became}} a monk of Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was very likely Abbot of Abingdon before {{becoming}} Abbot of St Albans Abbey around 975, although some historians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he held the office of Abbot at Abingdon. Although the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, or History of the Church of Abingdon, names Ælfric as abbot, the abbatial lists do not record him as such. Indirect corroboration of his being abbot at Abingdon is a grant of land to Ælfric personally (instead of to the office he held) while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from Abingdon. This land was to revert to Abingdon after Ælfric's death.|$|E

5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, {{there is still a}} significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Prince Iziaslav Yaroslavych, whose Christian {{name was}} Demetrius, first built the Saint Demetrius's Monastery and Church in the Uppertown of Kiev near Saint Sophia Cathedral in the 1050s. Half a century later, his son, Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych, is recorded as commissioning a monastery church (1108–1113) dedicated {{to his own}} patron saint, Michael the Archangel. One reason for building the church may have been Svyatopolk's recent victory over the nomadic Polovtsians, as Michael the Archangel was considered a patron of warriors and victories. In 1906, a medieval hoard of silver and gold jewellery was discovered in a metal casket on Trekhsvyatytelska Street (Street of the Three Saints), opposite the gates of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. Gold jewellery from the hoard {{is now in the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York while the silver jewellery and two ingots are in the British Museum, London. The hoard is dated to the 11th-12th centuries and was probably hidden {{at the time of the}} Tartar invasions and the Sack of Kiev in 1240.|$|E

25|$|Although {{scientists}} favor biological {{models for}} the cause of sexual orientation, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is the result of any one factor. They generally believe that it is determined by biological and environmental factors; they state that most people's sexual orientation is determined at an early age, and sexual orientation development involves a complex interplay between nature and nurture. The biological factors are genetic and hormonal, both of which affect the fetal development of the brain, while environmental factors may be sociological, psychological, or involve the early uterine environment. Scientists generally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> sexual orientation is a matter of choice.|$|E
