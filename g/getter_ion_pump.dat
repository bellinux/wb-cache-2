40|$|The {{electron}} {{storage ring}} Euterpe under construction at the Eindhoven University {{is a low}} budget project with a 400 MeV/ 200 mA electron beam. The bending magnets have a gap of 25 mm. A vacuum of 400 l/s is required. Such a value can hardly be obtained by means of external pumps as it {{is limited by the}} molecular conductance of these vessels. This problem is solved by a design in which the synchrotron radiation escapes from the dipole into a large pumping chamber. This will be equipped with integrated titanium sublimation pumps, giving rise to a high pumping speed. An external <b>getter</b> <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> of 60 l/s provides for the pumping of methane. The dipoles magnets will be mounted on a very accurate slide system which locks the dipole position. This allows in-situ bake-out of the ring. ...|$|E

Momentum transfer pumps, also called molecular pumps, use high speed jets of dense fluid or high speed rotating blades to knock gas molecules out of the chamber.

Three {{different versions of the}} vacuum chamber have been developed with vertical apertures of 12 mm, 8 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. The chambers are fabricated by extruding 6063 aluminum alloy to form a tube with the desired internal shaped and machining the exterior to finish dimensions. The wall thickness of the completed chamber at the beam orbit position is 1 mm. The design utilizes a rigid strongback that limits deflection of the chamber under vacuum despite the thin wall.

40|$|Many accelerators of {{electron}} beams {{are susceptible}} to per-sistent beam lifetime disruptions, with correspondingly re-duced performance. One distinguishes between three pre-vailing explanations of these disruptions: (1) trapping of positive atomic ions in the negatively charged beam; (2) trapping of small highly positively ionised micro-objects (“dust”) in the negatively charged beam; (3) disruptions due to stray magnetic objects trapped in the magnetic field of undulators. The lifetime disruption of certain electron storage rings that employ ion-getter pump systems are attributed by most researchers to explanation (2), the trapped dust hypothe-sis. Systematic experimental studies of HERA, PETRA and DORIS reinforce the suspicion that specifically this type of pump system is the culprit. Examples of beam lifetime disruptions are presented, to-gether with a summary of observations and experiments performed at various afflicted storage rings to investigate dust trapping and the connection between <b>ion</b> <b>getter</b> <b>pumps</b> and dust particle release.

40|$|MARIA, {{belonging}} to JCNS at MLZ in Garching, is a dedicated versatile instrument for polarised neutron reflectometry (PNR) and grazing incidence small angle neutron scattering (GISANS) studies of ultra-thin films. However, due to limited space a UHV system for thin film growth and in-situ measurements cannot be placed on-site. Hence, {{up to now}} ultra thin films which are sensitive to ambient air have been fabricated in the MBE system located in the thin film laboratory nearby and were covered by protecting cap layers in-situ. However these layers may change the physical properties of the sample, which is undesirable and prevents from further manipulation of the sample, e. g. growth of additional layers. Recently, we have solved this problem by developing a handy mini UHV-chamber which is capable for both, sample transfer and quasi in-situ measurements at the neutron reflectivity instrument, respectively. Quasi in-situ polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) measurements can be performed at room temperature in magnetic fields of up to 600 mT at MARIA. Our solution consists of a DN CF- 40 cube with two opposing sapphire windows for the neutron beam, a combined non evaporable <b>getter</b> and <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> for keeping the vacuum, a wobble stick, which is needed for in-situ sample transfer and also serves as sample holder for samples of up to 1 cm 2 and a valve for sample exchange by mounting the chamber on the MBE system.

We present first polarized neutron reflectivity measurements on Co ultra-thin films at room temperature at different magnetic fields in the Q-range up to 0. 2 Å− 1.

40|$|Silver is an {{important}} catalyst for the epoxidation of ethylene {{and the production of}} formaldehyd from methanol. It is not yet known with certainty which form of adsorbed oxygen on silver is the catalytically active one. Therefore we have started to study the adsorption of oxygen on silver films by Raman spectroscopy. From previous investigations, especially from UPS work / 1 /, we know that at low exposures of ground state molecular oxygen, oxygen sticks on evaporated silver films only at defect sites. These defect sites are abundant on films which are deposited in UHV on substrates cooled to 120 K. Raman spectra of these oxygen exposed films display vibrational lines at 1053 cm- 1 and 697 cm- 1, which we assign to superoxidic and peroxidic dioxygen. We are able to follow the dissociation of these dioxygen species to adsorbed oxygen atoms during warming up of the films by multichannel Raman spectroscopy. Exposing the coldly deposited silver films to oxygen with the <b>ion</b> <b>getter</b> <b>pump</b> running leads to additional Raman lines at 815 cm- 1 and 1286 cm- 1. Investigations with 18 O 2 show that the responsible adsorbate is composed of or at least comprises oxygen.

The described work resulted from two initial objectives: improvement of the control system of vacuum sectors {{and the development of}} a new Pro bus-DP intelligent slave interface board for sputter <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> controllers. Since the objectives were distinct, the work was split into two di erent projects. In the rst project, the control system for vacuum sectors of Large Hadron Collider, Super Proton Synchrotron and Complex Proton Synchrotron was improved. A new control rmware based in VHDL was developed, tested and upgraded for the control cards. The second project presented in this report involved the development of an electronic card for sputter <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> controllers. Currently, the communication between the Pro bus network and the <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> controllers is performed by a remote input-output station based on the ET 200 module from Siemens. The operation and status information of the <b>ion</b> <b>pumps</b> and their controllers provided to the network are limited since the remote input-output station does not acquire all the available signals. Moreover, the physical connections between the remote input-output station and each <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> controller is done with a dedicated cable, which is prone to connection malfunctions.

However, the mechanism of action is not completely understood in most cases, and even remains largely unknown in other cases. In the present review we discuss the most recent insights into the interaction between mono- and polyoxometalate <b>ions</b> with <b>ion</b> <b>pumps,</b> with a particular focus on the interaction of decavanadate with Ca 2 +- ATPase. We also compare the proposed mode of action with those of established <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitors which are currently in therapeutic use. Of the 18 classes of compounds which are known to act as <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitors, the complete mechanism of inhibition is only known for a handful. It has, however, been established that most <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitors bind mainly to the E 2 <b>ion</b> <b>pump</b> conformation within the membrane domain from the extracellular side and block the cation release. Polyoxometalates such as decavanadate, in contrast, interact with Ca 2 +- ATPase near the nucleotide binding site domain or at a pocket involving several cytoplasmic domains, and therefore needs to cross through the membrane bilayer. In contrast to monomeric vanadate, which only binds to the E 2 conformation, decavanadate binds to all protein conformations, i. e. E 1, E 1 P, E 2 and E 2 P. Moreover, the specific interaction of decavanadate with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +- ATPase has been shown to be non-competitive with respect to ATP and induces protein cysteine oxidation with concomitant vanadium reduction which might explain the high inhibitory capacity of V 10, (IC 50 = 15 µM) which is quite similar to the majority of the established therapeutic drugs...|$|R
