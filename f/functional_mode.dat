5000|$|Also in {{the early}} 2000s <b>functional</b> failure <b>mode</b> {{analysis}} {{was added to the}} FMEDA process by John C. Grebe. In early FMEDA work, component failure modes were mapped directly to [...] "safe" [...] or [...] "dangerous" [...] categories per IEC 61508. This was relatively easy since everything that was not [...] "dangerous" [...] was [...] "safe." [...] With multiple failure mode categories now existing, direct assignment became more difficult. In addition, {{it became clear that the}} category assignment might change if a product were used in different applications. With direct failure mode category assignment during the FMEDA, a new FMEDA was required for each new application or each variation in usage. Under the <b>functional</b> failure <b>mode</b> approach, the actual <b>functional</b> failure <b>modes</b> of the product are identified during an FMEA. During the detailed FMEDA, each component failure mode is mapped to a <b>functional</b> failure <b>mode.</b> The <b>functional</b> failure <b>modes</b> are then categorized according to product failure mode in a particular application. This eliminates the need for more detailed work when a new application is considered.|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} complex motor, perceptual, and {{cognitive}} behaviors {{are composed of}} smaller units, which are somehow brought into a meaningful relation, permeates the biological and life sciences. However, no principled framework defining the constituent elementary processes has been developed to this date. Consequently, functional configurations (or architectures) relating elementary processes and external influences are mostly piecemeal formulations suitable to particular instances only. Here, we develop a general dynamical framework for distinct functional architectures characterized by the time-scale separation of their constituents and evaluate their efficiency. Thereto, we build on the (phase) flow of a system, which prescribes the temporal evolution of its state variables. The phase flow topology allows for the unambiguous classification of qualitatively distinct processes, which we consider to represent the <b>functional</b> units or <b>modes</b> within the dynamical architecture. Using {{the example of a}} composite movement we illustrate how different architectures can be characterized by their degree of time scale separation between the internal elements of the architecture (i. e. the <b>functional</b> <b>modes)</b> and external interventions. We reveal a tradeoff of the interactions between internal and external influences, which offers a theoretical justification for the efficient composition of complex processes out of non-trivial elementary processes or <b>functional</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to being useful for manufacturing [...] "go/no go" [...] testing, scan chains {{can also be used}} to [...] "debug" [...] chip designs. In this context, the chip is exercised in normal [...] "functional mode" [...] (for example, a computer or mobile-phone chip might execute assembly language instructions). At any time, the chip clock can be stopped, and the chip re-configured into [...] "test mode". At this point the full internal state can be dumped out, or set to any desired values, by use of the scan chains. Another use of scan to aid debug consists of scanning in an initial state to all memory elements and then go back to <b>functional</b> <b>mode</b> to perform system debug. The advantage is to bring the system to a known state without going through many clock cycles. This use of scan chains, along with the clock control circuits are a related sub-discipline of logic design called [...] "Design for Debug" [...] or [...] "Design for Debuggability".|$|E

40|$|On real {{processes}} many junctional {{states are}} usually observed. However {{some of them}} may represent different significant levels (or rates) of the same functional node. They do not represent by themselves a <b>functional</b> <b>mode,</b> they are only sub-modes of the same <b>functional</b> <b>mode</b> (e. g. one of the <b>functional</b> <b>mode</b> of my car is tank empty; some functional states observed may be 10 % empty tank, 50 % empty tank, 96 % empty tank). Thus the interest is not only to diagnose the <b>functional</b> <b>mode</b> (e. g. tank empty, sleeping driver) but also to highlight the gravity level of this <b>functional</b> <b>mode</b> (e. g. the reaction in the middle of desert, confronted to a 4 % empty tank {{is not the same as}} confronted to a 98 % empty tank). The aim of this paper is to present a diagnosis method based on fuzzy pattern recognition. Such a method allows the diagnosis of the current <b>functional</b> <b>mode</b> of a process and its gravity level. Usually in pattern recognition area, a membership function is a monotonic decreasing function of a Euclidean distance between two objects. Those objects represent two states of the process and a distance here is a dissimilarity measure between those states. Such a distance is defined in all the fuzzy subset associated with this membership function. So that function is monotonic decreasing in all subset directions. In this paper directional membership functions are proposed. In this case the distance is defined only by reference to a path describing the evolution from one functional state to another one. Then the obtained membership function is oriented according to this path and do not decrease identically within all directions in the subset. Such membership functions are then suitable in order to diagnose the state associated with data evoluting between known functional modes. An application to the French telephone network illustrates this method...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} {{that it is possible}} to observe spontaneous, highly structured fluctuations in human brain activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data when the subject is 'at rest'. This activity can be decomposed into groups of spatially distributed brain regions that are consistently temporally co- activated, and this thesis is concerned with developing new methods to identify these <b>functional</b> <b>modes.</b> We introduce a probabilistic model that allows us to infer <b>functional</b> <b>modes</b> without making restrictive assumptions about the spatio-temporal interactions between them, and furthermore, the model also accounts for the variability of these modes over subjects. Both of these facets of the model represent advances compared to current mode-identification techniques. We use a computationally efficient variational Bayesian approach to make inferences from this model, and this allows us to draw upon the enormous amount of information available from the types of large-scale fMRI data collection initiatives that are becoming the norm. We demonstrate, using data from over 450 subjects collected as part of the Human Connectome Project, that we can reliably infer a set of modes that captures an enormous degree of spatial variability over subjects and that makes a novel set of predictions about the temporal relationships that modes have with one another. Finally, we highlight the importance of functional registration and bring to light a surprising link between temporal non-stationarities and the fMRI global signal. </p...|$|R
