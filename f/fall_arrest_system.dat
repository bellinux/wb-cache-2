50|$|In the {{occupational}} setting, falling incidents are {{commonly referred to}} as slips, trips, and falls (STFs). Falls from elevation hazards are present at almost every jobsite, and many workers are exposed to these hazards daily. As such, falls are an important topic for occupational safety and health services. Any walking/working surface could be a potential fall hazard. An unprotected side or edge which is 6 ft or more above a lower level should be protected from falling by the use of a guard rail system, safety net system, or personal <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system.</b> These hazardous exposures exist in many forms, and can be as seemingly innocuous as changing a light bulb from a step ladder to something as high-risk as installing bolts on high steel at 200 ft in the air. In 2000, 717 workers died of injuries caused by falls from ladders, scaffolds, buildings, or other elevations. More recent data in 2011, found that STFs contributed to 14% of all workplace fatalities in the United States that year.|$|E
40|$|On April 19, 2012, a 37 -year-old Hispanic male laborer fell {{approximately}} 13. 5 {{feet from}} a residential roof to a concrete driveway; he died immediately from his injuries. The laborer {{was working with}} a crew of eight Hispanic workers for a construction subcontractor replacing shingles on a roof accessed by a ladder. At {{the time of the}} incident, five workers were on the roof, including the laborer who was out of sight of his coworkers working on the garage side of the home. When the incident occurred, the co-workers heard the laborer hit the ground, rushed to his aid, and called 911. Emergency Medical Services were dispatched to the incident and the laborer was pronounced dead at the scene. Key contributing factors identified in this investigation include: 1. 13 -foot plus fall distance and concrete surface; 2. 10 / 12 roof pitch; 3. 25 -foot working length of <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system</b> lifeline; 4. <b>Fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system</b> lanyard connection point; 5. <b>Fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system</b> anchorage method; 6.

Ensure that all employees working at heights are provided with fall prevention training that complies with OSHA standards, in a language and at a literacy level that they can comprehend; 3. Ensure that all employees are provided with properly assembled and maintained fall protection systems when exposed to fall hazards; 4. Assign a competent person to inspect the worksite before work begins to identify fall hazards, determine the appropriate fall prevention systems for workers, and ensure that personal fall arrest systems (PFAS) are installed properly.

40|$|Unprotected {{falls from}} {{elevation}} usually result in serious debilitating injury or death. Falls {{can be prevented}} {{through the use of}} proper prevention and arrest systems. All work from elevated work surfaces will be accomplished without any risk of falling to a lower level. This goal is achieved by adhering to the following fall protection hierarchy: 1. Remove the hazard: avoid working at heights. Bring the work down to the ground level whenever possible. 2. If work at heights is unavoidable, secure the elevated work area with a passive fall prevention barrier system, such as guardrails. 3. When a barrier system is not feasible because of the physical characteristics of the work environment or the infrequency of access, use an approved fall restraint system. 4.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the roof}} {{contracting}} industry, safety violations continuously lead to fall injuries and fatalities. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) suggests standard protective measures, {{but they are}} often not followed due to factors such as tight budget and lack of training. To alleviate this situation, we propose to develop a system that can automatically check the compliance of fall protection standards through machine vision and learning techniques to exploit day-to-day site images collected by the surveillance videos and site engineers. As an initial effort, this paper focuses on evaluation of an unsupervised feature learning and image classification method i. e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect objects of interest (roofs, roofers, guardrails, and personal <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>systems)</b> in {{a large number of}} unordered and cluttered construction site images. To isolate different objects, we initially segment each image using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and pass the resulting segments as input into CNN. This enhances the feature distinction between different objects and augments the inter-class variability. Then, we extract large feature sets in a hierarchical manner and classify images based on the acquired object features. Experiments results signify the promising performance of the CNN method in terms of accuracy. This research demonstrates potential of this method and paves the way towards applying it in the next research development required to achieve our ultimate goal...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} arresting a {{fall from a height}} by {{protective}} equipment is characterised by {{two most important}} values: the arrest force and the distance over which the fall arrest oc-curs. The time course of these values is determined primarily by the mechanical parameters of the connecting and shock-absorbing components of the <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system,</b> such as textile energy absorbers, retractable type fall arresters and guided type fall arresters. The paper presents the methods of testing used up till now to determine the properties of connect-ing and shock-absorbing components. Their disadvantages are demonstrated and a new method allowing to determine the load-elongation characteristics of connecting and shock-absorbing components containing textile elements is described. The method presented and test stand are based on simultaneous measurements of the force acting in the object inves-tigated and its elongation. For measurements of elongation under dynamic conditions, an extensometer equipped with a high speed camera was used. The results of tests performed under static and dynamic conditions on objects made of fibre rope and webbing used in equipment protecting against falls from a height are presented.

40|$|This {{cooperative}} research work {{is concerned with}} the development of fall arrest equipment constructed from textile materials for use in mountaineering, caving and industrial safety applications. The range of webbings available for use in fall arrest equipment is examined, and some basic experiments to determine the effect of severe abrasion are described. The methods of stitching slings (loops of webbing) are examined, and the effects of external abrasion on conventional lap joints and bartacked joints are compared. The development of harnesses is examined and the factors affecting their future design are considered. The major part of the work {{is concerned with the}} way in which the energy of a falling body is absorbed in a <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system</b> and with the peak impact loads imposed on the system's components. To measure these loads, apparatus was developed at the cooperating company's premises, together with appropriate instrumentation. A series of tests were carried out to determine loads in falls of increasing severity. The ensuing development work concerned textile shock absorbers, which are designed to limit the impact force in a fall to a predetermined maximum. Using the drop test apparatus, it was shown that such shock absorbers have very little practical effect in a climbing situation. However, the principles embodied in these devices were used to develop an industrial safety lanyard with an integral shock absorber which conforms to British Standard 1397. This device is lighter and more compact than others currently on the market and represents a step forward in the field. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFundamental {{safety measure}} for falling {{is to prepare}} flat and {{effective}} wide workplace with guardrails. However, their countermeasures {{may be difficult to}} apply for short-duration works and disaster relief works. In such cases, the <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system</b> has been applied to the height workplaces. This study focuses on fundamental characteristics of full body harness in various postures of wearer during falling. Three kinds of situation, such as (1) leg first fall, (2) head first fall, and (3) stop falling when the wearer body in parallel to the ground, were considered to recognize the performance. Experiments were carried out using 735 N of human dummy, called HybridIII pedestrian 50 %tile model in the automobile industry. The shock-absorber of the Lanyards used in this study were designed about 4 kN. Impact force acting on hook, head accelerations, and a chest displacement were measured during falling. From the results, not only the vertical acceleration of the human dummy but also horizontal were measured. Due to the horizontal acceleration, a huge bending moment acting on the dummy's neck observed in several situations. It indicates that the wearer may have risks of whiplash or more serious injuries such as dislocation of cervical vertebrae or spinal injuries. Chest deformations measured in this study were not also small for aged workers. It indicates that there are some risks of rid fractures or related chest injuries. The back of the head crashed aggressively to the D-ring of the full harness when the dummy rebounded due to stop falling by lanyard. Therefore, special helmet to resist the impact force due to D-ring, and the design force of shock-absorber should be reconsidered...|$|E

40|$|Thesis Chair, Dr. Sang D. Choi. This file {{was last}} viewed in Adobe Reader 7. 0 Construction {{is one of}} most {{dangerous}} industries in the United States. One of the most hazardous areas within the construction industry is roofing. Concern for safety in roofing construction has continued to spread, {{as a result of}} falls that make up the greatest rate of fatalities in the construction industry. Previous research has found that falls {{have been one of the}} leading categories under type of occupational death and that fall protection systems are not consistently used to prevent fall accidents in the roofing industry. Research is needed in order to analyze falls and other potential hazards in roofing. The main goal for this study is to analyze commercial and residential roofers’ behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs on the fall protection systems. A survey was distributed to commercial and residential roofers in the Midwest. Information collected from roofers was compared and analyzed to find differences between residential and commercial roofers. A total of 129 roofing contractors participated in this study. The results of the survey showed that while most of commercial roofers did use fall protection devices, a significant number of residential roofers did not comply with fall protection regulations and guidelines. Two main reasons of noncompliance with fall protection regulations and guidelines in roofing construction were found: (1) fall protection devices decrease productivity; (2) fall protection equipment makes roofers uncomfortable. Results from this study revealed that personal <b>fall</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>system</b> (PFAS) was the most prevalent fall protection device used among residential and commercial roofers. PFAS was also the most preferred fall protection equipment among the two groups of roofers. For both residential and commercial roofing, there is a significant (p = 0. 05 and p = 0. 01) negative relationship between enforcing roofers to wear or install fall protection devices and having falls from roofs. In both residential and commercial roofing, there is a very significant (p= 0. 001 and p = 0. 001) positive relationship between the enforcement and the actual usage of fall protection equipment. This thesis presents the results of the investigation of fall protection systems in roofing construction and recommendations that ultimately would reduce fall accidents...|$|E
