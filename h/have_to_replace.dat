5|$|Operation {{proved to}} give several major difficulties, and by March 2001, Oslo Sporveier was {{threatening}} to terminate the purchase agreement unless the manufacturer—who by then had merged to become AnsaldoBreda—fixed the problems. These included the noise being 15dB too loud, and trams being out of service during the January–February cold spell, when batteries and rectifiers would not operate. It was agreed that AnsaldoBreda would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> all 256 motors to satisfy the criteria in the contract. By 1 June, AnsaldoBreda had delivered one tram that met all the contract's criteria. Tram 155 was by then still undelivered, and was being used for testing by the manufacturer. At the same time, 149 was being used for tests in Oslo. The trams were taken out of service, and gradually put back as they were upgraded. In February 2002, tram 155 was equipped with new motors, and a new agreement was made where all motors would be replaced by December 2003, if Oslo Sporveier was satisfied with six months of trials with 155.|$|E

While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).|$|E

25|$|LZB is {{deprecated}} and to {{be replaced}} with European Train Control System (ETCS). It is referenced by European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) as a Class B train protection system in National Train Control (NTC). Driving cars mostly <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> classical control logic to ETCS Onboard Units (OBU) with common Driver Machine Interface (DMI). Because high performance trains are often not scrapped ore reused on second order lines, special Specific Transmission Modules (STM) for LZB were developed for further support of LZB installation.|$|E
25|$|Gladstone altered his {{approach}} to religious problems, which always held first place in his mind. Before entering Parliament he had already substituted a high church Anglican attitude, with its dependence on authority and tradition, for the evangelical outlook of his boyhood, with its reliance upon the direct inspiration of the Bible. In middle life he decided that the individual conscience would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> authority as the inner citadel of the Church. That view of the individual conscience affected his political outlook and changed him gradually from a Conservative into a Liberal.|$|E
25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, {{so they have to}} make the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking a chair in the final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor is to sit at a smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while making the decisions, while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E

2500|$|The Nazis {{disliked the}} Catholic and Protestant churches. They wanted to {{transform}} the subjective consciousness of the German people—their attitudes, values and mentalities—into a single-minded, obedient [...] "national community". Kershaw wrote that they believed they would therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> class, religious and regional allegiances by a [...] "massively enhanced national self-awareness to mobilize the German people psychologically" [...] for the coming struggle and war. Gill wrote that their long term plan was to [...] "de-Christianise Germany after the final victory".|$|E
2500|$|Nazism {{aimed to}} {{transform}} the subjective consciousness of the German people—their attitudes, values and mentalities—into a single-minded, obedient [...] "national community". The Nazis believed they would therefore <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> class, religious and regional allegiances. [...] Under the Gleichschaltung process, Hitler attempted to create a unified Protestant Reich Church from Germany's 28 existing Protestant churches. The plan failed, and was resisted by the Confessing Church. Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler moved quickly to eliminate political catholicism. Amid harassment of the Church, the Reich concordat treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, and promised to respect Church autonomy. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns, and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years.|$|E

2500|$|Adjacent to Studio B was a {{reverberation}} room containing a plate reverb device made by EMT, German makers of similar effects units installed in other recording studios around the world. The EMT reverb was an electro-mechanical echo chamber used to add artificial reverberation effects to recordings. Porter {{arranged to have}} the dedicated echo room cooled down {{as much as possible}} with an air conditioner, and he adjusted the ten springs on the EMT plate to be tighter than usual, in order to feed the plate more audio signal and get a cleaner sound returning from the device. So much signal was being sent to the plate that Porter disconnected the associated VU meter so {{that he would not be}} bothered with its needle slamming against its peg. Porter related that the EMT's springs frequently broke under the increased tension, and he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> them, but that the trouble was worth achieving a [...] "brighter and fuller" [...] echo effect.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{signed the}} {{pre-contract}} with Real Madrid, McManaman still had five months {{left on his}} contract at Liverpool. New manager Gérard Houllier, who had replaced Evans as full coach following the failure of their joint-managerial role, was widely believed to {{want to get rid}} of the [...] "Spice Boys" [...] mentality and cavalier attitudes at the club having told many players they were surplus to requirements (including Jason McAteer, Phil Babb, Rob Jones, Stig Bjornebye and Paul Ince). While stating that he would have preferred that the player stayed, he said that the club had to respect McManaman's decision to exercise his right to leave at the end of his contract. Houllier said, [...] "It wasn't unexpected. Steve had always maintained that he wanted to move abroad and I have to respect that... Emotionally we will miss him because he's a Liverpool lad, and needless to say as a player you can't fault him because he has immense ability... I will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> him, it's my job to go out and find another Steve McManaman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mortaza {{continued}} to struggle for {{form in the}} 2010 Asia Cup, held in June, taking just two wickets in three matches {{at an average of}} 77.00. The coach, Jamie Siddons, commented that [...] "He's going to have to improve a lot on his current form. Unfortunately there's no ready replacement for Mashrafe at the moment, we're hoping his experience will pull him through. We'll keep looking for others and if Mash can't stand up we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> him." [...] Siddons also noted that since his comeback in 2010, Mortaza's bowling has not been as fast as it used to be. In the one-day leg of the return tour in England in July 2010, Mortaza regain the captaincy of the ODI side. He took over from Shakib Al Hasan who had stepped down after a dip in form. In the second ODI Bangladesh ended their 24-match losing streak; Mortaza led his country to their first victory over England in any form of cricket. However, Bangladesh were unable to seal a series victory and lost 2–1. Mortaza finished as joint-lead wicket-taker for the series with five wickets, equal with England's Ajmal Shahzad. Later the same month, Bangladesh played two ODIs against Ireland, and one against the Netherlands; the team managed only one victory against Ireland. Analysing Bangladesh's performance on the tour, Mortaza noted his concern about the effectiveness of the team's bowling.|$|E

Mind you, I am perfectly clear where I am. Where we are. What is happening to us all is the breakup of the entire system. Agreed! We have to make another system or perish amidst the wreckage. I see that clearly. Science and plan <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> custom and tradition in human affairs. Soon. Very soon. Granted. Granted. We used to say all that. Even before the war. Now we mean it. We've muddled about in the old ways overlong. Some new sort of world, planned and scientific, has to be got going. Civilization renewed. Rebuilding civilization--while the premises are still occupied and busy. It's an immense enterprise, but it is the only thing to be done. In some ways it's an enormously attractive enterprise. Inspiring. It grips my imagination. I think of the other men who must be at work. Working as I do rather in the dark as yet. With whom I shall presently join up... The attempt may fail; all things human may fail; {{but on the other hand}} it may succeed. I never had such faith in anything as I have in the rightness of the work I am doing now. I begin at that. But here is where my difficulty comes in. The top of my brain, my innermost self says all that I have been saying, but--The rest of me won't follow. The rest of me refuses to attend, forgets, straggles, misbehaves." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the world}} as we have been imagining fit, {{economic}} fear and most economic hope will be alike removed out of life. No one will be haunted by the dread of poverty or driven into ruthlessness by the hope of wealth. There will not be the distinction of social classes which now plays such an immense part in life. The unsuccessful professional man will not live in terror lest his children should sink in the scale; the aspiring employe will not be looking forward to the day when he can become a sweater in his turn. Ambitious young men will have to dream other daydreams than that of business success and wealth wrung out of the ruin of competitors and the degradation of labor. In such a world, most of the nightmares that lurk in the background of men's minds will no longer exist; on the other hand, ambition and the desire to excel will have to take nobler forms than those that are encouraged by a commercial society. All those activities that really confer benefits upon mankind will be open, not only to the fortunate few, but to all who have sufficient ambition and native aptitude. Science, labor-saving inventions, technical progress of all kinds, may be confidently expected to flourish far more than at present, since they will be the road to honor, and honor will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> money among those of the young who desire to achieve success. Whether art will flourish in a Socialistic community depends upon the form of Social- ism adopted; if the State, or any public authority, (no matter what), insists upon controlling art, and only licensing those whom it regards as proficient, the result will be disaster. But if there is real freedom, allowing every man who so desires to take up an artist's career at the cost of some sacrifice of comfort, {{it is likely that the}} atmosphere of hope, and the absence of economic compulsion, will lead to a much smaller waste of talent than is involved in our present system, and to a much less degree of crushing of impulse in the mills of the struggle for life.|$|E
