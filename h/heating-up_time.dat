40|$|A novel {{integrated}} microsystem {{consisting of}} a heater, microchannels and distributed temperature sensors was successfully fabricated. The transient temperature behavior of the device was experimentally studied {{for a variety of}} power dissipation levels and forced convection flow rates, where DI water was used as the working fluid. Both heating-up and cooling-down time constants were determined for a pulsed current input. The device frequency response to a sinusoidal input voltage, with the device operating either in a single or in a two-phase mode, was characterized. The dependence of the resulting temperature average and amplitude on the input signal was studied for a variety of cycle conditions. It was found that, contrary to expectations, the <b>heating-up</b> <b>time</b> constant was larger than the cooling-down time constant. Furthermore, the periodic temperature field stabilized the system to avoid the occurrence of the dryout phenomenon. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The soda pulping {{modified}} by green liquor pretreatment was adopted to explore optimal green liquor pretreatment conditions. Results shows that optimum pretreatment conditions are as follows: max temperature, 130 °C; holding time, 90 min; wood to liquor ratio, 1 : 4; and green liquor charge, 0. 9 L/kg. Pretreated reed was pulped under following conditions: <b>heating-up</b> <b>time,</b> 60 min; maximum temperature, 160 °C; holding time, 60 min; NaOH charge, 20 % (pretreatment alkali included). Results {{shows that this}} process produces pulp with screened yield of 49. 05 %, Kappa number of 14. 6, and viscosity of 1274 mL/g. Compared {{with the results of}} industrial simulation pulping (21 % NaOH), screened yield increases by 2. 14 %, Kappa number decreases by 5. 6 and viscosity rises by 556 mL/g. Therefore, green liquor pretreatment before soda pulping improves pulp performance and yield. Meanwhile the pretreatment utilizes material effectively, thus has practical significance to decrease alkaline consumption and pulping cost...|$|E
30|$|SiC {{nanowires}} {{have been}} synthesized at 1, 600 °C {{by using a}} simple and low-cost method in a high-frequency induction furnace. The commercial SiO powder and the arc-discharge plasma pretreated carbon black were mixed and used as the source materials. The <b>heating-up</b> and reaction <b>time</b> {{is less than half}} an hour. It was found that most of the nanowires have core-shell SiC/SiO 2 nanostructures. The nucleation, precipitation, and growth processes were discussed in terms of the oxide-assisted cluster-solid mechanism.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a novel method to {{fabricate}} β-SiC nanowires {{by using a}} high-frequency induction furnace with a graphite tube. A mixture of commercial SiO and the carbon black powder with loose structures pretreated by an arc-discharge plasma method {{was used as the}} starting materials. After heating the source materials in graphite tube in argon atmosphere, bright blue powders can be observed in the tube, which were characterized as β-SiC nanowires with core-shell structures. The total <b>heating-up</b> and reaction <b>time</b> is less than 1 h, and more than 200 g products can obtain per day. The modified oxide-assisted cluster-solid growth mechanism was used to explain the formation of core-shell SiC/SiO 2 nanowires.|$|R
40|$|The natural {{convection}} thermal boundary layer adjacent to an inclined flat plate and inclined walls of an attic space subject to instantaneous and ramp {{heating and cooling}} is investigated. A scaling analysis has been performed to describe the flow behaviour and heat transfer. Major scales quantifying the flow velocity, flow development time, heat transfer and the thermal and viscous boundary layer thicknesses {{at different stages of}} the flow development are established. Scaling relations of <b>heating-up</b> and cooling-down <b>times</b> and heat transfer rates have also been reported for the case of attic space. The scaling relations have been verified by numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. Further, a periodic temperature boundary condition is also considered to show the flow features in the attic space over diurnal cycles...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{integrated}} thermal microsystem {{was designed}} and fabricated with a heater microchannels and distributed temperature sensors. This device allows, for the first time, an experimental study of the transient behavior of a thermal microsystem. The transient temperature behavior of the device was studied {{for a variety of}} heater power levels and forced convection flow rates, where DI water was used as the working fluid. Both hearing-up rise time and cooling-down fall rime due to a step current input were determined for natural and forced convection heat transfer. The transient temperature response to a sinusoidal power input was also investigated. The resulting temperature distribution was measured {{as a function of the}} input signal and the how rate. The step response under natural convection is exponential for both heating and cooling processes. However, under forced convection, the <b>heating-up</b> <b>time</b> response exhibits a clear overshoot. The response time for both heating and cooling process is about four times faster than that for the natural convection case. Furthermore, under certain conditions, the periodic temperature: response can exhibit a large peak-peak temperature without the occurrence of dry-out phenomenon...|$|E
