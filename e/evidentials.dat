40|$|Extract] Evidentiality is a {{grammatical}} category with {{source of}} information as its primary meaning- whether the speaker saw the event happen (known as visual <b>evidential),</b> or heard it but didn't see it (non-visual <b>evidential),</b> or made an inference based on general knowledge or visual traces (assumed <b>evidential</b> and inferential <b>evidential</b> respectively), or was told about it (known as reported, secondhand, or hearsay <b>evidential).</b> Languages may distinguish just first-hand and non-first-hand information or have a special marker just for reported evidentiality. Non-first-hand <b>evidential</b> as a separate category typically covers inferential and reported meanings (but is not a subtype of either inferential or reported <b>evidential).</b> In larger <b>evidential</b> systems, first-hand or visual <b>evidential</b> may contrast with non-visual, inferred, assumed, and reported...|$|R
40|$|Since Aikhenvald 2004, evidentiality {{has been}} severed from epistemic modality. We studied the <b>evidential</b> and epistemic modal {{aspects of the}} Estonian <b>evidential</b> -vat {{experimentally}} and {{on the basis of}} a corpus study. We designed two experiments to separate the two categories. Four-, six-, and nine-year-old children were first asked to identify the source of the information provided with the morpheme. Then they performed a forced choice task guided by grammar: affirmative indicative, negative, and <b>evidential</b> sentences. Four-year-olds did not understand the <b>evidential</b> and modal -vat. Six year-olds showed an increased understanding of the <b>evidential</b> meaning but not the modal meaning or use. Nine-year-olds demonstrated full understanding of the <b>evidential</b> and an increased understanding of the epistemic modal aspect of the <b>evidential.</b> Estonian children thus develop the correct understanding of the morpheme -vat as an epistemic modal only after learning its <b>evidential</b> meaning...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the interactions with tense, modality, and mirativity, the usage of <b>evidentials</b> in some languages may also depend on the clause type, discourse structure, and/or linguistic genre.|$|E
25|$|Tariana has {{a system}} of {{obligatory}} tense-evidentiality markers, which {{take the form of}} clitics on verbs. There are four tenses: present, recent past, remote past, and future. In affirmative clauses, non-future tenses fuse with <b>evidentials</b> to designate visual, non-visual, inferred generic, inferred specific, and reported information. The inferred specific evidential is a recent innovation and has been ascribed to the influence of Tucano. It is a combination of the anterior aspect marker -nhi and non-present visual <b>evidentials</b> -ka and -na producing -nhika for recent past inferred specific and -nhina for remote past inferred specific.|$|E

40|$|Bayesians {{understand}} {{the notion of}} <b>evidential</b> support in terms of probability raising.

We investigate a number of prima facie plausible candidate logical principles for the <b>evidential</b> support relation and show which of these principles the Bayesian <b>evidential</b> support relation does and which it does not obey.

40|$|There are {{methods of}} mineral prospectivity mapping whereby, besides {{assignment}} of weights to classes {{of evidence in}} an <b>evidential</b> map, every <b>evidential</b> map is also given a weight based on expert opinion. In this regard, evaluating {{the relative importance of}} every <b>evidential</b> map derived from particular spatial data sets is a highly subjective exercise and the assignment of meaningful weights to <b>evidential</b> maps usually involves a trial-and-error procedure. In this paper, we used a prediction–area (P–A) plot and normalized density to estimate weights of every <b>evidential</b> map. The method of P–A plot is a data-driven way, rather than using expert opinion, to evaluate and weight <b>evidential</b> maps...|$|R
25|$|Mood and {{modality}} — Mood and modality includes mood, <b>evidentials,</b> event modality, and the imperative. These suffixes {{are both}} productive and obligatory. Their semantic affect is usually transparent.|$|E
25|$|For instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) {{states that}} evidentiality asserts {{evidence}} while epistemic modality evaluates evidence and that evidentiality is {{more akin to}} a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstratives mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that <b>evidentials</b> may indicate a speaker's attitude {{about the validity of}} a statement {{but this is not a}} required feature of <b>evidentials.</b> Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} is a brief survey of evidential systems found in the languages {{of the world as}} identified in Aikhenvald (2004). Some languages only have two evidential markers while others may have six or more. The system types are organized by the number of <b>evidentials</b> found in the language. For example, a two-term system (A) will have two different evidential markers; a three-term system (B) will have three different <b>evidentials.</b> The systems are further divided by the type of evidentiality that is indicated (e.g., A1, A2, A3, etc.). Languages that exemplify each type are listed in parentheses.|$|E
40|$|<b>Evidential</b> {{reasoning}} {{is now a}} leading topic in Artificial Intelligence.

This paper discusses two of the basic operations on <b>evidential</b> functions, the discount operation and the well-known orthogonal sum operation. We show that the discount operation is not commutative with the orthogonal sum operation, and derive expressions for the two operations applied to the various <b>evidential</b> function.

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine a}} contextualist thesis {{that has been}} little {{discussed}} in comparison with contextualism about knowledge, namely contextualism about <b>evidential</b> support. This seems surprising since, prima facie, <b>evidential</b> support statements seem shifty in a way parallel to knowledge ascriptions. I examine but reject the suggestion that contrastivism about <b>evidential</b> support is motivated by arguments analogous to those used to motivate contrastivism about knowledge including sceptical closure arguments, the nature of inquiry, the existence of explicitly contrastive <b>evidential</b> support statements, and the intuitive shiftiness of some binary <b>evidential</b> support statements. I end by discussing the relations between contextualism about <b>evidential</b> support, evidence and knowledge. In particular, I argue that my discussion of contrastivism about <b>evidential</b> support undermines Neta’s contextualist view about evidence, and his broader suggestion that the shiftiness of evidence statements explains the shiftiness of knowledge ascriptions.

25|$|Sensory <b>evidentials</b> {{can often}} be divided into {{different}} types. Some languages mark visual evidence differently from nonvisual evidence that is heard, smelled, or felt. The Kashaya language has a separate auditory evidential.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{different}} inferential <b>evidentials</b> {{also indicate}} epistemic modality, such as uncertainty or probability (see epistemic modality below). For example, one evidential {{may indicate that}} the information is inferred but of uncertain validity, while another indicates that the information is inferred but unlikely to be true.|$|E
25|$|<b>Evidentials</b> {{can be used}} to ‘deflect culpability’ in a statement. In his {{dissertation}} on Nanti, a Peruvian Amazonian language, Lev Michael refers to an example in which a young girl is accidentally burned, and a community member questions her mother about how it happened. Her mother uses the evidential marker ‘ka’ which translates to ‘presumably,’ to deflect responsibility for the girl’s mistake.|$|E
2500|$|In some languages, <b>evidential</b> markers {{also serve}} other purposes, such as {{indicating}} the speaker's attitude to, or belief in, the statement. Usually a direct <b>evidential</b> marker {{may serve to}} indicate that the speaker is certain about the event stated. Using an indirect <b>evidential</b> marker, such as one for hearsay or reported information, may indicate that the speaker is uncertain about the statement, or doesn't want to take responsibility for its truth. A [...] "hearsay" [...] <b>evidential</b> may then have the undertone of [...] "that's what they say; whether or not it's true is nothing I can take responsibility for". [...] In other languages, this is not the case. Therefore one should distinguish between such <b>evidential</b> markers that only mark source of knowledge, and such <b>evidential</b> markers that serve other functions, such as marking epistemic modality.|$|R
40|$|A {{theory of}} <b>evidential</b> {{probability}} is developed from two assumptions: (1) the <b>evidential</b> {{probability of a}} proposition is its probability conditional on the total evidence; (2) one's total evidence is one's total knowledge. <b>Evidential</b> probability is distinguished from both subjective and objective probability. Loss as well as gain of evidence is permitted. <b>Evidential</b> probability is embedded within epistemic logic by means of possible worlds semantics for modal logic; this allows a natural theory of higher-order probability to be developed. In particular, it is emphasized that it is sometimes uncertain which propositions are part of one's total evidence; some surprising implications of this fact are drawn out. 1 <b>Evidential</b> probabilit...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} {{knowledge}} can vary in that knowledge of important facts is {{more valuable than}} knowledge of trivialities. This variation {{in the value of}} knowledge is mirrored by a variation in <b>evidential</b> standards. Matters of greater importance require greater <b>evidential</b> support. But all knowledge, however trivial, needs to be evidentially certain. So on one hand we have a variable <b>evidential</b> standard that depends on the value of the knowledge, and on the other, we have the invariant standard of <b>evidential</b> certainty. This paradox in the concept of knowledge runs deep in the history of philosophy. We approach this paradox by proposing a bet settlement theory of knowledge. Degrees of belief can be measured by the expected value of a bet divided by stake size, with the highest degree of belief being probability 1, or certainty. Evidence sufficient to settle the bet makes the expectation equal to the stake size and therefore has <b>evidential</b> probability 1. This gives us the invariant <b>evidential</b> certainty standard for knowledge. The value of knowledge relative to a bet is given by the stake size. We propose that <b>evidential</b> probability can vary with stake size, so that <b>evidential</b> certainty at low stakes does not entail <b>evidential</b> certainty at high stakes. This solves the paradox by allowing that certainty is necessary for knowledge at any stakes, but that the <b>evidential</b> standards for knowledge vary according to what is at stake. We give a Stake Size Variation Principle that calculates <b>evidential</b> probability from the value of evidence and the stakes. Stake size variant degrees of belief are probabilistically coherent and explain a greater range of preferences than orthodox expected utility theory, namely the Ellsberg and Allais preferences. The resulting theory of knowledge gives an empirically adequate, rationally grounded, unified account of evidence, value and probability...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates six- to nine-year-old children's {{acquisition}} of evidentiality.

Hence, even though the child cannot rely on speaker certainty to provide an answer, the results still show that direct evidentiality is acquired before indirect evidentiality. 22 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|In {{interrogative}} clauses, {{the same}} three non-future tenses fuse with <b>evidentials</b> to designate visual, non-visual, and inferred information. [...] Evidentiality, in interrogative clauses, indicates the speaker's assumptions about the addressee's source of information. Use of an inferred evidential, for example, implies that the speaker assumes the addressee not to have direct access to evidence on the subject at hand.

2500|$|Evidential {{systems in}} many {{languages}} are often marked simultaneously with other linguistic categories.

40|$|In Newcomb's Problem, a lot {{of people}} choose the option of one-boxing. However, the {{equivalent}} choice is rarely made in other similar decision problems. This discrepancy needs explaining. In this thesis, I consider Horwich's suggestion that <b>evidential</b> decision theory provides an explanation. Horwich argues that <b>evidential</b> decision theorists make these different choices because static screening cannot be used in Newcomb's Problem, yet it can be used in other similar decision problems. I discuss and expand upon his argument. 	I then describe the process of dynamic screening. The appeal to dynamic screening purports to show how screening could occur in Newcomb's Problem and thus lead <b>evidential</b> decision theorists to two-box. However, I argue that dynamic screening would not convince an <b>evidential</b> decision theorist to two-box, since the argument behind dynamic screening presupposes the irrationality of <b>evidential</b> decision theory. I then argue that using static screening also presupposes the irrationality of <b>evidential</b> decision theory. Thus, Horwich's argument is flawed. Screening cannot occur in any common cause problems, and the <b>evidential</b> decision theorist would be expected to do the equivalent of one-boxing. <b>Evidential</b> decision theory cannot explain why agents do the equivalent of two-boxing in some decision problems, and yet one-box in Newcomb's Problem...|$|R
25|$|In linguistics, evidentiality is, broadly, the {{indication}} {{of the nature of}} evidence for a given statement; that is, whether evidence exists for the statement and if so what kind.
