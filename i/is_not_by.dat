5|$|One {{month before}} the 2008 United States election, 5% of Ohio {{mortgages}} were either severely delinquent or in foreclosure.

5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, {{it must be}} {{understood}} that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure {{to bring an end}} to Persepolis, Alexander <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> any means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the Sassanid era. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.|$|E

Without such a system, all merchants who did not maintain their own records were at greater risk of theft by their employees and agents: it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> accident that the first and last items described in his treatise concern maintenance of an accurate inventory.|$|E

Many scientists are {{actively engaged in}} the search for unicellular life within the solar system, carrying out studies on the surface of Mars and examining meteors that have fallen to Earth. Projects such as SETI are conducting an astronomical search for radio activity that would show evidence of intelligent life outside the solar system. Scientific theories of how life developed on Earth allow for the possibility that life developed on other planets as well. The paranormal aspect of extraterrestrial life centers largely around the belief in unidentified flying objects and the phenomena said to be associated with them.|$|E
25|$|Taxpayer {{standing}} is {{the concept}} that any person who pays taxes should have standing to file {{a lawsuit against the}} taxing body if that body allocates funds {{in a way that the}} taxpayer feels is improper.

The Court has consistently found that the conduct of the federal government is too far removed from individual taxpayer returns for any injury to the taxpayer to be traced to the use of tax revenues, e.g., United States v. Richardson.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} composers of the time, producing an extraordinarily diverse output, including almost all the forms and styles current at the time; only Lassus, at the end of the 16th century, had a wider overall range. Music composed by Isaac included masses, motets, songs in French, German, and Italian, as well as instrumental music. His best known work may be the lied Innsbruck, ich muss dich lassen, of which he made at least two versions. It is possible, however, that the melody itself <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> Isaac, and only the setting is original. The same melody was later used as the theme for the Lutheran chorale O Welt, ich muss dich lassen, which was the basis of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, including his St Matthew Passion and Johannes Brahms.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{title of this}} pas was Les Aventures Amourouse de Diane or simply the Pas de Diane and was originally a pas de trois danced by Diana the Roman Goddess of the Hunt, Endymion the shepherd and a satyr, reflecting {{the myth of the}} passion between Diana and Endymion. It is believed that Petipa's inspiration for this pas was a painting by the Russian painter, Karl Bryullov. The traditional version that is danced today <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> Petipa, but by Agrippina Vaganova, who staged her own version of the Pas de Diane when she transferred it into a revival of La Esmeralda in 1935. She altered the scheme by removing the role of the satyr and changing the lead male role to the hunter, Actaeon, with whom Diana dances in the company of twelve of her nymphs. This was a very strange change on Vaganova's part since Diana and Actaeon were not lovers, but had one association when he stumbled upon her bathing naked with her nymphs, after which, she transformed him into a stag and he was hunted down and killed by his own hunting dogs.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely known work {{associated}} with Marie de Romieu, her Brief discourse on the superiority of woman over man, {{was a response to}} an anti-feminist text penned by her brother, Jacques. Some critics attribute Jacques as the actual author of the Discourse, but this theory has been mostly rejected due to stylistic differences. Featured as the first piece in Premières Oeuvres, de Romieu’s discourse on the superiority of women builds itself by praising the courage, wit and virtue of women. It argues that women were visibly more beautiful than their male counterparts because they were a refined product from man, who had been made with clay. In her discourse, de Romieu asserts that women were superior to men in their sacrifices and charity work. She condemns men who fault women for their failings and for leading them astray, claiming they are responsible for their own actions. She also accuses men of trying to deliberately deceive women with ‘fine words’ and goes into great detail elaborating the different types of deception perpetrated by men: those who cite God's will and authority, those who pose as protectors of female virtue, or those who pretend to 'serve' women. Furthermore, she illustrates women as the source of learning, both in ancient times and her own. In her conclusion, she reasons that life without women would be lacking in social graces and virtues; she also points out that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>by</b> accident that the classical virtues are depicted as women.|$|E
