25|$|It is a hard-water marl-producing lake, and {{the lake}} bottom {{consists}} of deep deposits of it. This gives the lake a murky appearance <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> {{especially during the}} summer. The lake is reportedly filling in with this marl by about 1 millimetre per year.|$|E
25|$|The {{turquoise}} {{green water}} around this coast {{is caused by}} the slate/sand around Tintagel which contains elements of copper: strong sunlight turns the water a light turquoise green colour <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather.</b> The rocks contain various metal ores in small amounts: a few of these were mined in the Victorian period.|$|E
25|$|Courtyard {{homes are}} more {{prevalent}} in temperate climates, as an open central court {{can be an important}} aid to cooling house <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather.</b> However, courtyard houses have been found in harsher climates as well for centuries. The comforts offered by a courtyardair, light, privacy, security, and tranquilityare properties nearly universally desired in human housing.|$|E

25|$|The {{caterpillars}} grow fast <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> sometimes pupating {{within a}} month. Caterpillars have 4 moults in total. The pupa remains {{attached to a}} foodplant stem by a silk girdle. Pupation lasts {{for two or three}} weeks and in good years there can be as many as three generations per year, with adults still on the wing at the beginning of November.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, bed bugs {{were very}} common. According {{to a report}} by the UK Ministry of Health, in 1933, all the houses in many areas had some degree of bed bug infestation. The {{increase}} in bed bug populations in the early 20th century has been attributed to the advent of electric heating, which allowed bed bugs to thrive year-round instead of only <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
25|$|Courtyard {{houses in}} the Middle East reflect the nomadic {{influences}} of the region. Instead of officially designating rooms for cooking, sleeping, etc., these activities were relocated throughout the year as appropriate to accommodate the changes in temperature and {{the position of the}} sun. Often the flat rooftops of these structures were used for sleeping <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather.</b> In some Islamic cultures, private courtyards provided the only outdoor space for women to relax unobserved.|$|E
50|$|Shore {{angling for}} cod and plaice at the beaches and the harbour attracts many people, {{especially}} during the summer. Swimming is popular <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather,</b> especially on the south beach. The coast is also suitable for jogging and hiking.|$|R

25|$|In {{his older}} age Pissarro {{suffered}} from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather.</b> As {{a result of this}} disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms. He often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. He moved around northern France and painted from hotels in Rouen, Paris, Le Havre and Dieppe. On his visits to London, he would do the same.|$|E
25|$|The Tropical Blue uniform, worn <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> omits {{the jacket}} and tie, and {{features}} a short-sleeved, light blue shirt (identical to that {{worn by the}} U.S. Air Force) with rank insignia on shoulder boards for officers, and pin-on collar insignia for petty officers. The Tropical Blue uniform may be worn year-round for general office wear and for visits between commands. It may be worn {{in lieu of the}} SDB uniform, but not to functions where civilian dress is coat and tie.|$|E
25|$|Open air pools {{were both}} a {{commercial}} problem as they only received money <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> {{and they were}} also a risk {{to the health of}} the users. A report published by the Ministry of Health advised against the use of open air pools unless they were chlorinated and filtrated. The committee felt that cost of adding such systems to the pools in Victoria Park and Cannon Hill Park was too expensive and both pools were closed in early 1939.|$|E
50|$|They are omnivorous; they {{primarily}} eat grains, vegetables, fruit, and plants, {{but they}} will also eat meat and insects in small quantities. Roborovski hamsters remain underground in winter and survive in that season by stockpiling some food <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather</b> and storing it in special food chambers within their burrow system.|$|R
50|$|Women {{traditionally}} wear long-sleeved floor-length dresses {{of thick}} wool called tongkok. A sleeveless variation called angi is worn over a raatuk (blouse) <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather.</b> These are worn with colourful striped aprons; metil aprons are worn in front, and gewe in back, and are {{held together by}} an embossed silver buckle called kyetig.|$|R

25|$|Rubber was {{introduced}} to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and gummy <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, {{as though they were}} held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{variation}} in time taken for the female to engorge, a host may carry a tick {{for up to three}} weeks without the tick being significantly engorged or causing paralysis. However, <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> the female engorges rapidly, and at the same time, injects her toxin into the host, thus causing paralysis if the host is susceptible. The adult female does not usually inject detectable amounts of toxin until the 3rd or 4th day of attachment to the host, with peak amounts being injected on days 5 and 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} home to a variety of reptiles. The Balkan terrapin (Mauremys rivulata) can be found near fresh water along with the Greek marsh frog (Pelophylax kurtmuelleri), though this habitat is slowly disappearing due to development. The Balkan wall lizard (Podarcis taurica) is seen {{regularly}} in daylight <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> and the Hemidactylus turcicus at night. A larger lizard is the Balkan green lizard (Lacerta trilineata). Several varieties of snakes can be observed: the Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus), the leopard snake (Elephe situla), the large whip snake (Coluber jugularis), the grass snake (Natrix natrix), and a species of viper.|$|E
50|$|Earth-loving poverty bush is {{an ideal}} small, compact shrub for a very low hedge, {{along the edge of}} a {{footpath}} or as an understorey container plant. It can be grown from cuttings, taking several months to form roots <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather</b> or can be grafted onto Myoporum species. It prefers well-drained soil but is drought tolerant and frost hardy.|$|R

25|$|Climatic factors, such as temperature, {{are known}} to {{influence}} egg-laying and development of instar-larvae. <b>In</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather</b> the life cycle can last a little less, and in cooler temperatures the life cycle takes a little longer. Knowing the duration between the three instars and pupa stage and post-feeding larval dispersal can be useful to determine the post mortem interval in a criminal case.|$|R
25|$|The tall ancient manna gum forests near Whitefriars College {{are home}} to ducks (who nest {{on the tops of}} old stags) crimson rosellas, galahs and other parrots (who nest in old hollows), rare large {{powerful}} owls and rainbow lorikeets. Pied cormorants and night herons cruise the creek pools. Rakali and the occasional platypus, fish for galaxias, gudgeon and yabbies. There are signs of wombat diggings on the hill face but they are rarely seen. The occasional swamp wallaby and eastern grey kangaroo visit the gorge. <b>In</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> skinks, blue tongue lizards and copperhead snakes can be seen. Other rarely seen species include marbled geckos and white-lipped snakes.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{commissioned}} {{construction of}} a more refined house; the original mansion was a two-story Federal-style building, built with bricks manufactured on-site with skilled slave labor, and completed between 1819 and 1821. It had four rooms {{on the ground floor}} and four rooms on the second level, each having a fireplace and chimney. The large central hallways opened <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> from front to back to form a breezeway. A simple portico was added later. In 1831, while Jackson was away in the White House, he had the mansion remodeled under the direction of architect David Morrison, with flanking one-story wings, a one-story entrance portico with 10 columns, and a small rear portico giving the house a Classical appearance.|$|E
25|$|The Bendix system's public {{debut in}} December 1956 was {{followed}} by a March 1957 price bulletin listing it as a US$395 option, but because of supplier difficulties, EFI Rebels would only be available after June 15. This was to have been the first production EFI engine, but Electrojector's teething problems meant only pre-production cars were so equipped: thus, very few cars so equipped were ever sold, and none were made available to the public. The Rambler's EFI was more advanced than the mechanical types then appearing on the market and the engines ran fine <b>in</b> <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures. As a result, all of the production Rebels used a four-barrel carburetor. Nevertheless, the EFI option remained in the published owner's manual.|$|E
50|$|Recovery efforts {{continued}} <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather,</b> albeit on {{a smaller}} scale. For its exercises and training sessions, the RCMP's search and rescue team chose areas of the taiga where Yoshikubo might have gone. They kept those locations confidential to ensure that only trained personnel {{who knew how to}} process the scene found the body if there was one to be found.|$|R
50|$|The {{shore of}} the lake has a high density of {{recreation}} homes, many with docks for boats and other recreation vehicles. <b>In</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather,</b> fishing is considered exceptional in Honeoye Lake. Walleye, bass, perch and bluegill {{are some of the}} recreational and tournament fish that can be found. Popular recreational activities also include boating, tubing, water skiing, wake boarding, and other water sports.|$|R
50|$|Higher {{amounts of}} {{terpenes}} are released by trees <b>in</b> <b>warmer</b> <b>weather,</b> {{acting as a}} natural form of cloud seeding. The clouds reflect sunlight, allowing the forest to regulate its temperature. The aroma and flavor of hops comes, in part, from sesquiterpenes (mainly alpha-humulene and beta-caryophyllene), which affect beer quality. Terpenes are also major constituents of Cannabis sativa plants, which contain at least 120 identified compounds.|$|R
