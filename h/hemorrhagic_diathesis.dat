40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} the hemostatic efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven (R), Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) in platelet-related bleeding disorders remain unclear. The general concept is that rFVIIa locally enhances thrombin generation {{at the site of}} injury, where tissue factor (TF) has become exposed. However, a growing amount of evidence shows that rFVIIa is also able to exert its activity in a manner independent of TF. Using an in vitro flow model, we recently showed that TF-independent thrombin generation is responsible for increased platelet deposition onto injured vessels following rFVIIa administration. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} rFVIIa can restore platelet aggregation in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) patients via TF-independent thrombin generation. However, the mechanism behind TF-independent thrombin generation remains to be elucidated. It is postulated that, in vivo, both the TF-dependent and TF-independent thrombin generation induced by rFVIIa contribute to the control of hemorrhage in patients with platelet-related bleeding disorders and, perhaps, other causes of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diatheses...</b>|$|R

50|$|Summer {{diarrhea}} is {{a condition}} prevalent in children in Iraq due to contaminated food. Treatment usually involves a fat free diet, however the resulting lack of fat soluble vitamins, including vitamin K, can result in <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diathesis</b> — bleeding from the gut and from under the skin. Children suffering with this condition were typically given blood transfusions, but with little improvement. In 1959, Dr. Fakhri, Tajeldin and Nouri at the Children’s Welfare Hospital in Baghdad discovered that these patients suffered from low prothrombin, which is essential for blood clotting. This could be remedied simply with vitamin K, a precursor of prothrombin.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{describe}} {{the results of a}} simple experiment designed to investigate the <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diathesis</b> in scurvy. The <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diathesis</b> is perhaps the most striking clinical feature of scurvy. The anatomic study of the disease, however, has centered chiefly about the changes in the skeletal system, and, lately, the teeth. This is due, in part, at least, to the absence of definite or characteristic lesions in the vessels. The pathologic features of the terminal vessels have been described as thickening or proliferation of the cells of the intin ~ and, by some, adventitia as well. Several pathologists consider them to be inflammatory (1, 2). According to this view of the <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diathesis</b> the vitamin deficiency is responsible for a nutritive state in which organisms normally non-pathogenic incite inflammatory changes.

40|$|Radiosynovectomy is a safe and {{repeatable}} {{treatment method}} of chronic synovitis with synovial overgrowth and refractory chronic or acute inflammatory joint effusion. It consist in the intraarticular administration of a radioactive isotope {{in the form}} of a colloid causing the extinguishing of active synovitis. The radiocolloid causes permanent irradiation of the synovium with beta ray electron beams, which ultimately leads to its fibrosis and extinguishes the inflammatory process destroying the joint. The main indications for radiosynovectomy include chronic and acute arthritis in the course of systemic diseases, intraarticular bleeding in <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diatheses</b> (hemophilia), selected cases of osteoarthritis, recurrent effusions following surgery, e. g. arthroplasty, or other iatrogenic post-surgery complications causing arthritis. Radiosynovectomy is also performed in pigmented villonodular synovitis and crystal synovitis. The most common method used to determine the eligibility for radiosynovectomy is an ultrasound, which shows the location and activity of the thickened synovium. The administration of a radiocolloid into the joint, sheath or bursa should also be performed {{under the control of the}} ultrasound image, as this ensures a precise location of the puncture needle and full control of the isotope administration process.

40|$|Case summary The current report {{describes}} thromboelastography (TEG) {{findings in}} two cats with factor XII (FXII) deficiency. The first cat {{was diagnosed with}} bilateral perinephric pseudocysts; hemostatic testing was performed prior to performing renal aspirates. The second cat was healthy; hemostatic testing was performed prior to inclusion into a research project. Both cats had markedly prolonged partial thromboplastin times and hypocoagulable TEG tracings when samples were activated with kaolin. However, when tissue factor (TF) was used to activate the sample, both cats had normal-to-hypercoagulable TEG tracings. The cats each had a subnormal FXII level.

40|$|Bleeding {{complications}} are {{a significant}} clinical problem in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes even at suf-ficient platelet counts (> 50, 000 /l). However, the under-lying pathology of this <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diathesis</b> is still un-known. Here, we analyzed the platelet proteome of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes by quantitative two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometric protein identification. Proteins identified with lower concentrations, such as Talin- 1, Vin-culin, Myosin- 9, Filmain-A, and Actin play critical roles in integrin IIb 3 signaling and thus platelet aggregation. Despite normal agonist receptor expression, calcium flux, and granule release upon activation, the activation capac-ity of integrin IIb 3 was diminished in myelodysplastic syndrome platelets. Förster resonance energy transfer analysis showed a reduced co-localization of Talin- 1 to the integrin’s 3 -subunit, which is required for receptor activation and fibrinogen binding.

40|$|Purpose: Valproate (VPA) is an {{extensively}} used drug in {{the therapy}} of epilepsies. One {{of the most frequently}} reported side effects of VPA is <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diathesis.</b> Some authors emphasized the decreased platelet count as the basis of VPA-induced <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diathesis,</b> but some reports suggested that a significant proportion of patients with normal platelet count may still have an altered platelet function. The mechanism of the VPA-induced platelet dysfunction has not yet been elucidated. A determining element of platelet functions is the arachidonate cascade. Present ex vivo experiments were designed to determine whether a relation exists between the incidence of hemostasis caused by VPA and the effect of this drug on the arachidonate cascade of platelets. Methods: Platelets were isolated from patients receiving long-term VPA treatment (serum level, 36. 04 +/- 16. 12 mu g/ml; n = 10) or carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment (serum level, 5. 24 +/- 2. 67 mu g/ml; n = 10) and were labeled with [C- 14]arachidonic acid. (CBZ-treated patients were chosen as a control group, because CBZ causes blood dyscrasias similar to those elicited by VPA, but there has been no report that CBZ induces a platelet dysfunction.) The C- 14 -eicosanoids were separated by means of overpressure thin-layer chromatography and determined quantitatively by liquid scintillation. Results: Even when the mean plasma concentration of the drug was low, VPA treatment reduced the activity of the arachidonate cascade in platelets. VPA effectively inhibited the cyclooxygenase pathway and the synthesis of the strong platelet aggregator thromboxane A(2). Conclusions: Inhibition of the platelet arachidonate cascade may contribute to the platelet-function alterations caused by VPA...|$|E
