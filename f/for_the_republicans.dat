5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as {{it would make it}} easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
5|$|On Election Day in November 1876, Tillman {{served as}} an {{election}} official at a local poll, as did two black Republicans. One arrived late and was scared off by Tillman. As there was as yet no secret ballot in South Carolina, Tillman threatened to remember any votes cast <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> That precinct gave 211 votes for the Democrats and 2 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Although almost two-thirds of those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, the Democrats were able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, reporting a win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote. Bolstered by this result, Hampton gained a narrow victory statewide, {{at least according to}} the official returns. The Red Shirts used violence and fraud to create Democratic majorities that did not exist, and give Hampton the election.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the tribes}} were better {{represented}} in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> and were close to the mediation attempt. By {{the end of the}} war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks and activists from South Yemen. In the summer of 1972, a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and South Yemen that they would reunite, but they did not. There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E

50|$|Six {{candidates}} filed to run <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination. There {{were two}} debates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> candidates, held on March 15 and April 9.|$|R
50|$|Executive Councilor Chris Sununu, state {{representative}} and entrepreneur Frank Edelblut, and Jon Lavoie ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination. Sununu defeated his challengers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination.|$|R
5|$|The mid-term {{elections}} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor {{with the administration}} over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{in the rural areas}} of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} power vacuums in {{the weeks}} following the Japanese surrender, created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Many pemuda joined pro-Republic struggle groups (badan perjuangan). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{after the}} {{overthrow}} of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake battleship was renamed España. In the mid-1930s, the Spanish Navy considered modernization programs for the two surviving battleships, but none came to fruition, primarily {{as a result of}} the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The two ships found themselves on opposite sides during the conflict; España served on the side of Francisco Franco's Nationalists, and Jaime I fought <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> España was used for coastal bombardment and to enforce the blockade of Republican ports, while Jaime I unsuccessfully attempted to disrupt the blockade, though neither ship engaged the other. In August 1936, Jaime I was attacked and moderately damaged by Nationalist bombers; while undergoing repairs in Cartagena, she was destroyed by an internal explosion in June 1937. España was sunk on 30 April 1937 after striking a mine laid by her own side off the coast of Santander in northern Spain.|$|E

50|$|His father, Harry Limehouse, Jr., was a {{campaign}} director <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee. He ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination to <b>the</b> United States House of Representatives in the 1st congressional district special election in 1971.|$|R
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> 2016 <b>Republican</b> Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger {{endorsed}} fellow Republican John Kasich. However, {{he announced}} in October {{that he would}} not vote <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> presidential candidate Donald Trump in the that year's United States presidential election, with this being the first time he did not vote <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.|$|R
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{was elected}} to succeed Bradley in the {{contentious}} 1899 gubernatorial election. When Democratic nominee William Goebel and his running mate J. C. W. Beckham challenged the election results, Bradley formed part of the legal team <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which found {{in favor of the}} Democrats. Despite {{being a member of the}} state's minority party, Bradley {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, divisions within the Democratic Party played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to Prohibition made him more palatable to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected Bradley. Bradley had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. On the day he announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a streetcar accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.|$|E
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E
5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E
50|$|Patrick Harlan, a {{fuel truck}} driver and President of the Knox County Tea Party, {{announced}} in September {{that he was}} running <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination.

[...] Assemblyman Logue was appointed chair of the Caucus Task Force on Jobs and Economic Recovery.|$|R
5|$|Ex-Confederates {{were usually}} a safe voting bloc for the Democrats, {{but many of}} them deserted Goebel because he had, in 1895, {{approached}} and quickly killed his main local political opponent, the grandson of Revolutionary War General and US Congressman Thomas Sandford, the esteemed banker and former Confederate colonel John Sandford, in what he declared was an act of self-defense. On the other hand, blacks had historically been a safe bloc <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> but Taylor had alienated many of them by not strongly opposing the Separate Coach Bill, which would have racially segregated railroad facilities. Goebel also risked losing support to minor party candidates. Besides John Y. Brown, the dissenting Democrats' nominee, the Populist Party nominated a candidate, drawing votes from Goebel's populist base. To unite his traditional base, Goebel convinced William Jennings Bryan, a hero to most populists and Democrats, to campaign for him. As soon as Bryan finished his tour of the state, Governor Bradley reversed course and began speaking in favor of Taylor. While Bradley insisted that his motives were to defend his administration, journalist Henry Watterson believed Taylor had promised to support Bradley's senatorial bid if elected.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the {{convention}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were mixed; on one hand, the party emerged united from their convention {{for the first time}} since 1868, but it came with a heavy price as the more moderate black and white members of the party switched to support Hampton and the Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In presidential elections, the 5th District {{was once}} fairly competitive, {{but in recent}} years has {{generally}} been a safe bet <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Although George W. Bush carried the district with 57% in 2000 and 2004, John McCain just narrowly won the district with 52% of the vote, while Barack Obama received 46% in 2008. In 2012, President Obama's share of the vote dropped to 44%.|$|E

25|$|The results, while {{a triumph}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans,</b> {{showed that the}} IPP's {{politics}} still had a significant constituency across the island. In the North East, and especially in Belfast, the IPP had more or less held their ground against the Sinn Féin insurgency, (Éamon de Valera soundly beaten by Joe Devlin in the Falls division). The IPP regrouped to become the Nationalist Party of Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{explored}} the ethnocultural {{foundations of the}} party, along the line that ethnic and religious groups set the moral standards for their members, who then carried those standards into politics. The churches also provided social networks that politicians used to sign up voters. The pietistic churches emphasized {{the duty of the}} Christian to purge sin from society. Sin took many forms—alcoholism, polygamy and slavery became special targets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nelson's {{strategy}} was to prevent Washburn from gaining a straightforward majority in either the nomination or the election in the Republican caucus, and to appear as a unifying choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> He had to strike a fine balance between appealing to Scandinavian ethnic pride {{on the one hand}} and affirming himself a true American on the other; between the appearance of treachery against Washburn and maintaining an honest impression.|$|E

25|$|Many non-Spaniards, often {{affiliated}} with radical communist or socialist entities, joined the International Brigades, {{believing that the}} Spanish Republic was a front line {{in the war against}} fascism. The units represented the largest foreign contingent of those fighting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Roughly 40,000 foreign nationals fought with the Brigades, though no more than 18,000 were in the conflict at any given time. They claimed to represent 53 nations.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 in The Emerging Republican Majority, Kevin Phillips {{argued that}} support from Southern whites and {{growth in the}} South, among other factors, were driving an {{enduring}} Republican electoral realignment. Today, the South is again generally solid in state elections, and mostly solid in presidential contests, but now <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Exit polls in 2004 showed that George W. Bush led John Kerry 70% to 30% among whites, who constituted 71% of Southern voters.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the IRA relied {{mostly on}} {{weaponry}} smuggled from Libya. The regular shipments from the United States, once {{the main source}} of arms <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> through the gunrunning operations of George Harrison, were disrupted after he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1981. The smuggling scheme suffered a further blow when the Fenit-based trawler Marita Ann, with a huge arms cache from Boston, was captured by the Irish Naval Service in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Ken Peoples, the {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> White Oak <b>Republican</b> Committee, had declared his candidacy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination, but was removed from <b>the</b> ballot <b>for</b> collecting insufficient ballot petition signatures. He subsequently ran a write-in campaign <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination in <b>the</b> State House's 35th Legislative District. Bob Howard, a former candidate for Allegheny County Controller in 2011, ran a write-in campaign <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination. Howard would need 1,000 certified write-in votes to be nominated. At least 1,498 Republican write-in votes were recorded in the district, but certifying them would take several weeks.|$|R
