Echocardiographic left ventricular <b>mass</b> (<b>in</b> <b>grams)</b> was estimated from the following formula: left ventricular mass = 1. 05 {[left ventricular internal diastolic dimension + ventricu-lar septal thickness (diastole) + posterior wall thickness (diastole) ] 3 - [left ventricular internal diastolic dimen-sion] 3 }. In both groups, female subjects had a slightly smaller left ventricular mass than male subjects (mean difference 7. 2 % in Group I, p< 0. 05, and 3. 6 % in Group II, p = 0. 05) for any given age and body surface area. Left ventricular mass varied linearly with body surface area and increased {{as a function of}} age. In group I subjects, echocardiographic left ventricular <b>mass</b> (<b>in</b> <b>grams)</b> could be estimated by the general formula: left ventricular mass = 124 (body surface area) + A ± C, where A is the age-dependent intercept; ± C encompasses a 95 % prediction interval for normal values, which is assumed to be nearly constant (± 58 g); and body surface area is expressed in square meters. In the Group II (younger) subjects, with age not considered, left ventricular <b>mass</b> (<b>in</b> <b>grams)</b> could be estimated from the following formula: left ventricular mass = 115 (body surface area) - 11 ± C, where ±C = ± 32 % and this 95 % prediction interval varies {{as a percentage of the}} mean.

5000|$|The Evans balance {{measures}} susceptibility indirectly {{by referring}} to a calibration standard of known susceptibility. The most convenient compound for this purpose is mercury cobalt thiocyanate, HgCo(NCS)4, which has a susceptibility of 16.44×10−6 (±0.5%) CGS at 20 °C. Another common calibration standard is Ni(en)SO which has a susceptibility of 1.104 x 10−5 erg G−2 cm−3. Three readings of the meter are needed, of an empty tube, R0 of the tube filled with calibrant and of the tube filled with the sample, Rs. Some balances have an auto-tare feature that {{eliminates the need for}} the R0 measurement. Accuracy depends somewhat on homogenous packing of the sample. The first two provide a calibration constant, C. The <b>mass</b> susceptibility <b>in</b> <b>grams</b> is calculated aswhere L is the length of the sample, C is the calibration constant (usually 1 if it has been calibrated), and m is its <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>grams.</b> The reading for the empty tube is needed because the tube glass is diamagnetic. There is a V term multiplied by an A term in the most general form of the equation. These two terms (V∗A) are colletively added to the numerator in the above equation. The V term is the volume susceptibility of air (0.029 x 10−6 erg G−2 [...] cm−3) and A is the cross-sectional area of the sample. These two terms can be ignored for solid samples, yielding the original equation written above.|$|R

Our aim was to study infant size and body composition variables in relation to body composition variables of their mothers and fathers in a well-nourished population using an accurate methodology. Methods: Between 2008 and 2011, we used air displacement plethysmography to measure the body composition of 209 parent–infant units. Parents were measured when women were in gestational week 32. Their healthy, singleton, full-term infants were measured at 1  week. Results: Infant fat-free <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>grams</b> was positively related (p ≤  0. 007) to the fat-free <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> kilograms of the mothers (15. 6  g/kg) and the fathers (9. 1  g/kg). Furthermore, the fat mass of the daughters, but not of the sons, {{was positively related to}} the fat mass of the mothers (5. 8  g/kg, p =  0. 007). Conclusion: This study found associations between the fat-free mass of parents and infants and an association between the fat mass of mothers and their infant girls.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of diabetic cardiomyopathy in patients with diabetes mellitus in Manipur and its correlation with different parameters like obesity, blood pressure, lipids, duration of diabetes, and glycemic control. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 type 2 diabetic patients were selected randomly. Anthropometric parameters were recorded, blood glucose levels and lipid profiles were determined, and the echocardiographic examinations were performed in all patients according to standard techniques. Ejection fraction (EF) was calculated by the formula LVEF% = (LVID) 2 - (LVIDS) 2. Left ventricular EF was considered normal when EF was 55 to 75 %.

Similar equations are presented for the families Saturniidae and Sphingidae. In sphingids and saturniids thoracic mass, wing length, and wing area increased with body mass, whereas wing loading and aspect ratio were independent of body mass. The sphingids had higher wing loading, aspect ratio, and wing beat frequency during flight than the saturniids. Wing beat frequency was more tightly coupled to morphological parameters in sphingids than in saturniids.
