5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E

As both King Gustavus I and his son, John III, were involved in lengthy wars with Russia, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise {{that this was a}} central element in the arms of both the Grand Duchy of Finland, and in that of the coat of arms of the Finnish province of Karelia (Figure 6), which symbolizes the struggle between East and West.|$|E
25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E
500|$|Sestak won the May 18 primary with 53.8 {{percent of}} the vote, or 568,563 of the votes cast, {{compared}} to 46.2 percent and 487,217 votes for Specter. The defeat led {{to the end of}} Specter's nearly 30-year Senate career, the longest of any Pennsylvania Senator in history. Afterward, Sestak declared, [...] "This is what democracy should look like: a win for the people over the establishment. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise to anyone that people want a change." [...] Specter conceded defeat and said, [...] "It's been a great privilege to serve the people of Pennsylvania. It's been a great privilege to be in the United States Senate." [...] Commentators suggested Specter's defeat signaled an electorate unsatisfied with the establishment in both major parties, and indicated that the backing of prominent politicians had little effect on voters during this political age. Sestak's victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for Obama, who strongly and publicly advocated for Specter during the race. Several news outlets reflected that Sestak's television advertisements condemning Specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been the primary factor in his victory. The Washington Post said the Pennsylvania race drew more attention than any other primary election in 2010 due to Specter's longevity and his switch to the Democratic party.|$|E

2500|$|But {{the reason}} for Maroto's leaving Catalonia was not the {{opposition}} of the leading Catalans, but his belief {{that he had been}} betrayed in not having received the resources he had counted on when he left Navarre. So, after submitting to the Intendant Díaz de Labandero a series of petitions for armaments and uniforms that were totally impossible to fulfill, Maroto abandoned Catalonia 5 October on the pretext of going to see Don Carlos to notify him of the true situation of the war in that territory, thereby fulfilling [...] "my intent of resigning the command of the Catalan forces… it not being my character to carry on a disastrous life with no higher dignity than that of a captain of brigands". <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that the Catalans despised the man who had abandoned them, and that the court of Don Carlos did not look favorably on a man who appeared not to have exerted all possible force to achieve his assigned task.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, No Mercy {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 59, based on 15 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Henry Adaso of About.com states [...] "Arguably T.I.'s worst outing yet, No Mercy relies on gruesomely listless party tunes {{and the occasional}} whining" [...] and stating [...] "The production on No Mercy is painfully generic for a rapper once known for rocking {{some of the best}} beats money can buy". AllMusic writer Andy Kellman described it as [...] "a career low point for all involved" [...] however he states [...] "There's a sense that he'll regain focus once his legal matters settle". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club states [...] "As is the case with 2Pac, it's difficult to separate the ongoing crime drama/soap opera of T.I.'s life from the music he creates. So <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that No Mercy, the superstar's latest post-and-pre-prison-stint album, reflects the life lessons and soul-searching that come with extended jail time at the height of a superstar's fame". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe noted that [...] "throughout this disc there's an unsettling celebration of the untamed life without any reflection on the consequences T.I. often laments". Entertainment Weeklys Brad Wete noted that [...] "The self-proclaimed King of the South addresses his troubles on several tracks while on others he remains unrepentant, though: On Get Back Up, he arrogantly apologizes for being human rather than for his crimes" [...] Wete ended the review by stating [...] "That crown must be getting heavy".|$|E
2500|$|The MDNA Tour has {{received}} positive reviews. A journalist from The Jerusalem Post described {{the show in}} Tel Aviv as an [...] "assault on the senses". He further comments, [...] "Despite the confused ideas underlying the performance, it's difficult to imagine somebody not enjoying a Madonna concert. Say what you will about the Kabbalah-studying, gun-toting, fashionista of pop music– and everyone has something to say– but the woman knows how {{to put on a}} good show". Jon Parales from The New York Times wrote that [...] "the concert is a display of energy and nutty inventiveness, with Madonna costumed as everything from baton twirler to folk dancer", adding that it [...] "is less a story than an excellent excuse for extravagant, perpetually surprising production numbers involving more than three dozen performers, while it turns some of Madonna's past hits inside out." [...] New York Daily News called the show [...] "an idea-intensive, message-packed riddle wrapped in an enigma that must be seen to be believed", arguing that the show's risky artistry [...] "deserves praise." [...] German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost wrote: [...] "Madonna live in 2012 is still magical and unmatched", Newspaper El País said [...] "Madonna shows her intelligence, femininity and elegance in a danceable and spectacular show," [...] Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "With three decades of superstardom under her belt, Madonna has pretty much perfected the art of mass entertainment with a hint of scandal. So <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise, even in the Holy Land, that her show would open with a giant cross, the clang of a church bell and cloaked clergymen"; while the show was given a positive review, the fact that the tour contains many songs from the MDNA album was criticized. Saeed Saeed from The National states the performance in Abu Dhabi saw Madonna [...] "bearing her soul". He says, [...] "While her previous Sticky and Sweet tour saw her lightly poking fun at herself and her various musical guises throughout the years, this concert was at times brutally dark and suffocating and as much an emotional exorcism as a performance".|$|E
