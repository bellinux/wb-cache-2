40|$|A 4 degree wedge {{was used}} to produce a thick {{turbulent}} boundary layer with an edge Mach number of 11. By using a two-dimensional model, the boundary layer was nearly free from upstream history effects associated with nozzle wall turbulent boundary layers. Heat-transfer distributions were used to define regions of laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow at several values of T(sub w) /T(sub t) for an <b>edge</b> <b>unit</b> Reynolds number of 0. 47 x lot per cm. Pitot and total temperature profiles and skin-friction measurements were obtained at selected stations along the model. Turbulence parameters (mixing length/sigma and epsilon) were derived from the fully turbulent profiles and used to more completely define the "low Reynolds number" effect. Turbulent Prandtl number distributions are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a thick hypersonic boundary layer turbulent for a length of 175 cm on a 4 deg sharp wedge were measured. The resulting boundary layer was free from transverse curvature effects and only mildly affected by upstream history effects caused by pressure and wall temperature gradients. Heat-transfer distributions were used to locate regions of laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow at an <b>edge</b> <b>unit</b> Reynolds number of 470, 000 cm at wall-to-total temperature ratios from about 0. 3 to 1.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel way to draw planar graphs with good angular resolution. We {{introduce}} the polar coordinate representation and describe {{a family of}} algorithms which use polar representation. The main advantage of using a polar representation {{is that it allows}} us to exert independent control over grid size and bend positions. Polar coordinates allow us to specify di#erent vertex resolution, bend-point resolution and edge separation. We first describe a standard (Cartesian) representation algorithm (CRA) which we then modify to obtain a polar representation algorithm (PRA). In both algorithms we are concerned with the following drawing criteria: angular resolution, bends per edge, vertex resolution, bend-point resolution, edge separation, and drawing area. The CRA algorithm presented here achieves 1 bend per <b>edge,</b> <b>unit</b> vertex resolution, unit bend resolution, # 2 / 2 edge separation, 5 n 5 n 2 drawing area and 1 2 d(v) angular resolution, where d(v) is the degree of vertex v. These simultaneous bounds are an improvement over all previously known results. The PRA algorithm has an improved angular resolution of # 4 d(v), 1 bend per edge, and unit vertex resolution. For the PRA algorithm, the bend-point resolution and edge separation are parameters that can be modified to achieve di#erent types of drawings and drawing areas. In particular, for the same parameters as the CRA algorithm (unit bend-point resolution and # 2 / 2 edge separation), the PRA algorithm creates a drawing of size 9 n 9 n 2. ...|$|E

40|$|The coding {{standard}} such as H. 264 /AVC or MPEG 4 {{which have a}} high compression rate {{made it possible to}} transmit video data and even real-time video payload over network. However, the influence of error propagation and the sequential data loss in the spatial domain also occur as the side effect of this high compression rate. In order to improve the image quality degraded by transmission errors error concealment techniques are useful. By using the spatial relativity of the image after compression, it is feasible for the decoder to accomplish this job alone without consuming any extra network bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for reconstructing multi-edge cases for error concealment. By manipulating each <b>edge</b> <b>unit</b> separately, deriving the angle of the gradient for each unit by a similar procedure of directional interpolation, forming the best connection pattern with proper judging criterion, and filling the rest of the region by bilinear interpolation, we reconstruct the error blocks. Besides, the estimation of the best error concealment algorithm, which is processed in the decoder, is done in the encoder. Then we embed the estimated result into the image by data hiding techniques. Once the error appeared during the transmission, the decoder can efficiently conceal the loss by the information embedded by the encoder without incurring extra network payload.

This paper focuses on the recently proposed two-connected network with bounded rings problem. We investigate the search difficulty of both the Euclidean <b>edge</b> and <b>unit</b> <b>edge</b> length ring size bounds flavors of this problem by performing an information-theoretic fitness landscape analysis for several instances of the problem. Our results further confirm the hypothesis that the <b>unit</b> <b>edge</b> length version of the problem is indeed more difficult.

40|$|Designing an {{efficient}} sampling scheme {{for a rare}} and clustered population is a challenging area of research. Adaptive cluster sampling, which {{has been shown to}} be viable for such a population, is based on sampling a neighborhood of units around a unit that meets a specified condition. However, the <b>edge</b> <b>units</b> produced by sampling neighborhoods have proven to limit the efficiency and applicability of adaptive cluster sampling. We propose a sampling design that is adaptive in the sense that the final sample depends on observed values, but it avoids the use of neighborhoods and the sampling of <b>edge</b> <b>units.</b> Unbiased estimators of population total and its variance are derived using Murthy’s estimator. The modified two-stage sampling design is easy to implement and can be applied to a wider range of populations than adaptive cluster sampling. We evaluate the proposed sampling design by simulating sampling of two real biological populations and an artificial population for which the variable of interest took the value either 0 or 1 (e. g., indicating presence and absence of a rare event). We show that the proposed sampling design is more efficient than conventional sampling in nearly all cases. The approach used to derive estimators (Murthy’s estimator) opens the door for unbiased estimators to be found for similar sequential sampling designs...|$|R

Moreover, if the edges may be freely permuted around each vertex, then such a drawing is possible, without crossings, with all <b>edges</b> <b>unit</b> length or higher, and with the entire drawing fitting within a bounding box of polynomial area.
