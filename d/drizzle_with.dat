5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and <b>drizzle,</b> <b>with</b> a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{of cloud}} phase (liquid, ice, mixed, etc.) is {{necessary}} to describe the radiative impact of clouds and their lifetimes, but is a property {{that is difficult to}} simulate correctly in climate models. One step towards improving those simulations is to make observations of cloud phase with sufficient accuracy to help constrain model representations of cloud processes. In this study, we outline a methodology using a basic Bayesian classifier to estimate the probabilities of cloud-phase class from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) vertically pointing active remote sensors. The advantage of this method over previous ones is that it provides uncertainty information on the phase classification. We also test the value of including higher moments of the cloud radar Doppler spectrum than are traditionally used operationally. Using training data of known phase from the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE) field campaign, we demonstrate a proof of concept for how the method can be used to train an algorithm that identifies ice, liquid, mixed phase, and snow. Over 95  % of data are identified correctly for pure ice and liquid cases used in this study. Mixed-phase and snow cases are more problematic to identify correctly. When lidar data are not available, including additional information from the Doppler spectrum provides substantial improvement to the algorithm. This is a first step towards an operational algorithm and can be expanded to include additional categories such as <b>drizzle</b> <b>with</b> additional training data...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper describes {{the effects of}} rain attenuation on the free space optical (FSO) transmission system. The entire research was conducted {{in the heart of}} Kuala Lumpur city- year 2001, as the city was using such systems (LAN-to-LAN & WLAN-to-WLAN) widely to connect the metropolitan areas for data transmission. The preliminary experiments were done using PAVLight product modeled PL- 1 G/ 1 Tx/GigE which leaded to maximum reach of 700 m distance with 810 nm wavelength and also laser power of 14 dBm. The data for rain intensities were obtained from measuring unit at UTM Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur following the ITU protocols such as ITU-R P. 1814 and ITU-R P. 1817. The transmission and reception were achieved by using Continuous Wave (CW) Laser signals as transmitting signals and APD photo detector to receive it on the other end. The experiments were fully carried out for two conditions (heavy-rain and lighter rain or <b>drizzle)</b> <b>with</b> multiple repetitions. At last, the collected data were compiled and compared with other researcher's results. It was found to be the same as how the other researchers have obtained before for various cities worldwide. The results were found to be very satisfactory. It obeyed the theoretical aspects as higher the rain, higher the attenuations then. These results the degradation on the received signals. As a guide for future implementation of FSO systems for various atmospheric conditions in the metropolitan areas of Kuala Lumpur; we believed that this preliminary works may help...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} use of the IDL MultiKing proce-dures to generate and add simulated PSF or Globular Clusters to HST ACS observations, simulating the effect of dithering on the final drizzled and stacked image. The script can be easily modified to add any type of object. NEW:- Version 1. 2 -a. bug fixed: the code was not checking the drizzling kernel used by the reference image, and was thus using whatever kernel the user had defined in its drizzle preference file. The fix allows the code to <b>drizzle</b> <b>with</b> the same kernel used in the reference image. b. The documentation was updated to reflect the fact that files in use by TinyTim are not required anymore, since TinyTim is implemented in the code but not actually used (see below for further details) and also discouraged for it’s limitations. c. the code now is able to generate PSFs of with the total magnitude requested by the user, as was alrady possible for GCs (In previous ver-sions PSFs were always normalized to 1). T{{the use of}} the package to 1 generate PSFs, based on the Anderson templates, is better described. - Version 1. 1 - fixed a bug which did not allow the code to properly handle simulated sources overlapping edges. This happens when reading from an input list, since randomly created sources avoid the field edges by design. The code now also allows to include Poissonian errors in the mask files due to simulated sources, for final drizzling. This is intended to be used with the ERR weighting option of Multidrizzle [1], which computes correct error maps including all error sources. 2...|$|E

40|$|Increased Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) load due to {{anthropogenic}} activity {{might lead to}} non-precipitating clouds because the cloud drops become smaller (for a constant liquid water content) and, therefore, less efficient in rain formation (aerosol indirect effect). Adding giant CCN (GCCN) into such a cloud can initiate precipitation (namely, drizzle) and, therefore, might counteract the aerosol indirect effect. The effect of GCCN on global climate, especially on clouds and precipitation, within a General Circulation Model (GCM) is investigated. GCCN are aerosol particles larger than 5 &ndash; 10 μm in radius that can act as cloud condensation nuclei. One prominent GCCN species is sea salt. Sea salt concentrations depend mainly on wind speed but also on relative humidity, stability and precipitation history. Natural variability is {{much larger than the}} simulated one because sea salt emissions within ECHAM 5 are a function of wind speed only. Giant sea salt concentrations in ECHAM 5 are determined by using the tail of the coarse mode aerosol distribution with cutoff radii of 5 μm or 10 μm. It is assumed that activated GCCN particles directly form rain drops (of 25 μm size). Thereby, the added rain water mass and number stems from the redistribution of the condensed water into cloud and rain water according to the number of activated GCCN. As the formed precipitation is most likely <b>drizzle</b> <b>with</b> rather small drops a prognostic rain scheme is applied to account for the lower fall speeds and, therefore, slower sedimentation of the drizzle drops. The ECHAM 5 simulations with incorporated GCCN show that precipitation is affected only locally. Cloud properties like liquid water and cloud drop number show a larger sensitivity to GCCN. On the one hand, the increased rain water mass causes an increase in the accretion rate and, therefore, in the rain production. On the other hand, very high GCCN concentrations can lead to an artificially exaggerated transfer of cloud water to the rain class which then results in a strong decrease of the conversion rate and the rain production. The introduction of the GCCN reduces the anthropogenic increase of liquid water in the atmosphere from pre-industrial to present day because clouds are precipitating faster {{in the presence of the}} GCCN. Hence, the accumulation of liquid water in the atmosphere is reduced. According to those changes in the cloud properties, the radiative budget is also changing. The GCCN cause a reduction of the anthropogenic aerosol indirect effect of about 0. 1 &ndash; 0. 25 W m&minus; 2 which corresponds to 5 &ndash; 10 % of the total effect. Thus, the GCCN in ECHAM 5 partly offset the anthropogenic aerosol indirect effect...|$|E
