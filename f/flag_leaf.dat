50|$|It {{is closely}} related to Festuca brachyphylla. The plant is similar to boreal fescue (Festuca hyperborea) but has <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> (final leaf) blades that are 5 mm or longer and has larger spikelets. It grows in dense clumps without rhizomes.|$|E
50|$|Infections {{appear as}} dark, chocolate-colored blotches. The spots merge, {{eventually}} forming irregular necrotic patches on the leaves. Leaf spots may {{be surrounded by}} a zone of yellow leaf tissue of varying width. Spot may also appear on the leaf sheaths, necks and heads of the plant. Heavily infected leaves dry up completely, and infections on the <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> during kernel filling are the most serious.|$|E
50|$|The Russian {{wheat aphid}} (Diuraphis noxia) is an aphid {{that can cause}} {{significant}} losses in cereal crops. The species {{was introduced to the}} United States in 1986 and is considered an invasive species there. This aphid is pale green and up to 2 mm long. Cornicles are very short, rounded, and appear to be lacking. There is an appendage above the cauda giving the aphid the appearance of having two tails. The saliva of this aphid is toxic to the plant and causes whitish striping on cereal leaves. Feeding by this aphid will also cause the <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> to turn white and curl around the head causing incomplete head emergence. Host plants: cereal grain crops including wheat and barley and to a lesser extent, wild grasses such as wheatgrasses, brome-grasses, ryegrasses and anything in the grass family.|$|E

5000|$|Whole-plant {{studies also}} showed that the xeric and mesic types {{differed}} from each other for many characters such as the <b>flag</b> <b>leaf,</b> primary stem height, number of tillers, weight and number of seeds, dry weight, and flowering time, with the mesic ecotype being generally larger and more fecund, overall, than the xeric type; further, the flag leaves of the xeric type were consistently smaller than the mesic type under many conditions. [...] It was further shown that xeric populations that were monomorphic for the seed and leaf sheath characters and allozymes had less genetic variation for quantitative genetics characters than mesic populations; however, quantitative genetic variation existed in all xeric or mesic populations that were studied. Consequently, with all genetic characters studied, xeric populations of the xeric ecotype were more similar to each other than they were to the mesic ecotype, and the evidence indicated that the various ecotypes represented significant linkage disequilibrium and coadapted genetic complexes.|$|E
50|$|The Zadoks {{scale is}} a cereal {{development}} scale {{proposed by the}} Dutch phytopathologist Jan C. Zadoks that is widely used in cereal research and agriculture.Knowing the stages of development of a crop is critical in many management decisions that growers make. They are represented {{on a scale from}} 10 to 92. For example, in some countries, nitrogen and herbicide applications must be completed during the tillering stage. In France, the recommendation for the first nitrogen application on wheat is 6 weeks before Z30, with the second application on Z30. Wheat growth regulators are typically applied at Z30. Disease control is most critical in the stem extension and heading stage (Z31, Z32, Z35), in particular as soon as the <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> is out (Z37). The crop is also more sensitive to heat or frost at some stages than others (for example, during the meiosis stage the crop is very sensitive to low temperature). Knowing the growth stage of the crop when checking for problems is essential for deciding which control measures should be followed.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms of this {{pathogen}} {{can be seen}} on the stem, leaves, and glumes. Stem symptoms are not always present, but {{can be seen as a}} dark brown to purple discoloration on the stem below the head and above the <b>flag</b> <b>leaf.</b> 14 In the early stages of the disease, translucent water soaked streaks {{can be seen on}} the leaves often accompanied by a shiny glaze or clumps of dried bacteria on the leaf surface. 8 These markings turn to brown lesions after just a few days, and may be surrounded by a lime green halo. Lesions can stretch the entire leaf blade. BLS exhibits similar symptoms to those of Septoria nodorum, a common fungal infection. A common sign that will distinguish {{this pathogen}} from Septoria nodorum is the lack of spores on the leaves, which appears as tiny black spots on the leaf surface with a Septoria infection. A cream to yellow colored bacterial ooze produced by BLS infected plant parts is also a distinguishing sign of the pathogen.7Infected glumes, known as black chaff, are darkened and necrotic. Severe symptoms will result in kernels that are discolored due to black and purple streaks. 9 Plants infected with bacterial leaf streak will exhibit an orange cast from leaf symptoms and suffer yield and quality loss.14 ...|$|E

40|$|Cereal Leaf Beetle larvae (Oulema melanoplus (L)) {{appeared}} in leaf damaging numbers by June 1, 2006 {{in each of}} 2 spring wheat trials. Both trials were rated for CLB larvae per cent per M 2 at boot stage on June 15, 2006. <b>Flag</b> <b>leaf</b> loss was calculated in terms of per cent destruction of leaf surface on July 1. In an effort to estimate wheat <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> per cent surface lost by cereal leaf beetle larval feeding, flag leaves were sampled from a 1 / 4 meter square area in each of 4 replicates per treatment. Length of <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> was measured in centimeters for each replicate and means were produced statistically by AOV. Levels of <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> per cent losses were broken out for each treatment, with percentages in 5 % differences.

30|$|The {{pair-wise}} {{correlation analysis}} was conducted on length, width and length-width ratio of the <b>flag</b> <b>leaf,</b> and yield per plant in the core recombinant inbred lines of Liang-You-Pei-Jiu (LYP 9) developed in Hainan and Hangzhou. There were significant correlations among the three <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> size and shape traits. Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> width and yield per plant. Based on the high-resolution linkage map we constructed before, 43 QTLs were detected for three <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> size and shape traits and yield per plant, among which 31 QTLs were unreported so far. Seven QTLs were identified common in two environments. And qFLW 7.2, a new major QTL for <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> width, was fine mapped within 27.1  kb region on chromosome 7.

40|$|This {{field study}} was {{conducted}} in a factorial split plot experiment based on randomized complete block design with three replications to evaluate the effect of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer levels on physiological characteristics of four varieties of barley (Hordeum vulgare) during 2012 in Azad University of Miandoab. Irrigation levels were full irrigation, cutting off irrigation at boot stage (code 40 scale zadoks) and cutting off irrigation at flowering stage (code 60 scale zadoks). Nitrogen levels were 20, 40, 60 and 80 kg ha- 1. Varieties under study were ‘Makuyi’, ‘Valfajr’, ‘Sahra’ and ‘Jonoob’. Traits studied were seed yield, <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> area, chlorophyll content of <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> and proline content of <b>flag</b> <b>leaf,</b> and peducle length. The results showed that highest grain yield, <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> area, chlorophyll content of <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> and proline content were obtained by using 80 kg. ha- 1 nitrogen. Data collected also showed that at 80 kg. ha- 1 nitrogen and full irrigation, the highest and lowest grain yield, <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> area, chlorophyll content of <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> belonged  to ‘Makuyi’ and Jonoob, respectively. However, cuuting off irrigation at boot stage resulted in highest and lowest grain yield, <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> area, chlorophyll content of <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> to Jonoob and Valfajr, respectively. Cutting off irrigation at flowering stage decreased grain yield and increased proline content in ‘Makuyi’ and ‘Valfajr’. However, lowest reduction in grain yield, and highest increase in proline content were measured in ‘Sahra’ and ‘Jonoob’ varieties. Decreasing slope of regression curves was higher in ‘Makuyi’ and ‘Valfajr’. This indicates that cutting off irrigation at flowering stage reduced yield and increased proline content of these varieties compared to ‘Sahra’ and ‘Jonoob’...|$|E
40|$|Contribution {{to yield}} of cereals has {{traditionally}} been studied using yield and various yield components, thus neglecting the role of other organs such as ear awns and <b>flag</b> <b>leaf.</b> Here, we studied the effects of genotypes on the photosynthetic activity of the <b>flag</b> <b>leaf</b> blade and the ear awns of spring wheat.
