2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that all trap types are modifications of a similar basic structure—the hairy leaf. Hairy (or more specifically, stalked-glandular) leaves can catch and retain drops of rainwater, especially if shield-shaped or peltate, thus promoting bacteria growth.

Their use minimised many of the disadvantages associated with other commonly used tracers such as visible and fluorescent dyes, and {{it was possible to}} quantify each tracer when present on the target in ratios of up to 100 : 1. Each spray solution contained a single chelate at a metal concentration of 1 g litre(- 1). The recovery of metal chelates from plant tissue may not be quantitative, as a consequence of absorption or adsorption by leaves for example. The food colorant tartrazine, at a concentration of 10 g litre(- 1), was shown to be a suitable internal standard for estimation of percentage recovery. Combined spray deposits were recovered readily from apple leaves and fruit by aqueous extraction and analysed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The spray deposit of each metal tracer was calculated from the raw analytical data using procedures for generating calibration curves designed to optimise the accuracy of the analysis...|$|R

There is therefore, need {{to put in place}} interventions that will reduce the cost of production hence making tissue culture products affordable. In this research, a low cost protocol for cassava tissue culture was developed and used to regenerate two farmerpreferred cassava varieties, KME 1 and Muchericheri. Easygro® vegetative fertilizer, a locally available <b>foliar</b> <b>feed</b> was used as an alternative source for conventional MS salts.

The conventional MS medium was used as the control. The number of leaves, nodes, roots and average plant heights for the resultant plantlets were determined and compared. The variety Muchericheri had a significantly higher regeneration index compared to KME 1 having produced a mean of 6. 8 nodes on the low cost medium and 5. 6 nodes on the conventional medium compared to KME 1 which had a mean of 5. 6 nodes on the low cost medium and 4. 5 nodes on the conventional medium.

5000|$|In 2004, {{professional}} horticulturist Robert Sacilotto {{published a}} summary of measured tolerances of highland Nepenthes species, based on experiments conducted between 1996 and 2001. Nepenthes burbidgeae {{was found to be}} tolerant of a fairly wide range of conditions, particularly in terms of temperature and soil composition; it grew in every substrate used in the experiment. However, plants showed stunted growth when grown in a mixture consisting of 50% silica gel, 20% Sphagnum moss, 20% fir bark, and 10% peat moss chunks. The highest growth rates were exhibited by specimens in 50% leached perlite, 30% long fiber Sphagnum moss, 10% peat moss chunks, and 10% fir bark, as well as media without fir bark and with a higher percentage of Sphagnum. Nepenthes burbidgeae was found to tolerate temperatures in the range of 9 to 41 °C (48° to 105 °F). A nighttime drop in temperature below 18 °C (65 °F) was necessary for good growth; plants that were not exposed to such a drop grew around 50% slower and produced fewer pitchers. Optimal growth rates were observed with daytime temperatures of 20 to 29 °C (68° to 85 °F) and nighttime temperatures of 12 to 16 °C (54° to 60 °F). Soil with a pH of 4.8 to 5.5 produced the best results; values below 3.5 corresponded with slower growth. Optimal soil conductivity was between 10 and 24 microsiemens, and prolonged exposure of one week or more to levels of more than 60 microsiemens resulted in foliar burn. The experiments suggested that N. burbidgeae grows best when relative humidity is in the range of 68 to 95%. However, constant exposure to high humidity in excess of 90% resulted in disease outbreaks and increased plant death rates. Seedlings of less than one year proved to be particularly vulnerable to this. Optimal light levels varied depending on the light source used: 8100-11000 lx (750-1000 fc) in sunlight, 7000-9700 lx (650-900 fc) under high pressure sodium lamps, 6500-9100 lx (600-850 fc) under metal halide lamps, and 5400-7300 lx (500-680 fc) under fluorescent lamps. Nepenthes burbidgeae could be grown in lower light conditions, but such plants exhibited [...] growth and reduced colouration.

40|$|Insect pests {{that attempt}} to feed on the caterpillar-resistant maize {{genotype}} Mp 708 encounter a potent, multipronged defense system that thwarts their invasion. First, these plants are on “constant alert” due to constitutively elevated levels of the phytohormone jasmonic acid that signals the plant to activate its defenses. The higher jasmonic acid levels trigger the expression of defense genes prior to herbivore attack so the plants are “primed” and respond with a faster and stronger defense. The second defense is the rapid accumulation of a toxic cysteine protease called Mir 1 -CP in the maize whorl in response to caterpillar feeding. When caterpillars ingest Mir 1 -CP, it damages the insect's midgut and retards their growth. In this article, we discuss a third possible defense strategy employed by Mp 708. We have shown that <b>foliar</b> caterpillar <b>feeding</b> causes Mir 1 -CP and defense gene transcripts to accumulate in its roots. We propose that caterpillar feeding aboveground sends a signal belowground via the phloem that results in Mir 1 -CP accumulation in the roots. We also postulate that the roots serve as a reservoir of Mir 1 -CP that can be mobilized to the whorl in response to caterpillar assault...|$|R

40|$|Euclea natalensis A. DC. {{belongs to}} the Ebenaceae family, and is {{extensively}} distributed along the eastern coast of southern Africa. Many Euclea species are widely gathered by indigenous people because of their medicinal properties. Roots of these plant species are frequently used to treat respiratory complications such as chest pains, bronchitis, pleurisy and asthma. Ground root powder is topically applied in cases of leprosy and is used by some ethnic groups to treat toothache and headache. The bioactivity encountered is attributable to naphthoquinones, which are common phenolic compounds in the Ebenaceae family. Naphthoquinones isolated from E. natalensis (shinanolone, 7 -methyljuglone, diospyrin, isodiospyrin and neodiospyrin) have exhibited {{a broad spectrum of}} antimicrobial activity. The demand for these products will escalate due the amount of plant material required to further research. We need to explore techniques that can maximize their productivity. The present study was conducted on E. natalensis, in an attempt to establish if there exists any correlation between the accumulation of naphthoquinones and stages of seedling growth, seasonal fluctuations and application of fertilizers. A possible correlation between seedling growth stages and the accumulation of naphthoquinones (shinanolone, 7 -methyljuglone and diospyrin) was investigated in seeds and seedlings of Euclea natalensis. In this study, the seeds represented the first stage, whereas the second seedling stage was defined as the stage when the radicles were about 6 cm long. The lengths of the seedlings at the third, fourth and fifth seedling stages were 9 cm, 12 cm and 16 cm respectively. Plant materials collected from the five seedling stages were separately extracted using chloroform and the naphthoquinones were then quantified by means of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Mobile phase of MeCN: H 2 O: AcOH (62. 5 : 32. 5 : 5) was used as an eluent in an isocratic mode and at a flow rate of 0. 8 ml/min. Standard curves of each of the four compounds were obtained by making a series of dilutions in the concentration range of 22. 5 µg/ml to 2. 25 µg/ml. Ten microlitres of each dilution was injected three times into the HPLC, and the run time for each injection was 20 minutes. Calibration curves were then generated and used for the quantification of each compound. Shinanolone, which was the only naphthoquinone detectible in seeds, accumulated at variable rates (P< 0. 01) and no trend could be established between its synthesis and seedling growth. The content of shinanolone ranged from 87. 5 mg/kg dry weight (dw) in seeds to a high mean value of 1047 mg/kg (dw) during the fourth seedling stage. A significant correlation (P< 0. 01) was found between the mean concentrations of 7 -methyljuglone and seedling growth. 7 -Methyljuglone was quantified at a high mean level of 5003 mg/kg during the third seedling stage and was not detected in the seed samples. A positive correlation (P< 0. 01) was established between the concentration of diospyrin and seedling stages. Diospyrin was detected at an elevated mean concentration of 6182 mg/kg during the fifth seedling stage, which was higher than the other quantified naphthoquinones. Seasonal variation of naphthoquinones (shinanolone, 7 -methyljuglone, diospyrin, isodiospyrin and neodiospyrin) was investigated from eleven plants of E. natalensis subsp. natalensis growing in natural populations, over a period of four seasons. The roots were harvested, dried, extracted and analysed as in the previous study. The mean levels of shinanolone and 7 -methyljuglone were found to be uniform in all the seasons and no statistically significant variation could be found between seasonal changes and their mean concentrations. Accumulation of isodiospyrin and neodiospyrin varied significantly with seasonal changes (P< 0. 05). These two bioactive naphthoquinones were detected only in summer and autumn respectively, and not in winter. A statistically significant variation (P< 0. 05) was established between the levels of diospyrin and seasonal fluctuations. Diospyrin was detected at a mean concentration of 3190 mg/kg (dw) during spring, which was higher than the other naphthoquinones quantified in all four seasons. The effect of NPK fertilizers on growth performance and accumulation of naphthoquinones (shinanolone, 7 -methyljuglone, diospyrin, isodiospyrin and neodiospyrin) in seedlings of E. natalensis grown in shade and under field conditions was investigated. Each group was subdivided into four subgroups, which were then subjected to four respective treatments of water-soluble <b>foliar</b> <b>feed</b> (2 : 1 : 2 (44) NPK) at three different concentrations. Treatments tested were as follows: Treatment 1 at 40 g/l, Treatment 2 and Treatment 3 at 20 g/l and 10 g/l respectively. The control group received only supplemental water. The first harvest was conducted after 6 months of application of fertilizers and the second one was done after 12 months of treatment. Roots and shoots were harvested and analysed separately. The naphthoquinones were quantified as previously described. The bioactivity of root extracts from seedlings was tested against Mycobacterium smegmatis and extracts with lower MIC were further tested on M. tuberculosis. Growth parameters differed between the two groups, with seedlings from the shadehouse showing more plant vigour than the field grown plants. No significant interaction could be established between the measured growth factors and treatment. A significant interaction (P< 0. 001) was found between Treatment 2 and shadehouse seedlings. Treatment 2 enhanced vegetative performance with the mean values of fresh weight of shoots and roots being twice as much as their respective control mean values. A significantly positive correlation was established between the concentration of shinanolone (P< 0. 01), isodiospyrin (P< 0. 05) and neodiospyrin (P< 0. 05) with fertilization from field-grown seedlings. Application of NPK fertilizers significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the accumulation of neodiospyrin in seedlings subjected to shadehouse conditions. The most potent naphthoquinone, 7 -methyljuglone, was found to be abundant in all the extracts and was quantified at a high mean concentration of 10200 mg/kg from shadehouse seedlings. Root extracts of E. natalensis seedlings grown under field conditions were generally more active against the bacterial strain of M. smegmatis as compared to extracts acquired from roots of seedlings maintained under a shadehouse setting. A lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0. 78 mg/ml against M. smegmatis was observed from the second harvest of field-cultivated seedlings of the control and Treatment 1 subgroups. The MIC values for shadehouse seedlings ranged from 1. 6 to 6. 3 mg/ml. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values from all the extracts tested were relatively higher than their respective MIC’s. Root extracts of E. natalensis were more active against M. tuberculosis and their MIC values were lower than the tested concentrations. Extracts acquired from field-grown seedlings were more active against M. smegmatis with a lowest MIC value of 0. 78 mg/ml. Extracts from the control group and Treatment 1, which had less application of fertilizers were more active against strains of M. tuberculosis with MIC value of 10 µg/ml. This shows the selectivity of E. natalensis against the mycobacterial strain of M. tuberculosis. Based on the findings, synthesis and accumulation of naphthoquinones in E. natalensis is highly variable within individuals of the species investigated. Naphthoquinones accumulate in relatively higher amounts in roots of E. natalensis than in the aboveground structures, which validate their harvest by indigenous people. The concentration of shinanolone varied slightly and its production increased with seedling growth. The synthesis of 7 -methyljuglone is independent of fertilisation as its accumulation was enhanced in seedlings subjected to control treatment. Neodiospyrin and isodiospyrin were always present in every sample obtained from the seedlings but they were not detectible in every profile of samples from mature plants. Diospyrin is the only naphthoquinone that was detected in every sample analysed and also quantified in high concentrations from mature plants harvested in spring. The study showed that depending on the requirement of a particular naphthoquinone for research, one could target the seasons and seedling stages recommended from this study. This study also showed that field-cultivated seedlings produced more potent naphthoquinones than the ones subjected to controlled environments.

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} were conducted during 1999 / 2000 and 2000 / 2001 seasons at the Agricultural Research Station of National Research Center (NRC), Shalkan, Qalubia Governorate {{to study the}} possibility of {{reducing the amount of}} soil potassium fertilizers applied to feed faba bean through potassium <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding.</b> Five potassium treatments per feddan including negative (0. 0 kg K 2 O) and positive control (48 kg K 2 O) in addition to three treatments (36, 24 and 12 kg K 2 O) supplemented with potassium <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> were applied. No significant differences on plant height and branch number was found. Applying 36 kg K 2 O supplemented with foliar potassium feeding gave the highest marked increase in 100 seed weight, number of pods and seed yield. Applying the recommended soil potassium fertilizer (48 kg K 2 O) gave the highest increase in straw yield. Applying 36 kg K 2 O supplemented with foliar potassium feeding showed the highest leaf N, K and Fe, while 24 kg K 2 O supplemented with foliar potassium feeding showed the highest marked increase in leaf P concentration. No significant effect on leaf Mg, Mn and Zn due to potassium treatments were recorde...|$|E
40|$|In a pot {{experiment}} {{conducted in a}} phytotron, the effectiveness of <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> of different potassium salts, with and without the addition of 0. 5 % CO(NH 2) 2, in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) was investigated. Potassium was applied 3 times {{in the form of}} 1 % solutions KCl, KNO 3, K 2 SO 4 and C 6 H 5 K 3 O 7 &# 8226;H 2 O, compared to water as the control treatment. The obtained results show that <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> of potassium salts in spinach is an efficient method of supplementing the level of K + in plants during vegetation. Plants fed with KNO 3 had the highest content of potassium in leaves, and those fertilized with K 2 SO 4, C 6 H 5 K 3 O 7 × H 2 O and KCl had an only slightly lower potassium content. The application of potassium salts resulted in more intensive gas exchange in leaves (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, transpiration) and, as a consequence of that, increased leaf yield. Potassium nitrate and citrate influenced most effectively the abovementioned processes. The treatment of spinach with potassium salts resulted in an increased content of protein, chlorophyll, carotenoids, nitrates and iron as well as a decreased content of vitamin C and calcium in leaves...|$|E
40|$|Root feeding insects can {{influence}} foliar {{quality of the}} host plant, which can affect the development and behaviour of leaf herbivores and parasitoids. Thus far, such interactions {{have been reported in}} situations where root and leaf associated organisms share a host-plant. We tested whether root herbivory influences searching behaviour of an above-ground parasitoid when the <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> host of the parasitoid and the root herbivore are feeding on different plants. We manipulated the proportion of 25 plants (ranging from 0 to 1) exposed to root herbivory by Delia radicum (neighbouring-plants). Five additional plants were infested above-ground with Pieris brassicae larvae (host-infested plants) and were placed in-between the neighbouring plants. We then released females of the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata which attacks P. brassicae and studied foraging efficiency of the parasitoid. Overall, parasitoids located more host-infested plants during the maximum allowed searching time, and found their hosts about three times faster when neighbouring plants were exposed to root herbivory, than when neighbouring plants were not infested with D. radicum. Similar results were found when the host-infested plants were also exposed to root herbivory. Our results show that the interaction between an above-ground <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> insect and its parasitoid can be influenced by the presence of non-host herbivores feeding on the roots of neighbouring conspecific plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> on the nitrogen assimilation in alfalfa plants {{under conditions of}} Mo shortage was studied. It was established that foliar fertilization with 0. 3 % solution of Agroleaf® resulted in increase of nitrogen fixation and nitrogen assimilation {{in the absence of}} Mo. Insufficient molybdenum supply leads to significant reduction of plant Mo content and nitrogen-fixing activity, while stress induced amino acids as alanine, GABA, threonine, proline and serine increased repeatedly. The negative effect of Mo deficiency on the enzyme activities related to the primary nitrogen assimilation (NR, GS, GOGAT) and plant growth diminished due to the foliar absorbed nutrients...|$|E
40|$|In a pot {{experiment}} {{conducted in a}} phytotron, the effectiveness of foliar nutrition of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) with different magnesium salts with and without the addition of 0. 5 % CO(NH 2) 2 was studied. Magnesium was applied 3 times {{in the form of}} solutions of MgSO 4 x 7 H 2 O, Mg(NO 3) 2 x 6 H 2 O, MgCl 2 x 6 H 2 O, C 4 H 6 O 4 Mg x 4 H 2 O, compared to water as the control treatment. The obtained results showed that <b>foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> of spinach with inorganic magnesium salts was an efficient method for supplementing the Mg level in plants during the growing period. But the application of a metalo-organic complex in the form of magnesium acetate (C 4 H 6 O 4 Mg x 4 H 2 O) at a concentration of 1. 7 %, in spite of a similar effect on leaf Mg content, induced phytotoxic symptoms in the form of chlorotic and necrotic spots on the leaves. The application of the solutions of inorganic magnesium salts had a significant effect, resulting in more intensive leaf gas exchange (stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis) and an increase in leaf yield. Magnesium sulphate affected the abovementioned processes in the most effective way, while magnesium acetate had a negative impact. <b>Foliar</b> <b>feeding</b> of spinach with the magnesium salts resulted in an increased leaf content of protein, chlorophyll, carotenoids, nitrates and proline, but a decrease in vitamin C content. The addition of urea to the applied magnesium salt solutions increased the plant gas exchange rates and the leaf content of protein, chlorophyll, carotenoids, nitrates and proline, but it decreased the content of vitamin C, potassium and magnesium...|$|E
