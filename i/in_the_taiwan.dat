5|$|Typhoon Babs was a {{powerful}} typhoon that struck the Philippines (where it was locally known as Typhoon Loleng) just days after Typhoon Zeb hit the same area. The seventh typhoon of the 1998 season, Babs formed on October14 between the Philippines and Guam. The storm moved westward initially, failing to intensify initially due to the outflow from Typhoon Zeb to the northwest. Babs slowed and briefly turned to the south before advancing to the northwest, whereupon it rapidly intensified into a strong typhoon. On October20, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10‑minute winds of 155km/h (100mph), while the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (155mph), making Babs an unofficial super typhoon. The storm struck the Philippine island of Catanduanes at that intensity and weakened slightly before hitting Luzon. Babs turned northward once in the South China Sea, later weakening due to unfavorable conditions and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October27 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taiwan</b> Strait.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} {{of nuclear weapons}} by the ROC has been a contentious issue.

The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President Clinton to invoke the Taiwan Relations Act and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC's missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned.

25|$|On 1 September 1957, {{her home}} port was changed from Alameda to Long Beach, California, {{and she was}} {{reclassified}} an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft carrier with the new designation CVS-10. On 23 September, she departed Alameda and, four days later, entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for overhaul and for modification to an ASW carrier. That yard period lasted {{until the beginning of}} February 1958. She departed the naval ammunition depot at Bangor, Washington on 7 February and entered Long Beach five days later. For the next eight months, Yorktown conducted normal operations along the west coast. On 1 November, she departed San Diego to return to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 8–17 November, Yorktown continued her voyage west and arrived in Yokosuka on 25 November. During that deployment, the aircraft carrier qualified for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal on three occasions. The first time came on 31 December and 1 January 1959, when she participated in an American show of strength in response to the communist Chinese shelling of the offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu, held by Nationalist Chinese forces. During January, she also joined contingency forces off Vietnam during internal disorders caused by communist guerrillas in the southern portion of that country. That month she earned the expeditionary medal for service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taiwan</b> Strait. The remainder of the deployment—save for another visit to Vietnamese waters late in March—consisted of a normal round of training evolutions and port visits. She concluded that tour of duty at San Diego on 21 May. The warship resumed normal operations along the west coast, and that duty consumed the remainder of 1959.|$|E
