The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how a White teacher (Gina) responded to African American Language (AAL) <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that {{situated}} students as valuable members of a high school English classroom. This 5 -month qualitative study in a 10 th grade classroom drew from positioning theory and discourse analysis to make sense of classroom interactions with AAL. Findings show that although Gina was not fluent in AAL, she leveraged it <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that positioned students as members of the literacy community by doing the following: (a) opening opportunities for students to use AAL <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that contributed to the community, (b) not dismissing or ridiculing the use of AAL, and (c) maintaining a classroom of respect when AAL was used <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that disrespected that community. Implications from the study suggest that teaching high school English is not only about knowledge of content or best practices but also about leveraging multiple languages <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that position students as participants of a literacy community.

5|$|D. s. sumatrensis, {{known as}} the Western Sumatran rhinoceros, which has only 75 to 85 rhinos remaining, mostly in the {{national}} parks of Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser in Sumatra, but also <b>in</b> <b>Way</b> Kambas National Park in small numbers. They have recently gone extinct in Peninsular Malaysia. The main threats against this subspecies are habitat loss and poaching. A slight genetic difference is noted between the Western Sumatran and Bornean rhinos. The rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia were once known as D. s. niger, but were later recognized to be a synonym of D. s. sumatrensis. Three males and four females currently live in captivity at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas, the youngest male having been bred and born there in 2012. Another calf, a female, was born at the sanctuary in May 2016. The sanctuary's two males were born at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.|$|E
