Out of the blue, 2 ̆ 2 Big Data 2 ̆ 2 has become a topic in board-level discussions. The abundance of data will change many jobs across all industries. Moreover, also scientific research is becoming more data-driven. Therefore, we reflect on the emerging data science discipline. Just like computer science emerged as a new discipline from mathematics when computers became abundantly available, we now see the birth of data science as a new discipline driven by the torrents of data available today. We believe that the data scientist will be the engineer of the future. Therefore, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) established the Data Science Center Eindhoven (DSC/e).

25|$|In the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel architecture for data analytics targeting an anticipatory learning {{process in the}} context <b>of</b> the <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> Mobile <b>Things.</b> The architecture is geo-distributed and composed by edge, fog, and cloud resources that operate collectively to support such an anticipatory learning process. We designed the architecture to manage large volumes of data streams coming from the IoMT devices, analyze in successive phases climbing up {{in the hierarchy of}} resources from edge, fog and cloud. We discuss the characteristics of the analytical tasks at each layer. We notice that the amount of data being transported in the network decreases going from the edge, to the fog and finally to the cloud, while the complexity of the computation increases. Such design allows to support different kind of analytical needs, from real-time to historical according to the type of resource being utilized. We have implemented the proposed architecture as a proof-of-concept using the transit data feeds from the area of Greater Moncton, Canada.

40|$|The <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> Moving <b>Things</b> (IoMT) {{requires}} {{support for}} a data life cycle process ranging from sorting, cleaning and monitoring data streams to more complex tasks such as querying, aggregation, and analytics. Current solutions for stream data management in IoMT have been focused on partial aspects of a data life cycle process, with special emphasis on sensor networks. This paper aims {{to address this problem}} by developing streaming data life cycle process that incorporates an edge/fog/cloud architecture that is needed for handling heterogeneous, streaming and geographically-dispersed IoMT devices. We propose a 3 -tier architecture to support an instant intra-layer communication that establishes a stream data flow in real-time to respond to immediate data life cycle tasks in the system. Communication and process are thus the defining factors in the design of our stream data management solution for IoMT. We describe and evaluate our prototype implementation using real-time transit data feeds. Preliminary results are showing the advantages of running data life cycle tasks for reducing the volume of data streams that are redundant and should not be transported to the cloud.

30|$|The {{proliferation}} of electronic devices equipped with Wi-Fi transceivers has favored the rapid deployment of large-scale wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on Wi-Fi backbone in several highly dense urban {{areas of the}} world [1, 2], which is considered a cheaper alternative to the traditional cabling solutions for the Internet access and <b>Internet</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> (IoT). However, the performance of WMNs is still not competitive since the mesh nodes in highly dense urban environments must share the 2.4 -GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) channels with several external devices, primary nodes (PNs), that cannot be governed by the mesh nodes and possibly interfere with the WMNs transmissions. Cognitive radio (CR) researches have mainly investigated the potential of reconfigurable radio technology for enabling an opportunistic spectrum access paradigm [3, 4], in which a cognitive device exploits the portions of the spectrum left vacant and less interfered multi-hop routes by the licensed users. While this solution can effectively improve the spectrum utilization of wireless communication, it also poses formidable challenges for its implementation, e.g., the legacy aspects for the utilization of licensed spectrum and the protection of the licensed users.|$|R
