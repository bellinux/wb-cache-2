5|$|In the Middle Adriatic Basin, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of Permian volcanism in the area of Komiža on the island of Vis, in addition to the volcanic islands of Jabuka and Brusnik. Earthquakes are frequent in the area around the Adriatic Sea, although most are too faint to be felt; an earthquake doing significant damage happens <b>every</b> <b>few</b> decades, with major earthquakes <b>every</b> <b>few</b> centuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{rare cases}} where {{none of the}} oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) <b>every</b> <b>few</b> weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} {{portion of its}} range, wood turtles are more aquatic. In the east, wood turtles are decidedly more terrestrial, {{especially}} during the summer. During this time, they {{can be found in}} wooded areas with wide open canopies. However, even here, they are never far from water and will enter it <b>every</b> <b>few</b> days.|$|E
30|$|Naturally, {{coefficients}} mean {{different things}} for countries depending on {{not only their}} level of unemployment but also their level of expenditure {{in each of the}} policies. For example, based on the above results, a country with a 10 % unemployment rate (such as France or the United States in 2010) would need to spend around US$ 5, 600 (PPP) in training measures for <b>every</b> <b>fewer</b> unemployed (i.e. cost of reducing 1 for every 10 unemployed in a country with an unemployment rate of 10 %). Following the same logic, this same country would need to spend around US$ 6, 200 (PPP) in the policy cluster and US$ 3, 600 (PPP) in start-up incentives for <b>every</b> <b>fewer</b> unemployed. According to this, start-up incentives would be more effective in reducing unemployment than both the policy cluster and training. This finding is in line with results from micro-econometric analyses showing that start-up incentives are associated with a ‘double dividend’ if subsidized firms create more jobs in the future (Caliendo and Künn 2014).|$|R

5|$|Bell {{explained}} that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise {{all of the}} series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken <b>every</b> <b>few</b> weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, {{a member of the}} series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the water}} {{remaining}} in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts {{for a few seconds}} <b>every</b> <b>few</b> minutes, while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10minutes every 8–12hours.|$|E

Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death {{on the front porch}} of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play <b>every</b> <b>few</b> minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
