6000|$|But, as General Taylor is, par excellence, {{the hero}} of the Mexican War, and as you <b>Democrats</b> <b>say</b> we Whigs have always opposed the war, you think it must be very awkward and {{embarrassing}} for us to go for General Taylor. The declaration that we have always opposed the war is true or false, according as one may understand the term [...] "oppose the war." [...] If to say [...] "the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President" [...] by opposing the war, then the Whigs have very generally opposed it. Whenever they have spoken at all, they have said this; and they have said it on what has appeared good reason to them. The marching an army into the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement, frightening the inhabitants away, leaving their growing crops and other property to destruction, to you may appear a perfectly amiable, peaceful, unprovoking procedure; but it does not appear so to us. So to call such an act, to us appears no other than a naked, impudent absurdity, and we speak of it accordingly. But if, when the war had begun, and had become the cause of the country, the giving of our money and our blood, in common with yours, was support of the war, then it is not true that we have always opposed the war. With few individual exceptions, you have constantly had our votes here for all the necessary supplies. And, more than this, you have had the services, the blood, and the lives of our political brethren in every trial and on every field. The beardless boy and the mature man, the humble and the distinguished--you have had them. Through suffering and death, by disease and in battle they have endured and fought and fell with you. Clay and Webster each gave a son, never to be returned. From the State of my own residence, besides other worthy but less known Whig names, we sent Marshall, Morrison, Baker, and Hardin; they all fought, and one fell, and in the fall of that one we lost our best Whig man. Nor were the Whigs few in number, or laggard in the day of danger. In that fearful, bloody, breathless struggle at Buena Vista, where each man's hard task was to beat back five foes or die himself, of the five high officers who perished, four were Whigs.|$|E

Such comments reinforce the perception of Rupert Murdoch's network as a conservative bastion - an image that Fox News President Roger Ailes insists is not the case. One reason for Fox's right-leaning reputation early on was its prime-time talk lineup. As even some network insiders acknowledge, the chat consistently tilts to the conservative side.|$|E

40|$|As the 2016 presidential {{campaign}} {{heads into the}} final stretch, Americans remain just as frustrated and angry about the election as in May when the primaries were drawing to a close. In the latest national poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, the public says their issues and concerns are not being addressed by the campaigns, and {{there is too much}} focus on personal aspects of the candidates and not enough on their qualifications. The issues that matter most to the public overall are health care, Social Security, education, and terrorism, although Republicans care more about terrorism while Democrats are more concerned with health care. Regardless of party affiliation, Americans consider the economy and education to be of great importance to them personally. But partisan divisions are found in the level of importance assigned to many other issues asked about in the survey. For example, three-quarters of <b>Democrats</b> <b>say</b> the environment and climate change are extremely or very important to them personally. Only about 4 in 10 Republicans agree. And {{on the other side of}} the aisle, more than 8 in 10 Republicans consider the national debt to be extremely or very important, along with just 6 in 10 Democrats. While disappointed in the focus of the 2016 election, this campaign is drawing the public's attention. Two-thirds of Americans say the election interests them in general, and 6 in 10 have paid a good deal of attention to the campaign so far.   In comparison, four years ago, less than half of voters surveyed by The New York Times and CBS News said they were paying a lot of attention to the {{presidential campaign}} between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. But interest was at similar levels in September during Obama's first presidential campaign against John McCain. At the time, a New York Times/CBS News poll found 63 percent said they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign. The nationwide poll of 1, 022 adults was part of the AmeriSpeak® Omnibus, a monthly multi-client survey using NORC at the University of Chicago's probability-based panel. Interviews were conducted between September 15 and 18, 2016, online and using landlines and cell phones. Three Things You Should Know about The AP-NORC Poll on important issues to Americans: Among All American Adults [...] . Most Americans say the presidential campaign is focusing too much on the candidates' personal characteristics and not enough on their qualifications or the issues that matter most. The issues that matter most to the public overall are health care, Social Security, education, and terrorism, although partisan differences exist in the levels of importance. While most Americans are disappointed in the focus of the campaign, they are interested and paying attention to news about the 2016 presidential election...|$|E

Doggett has stressed his long tenure as a progressive <b>Democrat,</b> <b>saying</b> he wants to “stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care, and also notes his strong support for both higher education programs and public education.” By contrast, Romo’s campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth.|$|R

Footage of a baby chicken chirping was shown during the ad, interpreted by some as comparing her to a chick.

In her resignation speech, Kernot did not criticise the <b>Democrats,</b> <b>saying</b> her motivation was due to a [...] "growing sense of outrage at the damage being done to Australia by the Howard Government" [...] and that her position leading a minor party in the Senate meant she [...] "had a limited capacity to help minimise that damage".

5000|$|Regarding the Obama {{economic}} stimulus package of 2009, McCain said [...] "I think we are clearly prepared to sit down, discuss, negotiate a true stimulus package that will create jobs," [...] but opposed the package as proposed by the White House {{on the grounds that}} it incorporated federal policy changes that had nothing to do with near-term job creation. [...] McCain emerged as a chief opponent of the package in subsequent discussions, and continued to oppose it even after it was reduced in scope to gain the support of a group of centrist Republicans and <b>Democrats,</b> <b>saying,</b> “We want to stimulate the economy, not mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren by the kind of fiscally profligate spending embodied in this legislation.” [...] McCain continued his opposition to the final version of the bill that passed, saying it represented [...] "generational theft" [...] and complaining that a truly bipartisan approach was not taken towards forming the bill.
