40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{maintenance of}} materialized views in a warehousing environment, where views reside {{on a remote}} database. We analyze so called Change Data Capture techniques used to capture changes (also referred to as <b>deltas)</b> at the source systems. We show that many existing CDC techniques do not provide com-plete <b>deltas</b> but rather incomplete (or partial) <b>deltas.</b> Traditional view maintenance techniques, however, require complete <b>deltas</b> as input. We propose a generalized tech-nique that allows for maintaining a class of materialized views using partial <b>deltas.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{have found}} a number of {{examples}} of <b>deltas</b> that formed in Martian lakes. Finding <b>deltas</b> is a major sign that Mars once {{had a lot of}} liquid water. <b>Deltas</b> usually require deep water {{over a long period of}} time to form. Also, the water level needs to be stable to keep sediment from washing away. <b>Deltas</b> have been found over a wide geographical range, though there is some indication that <b>deltas</b> may be concentrated around the edges of the putative former northern ocean of Mars.|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from social}} fraternities and sororities on campus, {{there are also}} a number of {{professional}} organizations as well. There are Kappa Gamma <b>Delta,</b> a prehealth sorority, Sigma Mu <b>Delta,</b> a prehealth fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, a coed service fraternity, Phi Alpha <b>Delta,</b> a pre-law fraternity, and <b>Delta</b> Sigma Pi, a co-ed professional business fraternity.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{organizations}} have historical significance at NYU. <b>Delta</b> Phi Epsilon, Zeta Psi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Tau <b>Delta</b> Phi, Alpha Kappa Psi and <b>Delta</b> Sigma Pi were founded at NYU. Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America was chartered in 1847, <b>Delta</b> Sigma Pi in 1907, and Alpha Epsilon Pi in 1913. <b>Delta</b> Phi Epsilon {{was founded in}} 1917. The NYU Gamma chapter of <b>Delta</b> Phi, founded in 1841, is the longest continuously active fraternity chapter in the world, having never gone inactive since its establishment. <b>Delta</b> Phi is also the oldest continuously active fraternity in the United States, being the only organization in the original Union Triad to remain active since its institute. The NYU Gamma chapter of Zeta Beta Tau is the oldest active ΖΒΤ chapter in the country.|$|E
5|$|In the 1975–76 season, <b>Delta</b> State and Immaculata {{met again}} in the {{national}} tournament final. Harris again led <b>Delta</b> State with 30 points and 18 rebounds in a 69–64 victory. That season, she {{led the nation in}} scoring with 1,060 points and a 31.2 points per game average, including a 58-point game against Tennessee Tech. In her senior season, <b>Delta</b> State played a game in the Madison Square Garden, in which Harris scored 47 points. This {{was one of the first}} women's basketball game ever played there. <b>Delta</b> State then went to the national tournament final for the third year in a row. In the final, Harris scored 23 points and recorded 16 rebounds as <b>Delta</b> State defeated Louisiana State University 68–55 for their third consecutive title.|$|E

5|$|Mice {{have been}} used as an {{experimental}} system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of nerve-cell GABA receptor subtype <b>delta</b> was high. Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory, nerve cells with more <b>delta</b> receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of <b>delta</b> receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of <b>delta</b> receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.|$|E

50|$|Kame <b>deltas</b> form in {{association}} with other glacial features such as, kettles and eskers.

40|$|Worldwide, <b>deltas</b> host dense {{populations and}} are {{important}} centres of agricultural and industrial production, and economic activity. Many <b>deltas</b> are areas of great ecological importance as well, featuring wetlands {{of high and}} unique biodiversity. <b>Deltas</b> are vulnerable to changes by natural forces and human activities. Major drivers of change are population growth, economic development, climate change and subsidence...|$|R
50|$|Lava <b>deltas,</b> {{similar to}} river <b>deltas</b> form {{wherever}} sufficient sub-aerial flows of lava enter standing bodies of water. The lava cools and breaks up as it encounters the water, with the resulting fragments {{filling in the}} adjacent seabed topography such that the flow can move further offshore sub-aerially. Lava <b>deltas</b> are generally associated with large-scale, effusive type basaltic volcanism.|$|R

5|$|As <b>Delta</b> {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that <b>Delta</b> had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm <b>Delta</b> lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Delta</b> Serpentis, forming part of {{the body}} of the snake between the heart and the head, is a {{multiple}} star system positioned around 70 parsecs from Earth. Consisting of four stars, the system has a total apparent magnitude of 3.79 as viewed from Earth, although two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.80, provide nearly all the light. The primary, a white subgiant, is a <b>Delta</b> Scuti variable with an average apparent magnitude of 4.23. Positioned very near <b>Delta,</b> both in the night sky and likely in actual space at an estimated distance of around 70 parsecs, is the barium star 16 Serpentis. Another notable variable star {{visible to the naked eye}} is Chi Serpentis, an Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable situated midway between <b>Delta</b> and Beta which varies from its median brightness of 5.33 by 0.03 magnitudes over a period of approximately 1.5 days.|$|E

30|$|Shelf-edge <b>deltas</b> are a {{class of}} <b>deltas</b> {{developed}} {{at or near the}} shelf edge. Shelf-edge <b>deltas</b> have received much attention in recent years because of their role as the staging area for delivery of sediment to deep-water environments, and because of a focus of hydrocarbon exploration in shelf-edge settings. They are well known in their geometry and morphology, especially from the Gulf of Mexico shelf margin (e.g., Edwards 1981; Suter and Berryhill 1985; Morton and Suter 1996) and a recent shelf edge in Offshore Nigeria (e.g., Adereti et al. 2012; Fieldman et al. 2013). These cases show clearly that shelf-edge <b>deltas</b> tend to be thicker and show much more evidence of instability and collapse compared to inner shelf <b>deltas.</b> The exposures from outer shelf to upper slope make it possible to analyse the variability of shelf-edge <b>deltas</b> in response to supply variability and to the gradient increase from outer shelf to shelf-edge environments (Dixon et al. 2011). Research by Dixon et al. 2011 showed that river-dominated shelf-edge <b>deltas</b> transport large volumes of sand to the upper slope, even when major shelf-edge incisions are absent.|$|R
