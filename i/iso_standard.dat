40|$|Construction {{industry}} plays {{very important}} role in development of any country. The development of construction industry depends to a larger extent on quality of construction productions and projects. Quality of construction productions and projects is linked {{with the implementation of}} QMS (Quality Management System) in construction organizations. ISO certification is one of the QMS which has been adopted in manufacturing and construction industry at the global level. The construction companies of developing countries have reaped many advantages from the effective implementation of <b>ISO</b> <b>standards.</b> The rate of adoption of <b>ISO</b> <b>standards</b> has remained slow in the construction sector of some developing countries like Pakistan. This paper presents the literature review of ISO in global construction industry. It highlights the advantages, disadvantages and barriers faced by construction companies in the implementation of <b>ISO</b> <b>standards.</b> This study also investigates the level of adoption of <b>ISO</b> <b>standards</b> in construction and manufacturing companies of Pakistan through a questionnaire survey. It presents the comparison of <b>ISO</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{widespread}} use of <b>ISO</b> <b>standard</b> containers has driven modifications in other freight-moving standards, gradually forcing removable truck bodies or swap bodies into standard sizes and shapes (though without the strength needed to be stacked), and changing completely the worldwide use of freight pallets that fit into ISO containers or into commercial vehicles.|$|E

25|$|XML is {{a profile}} of an <b>ISO</b> <b>standard</b> SGML, and most of XML comes from SGML unchanged.

Removed were the SGML declaration (XML has a fixed delimiter set and adopts Unicode as the document character set).|$|E
25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an <b>ISO</b> <b>standard</b> container that {{is loaded}} and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E
25|$|The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) {{also has}} a {{specific}} Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with <b>ISO</b> <b>standards.</b> Some CEN cycle standards were developed before <b>ISO</b> published their <b>standards,</b> leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while <b>ISO</b> <b>standards</b> have historically harmonized parts geometry.|$|R

25|$|Every {{piece of}} {{railroad}} rolling stock operating in North American interchange service {{is required to}} carry a standardized set of reporting marks. The marks {{are made up of}} a two- to four-letter code identifying the owner of the equipment accompanied by an identification number and statistics on the equipment's capacity and tare (unloaded) weight. Marks whose codes end in X (such as TTGX) are used on equipment owned by entities that are not common carrier railroads themselves. Marks whose codes end in U are used on containers that are carried in intermodal transport, and marks whose codes end in Z are used on trailers that are carried in intermodal transport, per <b>ISO</b> <b>standard</b> 6346). Most freight cars carry automatic equipment identification RFID transponders.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional dictionaries, which {{are designed to}} be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary {{does not need to be}} able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an <b>ISO</b> <b>standard</b> called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.|$|E
25|$|ISO/IEC 6937:2001, Information {{technology}} — Coded {{graphic character}} set for text communication — Latin alphabet, is a multibyte extension of ASCII, or rather of ISO/IEC 646-IRV. It {{was developed in}} common with ITU-T (then CCITT) for telematic services {{under the name of}} T.51, and first became an <b>ISO</b> <b>standard</b> in 1983. Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with diacritics (accents). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on. Only certain combinations of lead byte and follow byte are allowed, and there are some exceptions to the lead byte interpretation for some follow bytes. However, that no combining characters at all are encoded in ISO/IEC 6937. But one can represent some free-standing diacritics, often by letting the follow byte have the code for ASCII space.|$|E

25|$|A {{reference}} {{simulation software}} implementation, {{written in the}} C language and later known as ISO 11172-5, was developed (in 1991–1996) {{by the members of}} the ISO MPEG Audio committee in order to produce bit compliant MPEG Audio files (Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3). It was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC technical report in March 1994 and printed as document CD 11172-5 in April 1994. It was approved as a draft technical report (DTR/DIS) in November 1994, finalized in 1996 and published as international standard ISO/IEC TR 11172-5:1998 in 1998. The reference software in C language was later published as a freely available <b>ISO</b> <b>standard.</b> Working in non-real time on a number of operating systems, it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding (DSP based) of compressed audio. Some other real time implementation of MPEG Audio encoders and decoders were available for the purpose of digital broadcasting (radio DAB, television DVB) towards consumer receivers and set top boxes.|$|E

500|$|Misunderstanding of how Null {{works is}} the cause of a great number of errors in SQL code, both in <b>ISO</b> <b>standard</b> SQL {{statements}} and in the specific SQL dialects supported by real-world database management systems. These mistakes are usually the result of confusion between Null and either 0 (zero) or an empty string (a string value with a length of zero, represented in SQL as [...] ). [...] Null is defined by the SQL standard as different from both an empty string and the numerical value 0, however. While Null indicates the absence of any value, the empty string and numerical zero both represent actual values.|$|E
