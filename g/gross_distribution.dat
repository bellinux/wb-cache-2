The analysis is based on the image method, which expands the array into a series of reflected virtual replicas that interfere to create a strong focal spot. This setup allows the acoustic field to be approximately expressed as the product of two terms, one of which depends on the free-space directivity of the array, and the other one on the environmental properties. The former dictates the <b>gross</b> <b>distribution</b> of acoustic energy in the water column, while the latter defines the fine-scale variations and the effective size of the focus. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{gravitational}} lensing on {{cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) anisotropies is investigated using the power spectrum approach. The lensing effect can be calculated in any cosmological model by specifying the evolution of gravitational potential. Previous work on this subject is generalized to a non-flat universe and to a nonlinear evolution regime and some erroneous expressions in the previous literature are corrected. Gravitational lensing cannot change the <b>gross</b> <b>distribution</b> of CMB anisotropies, but it may redistribute the power and smooth the sharp features in the CMB power spectrum. The magnitude of this effect is estimated using observational constraints on the power spectrum of gravitational potential from galaxy and cluster surveys and also using the limits on correlated ellipticities in distant galaxies. For realistic CMB power spectra the effect on CMB multipole moments is less then a few percent on degree angular scales, but gradually increases towards smaller scales. On arcminute angular scales the acoustic oscillation peaks may be partially or completely erased because of the gravitational lensing...|$|E

More detail was obtained from a longitudinal profile scan made at 10 cm intervals with a slit-collimated detector. A general labelling of the skeleton consistent with bone surface deposition was observed, together with a pronounced increased concentration in the thorax. A transverse profile scan was made at the point which had yielded the highest counting rate in the longitudinal scan.

40|$|Proteins of {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex class I (MHCI) {{are known for their}} role in immunity and have recently been implicated in long-term plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission. However, the mechanisms by which MHCI influences synaptic plasticity remain unknown. Here we show that endogenous MHCI regulates synaptic responses mediated by NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The AMPA/NMDA ratio is decreased at MHCI-deficient hippocampal synapses, reflecting an increase in NMDAR-mediated currents. This enhanced NMDAR response is not associated with changes in the levels, subunit composition, or <b>gross</b> subcellular <b>distribution</b> of NMDARs. Increased NMDAR-mediated currents in MHCI-deficient neurons are associated with characteristic changes in AMPA receptor trafficking in response to NMDAR activation.

The <b>gross</b> <b>distribution</b> of receptors is in excellent accord with the distribution determined by filtration binding assays. Specifically, the density of glycine receptors is greatest in the gray matter of the spinal cord and decreases progressively in regions more rostra 1 in the neuraxis. Glycine receptors {{were found to be}} associated with both sensory and motor systems in the CNS. Moreover, there is a striking correlation between areas of high strychnine binding site density and areas in which glycine {{has been found to be}} electrophysiologically active. Finally, the anatomic localization of strychnine binding sites may help explain many of the signs and symptoms of strychnine ingestion. For example, individuals consuming subconvulsive doses of strychnine frequently experience altered cutaneous and auditory sensation. We have localized strychnine receptors in areas of the acoustic system known to influence discriminative aspects of audition and in areas of the spinal cord and trigeminal nuclei which modulate discriminative aspects of cutaneous sensation. The alteration of visceral functions (e. g., blood pressure and respiratory rate) associated with strychnine ingestion may be accounted for in a similar manner.

40|$|The Bonaparte Basin (NW Australia) forms a rare, {{recent example}} where Neogene {{deformation}} shaped {{a very wide}} platform (630 km wide) in which a mixed carbonate-silliciclastic sedimentary sequence developed. This study combines structural and stratigraphic analysis and provides new insights as {{to the role of}} tectonics in controlling platform shape and sediment distribution in wide shallow water settings. Detailed analysis of the structure and stratigraphy of {{the northern part of the}} Bonaparte Basin allowed identification of the main regimes and phases of deformation and their control on sedimentation during the Neogene. The results reveal that the distribution of Neogene sediments across the northern Bonaparte Basin is mainly controlled by flexure-induced deformation mechanisms associated locally with extensional faults and low-strain, left-lateral strike-slip. These processes ultimately shaped the geometry and sedimentary architecture of the wide continental shelf. They led to the development of two different types of tectonically induced shelf depocentres that controlled the <b>gross</b> <b>distribution</b> of Quaternary sediments. In particular, deformation processes enhanced the formation of the carbonate-dominated, 200 m-deep Malita intra-shelf basin. The Bonaparte Basin is a prime natural laboratory to describe the links between tectonics and sedimentation along a very large, mixed carbonate/clastic platform and could be used as a modern analogue to similar settings in the past Earth's history.

The lipid systems were fabricated into tablets and stored for up to 180 days at temperatures of 20 and 37 °C. The dispersions were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy, and dissolution testing. DSC studies indicated that the Gelucire 50 / 13 exists in two principal melting forms (melting points 38 and 43 °C) that undergo transformation to the higher melting form on storage at 37 °C. Scanning electron microscopy studies indicated that the systems exhibit “blooming,” with crystal formation on the surface being apparent on storage at both temperatures. The dissolution rate increased on storage, with the effect being particularly marked at higher storage temperatures and for the paracetamol systems. However, whereas these changes corresponded well to those seen for the morphology, the correlation between the changes in dissolution and those of the DSC profiles was poor. The study has suggested a novel explanation for the storage instability of Gelucire 50 / 13 whereby the change in dissolution is associated not with molecular rearrangement as such but with the <b>gross</b> <b>distribution</b> of the constituent components, this in turn altering the physical integrity of the lipid bases...|$|E
