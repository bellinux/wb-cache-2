A short time later, the agents are approached {{by a man named}} Ramirez, who claims that the trees are all dying because of a [...] "very bad man." [...] Meanwhile, Karin invites Lisa to stay at her home until her aunt can pick her up the following day. As Lisa listens from her bedroom, she overhears an argument between Karin and a male voice. When she descends into Karin's root cellar, she discovers the skeletal body of a man. Terrified, Lisa turns towards the door, only to have the door close and lock.|$|E
2500|$|Like Archipenko and Csaky, both Lipchitz and Henri Laurens {{were aware}} of {{primitive}} African art, though hardly evident in their works. Lipchitz collected African art from 1912 on, but Laurens, in fact, {{appears to have been}} entirely unaffected by African art. Both his early reliefs and three-dimensional sculptures attach problems posed by Cubist painters first. Lipchitz and Laurens were concerned with giving tangible substance to idea first pronounced by Jean Metzinger in his 1910 Note sur la peinture of simultaneous multiple views. [...] "They were", as Goldwater notes, [...] "undoubtedly impressed with the natural three-dimensionality of African sculpture and with its rhythmic interplay of solid and related void. But in its frontality and mass, though often composed of cubic shapes, it was anything but cubist, and was indeed, fundamentally anti-cubist in conception". The African sculptor, writes Goldwater, [...] "whether his forms were rectangular, elliptical, or round in outline, and whether he cut back little or much into the cylinder of <b>fresh</b> <b>wood</b> with which he began, was content to show one aspect of his figure at a time". Goldwater continues: :"He achieved his [...] "instinctive" [...] three-dimensional effect by calculated simplification and separation of parts that allowed the eye to grasp each one as a unified, coherent mass. The cubist sculptor, on the other hand, wished to [...] "make his figure turn" [...] by simultaneously showing or suggesting frontal and orthogonal planes, by flattening diagonals, and by swinging other hidden surfaces into view." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{unconscious}} man {{was placed}} in a comfortable position near the fire, which was heaped up with <b>fresh</b> <b>wood,</b> that all might dry themselves, and Watson went to work to restore Slavin.|$|E

5000|$|Page owns a {{farmhouse}} near Toronto. At some point {{prior to the}} recording of Barenaked for the Holidays, he invested in building a recording studio at his farmhouse, which he has named <b>Fresh</b> Baked <b>Woods.</b> The band's first record there was the aforementioned Holidays album. The band also used the studio for the recording sessions for the Barenaked Ladies Are Me / Barenaked Ladies Are Men albums. Page acquired the console from Le Studio, where the band recorded Gordon (among the many famous albums recorded at that studio), and integrated some of its equipment into the console at <b>Fresh</b> Baked <b>Woods.</b>|$|R
60|$|The men in {{the boat}} were told to row direct for the light, {{and some of the}} sweeps were got out and helped the vessel through the water. As they drew near, they could make out Giuseppi {{throwing}} <b>fresh</b> <b>wood</b> on the fire.|$|E
60|$|Whopper {{remained}} on guard first, and about midnight {{he was relieved}} by Snap. The leader of the club had just put some <b>fresh</b> <b>wood</b> on the fire {{when he heard a}} strange sound some distance from the shelter. Then came a mocking laugh.|$|E
60|$|The {{greater part}} of that day was spent in rearranging the {{habitable}} parts of Willow Creek, and placing the more delicate valuables further out of danger.

60|$|The chances, naturally, {{are against}} the young contributor, and vastly against him; but if any {{periodical}} is to live, and to live long, it is by the infusion of new blood; and nobody knows this better than the editor, who may seem so unfriendly and uncareful to the young contributor. The strange voice, the novel scene, the odor of <b>fresh</b> <b>woods</b> and pastures new, the breath of morning, the dawn of tomorrow--these are what the editor is eager for, if he is fit to be an editor at all; and these are what the young contributor alone can give him.|$|R

She made it to Rio de Janeiro (in a record time of 24 days from New York), where she stopped for engine repairs and to resupply coal, <b>fresh</b> water, <b>wood,</b> <b>fresh</b> fruits and vegetables and other supplies. After traversing the Straits of Magellan she stopped at Valparaíso, Chile; Callao, Peru (just outside Lima); and Paita, Peru for more supplies. The coal supplies had been previously shipped to the various ports by sailing ships that had left earlier.|$|R
60|$|Both of {{the youths}} had been camping so often that they knew exactly what to do. The fire was stirred up, and <b>fresh</b> <b>wood</b> put on, and they {{prepared}} a couple of cups of coffee, and broiled two squirrels. They had bread and crackers, and a little cheese, and thus made quite a good breakfast.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour before}} daybreak, the men were aroused. Tents were struck and packed in the waggon, and the men then fell in, and {{remained}} until the king, {{with three or four}} of his officers and fifty cavalry, rode up. <b>Fresh</b> <b>wood</b> had been thrown on the fires, and some of the men told off as cooks.|$|E

A breath of tangy air blowing from <b>fresh</b> <b>woods</b> and pastures new over the dry and dusty soil in which {{so much of}} our Australian literature has its roots. We have our good writers. We get our good books from them each year. But how few of them make us laugh, or even smile. And scarce a one of them makes us chuckle. But how a new field of Australian literary endeavour has been dug, and has produced a delicious, well-handled piece of satire to make us sit up and take notice, and feel that Australian writing has some thing bright to say for itself. And it has taken two women to do it." ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{an index}} of {{revealed}} comparative advantage (IRCA) is computed for Fiji's twelve major export products at the three-digit level of the Standard International Trade Classification for the period 1988 - 2001. Our results provide confirmation of Fiji having comparative advantages in its resource based products, namely sugar, canned fish, <b>fresh</b> fish, dalo, <b>wood</b> chips, gold, and manufactured goods such as textiles, garments and footwear. Our results also confirm that the comparative advantage position weakened for canned fish and gold over time while that for sugar, <b>fresh</b> fish, <b>wood</b> chips and garments strengthened over the post 1987. Interestingly, our IRCA scores reveal that yaqona, copra and coconut oil {{do not have any}} comparative advantages...|$|R
60|$|When Godfrey woke {{he found}} that Luka was already up. He had stirred up the embers, put on <b>fresh</b> <b>wood,</b> filled the kettle and hung it over the fire, and had then evidently sauntered off into the wood.

60|$|Even in the {{daylight}} he did not dare leave the fire to chop <b>fresh</b> <b>wood.</b> Twenty feet away towered a huge dead spruce. He spent half the day extending his campfire to the tree, at any moment a half dozen burning faggots ready at hand to fling at his enemies. Once at the tree, he studied the surrounding forest in order to fell the tree {{in the direction of}} the most firewood.|$|E
60|$|It was Randy who {{uttered the}} words, as he danced {{around the floor}} of the living-room, almost on top of the stove. The fire had burned low during the night, and he had just shoved in some <b>fresh</b> <b>wood</b> and opened the draughts. Going to the little window of the sleeping-apartment, he looked through the single pane of glass at the thermometer, which hung on the {{casement}} outside. The mercury registered twenty-two degrees below zero.|$|E

50|$|The band set {{out after}} the bed-recording session at Steven Page's {{farmhouse}} studio, <b>Fresh</b> Baked <b>Woods,</b> for their perennial Barenaked for the Holidays tour.

In May, they began mixing the album at Mississauga's Metalworks Studios with mixer Bob Clearmountain while still finishing the last overdubs.|$|R
60|$|It {{began to}} get dark. The snow-veined rocks melted in the mist and the pines were vague and black. In the {{distance}} a timber wolf howled and the long mournful note emphasized the dreariness. In the rocks where Jimmy hid at the beginning he had Deering's society and at the ranch he had Margaret's and Jardine's. Now he was altogether alone in the savage wilds. Going back to the fire, he threw on <b>fresh</b> <b>wood,</b> and although he was not keen about smoking, lighted his pipe.|$|E
60|$|About {{three o'clock}} in the morning, the doctor stood for some minutes beside the bunk, and Charnock shivered as he watched his face. The shack seemed very quiet except for the throb of the river and the {{grinding}} of the ice. Then the doctor gave him a nod that hinted at satisfaction, and told him to refill the iron drum at Festing's feet with hot water. By and by he put <b>fresh</b> <b>wood</b> in the stove, moving cautiously and taking as long as possible, because {{it was a relief to}} do something after sitting still in suspense.|$|E
60|$|He threw <b>fresh</b> <b>wood</b> on the fire, {{and soon}} {{afterwards}} {{they went to}} sleep. Jimmy's sleep was broken, and when he woke at daybreak he shivered. He {{did not want to}} get up, but he must fetch water. The kettle handle stung his skin, the pools on the creek were frozen, and he saw the snow had moved five or six hundred feet down the rocks. Rose-pink light touched the high peaks and hoar frost sparkled on the pines, but the stern beauty of the wilds was daunting. Jimmy wanted the deep valleys up which the soft Chinook blew.|$|E
6000|$|I gather {{from half}} shut eyes {{that you were}} a Skeltist; now seriously that is a good beginning; there is a deal of romance (cheap) in Skelt. Look at it well, and you will see much of Dickens. And even Skelt is better than conscientious, grey back-gardens, and conscientious, dull still lives. The great lack of art just now is a spice of life and interest; and I prefer galvanism to {{acquiescence}} in the grave. All do not; 'tis an affair of tastes; and mine are young. Those who like death have their innings to-day with art that is like mahogany and horse-hair furniture, solid, true, serious and as dead as Cæsar. I wish I could read Treasure Island; I believe I should like it. But work done, for the artist, is the Golden Goose killed; you sell its feathers and lament the eggs.

60|$|But {{these are}} but experiments. All {{things in this}} new land are moving farther on: the wine-vats and the miner's {{blasting}} tools but picket for a night, like Bedouin pavilions; and to-morrow, to <b>fresh</b> <b>woods!</b> This stir of change and these perpetual echoes of the moving footfall, haunt the land. Men move eternally, still chasing Fortune; and, fortune found, still wander. As we drove back to Calistoga, the road lay empty of mere passengers, but its green side was dotted with the camps of travelling families: one cumbered with a great waggonful of household stuff, settlers going to occupy a ranche they had taken up in Mendocino, or perhaps Tehama County; another, a party in dust-coats, men and women, whom we found camped in a grove on the roadside, all on pleasure bent, with a Chinaman to cook for them, and who waved their hands to us as we drove by.|$|R
