25|$|Baldwin's first {{scientific}} {{paper was}} on two {{new species of}} Rottboellia {{that he had found}} on the coast of Georgia. It was published in the year of his death. His only other paper was read before a meeting of the American Philosophical Society on 16 April 1819 as he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River, but it was not published until 1825. Its subject was two species of Cyperus from Georgia and four Species of Kyllinga from South America.|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 1918, McCarthy {{performed}} {{what was}} later {{described in the}} official history as being the most effective piece of individual fighting {{in the history of}} the AIF, next to Albert Jacka's Military Cross-winning feat at Pozières. Near Madam Wood, east of Vermandovillers, France, the battalion was heavily opposed by well-posted German machine-guns. McCarthy, realizing the situation, dashed across the open ground with two men to the nearest post, where, having out-distanced his companions, he put the gun out of action, then continued fighting <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> trench. Later, having been joined by one of his men, together they bombed their way along the trench until contact was established with an adjoining unit.|$|E

25|$|Although the Cowboys {{eventually}} held a 451–294 {{advantage in}} total offensive yards, the 49ers converted three turnovers into three {{touchdowns in the}} first quarter en route to the 38–28 victory. On the third play of the game, San Francisco cornerback Eric Davis intercepted Aikman's pass, plowing right through the intended target (receiver Kevin Williams) as he snagged the ball out of the air, and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. On the next Dallas possession, Davis stripped the ball away from receiver Michael Irvin and fellow defensive back Tim McDonald recovered it on the Dallas 39, setting up a 29-yard touchdown pass from Young to running back Ricky Watters, who eluded several Cowboys defenders high-stepping <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> sideline en route to the goal line in spectacular showboating fashion. Williams then fumbled the ensuing kickoff when hit by 49ers running back Adam Walker. San Francisco kicker Doug Brien recovered the ball at the Cowboys 35-yard line, and then Young went back to work, converting a third and 1 with a 2-yard sneak and then throwing a 14-yard pass to receiver John Taylor. On the next play, Young ran the ball nine yards to the 1-yard line, and running back William Floyd took the ball into the end zone from there to give his team a 21–0 lead with 7:33 left {{in the first quarter}}.|$|E
25|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} The Rock and Steve Austin. On the February 20 episode of SmackDown!, The Rock {{returned}} to WWE after a six-month hiatus from wrestling (since SummerSlam). On that evening, {{he was in}} a confrontation with Hulk Hogan before their WrestleMania X8 rematch at No Way Out. At the No Way Out event, The Rock defeated Hogan with the help of Mr. McMahon. On the following night's episode of Raw, The Rock returned to the Raw brand in a 20-man Battle royal that would determine the opponent for the World Heavyweight Championship. Rock however, was unable to win after he was eliminated by Booker T; after the match, Rock criticized Steve Austin for being chosen as the Superstar of the Decade by the WWE fans in January, beginning the feud between Rock and Austin. The following week on Raw, Austin, who was on a long hiatus before returning that previous Sunday at No Way Out, made his WWE television return, as he cut a promo about the WWE fans, before he was interrupted by Rock, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania because The Rock, himself, was obsessed of not beating Austin at a WrestleMania event by the time they fought at WrestleMania XV and X-Seven during a four-year span. As soon as the challenge was made, Raw General manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the following week on Raw, Rock would face Booker T in a match, and if he won, he would have the choice to face either Austin or Triple H at WrestleMania. On the March 10 episode of Raw, Rock, with Bischoff's approval, announced that he would pick his own opponent for later that night, {{which turned out to be}} The Hurricane, in hopes for Rock to gain an easy victory. However, Austin made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> entrance ramp, which distracted Rock and allowed Hurricane to Roll up Rock into a successful pinfall, which made the Austin-Rock match at WrestleMania official. On the March 24, and final episode of Raw leading into WrestleMania, Austin was banned from entering the arena that night. He managed to enter the arena and attack Rock, however, before Rock fled the ring.|$|E
500|$|Walker took {{command of}} the 64-gun [...] on 8 February 1798, before {{transferring}} in quick succession to the 56-gun , the 98-gun , the 90-gun [...] and lastly the 50-gun [...] on 7 October 1800. He commanded Isis in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and in the Baltic Sea, {{as well as with}} the Channel Fleet. Isis was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and joined Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron for the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute, after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour, including Nelson's flagship, [...] Walker took Isis in to engage both his own target as well as Elephants, and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14-gun battery. When eventually Nelson was able to work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line he left Walker at his task and took another position. As he passed, Nelson took off his hat, waved it, and cried, 'Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better'. After four and a half hours of intense fighting Isis silenced her opponents, at the heavy cost of nine officers and 103 men killed or wounded. Nelson came aboard Isis the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 23 August 1765 (8th waxing of Tawthalin 1127 ME) {{at the height}} of the rainy season when the 20,000 strong northern Burmese army (20 regiments and three hundred war-boats) invaded Siam down the Wang River. The southern armies stayed put. The reason for the earlier start of the northern army was that it was much farther away from Ayutthaya than its southern counterparts. Still the strategy did not work as planned. The northern army's advance was greatly slowed by the rainy weather and the [...] "petty chiefs" [...] who put up a fight, forcing Thihapate to storm town after town. Nonetheless, Thihapate fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Wang, finally taking Tak and Kamphaeng Phet by the end of the rainy season.|$|E

2500|$|Russian {{colonization}} of the Americas reached its southernmost point with the 1812 establishment of Fort Ross (krepost' rus), an agricultural, scientific, and fur-trading settlement located in present-day Sonoma County, California. In November and December 1818, {{several of the}} missions were attacked by Hipólito Bouchard, [...] "California's only pirate." [...] A French privateer sailing under the flag of Argentina, Pirata Buchar (as {{he was known to}} the locals) worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> California coast, conducting raids on the installations at Monterey, Santa Barbara, and San Juan Capistrano, with limited success. Upon hearing of the attacks, many mission priests (along with a few government officials) sought refuge at Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, the mission chain's most isolated outpost. Ironically, Mission Santa Cruz (though ultimately ignored by the marauders) was ignominiously sacked and vandalized by local residents who were entrusted with securing the church's valuables.|$|E
2500|$|Then {{came the}} match between Nash and Hogan on the January 4, 1999, episode of Nitro. The match was {{originally}} advertised as a Starrcade rematch between Nash and Goldberg. As a result, the Georgia Dome in Atlanta {{was a complete}} sellout, with over 40,000 people watching live expecting to see the rematch. Throughout the broadcast the announcers hyped the main event as being the [...] "biggest match {{in the history of}} our sport" [...] and said that [...] "unlike the other guys, we have a real main event". Instead, Goldberg was forced to forgo his title match after being kayfabe arrested by the police for stalking Miss Elizabeth and was replaced by Hogan. Hogan faked a punch on Nash and then poked him in the chest. Nash overselled the poke in the chest by forcefully falling to the mat and allowing Hogan to pin him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The nWo hugged in the ring immediately afterwards until Goldberg made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stage along with Lex Luger, only to have Luger blindside him and Hall taser him with a shock stick once again, just like at Starrcade. This incident has since gone down in wrestling lore as the [...] "Fingerpoke of Doom". This bait-and-switch damaged the credibility of the company as a whole, having failed to present the advertised match and using underhand tactics to sell out the arena for that night's telecast. On the same episode of Nitro, Tony Schiavone, under direction from Bischoff, revealed that Mick Foley won the WWF Title at a taped edition of Raw and mocked the WWF for making what he implied was a bad business decision (sarcastically saying [...] "huh, that's gonna put some butts in the seats"). [...] Nielsen ratings indicated that over 300,000 households changed the channel to watch the victory and shifted the ratings for the night in the WWF's favor.|$|E
