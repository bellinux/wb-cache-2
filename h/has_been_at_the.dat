5|$|Archaeological discoveries {{show that}} the first {{settlements}} {{in the area of}} present-day Białystok occurred during the Stone Age. Tombs of ancient settlers {{can be found in the}} district of Dojlidy. In the early Iron Age a mix of Prussians, Yotvingians and Wielbark culture people settled in the area producing kurgans, the tombs of the chiefs in the area located in the current village of Rostołty. Since then, the Białystok area <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crossroads of cultures. Trade routes linking the Baltic to the Black Sea favored the development of settlements with Yotvingia-Ruthenian-Polish cultural characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{includes}} several Sites of Special Scientific Interest including Westhay Moor, Shapwick Heath and Shapwick Moor. Much {{of the area}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of peat extraction on the Somerset Levels. Large areas of peat were laid down on the Somerset Levels, particularly in the River Brue Valley, during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted. The extraction of peat from the Moors {{is known to have}} taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. Peat extraction on the Somerset Moors continues today, although much reduced.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the club}} was founded, there have been 30 managers. The honours won by the club under each manager's {{stewardship}} are also detailed. As of {{the start of the}} 2017 season, 28 men have held the post of Malmö FF manager, the most successful of whom in terms of trophies won is Bob Houghton, who, as manager between 1974 and 1980, led the club to three Swedish league championships and four Svenska Cupen wins. The manager who has won most national league titles with the club is Antonio Durán, who won Allsvenskan four times between 1964 and 1971. Although Roy Hodgson led Malmö FF to the Allsvenskan crown five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, the national championship was decided by a championship play-off during this time, and Malmö FF only won this in 1986 and 1988. Houghton is the club's longest-serving manager, having occupied the position between 1990 and 1992 in addition to the aforementioned period, giving him a total of 10 years in charge. The current manager of Malmö FF is Magnus Pehrsson, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club since 23 November 2016.|$|E
