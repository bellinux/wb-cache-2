500|$|In a January 20, 1990, contest against conference foe Tennessee, Pitino benched senior {{shooting}} guard Derrick Miller {{to start the}} second half, giving his spot to Farmer. Farmer, who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half, responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half. Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 {{points in the second}} half as the Wildcats turned a 4439 halftime deficit into a 9583 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> in the game. After a mid-week loss to Auburn, Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup, replacing Sean Woods, for the Wildcats' January 27 contest against Ole Miss. [...] "We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration. We'll try Richie Farmer at the point and see what we get out of that. Right now we're not getting too much out of that position," [...] Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference. In a 9879 victory, Farmer tallied 11 points, 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes; Woods registered 8 points, 4 assists, and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench. Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats' next game against Mississippi State, and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation.|$|E

When they get home, Ella and Iggy are under the spell also. Dylan, Max, Angel, Iggy, and Ella go to a rally at Ella's school, where Iggy begins a chant of [...] "kill the humans!"

They make a pact with each other to never again trust a grown-up. The group finds Ella at a campfire, singing a song about saving the earth. They are able to capture her and change her back to normal, but they quickly lose her again. She leaves a note saying that she was meant to have wings.|$|E

[Revised edition posted 12. 04. 2013] This guide {{is based on an}} extended literature search on the subject of scleral lens fitting and provides an overview of the latest knowledge and understanding on this exciting vision correction method. This guide serves as an introduction to scleral shape, scleral topography and scleral lens design as well as a generic guide to fitting scleral lenses to help the practitioner <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with the concept of scleral lenses. It provides a general overview, supported by the main experienced scleral lens fitters worldwide. Its goal is to give practitioners a framework to oversee and integrate scleral lens fitting into their practices. Being a general overview, it can never cover all of the specific scleral lens designs available and cannot be a fitting guide for all lens types available. Modern scleral lens fitting still is in its infancy, which makes it a modality with great potential. However, fitting scleral lenses is not very black-and-white, and many differences exist among fitters, cultures, manufacturers and countries. This clinical guide tries to find “common ground” among the mentioned philosophies. For specific lens fitting rules and guidelines, the lens manufacturer and the laboratory’s consultant and specialists have the most knowledge regarding their specific lens design, which practitioners should take advantage of.

40|$|I {{have found}} through my {{experience}} at The University of Rhode Island that {{two things are}} lacking; attention to the arts, and conversation about mental illness. Books are not only used as an educational tool for literacy among children {{but also as a}} way to introduce challenging topics. Combining my two majors, Art and Psychology, I aimed to create a real life tool that exposes children to the topic of mental health. The targeted age group for this book is between 4 through 6 years. By introducing this conversation to children at an appropriate level of learning, my hope is that future generations will grow to be aware of and sensitive to the multitude of issues involving mental health. The first step during this process was to develop a character that is relatable toa wide audience, but also suffers from Germaphobia, an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I created a 7 -year old boy named Henry. Henry is just like every other child and enjoys common activities such as art, sports, and writing. Yet the activity of ‘circle time’, a common practice in elementary schools where children sit on the ground, gives him chronic stress due to his irrational fear of germs. Henry works to overcome this obstacle through family therapy, utilizing breathing techniques, and exposure therapy. I wanted to convey that there are resources available for a child with mental illness and that they are not alone in their fight. Henry also is seen overcoming an obstacle, but not without difficulty. This was included in the story to show that children do have the ability to overcome obstacles of mental health but it is a process that does not include an immediate cure. Images are created by carving into linoleum with a sharp tool of varying widths. The panel then goes through the printing press covered with ink. A large amount of pressure is exerted imprinting the image onto a piece of paper. I chose to work with linoleum due to its ability to produce raw images and significant contrast. I felt that the images would be able to translate content more clearly than alternative media. I also wanted to <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> in this medium, as it is related to the art of the illustrated book. To create the book, I used the process of a storyboard. A storyboard deals with space, time, sequence, and narrative. The largest challenge of this project was to take a mature subject and re-imagine it at a new level. I worked to create sentences and compositions that convey the message of a mature concept, but have it be understood by a child. To do this there needed to be continuity in the imagery style, which proved to be difficult stylistically. Also, the syntax of the book needed to be at an elementary level while also effectively telling a story. The purpose of illustration is to build an understanding between words and pictures. The combination of words and images allows for higher levels of comprehension for a child by targeting more of the senses...|$|E

40|$|Multimodal {{interfaces}} that integrate multiple input modalities such as speech, gestures, gaze, {{and so on}} {{have shown}} considerable promise in terms of higher task efficiency, lower error rates and higher user satisfaction. However, the adoption of such interfaces for real-world systems {{has proved to be}} slow, and the reasons may be both technological (e. g. accuracy of recognition engines, fusion engines, authoring) as well as usability-related. In this paper, we explore a few patterns of “command and control ” style multimodal interaction (MMI) using touch gestures and short speech utterances. We then describe a multimodal interface for a photo browsing application and a user study to understand some of the usability issues with such interfaces. Specifically, we study walk-up use of multimodal commands for photo manipulations, and compare this with unimodal multi-touch interactions. We observe that there is a learning period after which the user <b>gets</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with the multimodal commands, and the average task completions times reduce significantly. We also analyze temporal integration patterns of speech and touch gestures. We see this as the first of many studies leading to more detailed understanding of user preferences and performance for using MMI, which can help inform the judicious use of MMI in designing interactions for future interfaces.
