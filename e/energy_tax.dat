40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the incidence of}} <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> using a lifetime framework to study both a Btu tax and a carbon tax. It takes into account two key facts. First, because <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> have different incidence effects across the life cycle, {{it is important to}} measure the burden of taxes in terms of lifetime incidence, not just their burden in a given year. To take account of lifetime incidence, we introduce an estimation methodology for lifetime-correction as well as showing current consumption measures. Second, <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> have a total effect that combines both direct and indirect effects: in addition to directly increasing the price of <b>energy</b> goods, <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> also indirectly increase the price of all other goods in proportion to the energy used to produce them. We provide incidence estimates by income group and by geographical region. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> and the EU ETS on {{a large number of}} firms in Europe between 1996 and 2007. Using company level micro-data, we examine how firms in {{different}} sectors were affected by environmental policies. Aspects of behavior and performance studied include total factor productivity, employment levels, investment behavior and profitability. On the whole, <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> increased total factor productivity and returns to capital but decreased employment, with a mixed effect on investment, for the sectors included in our analysis. However, large sectoral variation is observed, with some industries losing out in terms of productivity and profitability when faced with increased <b>energy</b> <b>taxes,</b> while others benefitted.

25|$|Some {{countries}} employ {{energy or}} carbon taxes to motivate energy users {{to reduce their}} consumption. Carbon taxes can allow consumption to shift to nuclear power and other alternatives that carry {{a different set of}} environmental side effects and limitations. Meanwhile, taxes on all energy consumption stand to reduce energy use across the board, while reducing a broader array of environmental consequences arising from energy production. The State of California employs a tiered <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> whereby every consumer receives a baseline energy allowance that carries a low tax. As usage increases above that baseline, the tax is increasing drastically. Such programs aim to protect poorer households while creating a larger tax burden for high energy consumers.|$|E

This was noted during the New York City Blackout of 1977 when {{the entire city}} was without power but lights were still visible in the North Shore Towers. During the Northeast blackout of 2003, the North Shore Towers continued to produce electricity unaffected. This resulted in extensive media coverage on the co-op's self-sufficiency with regard to energy. After seeing this news coverage of North Shore Towers' ability to produce power during the blackout, city tax collectors sent <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> bills to North Shore Towers and the Penn South co-op in Chelsea, Manhattan. The tax bills were for $1 million each, representing unpaid fuel taxes going back 20 years. This was extremely controversial because both co-ops produce their own power. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Councilman David Weprin (D-Queens), then Councilwoman Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan), and other city officials worked towards settling the tax bills and removing future energy taxes for the co-ops. Then Council Speaker Gifford Miller (D-Manhattan) commented that such co-ops [...] "should be rewarded, not punished for providing their own energy." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluates the}} effects of changes in <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> on <b>energy</b> {{consumption}} between the years 1995 and 2004 using an applied, general equilibrium model for a historical simulation. During this period, Finnish energy taxation was fundamentally changed, going from an up-stream, emission and energy content-based approach to one with a mixed fuel and electricity tax. The change put the burden more closely on the users of electricity and fuels. We find that while the sharp increases in energy prices since 1995 have significantly restricted the growth of <b>energy</b> demand, <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> have also been effective in curbing the growth of energy and especially electricity consumption. For transport fuels, the effective tax rate actually fell as the price net of tax increased over time. Nevertheless, for petrol and light fuel oil we do find the taxes to have slowed down overall demand growth. <b>Energy</b> <b>taxes,</b> emission, economic growth...|$|R

Controlling for the scale effect, our estimations show that fiscal policies and <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> are effective in reducing the concentration of certain pollutants through different mechanisms. We also find that trade has a direct effect on production pollutants, which is most likely due to an output composition effect, but not on consumption pollutants.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Energy</b> <b>taxes</b> do not {{necessarily}} improve the cost efficiency of emission trading, if they introduce price signals that differ from those caused by trading. This article studies the use of domestic <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> in the trading sectors in connection with EU-wide emissions trading in Finland. The study evaluates three distinct tax scenarios that progressively switch further away from current fuel taxes and compensate the initial loss of revenue by raising either income taxes or electricity taxes. Emission trading is studied for the period 2008 - 12. Currently, the initial allocation of permits for this period {{is yet to be}} determined; in the study, grandfathering is assumed to base on estimated domestic reductions that would result either from raising current <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> or from introducing a complete carbon dioxide tax. The results indicate that macroeconomic effects are highest if revenue neutrality is maintained with income tax increases. It makes less of a difference on the macroeconomic level if current <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> are retained in the trading sectors or if they are abolished and electricity taxes raised to compensate for lost revenue. At the sectoral level, however, the electricity tax alternative is less costly for the trading sectors. Grandfathering has a large impact on the effects of abatement, since it determines the required reductions for the non-trading sectors. If the goal for the non-trading sectors is too strict, macroeconomic costs are raised regardless of emission trading. Trading also has an effect on the use of renewable energy. High permit prices are required to encourage wind power, whereas the use of wood increases in all cases...|$|R
