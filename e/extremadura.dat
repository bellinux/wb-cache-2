5|$|Badajoz {{is home to}} the Universidad de <b>Extremadura</b> (UNEX) Badajoz campus, {{situated}} {{on the west side of}} the river. The university was founded on 4 November 1968, when the Faculty of Badajoz belonging to the University of Seville was established. Today, the University of <b>Extremadura</b> has branches in Badajoz, Cáceres, Mérida, and Plasencia. In 1971 the Council of Ministers approved the establishment of the College of Arts of Cáceres under the University of Salamanca. Secondary schools such as the Normal Schools of Education of Cáceres and Badajoz were integrated into the University in 1972 following the General Law of Education decree of 1970. The Intermediate Technical School of Agricultural Engineering of Badajoz was founded in Badajoz 1968, renamed the College of Agricultural Engineering in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Badajoz was {{the birthplace}} of the statesman Manuel de Godoy, the duke of Alcudia (1767–1851). Many of the provincial {{administration}} buildings are located in Badajoz, as well as the government buildings of the municipal administration. Politically, Badajoz belongs to the Spanish Congress Electoral District of Badajoz, which is the largest electoral district about of 52 districts in the Spanish Congress of Deputies in terms of geographical area and includes {{a significant part of the}} <b>Extremadura</b> region. The electoral district was first contested in modern times in the 1977 General Election. At the time of the 2011 election, Badajoz had six deputies representing the district in congress, four from the People's Party-United <b>Extremadura</b> party (PP-EU), and two from the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party party (PSOE).|$|E
5|$|Following a {{successful}} campaign in <b>Extremadura,</b> on 27 January 1811 Soult began his investment of Badajoz. Almost immediately the Spanish Army of <b>Extremadura</b> {{arrived in the}} vicinity with some 15,000 troops {{under the command of}} Gen. Mendizabal. Soult's army, too small to surround Badajoz, was unable to prevent 3,000 of Mendizabal's men from reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying the heights of San Cristóbal. This posed a major threat to the French, so Soult moved at once to engage. In the ensuing Battle of the Gebora the French inflicted 1,000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4,000 prisoners, at a cost to themselves of only 400 casualties. The remnants of Mendizabal's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Gebora {{was a minor}} {{battle of}} the Peninsular War between Spanish and French armies. It {{occurred}} on 19 February 1811, near Badajoz, Spain, where an outnumbered French force routed and nearly destroyed the Spanish Army of <b>Extremadura.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of John IV of Portugal in 1656, various Spanish offensives were {{launched}} against Portuguese territory, mainly from <b>Extremadura,</b> but also from Galicia, where a second front was opened to force the Portuguese to divide their forces. The Spanish Army of <b>Extremadura,</b> recently reinforced with many veterans of the war against France, was commanded by Francisco de Tuttavilla, Duke of San German, who appointed Gaspar Téllez-Girón y Sandoval, Duke of Osuna, as general of artillery and his second-in-command. In 1657 they laid siege to the Portuguese town of Olivença with 8,000 soldiers and 29 cannons and occupied the town, despite a desperate attempt by the Count of San Lorenzo, military governor of Alentejo, to dislodge them by launching a surprise attack himself on the Spanish town of Badajoz. Mourão fell into Spanish hands shortly thereafter. San Lorenzo was then dismissed from his command and replaced by dom Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos, who easily managed to retake both Mourão and Olivença in the following months, since their Spanish garrisons had been considerably diminished {{in order to move}} troops to face the French armies in Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} is the most {{populated}} of <b>Extremadura,</b> it has a relatively low population density (102.30 hab/km²), due to the extension of its municipality, {{one of the largest}} in Spain, with an area of 1,470km². It should be noted that in addition to the metropolitan centre the population includes districts, neighborhoods and towns with small populations, the most populous of which is Guadiana del Caudillo, which had 2,524 people as of 2012, but gained independence on 17 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, {{the town}} of Badajoz had a {{population}} of 5,628 people. As of 2010, Badajoz has 150,376 inhabitants. According to the 2010 census, Badajoz has 73,074 men and 77,312 women, representing a percentage of 48.59% and a 51.41% respectively. Compared to the statistics for the <b>Extremadura</b> region (49.7% and 50.3%), Badajoz city has a greater relative presence of women.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March, news of Victor's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Barrosa reached Soult {{and he left}} Badajoz to return to Andalusia, anxious that the siege of Cádiz had been lifted. Reaching Seville on 20 March he was {{relieved}} to find that Victor's siege lines still held and Andalusia remained under French control. Before his departure Soult had consolidated his gains in <b>Extremadura</b> by garrisoning Badajoz with 11,000 French troops {{under the command of}} Marshal Édouard Mortier.|$|E
5|$|Soult {{could not}} besiege so strong a {{fortress}} as Badajoz with his reduced force and therefore changed his plans. Sending his light cavalry under Brig. Gen. André Briche to take Mérida and leaving four squadrons of dragoons at Albuera {{to watch the}} garrison at Badajoz, he marched with {{the remainder of his}} army to invest Olivenza. Wellington had previously advised Gen. Pedro Caro de La Romana, commander of the Spanish Army of <b>Extremadura,</b> either to destroy the fortification at Olivenza or to repair its defenses and fully garrison it; La Romana in turn had instructed Mendizabal to slight the fortress, but Mendizabal ignored this order and instead reinforced the garrison with four infantry battalions. Soult, arriving on 11 January, was therefore confronted with a strongly garrisoned—but untenable—fortress. The heavy French artillery finally began to arrive on 19 January, and by 22 January a poorly repaired breach in the fortress' walls had been reopened. The garrison surrendered on 23 January, with over 4,000 Spanish troops from the Army of <b>Extremadura</b> taken captive.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Siege of Badajoz {{took place}} from July to October 1658 during the Portuguese Restoration War. It {{was an attempt}} by a huge Portuguese army {{under the command of}} Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos, {{governor}} of Alentejo, to capture the Spanish city of Badajoz, which was the headquarters of the Spanish Army of <b>Extremadura.</b> The fortifications of Badajoz were essentially medieval and considered vulnerable by the Portuguese, and had already been attacked by them three times during this war.|$|E
5|$|The city {{formerly}} hosted CD Badajoz, which {{dissolved in}} 2012 after finishing {{the season in}} Segunda División B Group 1. Now, the city's main association football club is CD Badajoz 1905, a new club formed in 2012 by disappeared CD Badajoz supporters which is currently playing in the Regional Preferente in <b>Extremadura,</b> the fifth level of competition of the Spanish league football, after promotion in the 2012-13 season in the playoffs. Its stadium is Estadio Nuevo Vivero.|$|E
5|$|With the {{invasion}} of the Romans, which started in 218 BC during the Second Punic War, Badajoz and <b>Extremadura</b> became part of the administrative district called Hispania Ulterior (Farther Spain), which was later divided by Emperor Augustus into Hispania Ulterior Baetica and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania; Badajoz became part of Lusitania. Though the settlement is not mentioned in Roman history, Roman villas such as the La Cocosa Villa have been discovered in the area, while Visigothic constructions have also been found in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, {{the black}} stork is found from Eastern Asia (Siberia and {{northern}} China) west to Central Europe, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, Lower Saxony and Bavaria in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Greece in the south, with an outlying {{population in the}} central-southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (<b>Extremadura</b> and surrounding provinces of Spain, plus Portugal). It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and Asia, although certain populations of black storks are sedentary or dispersive. An isolated population exists in Southern Africa, where the species is more numerous in the east, in eastern South Africa and Mozambique, and {{is also found in}} Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Botswana and less commonly Namibia.|$|E
5|$|Soult divided {{his army}} into two contingents and {{advanced}} into <b>Extremadura</b> via {{the two main}} passes leading from Andalusia into the Guadiana valley, {{with the intention of}} rejoining at Almendralejo. One of the columns, commanded by Gen. Marie Victor Latour-Maubourg, met little resistance on its march; on 3 January 1811 the column was confronted by 2,500 Spanish and Portuguese cavalry near Usagre, but that force was only a screen covering the retreat beyond the Guadiana of a Spanish infantry division commanded by Gen. Mendizabal. Latour-Maubourg was therefore able to take position near Almendralejo and await the arrival of the second French column.|$|E
5|$|The first grapevines {{were brought}} to Peru shortly after its conquest by Spain in the 16th century. Spanish chroniclers from the time note the first {{winemaking}} in South America {{took place in the}} hacienda Marcahuasi of Cuzco. The largest and most prominent vineyards of the 16th and 17th century Americas were established in the Ica valley of south-central Peru. In the 1540s, Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes planted vineyards in Peru. Carabantes also established vineyards in Ica, from where Spaniards from Andalucia and <b>Extremadura</b> introduced grapevines into Chile.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), <b>Extremadura</b> (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E
5|$|In {{a bid to}} help extricate Marshal André Masséna's army {{from its}} {{position}} in Portugal—mired in front of Lisbon's defensive Lines of Torres Vedras—Marshal Jean de Dieu Soult led part of the French Armée du Midi (Army of the South) from Andalusia into the neighbouring Spanish region of <b>Extremadura</b> and laid siege to the important fortress town of Badajoz. Viscount Wellington and the Spanish Captain-General Pedro Caro y Sureda, 3rd marqués de La Romana sent a large Spanish army to raise the siege. La Romana, however, died before the army could depart, and command fell to General Gabriel de Mendizábal Iraeta. Supported by a small force of Portuguese cavalry, the Spaniards reached the town and camped on the nearby heights of San Cristóbal in early February 1811.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon had {{previously}} sent dispatches to Marshal Soult, {{commander of the}} Army of the South, urging him to send assistance to Masséna in Portugal. However, the Emperor's orders, which called for only a small force, were based on outdated intelligence and the situation had changed considerably by the time Soult received them. Thirty thousand Allied troops and six major fortresses now stood between the French army and the Portuguese capital, making an attack against Lisbon virtually impossible. Nevertheless, compelled to act, Soult instead gathered an army of 20,000 men, mainly from VCorps, and launched an expedition into <b>Extremadura</b> {{with the aim of}} capturing the Spanish fortress at Badajoz, thereby drawing some of the Allied forces away from Masséna and the Lines of Torres Vedras.|$|E
5|$|That second column, {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's VCorps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore {{had to take}} a longer, more practicable route into <b>Extremadura.</b> Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Museo Catedralicio (Cathedral Museum) is {{situated}} on the cathedral grounds. It provides a historical journey through the different stages of the building's construction. It also features artifacts from {{the founding of the}} archdiocese to the present day. The collections include Filipino ivories, carvings and Flemish tapestries, the tombstone of Alfonso Suárez de Figueroa, and the Custodia Procesional del Corpus of 1558. There are also works by Luis de Morales and Zurbarán. The Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Museum) is located in the city centre, organized by the Extremadurian Bullfighting Club. It includes posters, photographs and objects from the world of bullfighting. The Museo del Carnaval (Carnival Museum) opened in 2007 in the Menacho centre. Costumes of groups who participated over the years in the city's carnival are exhibited in the museum. In 2008, it joined the <b>Extremadura</b> network of museums.|$|E
5|$|The conquistadors {{were all}} volunteers, the {{majority}} of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead {{a portion of the}} spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. A sizeable portion of the Spanish conquistadors were from the southwestern regions of Spain, with their origins in Andalusia and <b>Extremadura.</b> Up to 1519, according to licenses issued in Spain, over half were from these two regions. From 1520 to 1539, this fell to just under half of all conquistadors leaving Spain. The conquest of the Central American isthmus was launched from three directions; Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Relations between rival conquistadors were dominated by mutual distrust, greed, and envy.|$|E
5|$|From October 1810 Marshal Masséna's Army of Portugal {{had been}} tied {{down in an}} {{increasingly}} hopeless stand-off against Wellington's Allied forces, safely entrenched in and behind the Lines of Torres Vedras. Acting on Napoleon's orders, in early 1811 Marshal Soult led a French expedition from Andalusia into <b>Extremadura</b> {{in a bid to}} draw Allied forces away from the Lines and ease Masséna's plight. Napoleon's information was outdated and Soult's intervention came too late; starving and understrength, Masséna's army was already withdrawing to Spain. Soult was able to capture the strategically important fortress at Badajoz on the border between Spain and Portugal from the Spanish, but was forced to return to Andalusia following Marshal Victor's defeat in March at the Battle of Barrosa. However, Soult left Badajoz strongly garrisoned. In April, following news of Masséna's complete withdrawal from Portugal, Wellington sent a powerful Anglo-Portuguese corps commanded by Sir William Beresford to retake the border town. The Allies drove most of the French from the surrounding area and began the Siege of Badajoz.|$|E
5|$|Mendes de Vasconcelos, {{encouraged}} by his successes, promised the Portuguese Queen Regent Luisa de Guzmán {{that he would}} capture the town of Badajoz, headquarters of the Spanish Army of <b>Extremadura</b> and therefore the most important Spanish fortress near the Portuguese frontier. The Count of Sabugal suggested that an offensive in the north, to conquer the Galician city of Tui, would be easier, due to the mild climate of the coast, and suggested that this would also be strategically more beneficial as it would secure the province of Entre Douro e Minho. But the queen and her ministers preferred Mendes de Vasconcelos' plan. He was given command of an army consisting of 14,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry troops with a train of 20 cannons and 2 mortars, gathered in the main fortress of Elvas. Mendes de Vasconcelos' second-in-command was the recently appointed Maestro de Campo General dom Rodrigo de Castro, {{a friend of the}} Count of Soure, Vasconcelos' enemy in the court, which was a cause of friction between them.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and <b>Extremadura</b> (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

25|$|In Chiapas, {{personnel}} from the Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas have been investigating a Spanish cheese called La Serena, {{which is made}} in the region of <b>Extremadura</b> with the aim of creating a certified version of it in Mexico. This includes the importation and raising of Merino sheep, as well as learning the methods behind this cheese. The reason behind the effort is that large parts of the state have a similar climate to <b>Extremadura,</b> making the raising of this sheep possible. Researchers have found they can not only reproduce La Serena cheese, but produce a number of other varieties, as well. Despite their ability to produce milk for cheese, most sheep in Mexico are raised for wool and meat. This strain of Merino sheep has been bred for milk production.|$|E
