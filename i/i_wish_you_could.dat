500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She says to him, [...] "You're special. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets his keys down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E

60|$|MISS HOWARD (surprised). I think it's {{great to}} be able to write. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>You</b> ought to be proud of it.|$|R

She has talked of it since. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have heard how she talked of it--with what candour and generosity. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have heard her honouring your forbearance, {{in being able}} to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever {{receiving}} from yourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Portentous, certainly! Yet still <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{have found}} it in your heart to take {{advantage}} of any feeler towards sympathy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor will I;--except such disgrace as may attend upon poverty. Good-by, mother. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{have said}} one kind word to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Adieu, ma chere, I must {{dress for}} church. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see my new hat {{and go with}} me, for Lord Rockingham promised to be there.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Miss Schuyler, [...] "though {{there was}} a time when <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>You</b> can't help being pretty, but it ought to make you careful when you see another of them going that way again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sometimes <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see them; {{but then}} unless <b>you</b> <b>could</b> talk with them, and indeed unless {{you knew the}} Melanesian mind and nature, you couldn't {{estimate}} these things rightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Paint as many Berenices as you like, but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{feel with}} me--perhaps you will, on reflection--that you should choose another model." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you could, Henry, and, oh, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go!" [...] went on Dave impulsively. [...] "Wouldn't we {{have the}} best times, though!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{return with}} you; but, as I do not {{desire to go}} to Portanferry, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put me on shore somewhere on the coast.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{told you}} once--writing children's fairy stories. Now I don't {{want you to}} be bothered about it, but <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> give me an idea where to send them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear fellow! he's {{so happy}} he don't {{know what to}} do with himself. <b>I</b> just <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see him go round smiling, and singing, and looking as if he'd like to dance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must marry him. And {{the sooner}} the better, if 'tis {{to be done at}} all [...] . And yet <b>I</b> did <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have been Jim Bellston's wife. <b>I</b> did <b>wish</b> it! But no.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! in that case, then, {{all will}} come {{right in the}} end--though, as your father does not want it, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have it, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is your {{business}} so very particular,' asked Martin, 'that you cannot remain {{with us for}} half an hour? <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could.</b> What IS {{your business}}, Tom?' ...|$|E

60|$|RAINA (with cool impertinence). Oh, I know Sergius is your pet. <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{marry him}} instead of me. You would just suit him. You would pet him, and spoil him, and mother him to perfection.|$|R

Didn't <b>I</b> say <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have seen it when I first saw it? When you got up on your ear and called me names, and said I had brought you eleven miles {{to look at a}} sapling, didn't I explain to you that all the whale-ships in the North Seas had been wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years? And did you s'pose the tree could last for-ever, con-found it? I don't see why you want to keep back things that way, and try to injure a person that's never done you any harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think--yes, I {{went on in}} a {{pleasing}} blend of the casual and sotto voce, 'The fact of it is, sir, I happen to be your son-in-law, Capes. <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come and dine with us some evening. It would make my wife very happy.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Patty, <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{go to the}} party. It was {{so sweet}} of Clare to invite you, and perhaps she will be {{offended}} if you don't go--she won't understand. Clare Forbes isn't a girl whose friendship is to be lightly thrown away when it is offered." ...|$|R
