(b) The preparation of Isopropylnaphthalene <b>disulphonic</b> acids was attempted using sodium naphthalene 1. 5 and 2. 7 disulphonates, but under the necessary experimental conditions, desulphonation occurred, and no <b>disulphonic</b> acid could be isolated. (c) Methylisopropylnaphthalenesulphonic acid has been prepared as the potassium salt by the isopropylation of the potassium salt of 1.

Attempts to prepare this acid using methods analogous to those previously described, were unsuccessful. Investigations were also carried out on various salts and derivatives of the acid. (e) isopropyltetralinsulphonic acid. The most successful method of preparation was found to be as follows;- Tetralin was condensed with concentrated sulphuric acid and the appropriate amount of 30 % fuming acid added to bring the strength to 100 %. This mixture was added to isopropyl alcohol in sulphuric acid, and after 20 hours stirring at 45, the required acid (1) was isolated as the barium salt. The parent hydrocarbon, and various salts and derivatives have been investigated. It has been found that certain compounds of the alkylnaphthalene sulphonic acid type have the property, when dissolved in water, of lowering its surface tension, thus rendering wetting of fabrics immersed in it much more rapid, even when they are present in minute proportions. in the patent literature, this property has been ascribed to the presence of several isopropyl groups, and to several sulphonic acid groups. The main object of the present research was to obtain such compounds, whose wetting properties could be tested. Those examined fall into five main groups.

The two selected acid dyes are C. I. Acid Orange 8 (AO 8) and C. I. Acid Red 17 (AR 17). These were chosen as model organic contaminants. The effect of operating parameters, such as amount of Fenton’s reagent (H 2 O 2 and Fe 2 +) and Fenton’s-like reagent (H 2 O 2 and Fe 3 +), hydrogen peroxide concentration, the two azo dyes concentration and the solution pH have been studied. Results indicated that simultaneous utilization of UV irradiation with Fenton’s and Fenton’s-like reagent increase the degradation degree (DD%) of (AO 8) and (AR 17). The dyes quickly lose their color, indicating that the dissolved organics have been oxidized.

Na+ uptake is accompanied by amiloride-sensitive H+ release. The H+ efflux is dependent upon the external Na+ concentration, the K 0. 5 value for Na+ being 16 mM. In the presence of DIDS, when the coupled NaCl entry (NaCl co-transport) induced by catecholamine is blocked, the results provide evidence for a linked movement of Na+ and H+, with a stoicheiometry of 1 : 1. Exchange of H+ for Na+ induces osmotic swelling of the cells {{which is due to}} the replacement of a bound proton by an osmotically active Na+ cation. In the absence of DIDS when the bulk of the Na+ uptake {{is the result of a}} coupled entry of Na+ and Cl-, H+ extrusion still occurs and the magnitude of acid excretion is identical to that found in DIDS-treated cells. This suggests that Na+-H+ exchange remains active. Addition of isoprenaline first stimulates the Na+-H+ exchange but only transiently.

The mechanism of lactate transport across apical and basolateral membranes was examined by determining intracellular pH (pHi) microspectrofluorimetrically after addition of lactate to the extracellular solutions and by measuring uptake of [14 C]lactate. Addition of 20 mM lactate to the apical compartment produced no change in pHi, whereas lactate added to the basolateral compartment rapidly and reversibly lowered pHi. Pyruvate produced similar results. Inhibitors of lactate/H+ co-transporters, alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamate (CnCN) and quercetin, partially inhibited the fall in pHi produced by basolateral lactate. In contrast, the <b>disulphonic</b> stilbene. DIDS (4, 4 '-di-isothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonic acid) produced no inhibition at 0. 5 mM. Kinetic analysis was performed by applying basolateral lactate at various concentrations and measuring the rate of entry (delta pHi/min) in the presence and absence of CnCN. Lactate flux was shown to occur by both non-ionic diffusion and a alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamate-sensitive component (carrier). The latter has a Km of approximately 7 mM for the lactate anion. Propionate, but not formate, lowered pHi to the same degree as did equimolar lactate, but the propionate effect was not inhibited by CnCN.

SCN− concentrations in several epithelial secretions are higher than in serum, although the mechanisms of transepithelial transport and accumulation in these secretions are unknown. To examine SCN− accumulation in secretions, human airway epithelial cells, re-differentiated at the air–liquid interface, were used in open-circuit conditions. [14 C]SCN−, in the basolateral medium, was transported across the epithelium and concentrated tenfold at the apical surface. Measurement of the transepithelial potential showed that the basolateral compartment was positive relative to the apical surface (13. 7 ± 1. 8 mV) and therefore unfavourable for passive movement of SCN−. Transport was dependent on basolateral [SCN−] and saturable (Km,app = 69 ± 25 μm); was inhibited by increased apical [SCN−]; and was dependent {{on the presence of}} basolateral Na+. Perchlorate (Ki,app = 0. 6 ± 0. 05 μm) and iodide (Ki,app = 9 ± 8 μm) in the basolateral medium reversibly inhibited transport, but furosemide did not.

One set is located at the outer surface, the other at the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Treatment of right-side-out membrane vesicles from E. coli ML 308 - 225 with the membrane-impermeable oxidant ferricyanide resulted in inhibition of L-proline uptake without having significant effect on the magnitude of the Δμ~H+. Subsequent addition of reducing agents restored proline transport activity. The membrane-impermeable SH-reagent glutathione hexane maleimide inhibited proline transport in right-side-out membrane vesicles irreversibly. Pretreatment of the vesicles with ferricyanide protected the carrier against inactivation by glutathione hexane maleimide. Electron transfer in the respiratory chain of right-side-out vesicles led to the generation of a Δμ~H+, interior negative and alkaline, and the conversion of a disulphide to a dithiol in the proline carrier as is shown by the increased inhibition of proline transport by the membrane impermeable dithiol reagent 4 -(2 -arsonophenyl) azo- 3 -hydroxy- 2, 7 -naphthalene <b>disulphonic</b> acid (thorin). The inhibition exerted by thorin was completely reversed by dithiothreitol. Pretreatment of the vesicles with thorin protected against glutathione hexane maleimide inhibition, indicating that both reagents react with the same group. Treatment of inside-out membrane vesicles with ferricyanide inactivated the proline transport system reversibly. The oxidizing effect of ferricyanide in inside-out vesicles resulted in protection against inhibition by glutathione hexane maleimide. Imposition in these vesicles of a Δμ~H+, interior positive and acid, also protected the proline carrier against glutathione hexane maleimide inactivation, indicating that a dithiol is converted to a disulphide upon energization. ...|$|E

This elevation is much greater in P 2 Y 1 transfectants than in P 2 Y 2 transfectants. Both PPADS and suramin reduced this basal level of [3 H]-InsPx accumulation in the P 2 Y 1 expressing cells.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the effects of clinical doses of halothane on Vm, recorded using intracellular microelectrodes on cleaned and non stimulated sartorius muscle which was freshly isolated from the leg of the frog Rana esculenta. We assessed the mechanism of effects of superfused halothane on Vm by the administration of selective antagonists of membrane bound Na+, K+ and Cl− channels and by inhibition of SR Ca 2 + release. Halothane (3 %) induced an early and transient depolarization (4. 5 mV within 7 min) and a delayed and sustained hyperpolarization (about 11 mV within 15 min) of Vm. The halothane-induced transient depolarization was sensitive to ryanodine (10 μm) and to 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-isothiocyanatostilbene 2, 2 ′ <b>disulphonic</b> acid (SITS, 1 mm). The hyperpolarization of Vm induced by halothane (0. 1 - 3 %) was dose-dependent and reversible. It was insensitive to SITS (1 mm), tetrodotoxin (0. 6 μm), and tetraethylammonium (10 mm) but was blocked and/or prevented by ryanodine (10 μm), charybdotoxin (CTX, 1 μm), and glibenclamide (10 nm). Our observations revealed that the effects of halothane on Vm may be related to the increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration produced by the ryanodine-sensitive Ca 2 + release from the SR induced by the anaesthetic. The depolarization may be attributed to the activation of Ca 2 +-dependent Cl− (blocked by SITS) channels and the hyperpolarization to the activation of large conductance Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels, blocked by CTX, and to the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, inhibited by glibenclamide...|$|E

The accumulated AAs provide the cell with an osmotic reservoir that can be utilized for osmoregulation. Exposure of Leishmania promastigotes to hypotonic media induced a rapid release of AAs that was proportional to the imposed osmotic gradients and independent of the ionic strength or the presence of Cl-, K+, Na+ or Ca 2 + in the medium. The hypotonically activated AA release pathway was of relatively low chemical specificity. The solutes released included most of the zwitterionic and anionic AAs, predominantly alanine, hydroxyproline, glycine and glutamic acid, whereas cationic AAs were virtually excluded. AA release was markedly blocked by classical anion transport inhibitors such as the <b>disulphonic</b> stilbene 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonate (DIDS) and its dihydro derivative H 2 DIDS and others, by restoration of isotonicity or by lowering the temperature (4 degrees C). The temperature profile of AA release showed a low energy of activation (Ea 46 +/- 1. 3 (S. E. M.) kJ/mol) in the range 15 - 30 degrees C and a very high Ea (147 +/- 8 kJ/mol) in the range 4 - 15 degrees C. Parasites exposed to hypotonic media containing AAs also showed a hypotonically stimulated AA uptake under favourable solute concentration gradients. This uptake was analogous for L- and D-isomers of threonine. After hypotonic exposure, cells underwent a depolarization that was largely prevented by anion transport blockers. On the basis of all these results we propose that after hypotonic stress Leishmania promastigotes restore their internal volume by a regulated release of AAs, which involves activation of channels that allow the passage of both neutral and anionic AAs and possibly other anionic substances...|$|E

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Motor responses to exogenous ATP and to nerve stimulation in vitro were assessed as changes in isometric tension. KEY RESULTS: ATP induced a concentration-dependent contraction, reduced by 4 -[[4 -formyl- 5 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 3 -[(phosphonooxy) methyl]- 2 -pyridinyl]azo]- 1, 3 -benzene <b>disulphonic</b> acid (PPADS), suramin, P 2 Y purinoreceptor desensitisation with adenosine 5 '-O- 2 -thiodiphosphate (ADPbetaS), and atropine, but unaffected by P 2 X purinoceptor desensitisation with alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alpha,beta-meATP) and by 2, 2 -dimethyl-propionic acid 3 -(2 -chloro- 6 -methylaminopurin- 9 -yl) - 2 -(2, 2 -dimethyl-propionyloxymethyl) -propyl ester (MRS 2395), a P 2 Y(12) selective antagonist. The response to ATP was increased by 2 '-deoxy-N(6) -methyl adenosine 3 ', 5 '-diphosphate (MRS 2179), a P 2 Y(1) selective antagonist, tetrodotoxin (TTX) or N(omega) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). ADPbetaS, a P 2 Y-purinergic agonist, induced muscular contraction, with the same pharmacological profile as the ATP-induced contraction. ADP, a natural ligand for P 2 Y(1) receptors, induced muscular relaxation, antagonized by MRS 2179 and by TTX or L-NAME. Nerve stimulation elicited a transient nitrergic relaxation, followed by contraction. Contractile responses was reduced by atropine, PPADS, suramin, P 2 Y purinoceptor desensitisation, but not by P 2 X purinoceptor desensitisation, MRS 2179 or MRS 2395. None of the purinergic antagonists modified the nerve-evoked relaxation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In the longitudinal muscle of mouse distal colon, ATP, through ADPbetaS-sensitive P 2 Y purinoceptors, contributed to the excitatory neurotransmission acting directly on smooth muscle and indirectly via activation of cholinergic neurons.

40|$|Halothane {{has many}} {{effects on the}} resting {{membrane}} potential (Vm) of excitable cells and exerts numerous effects on skeletal muscle {{one of which is}} the enhancement of Ca 2 + release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) resulting in a sustained contracture. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the effects of clinical doses of halothane on Vm, recorded using intracellular microelectrodes on cleaned and non stimulated sartorius muscle which was freshly isolated from the leg of the frog Rana esculenta. We assessed the mechanism of effects of superfused halothane on Vm by the administration of selective antagonists of membrane bound Na+, K+ and Cl− channels and by inhibition of SR Ca 2 + release. Halothane (3 %) induced an early and transient depolarization (4. 5 [*]mV within 7 [*]min) and a delayed and sustained hyperpolarization (about 11 [*]mV within 15 [*]min) of Vm. The halothane-induced transient depolarization was sensitive to ryanodine (10 [*]μM) and to 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-isothiocyanatostilbene 2, 2 ′ <b>disulphonic</b> acid (SITS, 1 [*]mM). The hyperpolarization of Vm induced by halothane (0. 1 – 3 %) was dose-dependent and reversible. It was insensitive to SITS (1 [*]mM), tetrodotoxin (0. 6 [*]μM), and tetraethylammonium (10 [*]mM) but was blocked and/or prevented by ryanodine (10 [*]μM), charybdotoxin (CTX, 1 [*]μM), and glibenclamide (10 [*]nM). Our observations revealed that the effects of halothane on Vm may be related to the increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration produced by the ryanodine-sensitive Ca 2 + release from the SR induced by the anaesthetic. The depolarization may be attributed to the activation of Ca 2 +-dependent Cl− (blocked by SITS) channels and the hyperpolarization to the activation of large conductance Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels, blocked by CTX, and to the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, inhibited by glibenclamide...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{superoxide}} dismutase (SOD) mimetics were examined both biochemically {{for their ability}} to inhibit the superoxide-catalyzed reduction of cytochrome c and nitro blue tetrazolium, and functionally {{for their ability to}} mimic authentic Cu/Zn SOD in restoring nitrergic neurotransmission in bovine retractor penis (BRP) muscle following its inhibition by oxidant stress. The SOD mimetics investigated were CuSO 4, MnCl 2, CuDIPS (copper [II] [diisopropylsalicylate] 2), MnTBAP (manganese [III] tetrakis 4 -benzoic acid porphyrin), MnTMPyP (manganese [III] tetrakis 1 -methyl- 4 -pyridyl porphyrin pentachloride), tiron (4, 5 -dihydroxy- 1, 3 -benzene <b>disulphonic</b> acid), PTIYO (4 -phenyl, 2, 2, 5, 5,-tetramethyl- 3 -imidazolin- 1 -yloxy- 3 -oxide) and tempol (4 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl). The rank order of potency in inhibiting the reduction of cytochrome c was: CuSO 4 ⩾MnCl 2 ⩾CuDIPS⩾MnTMPyP>MnTBAP>tempol⩾tiron>PTIYO. The requirement for EDTA (0. 1 [*]mM) prevented assessment of the activity of CuSO 4, MnCl 2 and CuDIPS in the assay involving inhibition of reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium. However, the rank order of potency for those agents which could be examined (MnTMPyP>MnTBAP>tiron⩾tempol>PTIYO) was essentially similar to that seen in the cytochrome c assay. Inhibition of endogenous Cu/Zn SOD with diethyldithiocarbamate (DETCA, 3 [*]mM, 120 [*]min) in BRP muscle strips, followed by addition of the superoxide anion generator, LY 83583 (1 [*]μM), resulted in almost complete abolition of nitrergic relaxation (4 [*]Hz, 10 [*]s). Authentic Cu/Zn SOD (1 – 300 [*]u[*]ml− 1), CuSO 4 (0. 1 – 300 [*]μM), MnCl 2 (0. 1 – 100 [*]μM) and MnTMPyP (10 – 300 [*]μM) each restored nitrergic transmission by around 50 %. However, CuDIPS (0. 1 – 30 [*]μM), MnTBAP (0. 1 – 100 [*]μM), tempol (10 [*]μM– 3 [*]mM), PTIYO (1 – 300 [*]μM) and tiron (10 [*]μM– 10 [*]mM) all failed to restore nitrergic transmission. The ability of MnTMPyP to restore nitrergic neurotransmission may therefore provide a lead in the development of SOD mimetics as therapeutic agents in the treatment of neuropathies associated with oxidant stress...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} cAMP/cGMP, protein kinases and intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +](i)) in pentoxifylline-stimulated hamster sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction (AR) in vitro. Treatment with pentoxifylline [0. 45 mM) initially increased sperm cAMP values 2. 8 -fold, compared with untreated controls (396 +/- 9. 2 versus 141 +/- 6. 0 fmoles/ 10 (6) spermatozoa; mean +/- SEM, n = 6) after 15 min, although by 3 h, cAMP values were similar (503 - 531 fmoles/ 10 (6) spermatozoal, cGMP values (similar to 27 fmoles/ 10 (6) spermatozoa) were the same in treated and control spermatozoa. Both sperm capacitation and the AR, determined from {{the absence of an}} acrosomal cap, were stimulated by pentoxifylline; these were almost completely inhibited by a Cl-/HCO(3) (-) antiporter inhibitor (4, 4 -diisothiocyanato-stilbene- 2, 2 <b>disulphonic</b> acid; 1 mM) defined from the degree of sperm motility and by a protein kinase A inhibitor (H 89; 10 mu M) A protein kinase G inhibitor (staurosporine, 1 nM) did not affect pentoxifylline-stimulated capacitation but inhibited the AR by 50 %. A protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tyrphostin A- 47, 0. 1 mM) had no effect on either pentoxifylline-stimulated capacitation or AR, A phospholipase A(2) inhibitor (aristolochic acid, 0. 4 mM) markedly inhibited the pentoxifylline-stimulated AR but not capacitation. When intracellular sperm calcium [Ca 2 +](i) was measured using fura- 2 -AM, there was an early rise 271 nM at 0. 5 hi in pentoxifylline(-treated spermatozoa; this appeared to be due to intracellular mobilization rather than to uptake. In the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, sperm motility was maintained in the presence of pentoxifylline, but capacitation did not occur; spermatozoa exhibited a low level of hyperactivated motility and had a poor rate of AR(20. 5 +/- 2. 3 %). These results suggest that: (i) the pentoxifylline-stimulated early onset of sperm capacitation may be mediated by an early rise in cAMP and [Ca 2 +/-](i) and involves protein kinase A activity; and (ii) pentoxifylline-stimulated AR may require phospholipase A;A(2) and protein kinase C activity...|$|E
40|$|This acid is a {{component}} of Fast Yellow G and, {{because it is not}} solid, is not used generally as dyestuff. But it is important as an infermediate product of fast disazodyes, such as Crocein Scarlet etc. Finding it necessary to obtain a pure p-aminoazobenzensulphonic acid as component of the Chlorantine Fast Dyes (Red 5 BL, 7 BL and Bordeux BLL,), the auther made the following study on the preparation of the acid. The preparation of this pure acid with a good yield offers some difucuties. By sulphonating aminoazobenzene a product may be obtained, which consists mostly of the same monosulphoryic acid, but contains also some of <b>disulphonic</b> acid and possibly isomeric monosulphoryic acid. This product does not give the resired shade and properties, which are obtainable by pure p-sulbphonic acid. The method of coupling diazotised sulphanilic acid with aniline gives a poor yield. If, however, some easily hydrolysed derivatives of aniline, such as acylaniline, methylaniline-w-sulphonic acid etc., are used, coupling may be successful in certain cases. In the present work, according to the method used in G. P. 217935, aniline is acylated with p-toluenesul-phochloride. The preparation then proceeds as fallows, 93 parts of aniline are suspended in 1100 parts of water and 45 parts of caustic soda, acylated with 190 parts of p-toluenesulphochloride under rapid stirring. p-Toluenesulphochloride thus obtained is then dissolved in 1800 parts of water and 180 parts of caustic soda solution (40 %). 210 parts of sulphanilic acid are diazotized as usual and added to the above cooled solution of p-toluenesulphochloride. p-Toluenesulphoaminoazobenzenesulphonic acid is separated, and when coupling is finished, it is acidfied, filtered off and washed. The wet cake (60 % water contect) is then stirred with 3550 parts of concentrated sulphulic acid and the mixture warmed at 75 ℃ for 2 hours. When the solution is poured into 3000 parts of ice water, a free p-aminoazobenzensulphonic acid is precipitated, filtered off and recrystallised from 3500 parts of ammoniacal water. The yield of ammoniumsalt is 204 parts (69 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular Cl {{activity}} (aiCl), and intracellular pH (pHi) {{were measured}} in isolated sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres using a liquid ion exchanger Cl-selective micro-electrode {{and a glass}} recessed-tip, pH-selective micro-electrode. Removal of external Cl (glucuronate substituted) produced a fall in aiCl from about 20 to about 4 mmol/l: the residual level is probably caused by intracellular interference on the Cl-sensitive electrode. Re-exposure of the fibre to increased levels of external Cl produced, in the steady state, increased levels of aiCl. The dependence of steady-state aiCl upon external Cl activity, aoCl, was roughly hyperbolic with 50 % recovery occurring at an aoCl of about 9. 5 mmol/l. At all levels of external Cl tested, Cl was accumulated to a level much higher than that predicted for passive electrochemical equilibrium. Exposure of a Cl-depleted fibre to various levels of external Cl produced an exponential rise with time in aiCl. The initial rate-of-rise in aiCl {{was estimated to be}} a saturating function of aoCl, with a half-maximal effect occurring at an aoCl of about 33 mmol/l. The rate-of-rise was about 10 -fold greater than that predicted from constant-field theory using published values for PCl, the Cl permeability coefficient. Steady-state aiCl was essentially insensitive to changes in external HCO 3 concentration, [HCO 3]o, if these changes were made at a constant external pH, pHo, i. e. when a reduction in [HCO 3]o was accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in the partial pressure of CO 2, PCO 2. In contrast, if PCO 2 was maintained constant, then a change in [HCO 3]o (thus producing a change in pHo) resulted in an inverse change in aiCl. This change in aiCl was also accompanied by a change in pHi: when aiCl increased, pHi decreased and vice versa. The anion-exchange inhibitor, DIDS (4, 4 -diisothiocyanato-stilbene <b>disulphonic</b> acid) abolished the effect on aiCl of changes in [HCO 3]o and pHo (at constant PCO 2). Furthermore DIDS reduced the influence of pHo upon pHi. Both the fall of aiCl in Cl-free solution and the subsequent reuptake of Cl following re-exposure to Cl-containing solution were slowed by a reduction in [HCO 3]o (constant pHo, reduced PCO 2). Both reuptake and wash-out of Cl were saturating functions of [HCO 3]o with half-maximal effect occurring at an [HCO 3]o of 1 - 1. 3 mmol/l. The reuptake of Cl was little affected by removal of external Na (bis, 2 -hydroxy ethyl, dimethyl ammonium substituted). The reuptake of Cl was unaffected by amiloride (1 mmol/l) but slowed by piretanide (1 mmol/l). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation is δF 508 and this causes cystic fibrosis (CF). Animal models that recapitulate the human disease phenotype {{are critical to}} understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms in CF and developing therapies. New CF models in the pig and ferret have been generated that develop lung, pancreatic, liver, and intestinal pathologies that reflect disease in CF patients. Species-specific biology in the processing of CFTR has demonstrated that pig and mouse δF 508 -CFTR proteins are more effectively processed to the apical membrane of airway epithelia than human δF 508 -CFTR. The processing behavior of ferret wild-type (WT) and δF 508 -CFTR proteins remain unknown and such information is important to predicting the utility of a δF 508 -CFTR ferret. To this end, we sought to compare processing, membrane stability, and function of human and ferret WT- and δF 508 -CFTR proteins in a heterologous expression system using HT 1080, HEK 293 T, BHK 21, and Cos 7 cells, as well as human and ferret CF polarized airway epithelia. Analysis of the protein processing and stability by metabolic pulse-chase and surface On-Cell Western blots revealed that WT-fCFTR half-life and membrane stability were increased relative to WT-hCFTR. Furthermore, in BHK 21, Cos 7, and CuFi cells, human and ferret δF 508 -CFTR processing was negligible, while low levels of processing of δF 508 -fCFTR {{could be seen in}} HT 1080 and HEK 293 T cells. Only the WT-fCFTR, but not δF 508 -fCFTR, produced functional cAMP-inducible chloride currents in both CF human and ferret airway epithelia. Further elucidation of the mechanism responsible for elevated fCFTR protein stability may lead to new therapeutic approaches to augment CFTR function. These findings also suggest that generation of a ferret CFTRδF 508 /δF 508 animal model may be useful. Furthermore, in the CFTR and CFTR+/+ ferret model we have characterized abnormalities in the bioelectric properties of the trachea, stomach, intestine and gallbladder of newborn CF ferrets. Short circuit current (ISC) analysis of CF and WT tracheas revealed the following similarities and differences: 1) amiloride sensitive sodium currents were similar between genotypes, 2) responses to 4, 42 ̆ 7 -diisothiocyano- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -stilbene <b>disulphonic</b> acid (DIDS) were 4 -fold greater in CF animals, suggesting elevated baseline chloride transport through non-CFTR channels, and 3) as expected, {{there was a lack of}} IBMX/forskolin-stimulated and GlyH- 101 -inhibited currents in CF animals due to the lack of CFTR. CFTR mRNA and protein was present throughout all levels of the WT ferret and IBMX/forskolin-inducible ISC was only observed in WT animals. Interestingly, IBMX/forskolin-inducible intestinal ISC in WT animals was not inhibited by the CFTR inhibitor GlyH- 101 or bumetanide. The luminal pH of the CF ferret stomach was significantly decreased relative to the controls, while both genotypes maintained near neutral pH along the length of the intestine. The WT stomach and gallbladder exhibited significantly enhanced IBMX/forskolin ISC responses and inhibition by GlyH- 101 relative to CF samples. These findings demonstrate that multiple organs affected by disease in the CF ferret have bioelectric abnormalities consistent with the lack of cAMP-mediated chloride transport...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the ability of}} a range of NO donor compounds to stimulate cyclic GMP accumulation and inhibit collagen-induced aggregation of human washed platelets. In addition, the rate of spontaneous release of NO from each donor has been measured spectrophotometrically by the oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin to methaemoglobin. The NO donors used were five s-nitrosothiol compounds: S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-nitrosocysteine (cysNO), S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), S-nitroso-N-acetyl-cysteine (SNAC), S-nitrosohomocysteine (homocysNO), and two non-nitrosothiol compounds: diethylamine NONOate (DEANO) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Using 10 [*]μM of each donor compound, mean±s. e. mean rate of NO release ranged from 0. 04 ± 0. 001 [*]nmol[*]min− 1 (for SNP) to 3. 15 ± 0. 29 [*]nmol[*]min− 1 (for cysNO); cyclic GMP accumulation ranged from 0. 43 ± 0. 05 [*]pmol per 108 platelets (for SNP) to 2. 67 ± 0. 31 [*]pmol per 108 platelets (for cysNO), and inhibition of platelet aggregation ranged from 40 ± 6. 4 % (for SNP) to 90 ± 3. 8 % (for SNAC). There was a significant positive correlation between the rate of NO release and the ability of the different NO donors to stimulate intra-platelet cyclic GMP accumulation (r= 0. 83; P= 0. 02). However, no significant correlation was observed between the rate of NO release and the inhibition of platelet aggregation by the different NO donors (r=− 0. 17), nor was there a significant correlation between cyclic GMP accumulation and inhibition of aggregation by the different NO donor compounds (r= 0. 34). Comparison of the dose-response curves obtained with GSNO, DEANO and 8 -bromo cyclic GMP showed DEANO to be the most potent stimulator of intraplatelet cyclic GMP accumulation (P< 0. 001 vs both GSNO and 8 -bromo cyclic GMP), but GSNO to be the most potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation (P< 0. 01 vs DEANO, and P< 0. 001 vs 8 -bromo cyclic GMP). The rate of NO release from GSNO, and its ability both to stimulate intra-platelet cyclic GMP accumulation and to inhibit platelet aggregation, were all significantly diminished by the copper (I) (Cu+) chelating agent bathocuproine <b>disulphonic</b> acid (BCS). In contrast, BCS had no effect on either the rate of NO release, or the anti-platelet action of the non-nitrosothiol compound DEANO. Cyclic GMP accumulation in response to GSNO (10 − 9 – 10 − 5 M) was undetectable following treatment of platelets with ODQ (100 [*]μM), a selective inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase. Despite this abolition of guanylate cyclase stimulation, GSNO retained some ability to inhibit aggregation, indicating the presence of a cyclic GMP-independent component in its anti-platelet action. However, this component was abolished following treatment of platelets with a combination of both ODQ and BCS, suggesting that Cu+ ions were required for the cyclic GMP-independent pathway to operate. The cyclic GMP-independent action of GSNO, observed in ODQ-treated platelets, could not be explained by an increase in intra-platelet cyclic AMP. The impermeable thiol modifying agent p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonic acid (CMPS) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of aggregation of ODQ-treated platelets, accompanied by a progressive loss of detectable platelet surface thiol groups. Additional treatment with GSNO failed to increase the degree of aggregation inhibition, suggesting that a common pathway of thiol modification might be utilized by both GSNO and CMPS to elicit cyclic GMP-independent inhibition of platelet aggregation. We conclude that NO donor compounds mediate inhibition of platelet aggregation by both cyclic GMP-dependent and -independent pathways. Cyclic GMP generation is related to the rate of spontaneous release of NO from the donor compound, but transfer of the NO signal to the cyclic GMP-independent pathway may depend upon a cellular system which involves both copper (I) (Cu+) ions and surface membrane thiol groups. The potent anti-platelet action of GSNO results from its ability to exploit this cyclic GMP-independent mechanism...|$|E
