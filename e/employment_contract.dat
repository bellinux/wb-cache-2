5|$|Foreign {{domestic}} {{workers and}} their supporters, including activists and employers, have periodically staged rallies protesting {{what they perceive as}} discriminatory treatment {{on the part of the}} Hong Kong government. Grievances include discrimination, the minimum wage and the two-week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker's <b>employment</b> <b>contract.</b> According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM), foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 1 cabin fire in January 1967 put manned spaceflight on hold. The crew of Apollo 7, {{designated}} to be {{the return}} to manned spaceflight, began working with the Robbins Company later in 1967 to produce commemorative mission medallions. Commissioned by the NASA Astronaut Flight Office (AFO), the medallions were financed entirely through the orders placed by astronauts and support crew personnel. Only those directly affiliated with the AFO were eligible as purchasers, and they were bound by their <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> not to commercialize the medallions, as NASA was concerned about any appearance that the astronauts might profit from the flown medallions.|$|E
40|$|A bill {{currently}} {{pending in}} Congress would render unenforceable mandatory arbitration clauses in all <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> Some perceive these provisions as employer efforts to deprive employees of important legal rights. Company CEOs are firm employees, and, unlike most other firm employees, {{they can actually}} negotiate their <b>employment</b> <b>contracts,</b> very often with attorney assistance. Moreover, many CEO <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> are publicly available, {{so they can be}} examined empirically. In this paper, we ask whether CEOs bargain to include binding arbitration provisions in their <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> After exploring the theoretical arguments for and against including such provisions in these agreements, we use a large sample of CEO <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> to test the several different hypotheses for including such provisions. We find that only about one half of CEO <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> in our sample include such provisions. What factors might determine whether CEOs agree to arbitrate their employment disputes with their companies? We find that CEOs that receive a higher percentage of long-term incentive pay as a fraction of their total pay, that work in industry sectors that are undergoing greater amounts of change, and that have lower long-term profitability are statistically significantly more likely to have arbitration provisions in their <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> The importance of contextual factors for arbitration clauses in CEO contracts indicates that regulation of arbitration clauses in <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> should be more nuanced than that found in pending legislation...|$|R

Art. 15 of the Worker’s Statute (hereafter WS) establishes that a <b>contract</b> of <b>employment</b> may be of either a definite or an indefinite duration. Prior to the 1994 labour law reform, Art. 15 of the WS established a presumption in favour of open-ended <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> Accordingly, Spanish labour law sought to popularise the conclusion of open-ended <b>employment</b> <b>contracts,</b> with fixed-term contracts regarded as an exception...|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} requires foreign domestic helpers {{to leave}} Hong Kong {{within two weeks}} of the termination of their <b>employment</b> <b>contract,</b> unless they find another employer (the two-week rule). According to Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, this is a form of discrimination against foreign domestic helpers (who are almost all Southeast Asian); this limitation is not enforced for other foreign workers. The two-week rule has been condemned by two United Nations committees: the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore {{is confined to}} matters of public law, and the applicable tests are the source test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> was later terminated. She complained to various statutory bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against the PSC. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that the common law {{governing}} the employment of labor makes the distinction not only between employee and independent contractor but also between managerial control and agency. The idea is that common law precedents govern workers who are employed and managerially controlled without the requirement that formal, written contracts be established, and that these defaults support the authority of management to direct their activities within the firm. However, many firm owners voluntarily restrict their ability to control workers by making them agents. Workers who are agents differ from workers who are managerially controlled in that in the former caseworkers are treated differently in the eyes of the common law and they often sign detailed, formal <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> The typical features of formal <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> are examined. The principal conclusion is that formal <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> facilitate the granting of discretion to workers by superseding many of the legal defaults that define the relationship between the worker and firm owner. <b>Employment</b> <b>contracts,</b> managerial control, agency relations, common law, transaction cost economics...|$|R
