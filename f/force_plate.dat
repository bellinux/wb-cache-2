2500|$|The word walk is {{descended from}} the Old English wealcan [...] "to roll". In humans and other bipeds, walking is {{generally}} distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground {{and there is a}} period of double-support. In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground with each step. This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events. For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon {{the presence or absence of}} a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification. [...] The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> at midstance. During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance, while during running, it is then at a minimum. This distinction, however, only holds true for locomotion over level or approximately level ground. For walking up grades above 9%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals. Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground (averaged across all feet) of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, although this definition is incomplete. Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>force</b> <b>plates</b> measure {{only the}} vertical {{component of the}} force in the geometric center of the platform. More advanced models measure the three-dimensional components of the single equivalent force applied {{to the surface and}} its point of application, usually called the centre of pressure (CoP), as well as the vertical moment of <b>force.</b> Cylindrical <b>force</b> <b>plates</b> have also been constructed for studying arboreal locomotion, including brachiation.|$|R
50|$|The {{measurements}} from a {{force platform}} {{can be either}} studied in isolation, or combined with other data, such as limb kinematics to understand the principles of locomotion.

Simultaneous video measurements of leg joint angles and <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> output can allow the determination of torque, work and power at each joint using a method called inverse dynamics.|$|E
50|$|In short, sprint {{velocity}} is {{reliant on}} three main factors: step frequency (how many steps {{you can take}} per second), average vertical force applied to the ground, and contact length (distance your center of mass translates over the course of one contact period). The formula was tested by having subjects run on a force treadmill (which is a treadmill that contains a <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> to measure ground reaction forces (GRF)). Figure 1 shows approximately what the <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> readout looks like for the duration of three steps. While this equation has proved to be fairly accurate, the study was limited in the sense that data was collected by a <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> that only measured vertical GRF rather than horizontal GRF. This led some people to the false pretense that simply exerting a greater vertical (perpendicular) force to the ground would lead to greater acceleration, which is far from correct (See Morin studies below).|$|E
5000|$|Advancements in {{technology}} have allowed force platforms {{to take on}} a new role within the kinetics field. Traditional laboratory-grade force plates cost (usually in the thousands) have made them very impractical for the everyday clinician. However, Nintendo introduced the Wii Balance Board (WBB) (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) in 2007 and changed the structure of what a <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> can be. By 2010, {{it was found that the}} WBB is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the weight distribution, when directly compared to the [...] "gold-standard" [...] laboratory-grade <b>force</b> <b>plate,</b> while costing less than $100. More so, this has been verified in both healthy and clinical populations. This is possible due to the four force transducers found in the corners of the WBB. These studies are conducted using customized software, such as LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) that can be integrated with the board to be able to measure the amount of body sway or the CoP path length during trials for time. The other benefit to having a posturography system, such as the WBB, is that it is portable so clinicians around the world are able to measure body sway quantitatively, instead of relying on the subjective, clinical balance assessments currently in use.|$|E

Many scientist don't always have access to these expensive and unique equipment. Force plates can be any from thousands {{to tens of thousands}} of dollars. Scientist and students today have turned to an alternative way, by using Nintendo Wii Balance Board system as a <b>force</b> <b>plate.</b> One 2014 San Diego State University study has shown a correlation of [...] for the center of pressure measured using the Balance Board compared to a gold standard measure. The students expect their results to find that ankle bracing will reduce sway and decrease ankle instability and falls. Postural sway is the measurement of the time and distance a subject spends away from an ideal center of pressure. Measurement of a subject's center of pressure has been used as a method of quantifying postural stability.Investigators have theorized that if ankle injuries cause differentiation and functional instability, a subject's postural sway should be altered.Bracing has been known to provide cutaneous afferent feedback in maintaining postural control. The feedback follows the same neurological pathways in which the external ankle brace enhances the replication of the joint position.Although some may argue that braces have a negative impact on sport performance, the effectiveness of their mechanical stability make them of high priority and necessity. Due to the high incidence of ankle injury, the control of stability and body sway remain of most importance in reduction of injury and better quality of life.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study proposes an {{analysis}} system {{for evaluating the}} intersegmental forces exerted on human lower limbs during walking motion. In existing analysis systems, the ground reaction force exerted on the feet is generally measured using <b>force</b> <b>plates</b> and the intersegmental forces are then estimated using an inverse dynamics approach. However, <b>force</b> <b>plates</b> are inconvenient and expensive. Accordingly, the present study proposes a new method for evaluating the intersegmental forces exerted on human lower limbs during walking {{without the need for}} <b>force</b> <b>plates.</b> In the proposed approach, the legs are modeled as a seven-link parallel manipulator. The kinematics and dynamics of the leg model are formulated, and the intersegmental forces are then derived using Newton-Euler theory based on the posture information obtained by gyroscopes accelerometers during walking motion. The results obtained from the analysis system for the intersegmental forces during walking motion are compared with experiment data obtained by using an load cells. It is found that the estimated results are in good agreement with measurement results. Thus, the basic validity of the proposed analysis system is confirmed...|$|R

50|$|Both {{simulations}} on skeletal {{models and}} experiments on <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> {{agree on that}} since the total angular momentum is lowered with the counterbalancing swing of arms {{with respect to the}} lower-limb the free arm swing limits the ground reaction moments effective on the stance foot during walking. In other words, a subject needs less reaction moment applied by the ground surface when there is arm swing. Having a smaller need for a reaction moment implies that the friction force between the stance foot and the ground surface {{does not have to be}} as high as it would when there is no arm swing. Less dependence on the friction force, hence environment, is a possible outcome of arm swing.|$|E
50|$|Deep {{research}} into the anatomy of large mammals such as, kangaroos and other large ungulates such as deer and gazelle, suggests strongly {{that some sort of}} elastic mechanism is important for this energetic savings. Previous combination of careful experiments, with anatomical (e.g. tendon dimensions), mechanical (e.g. <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> recordings) and mathematical calculations revealed that a significant fraction of the work done with each step could be provided by the spring-like action of tendons, rather than by muscle work.When the animal’s foot contacts the surface of the ground during high speed locomotion, the tendon or ligament is pressed tightly together, storing elastic energy much like a compressed spring. As the foot gets of the ground, the pressure on the compressed tendons and ligaments is released, and elastic recoil from these spring like structures provides additional force to propel the animal thus resulting in energetic savings. Simple calculations based kangaroo hopping and forces involved in hopping show how storage of elastic strain energy can save twenty to thirty percent of metabolic energy required for hopping. Measurements of oxygen consumption with fluctuations of kinetic and gravitational potential energy, indicate elastic savings of at least fifty four percent at high speeds.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a report}} on an article in Nature, {{co-author}} Daniel E.

[...] Lieberman et al.'s study was an experiment that involved five groups of runners from Kenya and the United States. The two American groups were adult athletes who had run with shoes since childhood, and those who habitually ran barefoot or with minimal footwear such as Vibram FiveFingers (mentioned by name in the study).

The runners were instructed to run over a <b>force</b> <b>plate</b> that was embedded in a 25-meter track, and were recorded during the run using a three-dimensional infrared kinematic system.

COP data were collected from two piezoelectric <b>force</b> <b>plates</b> as a trolley wheel was rolled across the boundary between the plates.

Mean COP errors during transition across the plate boundary were 0. 003 +/- 0. 002 m relative to a control point. Kinematic and kinetic data were also collected from eight athletes during sprint running trials to demonstrate the sensitivity of the inverse dynamics analysis to COP error for the ground contact phase of the dynamic movement trials. Kinetic sensitivity to the COP error was assessed during the entire stance phase for the ankle, knee, and hip joints and was less than 5 % and 3 % for joint moment and power data, respectively.
