25|$|Dan Schok: Project {{engineer}} for <b>Flowline,</b> supplier of 34-inch diameter 130-foot long pipe being transported by Jessee in episode 2.|$|E
50|$|The Kapoor Tunnel is a {{straight}} 8.8 km subterranean route {{which is the}} main transport {{of water from the}} Sooke Lake to the Westshore, City of Victoria, Esquimalt, and the Saanich Peninsula. When it was determined that the Sooke <b>Flowline</b> would no longer meet the region's needs, {{the decision was made to}} excavate the tunnel. Prior to construction of the <b>flowline,</b> Arthur Adams, the consultant for the <b>flowline</b> construction, had proposed the Kapoor Tunnel be built. Unfortunately, that era's technology was not yet up to the task.|$|E
50|$|This tunnel can convey 580 million litres/day, 10 {{times greater}} than the Sooke <b>Flowline,</b> and {{provides}} water to all municipalities, except Sooke and the Highlands. Its final cost was $5.6 million. The Sooke <b>Flowline</b> had been leaking and was vulnerable to blow downs and rock slides.|$|E
5000|$|The FPSO {{built by}} Samsung Heavy {{industries}} contained {{a number of}} firsts for its type. The SURF (Subsea, Umbilicals, Risers, <b>Flowlines)</b> contract was won by Stolt Offshore (later renamed Acergy and now Subsea7 [...] ). Stolt vessel POLARIS installed all the <b>flowlines</b> and subsea structures in J-Lay and S-Lay pipelay modes.|$|R
50|$|Soluforce is an RTP, {{which is}} a {{flexible}} pipe, supplied in long length coils up to 400m length and pressure ratings from 30 to 90 bar. In the last few years, this type of pipe has been acknowledged as the standardised solution for oilfield <b>flowlines</b> and also recently used offshore for water injection risers and oil <b>flowlines.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} Gauss-Landau-Hall magnetic field on a Riemannian surface. The corresponding Landau-Hall problem is shown to be equivalent to the dynamics of a massive boson. This allows one to view that problem as a globally stated, variational one. In this framework, <b>flowlines</b> appear as critical points of an action with density depending on the proper acceleration. Moreover, we can study global stability of <b>flowlines.</b> In this equivalence, the massless particle model correspond with a limit case obtained when {{the force of the}} Gauss-Landau-Hall increases arbitrarily. We also obtain new properties related with the completeness of <b>flowlines</b> for a general magnetic fields. The paper also contains new results relative to the Landau-Hall problem associated with a uniform magnetic field. For example, we characterize those revolution surfaces whose parallels are all normal <b>flowlines</b> of a uniform magnetic field. 1 From a classical picture to a general setting Classically, the Landau-Hall problem consists of the motion study of a charged particle {{in the presence of a}} static magnetic field, H. In this setting, free of any electric field, a particle, of charge e and mass m, evolves with velocity v satisfying the Lorentz force law, [1], dP dt...|$|R

50|$|The Sooke <b>Flowline</b> is an {{abandoned}} 44 km concrete aqueduct that snakes through the Sooke Hills from Sooke Lake to the Humpback Reservoir near Mt. Wells Regional Park. From this reservoir, a buried, riveted steel pressure main transported water to Victoria. In between 1994 and 2007, this main was replaced {{since it was}} long past its useful life. The <b>flowline</b> was vital to the continued growth of the City of Victoria as it provided a reliable water supply.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the tunnel}} was {{completed}} in 1967, water flowed from the lake through the circuitous, leaky and much smaller 44 km Sooke <b>Flowline.</b>|$|E

40|$|For {{fields where}} the overall thermal {{performance}} requirement is a U-value {{of less than}} 3. 5 W/m-K or 0. 6 BTU/ft-hr-°F between the wellhead and the topsides, cost-optimization is achieved by using the combination between a very well insulated pipe in pipe for the <b>flowlines</b> (U as good as 0. 5 W/m-K or 0. 09 BTU/ft-hr-°F), which therefore allows to relax the specification on the riser thermal performance and bring it within the feasibility limits of the wet insulation (5 L syntactic PP) driving the overall installed cost down. This architecture {{has been used for}} the Shell Bonga project for which the overall specified U-value was initially 2 W/m-K. The optimized solution finally selected by the Operator was to use a pipe in pipe for the <b>flowlines</b> that achieved a U-value better than 1 W/m-K and a 100 mm 5 LSyntPP wet insulation on the riser (Uriser= 2. 5 W/m-K). The combination of the two allowed making significant cost savings while gaining on operation flexibility due to longer cooldown times on the <b>flowlines.</b> With the growing number of deeper water field developments, the cost of the <b>flowlines</b> and risers are paramount and this combination of pipe in pipes and wet insulation allows meeting, or exceeding, the thermal performance while ensuring the economy and feasibility of the projects.

5000|$|The Merlin {{field was}} {{discovered}} in 1998 and was initially developed as a low cost CRINE field (Cost Reduction In the New Era) utilising the discovery well recompleted as a subsea producer. The Merlin drill centre was progressively expanded to 3 subsea production wells and a single water injector. The <b>flowlines</b> from Merlin comprise 8" [...] water injection and production lines. These tie into the Osprey riser system at Dunlin. Merlin subsea controls tie in via a crossover manifold adjacent to Dunlin into the Osprey umbilical system. Flexible <b>flowlines</b> were installed for water injection service on Merlin and Osprey in 2002.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} to construct a kind of moduli space of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and then the Ricci flow really does give a geometric flow (in the intuitive sense of particles flowing along <b>flowlines)</b> in this moduli space.|$|R

5000|$|Scanline VFX is {{also known}} for its {{in-house}} software, <b>Flowline.</b> This software is a 3D package enhancement (for instance 3dsmax or Maya), offering a variety of tools for fluid simulations, dynamics or particles.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} {{are tied}} {{back to the}} FPSO by <b>flowlines</b> and power umbilicals. Project requires extensive sub-surface and reservoir management skills such as produced water injection, horizontal wells and flow assurance to sustain the project over a longer-term.|$|R
30|$|Asphaltene {{precipitation}} {{and subsequent}} deposition in porous medium {{as well as}} in the <b>flowlines</b> causes expensive flow assurance issues worldwide. Changes in pressure, temperature and composition of oil may cause asphaltene precipitation and deposition (Leontaritis and Mansoori 1987; Zahedi et al. 2009; Rassamdana et al. 1996; Branco et al. 2001; Mofidi and Edalat 2006; Eskin et al. 2016; Kord et al. 2014). These changes could happen during different in situ recovery processes such as natural depletion, gas injection, and chemical flooding as well as during production and transportation of the produced crude in <b>flowlines</b> (Mansoori 1997; Zanganeh et al. 2012; da Silva Oliveira et al. 2014). Asphaltene precipitation has also been reported during well workover and acidizing operations (Jacobs and Thorne 1986; Kokal and Sayegh 1995).|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} of Lockhart and Martinelli {{in its present}} form cannot be used to study a large set of data because it requires the use of charts and hence cannot be simulated numerically. A correlation between Lockhart and Martinelli parameters and X lor a two phase pressure drop in pipelines was developed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). This enabled the development of a computer program for the analysis of data using the Lockhart and Martinelli correlation. Field data from Saudi <b>flowlines</b> were then analysed using the program and the results show that the impoved Lockhart and Martinelli correlation predicts accurately the downstream pressure in <b>flowlines</b> with an average percent difference of 5. 1 and standard deviation of 9. 6 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{extends the}} {{so-called}} Effective Process Time (EPT) approach to single server <b>flowlines</b> with finite buffers and blocking. The {{power of the}} EPT approach is that it quantifies vari-ability in workstation process times without the need to identify each of the contributing disturbances, and that it directly provides an algorithm for the actual computation of EPTs. It is shown that EPT real-izations can be simply obtained from arrival and departure times of lots, by using sample path equations. The measured EPTs {{can be used for}} bottleneck analysis and for lumped parameter modeling. Simulation experiments show that for lumped parameter modeling of <b>flowlines</b> with finite buffers, in addition to the mean and variance, offset is also a relevant parameter of the process time distribution. A case from the automotive industry illustrates the approach...|$|R
