40|$|Conventional {{treatments}} for bacterial infections target bacterial viability, {{an approach that}} exerts a strong selective survival pressure on bacteria, leading {{to the development of}} multidrug resistant mutants. The number of multidrug resistant strains is increasing exponentially, far outpacing the development of new antibiotics. The conventional antibiotics are no longer the magic bullets they were once thought to be and there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics and/or novel strategies that do not induce bacterial resistance. Bacteria employ a population-dependent cell-to-cell communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) to express various pathogenic traits such as virulence factor production and biofilm formation. Therefore, QS inhibition is a promising novel strategy to selectively control multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, without exerting evolutionary pressures and development of resistance. This project focused on the design and synthesis of novel QS inhibitors based on common QS signaling molecules, such as N-acylated L-homoserine lactones (AHLs), indoles, N-acetyl glucosamine and other heterocyclic systems derived from halogenated furanones (Fimbrolides). Indole and glucosamine-based amides and oxo-amides were synthesized as non-native AHL mimics by applying EDC, DCC or EDC/HOBt mediated amide coupling methods. On docking study, the indole-based AHL mimics showed strong binding affinity with P. aeruginosa LasR receptor, with compound 146 d having highest docking scores of 61. 58. The reactions of brominated furanones with hydrazines have been developed granting access to 5 -membered aminopyrrolones and hydrazinyl furanones, as well as 6 -membered pyridazinones with novel bromination patterns. The ratio of formation of these different heterocycles varied with the types of hydrazine, {{as well as with the}} numbers of equivalents of hydrazines used. The X-ray crystallography analysis, revealed the characteristic halogen bonding in addition to other interactions such as hydrogen bonding which might facilitate efficient binding to the bacterial QS receptor proteins (LasR). The alkyne analogues of fimbrolides were synthesized via Sonogashira coupling reactions where the reaction was favored at the C 5 bromo methylene group over the C 4 bromine substituent of fimbrolides. Applying the Suzuki coupling reaction, various mono and di-aryl substituted fimbrolide analogues were synthesized where the aryl substitution also favored at the C 5 bromo methylene group over the C 4 bromo substituent. The dimeric scaffolds of fimbrolides were synthesized as novel ring structures using diboronic acids. Two different types of monoamino substituted (4 -bromo or 5 -bromomethylene) fimbrolides were isolated as novel structures via Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reactions of fimbrolides with various secondary amines from a single reaction in a predictable fashion (2 : 1 regioisomeric ratio). The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their QS inhibitory (QSI) efficacy against the P. aeruginosa PAMH 602 and E. coli MT 102 strains in terms of inhibition of their green fluorescent protein (GFP) production i. <b>e.</b> <b>QS</b> inhibition. The alkyne based fimbrolides compounds exhibited the highest QSI (up to 97. 6 % QSI at 250 µM) effect against P. aeruginosa MH 602 followed by glucosamine (up to QSI 79. 1 % and 97. 5 % at 2 mM concentration against P. aeruginosa MH 602 and E. coli MT 102 strain respectively) and the indole based AHL analogues (up to 65 % QSI at 250 µM against P. aeruginosa MH 602). The co-treatment of some potent QS inhibitory compounds with tobramycin also showed two-three fold enhanced P. aeruginosa biofilm inhibitory effect compared to single tobramycin treatment. These findings highlight the potential usefulness of synthesized compounds in this project with non-violent modes of action i. e. blocking bacterial communication, a key strategy for the development of future anti-QS antimicrobial compounds...|$|E

40|$|Time {{reversal}} processes {{have been}} used to improve communication performance in the severe underwater communication environment characterized by significant multipath channels by reducing inter-symbol interference and increasing signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the performance of the time reversal is strongly related to the behavior of the q -function, which is estimated by a sum of the autocorrelation of the channel impulse response for each channel in the receiver array. The q -function depends on the complexity of the communication channel, the number of channel elements and their spacing. A q -function with a high side-lobe level and a main-lobe width wider than the symbol duration creates a residual ISI (inter-symbol interference), which makes communication difficult even after time reversal is applied. In this paper, we propose a new parameter, <b>E</b> <b>q,</b> to describe the performance of time reversal communication. <b>E</b> <b>q</b> is an estimate of how much of the q -function lies within one symbol duration. The values of <b>E</b> <b>q</b> were estimated using communication data acquired at two different sites: one in which the sound speed ratio of sediment to water was less than unity and one where the ratio was higher than unity.

However, {{there is one}} essential {{difference between these two}} types of ferritins: bacterioferritins contain haem whereas eukaryotic ferritins are considered to be non-haem proteins. In vitro experiments had shown that horse spleen apoferritin or recombinant horse L chain apoferritins, when co-crystallised with haemin, undergoes demetallation of the porphyrin. In the present study a cofactor has been isolated directly from horse spleen apoferritin and from crystals of the mutant horse L chain apoferritin (<b>E</b> 53 <b>Q,</b> <b>E</b> 56 <b>Q,</b> <b>E</b> 57 <b>Q,</b> <b>E</b> 60 <b>Q</b> and R 59 M) which had been co-crystallised with haemin. In both cases the HPLC/ESI-MS results confirm that the cofactor is a N-ethylprotoporphyrin IX. Crystal structures of wild type L chain horse apoferritin and its three mutants co-crystallised with haemin have been determined to high resolution and in all cases a metal-free molecule derived from haemin was found in the hydrophobic pocket, close to the two-fold axis.
