Over the following months, Nilsen and Gallichan redecorated and furnished the entire flat. Much of this work was performed by Gallichan, as Nilsen — having discovered Gallichan's lack of <b>employment</b> <b>ambitions</b> — began to view himself as the breadwinner in their relationship. Nilsen later recollected that, although he was sexually attracted to Gallichan, the pair seldom had intercourse.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate how mentoring can prepare Māori tertiary students for employment. Representation of Māori in New Zealand business employment is low compared to non-Māori (Mintrom, 2005). Research has shown that mentoring can support both improved Māori student retention and achievement in tertiary education (Tahau-Hodges, 2010) as well as assist graduates to prepare for post-tertiary activity (Martin, Milne-Home, Barrett, & Jones, 2010). The Māori economy is flourishing within the New Zealand economy (Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, 2015), and the New Zealand government is asking tertiary organisations to prepare their graduates for employment in these areas. This research explores mentoring relationships between four Māori tertiary students and four business mentors. The mentors are currently employed in the business area the Māori tertiary student wishes to enter once graduated. The Māori tertiary students are currently studying business qualifications with majors in human resources (HR), accounting, law and business finance. The study was managed through a series of hui (meetings) between the researcher and participants. The Māori approach of whānaungatanga (relationship through shared connections) was used in the first hui, to introduce the mentor to the mentee and establish the mentoring relationship. This facilitated meeting assisted participants to decide on what they would do together to prepare the Māori tertiary student for employment. In addition, manaakitanga (to nurture), kaupapa (collective vision) and ako (reciprocity of teaching and learning) underpinned {{the way in which the}} mentoring relationship was presented to participants; as a result, they were able to connect, collaborate and learn from each other as the mentoring relationship progressed. The findings showed that mentoring by an industry mentor assisted the Māori tertiary students to prepare for employment because they were able to learn about the wider business industry, job functions, employment opportunities, study advice, creating networks and cultural considerations. The use of mentoring to prepare Māori tertiary students for employment also created an opportunity for the students to explore the potential contribution they can make to the business world. This supports the view held by Buckley and Zimmerman (2003) where mentoring can promote positive identity as well as encourage <b>employment</b> <b>ambitions.</b> All mentors and mentees were satisfied about the knowledge they had gained as a result of mentoring and offered useful suggestions for future mentoring programmes. Therefore, this research study leaves the research community with insight and direction as to how mentoring can be used to prepare Māori tertiary students for employment...|$|E

Does the ambition to get activity closer the labour market changes and if there are changing, in what way? Is it important that employment resemble or can lead to a common work? The method is to study and analysis periodicals and newspapers articles and make interviews. The main result of the study is: theories about disability, normalization and social integration has nearly connection with the <b>employment,</b> the <b>ambition</b> to get activity closer the labour market changes between different periods, the conditions to the labour market make sense and for some people with intellectual disabilities {{it is important that the}} employment resemble or can lead to a common work but for many the important is that employment offers in situation and a environment that they enjoy...|$|R
40|$|Lauren Berlant (2011) {{has written}} {{of the need}} to {{understand}} the problem of living contemporary lives, including the 'new normal' and 'new ordinary' (p. 261). This collection investigates the new normal of work and employment through international, interdisciplinary research into contemporary worker experience. The introductory chapter sets out the themes of the collection and introduces individual chapters. It argues that the most significant feature to emerge in the studies is the affective weighting attached to personalised and increasingly individualised work, and the shift this provides around how people want to work and organise their lives. Within different <b>employment</b> arrangements, this <b>ambition</b> promotes the intensification of labour and therefore becomes an 'obstacle to flourishing' (p. 1) and an example of the 'cruel optimism' discussed by Berlant...|$|R
6000|$|Fiesco {{himself is}} a personage at once {{probable}} and tragically interesting. The luxurious dissipation, {{in which he}} veils his daring projects, softens the rudeness of that strength which it half conceals. His immeasurable pride expands itself not only into a disdain of subjection, but also into the most lofty acts of magnanimity: his blind confidence in fortune seems almost warranted by the resources which he finds in his own fearlessness and imperturbable presence of mind. His ambition participates in the nobleness of his other qualities; he is less anxious that his rivals should yield to him in power than in generosity and greatness of character, attributes of which power is with him but the symbol and the fit <b>employment.</b> <b>Ambition</b> in Fiesco is indeed the common wish of every mind to diffuse its individual influence, to see its own activity reflected back from the united minds of millions: {{but it is the}} common wish acting on no common man. He does not long to rule, that he may sway other wills, as it were, by the physical exertion of his own: he would lead us captive by the superior grandeur of his qualities, once fairly manifested; and he aims at dominion, chiefly as it will enable him to manifest these. 'It is not the arena that he values, but what lies in that arena:' the sovereignty is enviable, not for its adventitious splendour, not because it is the object of coarse and universal wonder; but as it offers, in the collected force of a nation, something which the loftiest mortal may find scope for all his powers in guiding. [...] "Spread out the thunder," [...] Fiesco exclaims, [...] "into its single tones, and it becomes a lullaby for children: pour it forth together in one quick peal, and the royal sound shall move the heavens." [...] His affections are not less vehement than his other passions: his heart can be melted into powerlessness and tenderness by the mild persuasions of his Leonora; the idea of exalting this amiable being mingles largely with the other motives to his enterprise. He is, in fact, a great, and might have been a virtuous man; and though in the pursuit of grandeur he swerves from absolute rectitude, we still respect his splendid qualities, and admit the force of the allurements which have led him astray. It is but faintly that we condemn his sentiments, when, after a night spent in struggles between a rigid and a more accommodating patriotism, he looks out of his chamber, as the sun is rising in its calm beauty, and gilding the waves and mountains, and all the innumerable palaces and domes and spires of Genoa, and exclaims with rapture: [...] "This majestic city—mine! To flame over it like the kingly Day; to brood over it with a monarch's power; all these sleepless longings, all these never satiated wishes to be drowned in that unfathomable ocean!" [...] We admire Fiesco, we disapprove of him, and sympathise with him: he is crushed in the ponderous machinery which himself put in motion and thought to control: we lament his fate, but confess that it was not undeserved. He is a fit 'offering of individual free-will to the force of social conventions.' ...|$|R

40|$|Full employment’, {{for so long}} {{considered}} an unreachable relic of a bygone age, {{is back on the}} agenda. That it is once again part of economic and political debates is testament to the UK’s remarkably strong employment performance in recent years. A record-high employment rate is something few people would have thought possible this soon after the most sustained economic downturn in living memory. Expectations of what may be possible are shifting, and the question of how much further we might expect to go is increasing in relevance. It is in this context that the Chancellor has committed to full <b>employment</b> as an <b>ambition</b> for the government, targeting the highest employment rate of G 7 economies and a 2 million employment increase within this parliament under this banner. Welcome though such ambition is, with no universally-agreed definition of full employment and no further detail on the government’s approach at present, it is not clear just what these targets represent, who they benefit, or how they should be achieved. This report – the conclusion of a nine-month investigation into full employment by the Resolution Foundation – addresses these questions. It sets out a vision of further employment growth on the road to full employment that delivers the strongest social and economic benefits, and it provides policy directions for how we might get there...|$|R

Åtgärden/insatsen innebär att ett visst antal individer erhållervisstidsanställning inom kommunens verksamheter i syfte att bland annat fåarbetslivserfarenhet i Sverige och referenser. Syftet med studien är attfördjupa förståelsen för hur några av de som haft PUT- anställning upplevdeden. Deras upplevelser av insatsens/anställningens påverkan på livssituationenavseende ekonomi, sociala nätverk och aktiviteter samt upplevelsen avbemötandet på PUT- arbetsplatserna ställs i centrum. Sålunda fokuseras deintervjuades resonemang kring sin livssituation beträffande övergången frånsocialbidragstagande och långtidsarbetslöshet till visstidsanställning ochegenförsörjning genom insatsen PUT. Studien undersöker också huruvida deintervjuade utökat sitt sociala nätverk till att inkludera fler personer med svenskbakgrund medelst PUT- anställningen. Även de intervjuades upplevelser av PUToch dess betydelse i vägen mot {{integration}} i arbetsmarknaden lyfts fram. Kvalitativaintervjuer genomfördes med 10 personer som haft PUT- tjänst med ambitionen att kunnauppnå syftet med studien. I intervjuerna framkom att informanterna upplevdetidsperioden de hade PUT som positiv med särskild betoning på att derasekonomiska situation förbättrades avsevärt. I syfte att bibehålla eller utökaolika former av kapital, använder informanterna olika strategier och de framförupplevelser av stigmatisering och distinktioner av varierande slag. I analysenav resultatet, förenas Bourdieu (1999), Goffman (1972) och Elias och Scotson (1999). Flera konstateranden görs i diskussionsavsnittet och slutsatsen att behov attgenomföra vissa förändringar av insatsen dras, varför det i uppsatsen ocksålämnas förslag på hur PUT skulle kunna förändras i syfte att få ännu kraftigareoch bättre slagkraft på arbetslösheten bland socialbidragstagande ochlångtidsarbetslösa invandrare. I detta sammanhang refereras också till dentidigare forskning som presenteras i uppsatsen, vilken behandlar problemområdetinvandrare och deras inkludering/exkludering från arbetsmarknaden på grund avderas grupptillhörighet. The {{essay is}} {{an evaluation of}} a local government actionto promote employment / operation called Personlig UtvecklingsTjänst/PUT-tjänst, PUT (Personal Development Employment / PUT- employment) directed to long-term unemployed and welfare dependent immigrants in UddevallaMunicipality. The action / operation means that {{a certain number of}} individualsreceive fixed temporary employment inside the municipality's operations/activitiesin order to, inter alia, get work experience in Sweden and references. Thepurpose {{of this study is to}} deepen the understanding of how some of those whohave had PUT employment experienced it. Their experiences of the localgovernment action / employment and its impacts on living conditions, ineconomic, social networks and activities, and experience of the encounter onthe PUT workplaces is targeted. The focus is on the interviewees discussionsabout their lives about the transition from welfare dependency and long-termunemployment to fixed-term and self-sufficiency through the action PUT. Thestudy also examines whether the respondents expanded their social networks toinclude more people with Swedish background through the PUT employment. Alsothe interviewees' experiences of the PUT and its importance in the road tointegration into the labor market are highlighted. Qualitative interviews wereconducted with 10 people who had PUT <b>employment</b> with the <b>ambition</b> to achievethe aim of the study. The interviews revealed that respondents felt the timeperiod they had PUT- employment to be positive with special emphasis on theireconomic situation improved considerably. In order to maintain or expandvarious forms of capital, the respondents use different strategies and they expressexperiences of stigma and distinctions of various kinds. The analysis ofresults, combined Bourdieu (1999), Goffman (1972) and Elias and Scotson (1999). Several conclusions were made in the discussion section and settled that theneed to implement certain changes in operation is necessary. Therefore, thepaper also contains proposals on how the PUT could be changed in order to geteven stronger and better clout in unemployment among welfare dependency andlong-term unemployed migrants. In this context is also referred to the previousresearch presented in the paper, which deals with the problem area immigrantsand their inclusion / exclusion from the labor market because of their groupaffiliation...|$|R
