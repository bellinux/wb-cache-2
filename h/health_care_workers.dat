5|$|Given these risks, as {{smallpox}} became effectively eradicated and {{the number}} of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s. Routine vaccination of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> was discontinued in the U.S. in 1976, and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive the vaccination). By 1986, routine vaccination had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Beshear {{announced}} six mandatory, unpaid furlough {{days for}} most state employees {{in order to}} achieve the savings called for by the budget. Later in the month, Beshear announced exceptions from the furlough for public safety and mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers.</b> The American Federation of County State and Municipal Employees (AFCSME) Council 62, which represents about 9,000 of Kentucky's state workers, filed suit to block implementation of the furloughs. A Franklin County Circuit Court Judge refused to issue an injunction in September 2010, but allowed the lawsuit to proceed. A month later, AFCSME agreed to drop the suit and address the furlough issue through Beshear's Employee Advisory Council. Ultimately, all six furlough days were observed as outlined in Beshear's plan.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E

25|$|The {{move into}} health care was {{particularly}} risky. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 originally included <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> from {{the protection of}} federal labor law, but the Taft-Hartley Act amendments exempted workers employed by non-profit health care organizations from the law in 1947. Since nearly all health care organizations {{at the time were}} non-profit, this effectively excluded the vast majority of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> from federal labor law. In 1962, Congress passed legislation allowing workers in health care institutions owned by the federal government to engage in collective bargaining. Publicly owned hospitals were covered by the NLRA in 1967, and non-profit nursing homes in 1970. Congress amended the Taft-Hartley Act in 1974 to bring non-profit hospitals back under the NLRA's coverage. BSEIU had organized its first hospital workers in San Francisco in the 1930s. Hardy's push into health care proceeded very slowly. Nationwide, only 2.3 percent of all health care institutions had a union in 1970. Despite a sharp upturn in the number of dismissals of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> for union activity in the 1950s and 1960s, Hardy had organized one of the largest pockets of unionized <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>workers</b> outside New York City by the late 1960s.|$|E
