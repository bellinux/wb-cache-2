I am deeply sorry you should have had the vain hope of seeing Robert and Pen. As for me, I know my place; I am only good for a <b>drag</b> <b>chain.</b> But, dear, don't fancy it has been the fault of my will. In fact, I said almost too much at Rome to Robert, till he fancied I had set my selfwill on tossing myself up as a halfpenny, and coming down on the wrong side. Now, in fact, it was not at all (nearly) for Arabel that I wished to go, only I did really wish and do my best to go. He, on the other hand, before we left Rome, had made up his mind (helped by a stray {{physician}} of mine, whom he met in the street) {{that it would be a}} great risk to carry me north. He (Robert) always a little exaggerates the difficulties of travelling, and there's no denying that I have less strength than is usual to me even at the present time. I touched the line of vexing him, with my resistance to the decision, but he is so convinced that repose is necessary for me, and that the lions in the path will be all asleep by this time next year, that I yielded. Certainly he has a right to command me away from giving him unnecessary anxieties. What does vex me is that the dearest nonno should not see his Peni this year, and that you, dear, should be disappointed, on my account again. That's hard on us all. We came home into a cloud here. I can scarcely command voice or hand to name Cavour.[104] That great soul, which meditated and made Italy, has gone to the Diviner country. If tears or blood could have saved him to us, he should have had mine. I feel yet as if I could scarcely comprehend the greatness of the vacancy. A hundred Garibaldis for such a man. There is a hope that certain solutions had been prepared between him and the Emperor, and that events will slide into their grooves. May God save Italy! Dear M. Milsand had pleased me so by his appreciation, but there are great difficulties. The French press, tell him, has, on the whole, done great service, except that part of it under the influence of the ultramontane and dynastic opposition parties. And as to exaggerated statements, it is hard, even here, to get at the truth (with regard to the state of the south), and many Italian liberals have had hours of anxiety and even of despondency. English friends of ours, very candid and liberal, have gone to Naples full of hope, and returned hoping nothing--yet they are wrong, unless this bitter loss makes them right-- ...|$|E

5000|$|Oppenheim, a {{schoolmaster}} in {{the small}} town, concerned that his older male students often missed school loading and spreading manure, patented a wagon that, behind the <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> and two beaters, incorporated a steel axle with several wooden paddles attached to the shaft {{at an angle to}} throw the manure outward in a broad pattern eliminating the necessity for manual spreading.

5000|$|In the 1890s, Oppenheim was a {{schoolmaster}} in the one-room country schoolhouse in Maria Stein, {{the town}} where John M.

The unloader that Kramer built used a <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> {{at the bottom of}} the wagon to pull the load of manure to the rear where it was shredded by a pair of beaters and deposited directly behind the machine, but with very little spreading to the sides. [...] As a result, farmers still had to take the time-consuming step of heading into the fields with peg-tooth drags or similar implements to spread the manure in order to prevent burning the soil. As a schoolmaster, Oppenheim was concerned that the older boys often missed class at certain times of the year to stay home and work on the farm, usually loading and spreading manure. Not only was the chore backbreaking, but it deprived them of their education which Oppenheim saw as a need for the future.|$|E
50|$|In {{a general}} way, Wittmann, {{a student of}} André Martinet in the fifties, has {{been the first to}} apply the latter's {{principles}} of chain reactions in phonology to inflectional morphology. In Wittmann's view, the basic structure of the sentence is held together by functional items, with the lexical items filling in the blanks. Position in functional space must maintain functional equidistance and disturbances in functional equidistance set off error correcting chain reactions that are cyclical in nature and subject to drift. Thus, functionally salient lexical items will eventually set off a push chain conveyor belt pressure in functional space, sending functionally close-by affixes down the path of attrition. Such is the origin of agglutinating clitics of non-standard oral French from erstwhile lexical pronouns, setting off the attrition of functionally equivalent fusional means of inflection inherited from Old French and Latin: Loss of suffixal inflection on the verb, compensated by the rise of proclitic means indicating person, number and tense. Conversely, functional items going down the path of attrition leave behind functional gaps, triggering a <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> effect on surrounding functionally salient lexical items. Such is the origin of the agglutinating prenominal class markers from erstwhile articles, compensated by the rise of postnominal means of expressing definiteness on the noun. With the fulfilment of each cycle of change, a morphologically consistent phonological representation is realized which serves as input to the next cycle of morphological change. The aforementioned processes of inflectional renewal are not without parallels in recent neurolinguistic research, notably in the works by Gabriele Miceli.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Drag {{conveyors}} are {{the most}} efficient medium of material handling for conveying higher volume {{from one place to}} another. In horizontal condition <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> conveyors can handle material up to 45 - 50 % of cross sectional area of the trough.

Drag conveyor chains are work under the very extreme conditions such as high tensile load, friction and some time hazardous operating environment (e. g. presence of humidity, chemicals). Due to versatile application various failures are occurred in the drag conveyor chain and causes loss of productivity and corrective maintenance in the system.

The main conclusion of Wang (2006) is that, in Qinghai dialect, the monophthongization of [ie] and [ei] to [i] forced the original [i] {{to move towards}} [j] or [ʅ]. This opinion can be schematized as follows: 【Step 1 】 [ie][ei] ＞ [i] 【Step 2 】 [i] ＞ [j][ʅ] It follows from this figure that Wang (2006) regards the apicalization of [i] in Qinghai dialect {{as an example of}} a push chain.

40|$|Issue: Wood waste {{supplies}} {{range from}} sawdust or shavings to large containers or portions of structural framing. Bulky, irregular-shaped forms of wood waste can often present {{problems at the}} frontend of a wood waste processing facility if the available material handling equipment is unable to accommodate this type of wood waste material. Wood waste processors can experience excessive labor requirements, clean-up problems, and general reductions in production efficiency. Best Practice: This best practice recommends that processors use specialized, automated equipment to feed bulky, irregular-shaped wood waste into size reduction equipment. These specialized conveying systems can minimize the potential for hang-ups and blockage. These automated conveyor systems also provide ample in-feed surge capacity (temporary in-process material storage) and can free rolling stock operators from some of their loading duties. Conveyors consisting of a wide or sideless trough can minimize their possible blockage. Possible conveyor types include: <b>Drag</b> <b>Chain</b> Conveyor: a wide trough carrying a chain that is periodically fitted with ‘flights ’ which will pull the wood waste along the conveyor. Multiple Chain Conveyor: a very wide trough or sideless deck carrying a series of chains running in tracks spaced at regular intervals.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} optimisation of {{a conveyor}} from an underground hopper intended for a coal transfer station.

The Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) was chosen to optimise the transport. DEM simulations allow device design modifications directly in the 3 D CAD model, and then the simulation {{makes it possible to}} evaluate whether the adjustment was successful. By simulating the initial state of coal extraction using a chain conveyor, trouble spots were identified that caused operational failures. The main problem has been the increased resistance during removal of material from the underground hopper. Revealed resistances against material movement were not considered in the original design at all. In the next step, structural modifications of problematic nodes were made. For example, the following changes have been made: reduction of storage space or installation of passive elements into the interior of the underground hopper. These modifications made were not effective enough, so the type of the conveyor was changed from a <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> conveyor to a belt conveyor. The simulation of the material extraction using a belt conveyor showed a significant reduction in resistance parameters while maintaining the required transport performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{multiplicity}} of harsh environments in mining, processing and transporting ore and related waste, cause severe wear, extremely high maintenance costs and lost production. Elevated temperature processing {{is one of}} the conditions that influence the performance of possible materials of construction. This takes the forms of reduced hardness and strength, deleterious changes in the structure and properties of materials during protracted exposure and increased oxidation and corrosion. <b>Drag</b> <b>chain</b> conveying of hot solids e. g. in smelting, typically results in three-body sliding abrasion and adhesive wear of connecting pins and hole surfaces in link assemblies and of moving paddles that impel the particulates in enclosed channels. Selected materials have been assessed for this type of service under reciprocating sliding abrasion contact conditions using an adapted Cameron-Plint TE 77 wear rig at 20 0 C and 350 0 C. These include the current carburised low alloy steel, other steels, Cr white irons and Co-based alloys in bulk, overlay and surface treated forms. Examination of wear scars, using scanning electron microscopy, identified the main wear mechanisms affecting the highly resistant powder metallurgical (PM) tool steels and HVOF coating as micro-scratching and as indentation leading to micro-fracture. Materials with lowest resistance displayed evidence of significant material removal by micro-ploughing. The formation of oxide layers on some samples during testing appeared to be beneficial.

40|$|In present-day English, Dutch, {{and most}} of their Germanic siblings, the verbal weak {{inflection}} offers a well-established and regular strategy for forming the past tense. In contrast, the strong inflection seems to present {{no more than a}} diminishing rubble of vowel sub-rules and irregularities (Harbert 2007 : 277). Still, things were once different. As an innovation specific to Proto-Germanic, the fledging weak dental suffix had to compete with a sturdy strong ablaut-system inherited from Proto-Indo-European, which is assumed to have been both clearly regular and dominant in frequency (Bailey 1997 : 8). Earlier computational models of this competition have either focused exclusively on language acquisition (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986; Pinker and Prince 1988; Marcus et al. 1995; Taatgen and Anderson 2002), on the role of acquisition in language change when the weak inflection was already well-established (Hare and Elman 1995; Yang 2002), or have explicitly disregarded the regularity of the strong system (Colaiori et al. 2015; Pijpops and Beuls subm.). However, these models don’t address how a nascent weak inflection could have possibly gained enough momentum to overthrow a both regular and dominant strong system. To explain this enigma, several proposals have been put forward in the historical literature (Ball 1968 : 164; Bailey 1997 : 17). The first states that the dental suffix is in principle applicable to all verbs, while each separate strong vowel alternation is not. That is, the strong system presents a broken formation of several vowel alternations against a single dental suffix. The second holds that even as a whole, the strong system was not applicable to some particular verbs, which would then create a safe nest for the weak inflection to mature. The last posits that the regularity of the strong system was being undermined by sound changes, allowing the weak inflection {{to take advantage of the}} created irregularities. To investigate whether these causes can indeed be responsible for the ascent of the weak inflection, an agent-based model was created in which the focus lies on language use rather than acquisition (cf. Croft 2000; Bybee 2010). The model has been integrated into the Babel 2 -framework (Loetzsch et al. 2008), and the competing constructions have been implemented in the Fluid Construction Grammar formalism (Steels 2011; van Trijp et al. 2012). The model’s behavior showed that, in the long run, the first explanation alone already suffices to explain the rise of the weak inflection, even if each separate vowel alternation starts out more frequent than the weak inflection. This finding of course does not say that the second and third proposals did not help in creating more optimal conditions for the weak inflection to start its ascent. It does mean, however, that the disintegration of the strong system might be the result and subsequent catalyst rather than the original cause of the rise of the weak inflection. That is, perhaps both are related through a push chain, rather than a <b>drag</b> <b>chain.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
