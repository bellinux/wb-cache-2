40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present an {{original}} semi-supervised method for the segmentation of in situ tree color images which combines color quantization, adaptive fragmentation of learning areas {{defined by the}} human operator and labeling propagation. A mathematical morphology post-processing is introduced to emphasize the narrow and thin structures which characterize branches. Applied in the L*a*b* color system, this method is well adapted to easily adjust the learning set so that the resultant labeling corresponds to the accuracy achieved by the human operator. The method has been embarked and evaluated on a tablet to <b>help</b> <b>tree</b> professionals in their expertise or diagnosis. The images, acquired and processed with a mobile device, present more or less complex background {{both in terms of}} content and lightness, more or less dense foliage and more or less thick branches.

40|$|Sixteen {{percent of}} tree stems 10 cm {{diameter}} or greater recorded in seven 1 ha plots in Rabongo Forest, Uganda had stem damage attributable to elephants (Loxodonta africana). We propose four strategies that may <b>help</b> <b>tree</b> species persist under these conditions: repellence, resistance, tolerance and avoidance. We sought and found evidence for each strategy. Large, shade-tolerant Cynometra alexandri dominated basal area (often > 50 %) and showed severe scarring. Nearly 80 percent of stems were small pioneer species. Scarring frequency and intensity increased with stem size. Stem-size distributions declined steeply, implying a high mortality to growth rate ratio. Tree species with spiny stems or with known toxic bark defenses were unscarred. Epiphytic figs escaped damage while at small sizes. Mid-successional tree species were scarce and appeared sensitive to elephants. Savanna species were seldom scarred. Taking stem size effects into account {{by using a}} per-stem logistic modeling approach, scarring became more probable with slower growth and with increasing species abundance, and also varied with location. Pioneer and shade-bearer guilds showed a deficit of intermediate-sized stems. Evidence that selective elephant damage is responsible for monodominant C. alexandri forests remains equivocal; however, elephants do influence tree diversity, forest structure, and the wider landscape...|$|E
40|$|The Geant 4 {{software}} toolkit simulates {{the passage}} of particles through matter. Visualization is {{a key part of}} it. Geant 4 is used in many application domains including high energy, nuclear and accelerator physics, and in medical and space science. We have developed several visualization drivers, such as OpenInventor, HepRep, DAWN, VRML, RayTracer, ASCIITree, gMocren and OpenGL to fit the various requirements of each domain. During the last 3 years, the OpenGL suite of visualization drivers has been significantly improved by adding a lot of functionalities, in particular a new OpenGL Qt driver. Qt is a free and well-known toolkit available on all platforms, including Windows, that has enabled us to offer Geant 4 visualization that has the same look and feel on all systems. Geant 4 release 9. 5 integrates the latest improvements in the OpenGL and Qt viewer, including faster first time rendering, integration of multiple visualization frames and the user interface into same window, making posters (thanks to gl 2 ps), a new Qt viewer components <b>help</b> <b>tree</b> and volume tree, easy creation of videos, "free hand" rotation mode, etc. Thanks to the cmake build system, compiling Geant 4 with the Qt viewer is simple.

40|$|PosterTree shelters <b>help</b> <b>tree</b> {{establishment}} {{by offering}} advantages such as protection against browsing by animals and better {{growth and survival}} of trees. They have widely been used in agroforestry, forestry, landscaping and gardening since their first development more than 30 y ago. The material used for manufacturing is very stable an offers stability against the weathering conditions in forests or the open land. However, after their functions have been completed, tree shelters often do not degrade fast enough. Additional costs are needed to take them off and also to dispose them according to the legal specifications. Some manufacturers thus started to develop tree shelters, that degrade on site not leaving any dangerous residues (so-called third generation of tree shelters). Accelerated laboratory ageing testing to determine the degradation profile is not felt to be reliable. Therefore, real field testing of the whole product life cycle of the treeshelters is necessary. Our investigation shows first results of degradable tree shelters after < 3 y on site in open field conditions. The manufacturer has set up various experimental plots in the Black Forest (South-western Germany) in a reforestation site with oaks. 5000 plants have been protected with 50 different types of degradable tree shelters. The product finally developed offers precise time-dependent degradation while meeting with standard criteria for tree shelters like protection, transparency, stability and sufficient ventilation...|$|E
40|$|Rising water {{temperature}} (Tw) due to {{anthropogenic climate change}} may have serious consequences for river ecosystems. Conservation and/or expansion of riparian shade could counter warming and buy time for ecosystems to adapt. However, sensitivity of river reaches to direct solar radiation is highly heterogeneous in space and time, so benefits of shading are also expected to be site specific. We use a network of high-resolution temperature measurements from two upland rivers in the UK, in conjunction with topographic shade modelling, to assess the relative significance of landscape and riparian shade to the thermal behaviour of river reaches. Trees occupy 7 % of the study catchments (comparable with the UK national average) yet shade covers 52 % of the area and is concentrated along river corridors. Riparian shade is most beneficial for managing Tw at distances 5 to 20 km downstream from {{the source of the}} rivers where discharge is modest, flow is dominated by near-surface hydrological pathways, there is a wide floodplain with little landscape shade, and where cumulative solar exposure times are sufficient to affect Tw. For the rivers studied, we find that approximately 0. 5 km of complete shade is necessary to off-set Tw by 1 °C during July (the month with peak Tw) at a headwater site; whereas 1. 1 km of shade is required 25 km downstream. Further research is needed to assess the integrated effect of future changes in air temperature, sunshine duration, direct solar radiation and downward diffuse radiation on Tw to <b>help</b> <b>tree</b> planting schemes achieve intended outcomes...|$|E

5000|$|The {{chestnut}} blight is a fungal infection affecting the American Chestnut tree {{that had a}} devastating economic and social impact on communities in the eastern United States. It later spread {{to other parts of}} the world including Italy. [...] The fungus is spread by wind-borne ascospores and, over a shorter distance, conidia distributed by rain-splash action. In the first half of the 20th Century it killed an estimated 4 billion trees. Infection is local in range, so some isolated American chestnuts survive where there is no other tree within 10 km. There are at least two viral pathogens that weaken the fungus through a mechanism termed hypovirulence that <b>helps</b> <b>trees</b> survive.|$|R

40|$|New Zealand grown Pinus radiata {{is limited}} in its {{application}} for structural purposes by its stiffness deficiencies. This dissertation aims to estimate potential improvements in stem value through selection for improved stiffness. A new method to model and value volumes of structural wood grades within a stem was used to calculate these value improvements. Data for each stem from a stand in Kaingaroa Forest bred for improved wood quality was used to perform this analysis. This data was from a stand bred for improved wood quality and included information on the stiffness, density and width of each growth ring for each stem. The data was {{in the form of}} cores. Height and volume data was not recorded and therefore needed to be modelled. The volumes of MSG 8, MSG 11 and MSG 13 wood were estimated by modelling the stem volume at the age when wood is produced that is stiff enough to qualify for each grade. The majority of stems had merchantable volumes between 1 - 2. 5 m 3 with the largest stems containing 3. 6 m 3. Average stiffness ranged between 5. 2 GPa and 11. 3 GPa with the stand average being 8. 4 GPa. There was no relationship between average stiffness and merchantable volume. Stem values were found to range between $ 60 -$ 131 /m 3 with the stand average being $ 91 /m 3. The 10 most valuable stems had a total stem value ($ 318) twice that of the stand average ($ 157). The most valuable stem ($ 411) showed a 160 % increase in stem value from the average. The increases in value/m 3 were caused by large increases in the proportion of MSG 11 and MSG 13 wood held within the merchantable volume. These potential gains in stem value could <b>help</b> <b>tree</b> breeders assign an accurate economic weighting to stiffness improvements. Forest managers wanting to justify using a more expensive, improved stiffness seedlot may also find these results valuable...|$|E
