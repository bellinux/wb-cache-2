5|$|The tactics {{were also}} {{unsuitable}} for fighter-versus-fighter combat. Packed in tight formation, the RAF pilots {{were more concerned}} with keeping their position and not colliding with each other than they were keeping watch for the enemy. It made them vulnerable to surprise attacks by Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Even if the British fighters reached the bombers without interception, the chaos of modern aerial combat {{made it impossible to}} concentrate attacks with large, rigid formations. Pilots were also forced into paying <b>far</b> <b>too</b> much respect to the bomber's defensive capabilities. Attacks were broken off <b>far</b> <b>too</b> early and caused little damage to bombers. These tactical failures were evident during the battles in Belgium and France. Moreover, rushed training with pilots who were barely able to use the old tactical methods meant that airmen could not cope with much needed radical changes.|$|E

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'.

Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E

5|$|Other {{possibilities}} {{to synthesize}} nuclei {{on the island}} of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently {{it has been shown that}} the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability, although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), mimicking the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away <b>far</b> <b>too</b> quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in <b>far</b> <b>too</b> small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} after her sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes have been put forward to raise Titanic from her resting place. They have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it inside a giant iceberg that would float back to the surface. However, the wreck is <b>far</b> <b>too</b> fragile to be raised and is now protected by a UNESCO convention.|$|E

California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: How <b>far</b> is <b>too</b> <b>far?</b> Recent {{government}} policy and demographic growth {{have led to}} role changes within the professions in emergency care. Healthcare professionals have extended and expanded their scopes of practice to include duties outside their traditional role boundary. Nurses in particular are able to see and treat patients more independently. These expanded roles mean there is growing overlap between professional roles and responsibilities and one wonders—how <b>far</b> is <b>too</b> <b>far?</b> Where should role expansion cease? The aim {{of this research was}} to explore the perceptions of the professions on their current and future roles in emergency care. Methods: A qualitative design, utilising semistructured interviews was employed. Eight respondents, including doctors and nurses of all grades, were purposefully sampled from an emergency department within a large UK teaching hospital. Results: Content analysis revealed five key themes: role boundaries; driving forces; managing risk; training and future professional roles. Conclusions: Of genuine concern to the respondents was the lack of standardisation within the expansion of healthcare roles. In terms of "how <b>far</b> is <b>too</b> far", the respondents believed that greater clarification of training and scope of practice is required, enabling clinical roles to develop more consistently. <br/...|$|R

The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had <b>far</b> <b>too</b> little to sustain themselves. Three quarters of the labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E
