5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are classified}} mainly as baroclinic, because they form along zones of temperature and <b>dewpoint</b> gradient known as frontal zones. They can become barotropic late {{in their life}} cycle, when the distribution of heat around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with its radius.|$|E
5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and <b>dewpoint</b> gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E
5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small <b>dewpoint</b> depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E

25|$|On March 21, 1952, a {{significant}} surface low progressed across Oklahoma and Arkansas. Southerly winds transported <b>dewpoints</b> {{in excess of}} 64°F across portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Strong upper level wind speeds moved eastward and intersected the warm, moist air mass.|$|R
40|$|VAS {{satellite}} retrievals and derived parameters used in forecasting severe local storms {{were evaluated}} against corresponding radiosonde values. VAS products were also {{compared with the}} first-guess input to the retrieval algorithm. The evaluation methodology was to pair each radiosonde observation with the closest VAS retrieval within 50 km during a four-month period in 1986. VAS temperatures agreed closely with radiosonde values; <b>dewpoints</b> showed less agreement. Sounding differences were poorly correlated {{with the number of}} pixels from which the retrievals were prepared. VAS discrepancies usually were not well correlated with first-guess errors. Horizontal gradients of VAS products were stronger than those from radiosondes. VAS precipitable water agreed better with ground truth than did <b>dewpoints</b> at individual levels, but VAS thicknesses were not much improved. Results for severe storms forecasting parameters indicated that discrepancies increased with the amount of manipulation required during computation. The lifted index showed the best agreement; positive bouyant energy showed poor comparisons...|$|R
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and <b>dewpoint,</b> see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation fog (or frontal fog) {{forms as}} {{precipitation}} falls into drier air below the cloud, the liquid droplets evaporate into water vapor. The water vapor cools {{and at the}} <b>dewpoint</b> it condenses and fog forms.|$|E
25|$|Port Aransas {{experiences}} a humid subtropical climate, enjoying similar temperatures {{to those of}} other Gulf Coast regions, such as Deep South Texas and Southern Florida. The area {{experiences a}}n average annual rainfall of , with prevailing winds out of the southeast from the Gulf of Mexico. Average high temperatures in the summer months exceed 90°F (32°C) with <b>dewpoint</b> temperatures in the middle to upper 70s, while average nighttime winter lows in January, the coldest month, are slightly less than 50°F (10°C).|$|E
25|$|An unseasonably {{warm air}} mass was entrenched {{over much of}} central and eastern North America with record highs for much of the region. Several record high {{temperatures}} were broken across several states and Canadian provinces from January 7 to January 9 as temperatures rose into the 70s (21–25°C) as far north as the Ohio Valley with <b>dewpoints</b> in the high 50s and low 60s (14–17°C) providing additional fuel for storm development.|$|R
50|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Dampier has {{a desert}} climate (BWh). The annual average {{rainfall}} is 272.2 mm, {{which would make}} it a semi-arid climate, except, like Alice Springs, its high evapotranspiration (or its aridity) makes it a desert climate. Dampier has extremely hot and humid summers with <b>dewpoints</b> exceeding 24 C. Having over 3,700 hours of annual sunshine, {{it is one of the}} sunniest places in Australia.|$|R
50|$|A hot, {{extremely}} humid {{and highly}} unstable air mass, with <b>dewpoints</b> exceeding 80 °F (27 °C) in many areas, {{combined with a}} cold front across portions of the Upper Midwest. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for the region, as tornadoes began to develop in Minnesota {{on the afternoon of}} July 14. Several tornadoes were reported across the region, along with widespread moderate wind damage. The strongest tornado was rated EF2.|$|R
25|$|Arizona has {{an average}} annual {{rainfall}} of , which comes during two rainy seasons, with cold fronts coming from the Pacific Ocean during the winter and a monsoon in the summer. The monsoon season occurs {{toward the end of}} summer. In July or August, the <b>dewpoint</b> rises dramatically for a brief period. During this time, the air contains large amounts of water vapor. Dewpoints as high as 81°F (27°C) have been recorded during the Phoenix monsoon season. This hot moisture brings lightning, thunderstorms, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. These downpours often cause flash floods, which can turn deadly. In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams, the Arizona Legislature enacted the Stupid Motorist Law. It is rare for tornadoes or hurricanes to occur in Arizona.|$|E
500|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and <b>dewpoint</b> gradient, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform along the radius {{from the center of}} low pressure. [...] An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection, which warms its core and causes temperature and <b>dewpoint</b> gradients near their centers to fade.|$|E
500|$|When {{analyzing}} {{a weather}} map, a station model is plotted at each point of observation. Within the station model, the temperature, <b>dewpoint,</b> wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather are plotted. The {{circle in the}} middle represents cloud cover; fraction it is filled in represents the degree of overcast. Outside the United States, temperature and <b>dewpoint</b> are plotted in degrees Celsius. The wind barb points in the direction from which the wind is coming. Each full flag on the wind barb represents [...] of wind, each half flag represents [...] When winds reach , a filled in triangle is used for each [...] of wind. In the United States, rainfall plotted {{in the corner of}} the station model are in [...] inches. The international standard rainfall measurement unit is the millimeter. Once a map has a field of station models plotted, the analyzing isobars (lines of equal pressure), isallobars (lines of equal pressure change), isotherms (lines of equal temperature), and isotachs (lines of equal wind speed) are drawn. The abstract weather symbols were devised to take up the least room possible on weather maps.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} time, daily high {{temperatures}} {{are in the}} 95 °F (35 °C) range throughout much of July and August. The air tends to feel still and the abundant humidity, with <b>dewpoints</b> typically in the low to mid 70s, creates a heat index around 100 each day. Summer thunderstorms are common with 1/3 to 1/2 of the days hearing thunder. The highest temperature recorded in the area was 109 °F in September 2000.|$|R
50|$|An unseasonably {{warm air}} mass was entrenched {{over much of}} central and eastern North America with record highs for much of the region. Several record high {{temperatures}} were broken across several states and Canadian provinces from January 7 to January 9 as temperatures rose into the 70s (21-25 °C) as far north as the Ohio Valley with <b>dewpoints</b> in the high 50s and low 60s (14-17 °C) providing additional fuel for storm development.|$|R
50|$|A {{warm front}} was moving into {{southern}} Ontario and bringing {{with it a}} moist, unstable airmass. Thunderstorms were also reported across much of district during {{the early morning hours}} as well. The cold front however, was still back over Lake Michigan and tracking steadily towards the east. During the afternoon, the weather generally cleared up in the outbreak area and temperatures reached the upper 20's Celsius (low 80s F) with <b>dewpoints</b> in the low 20's Celsius (low 70s F).|$|R
500|$|Station model plots use {{an internationally}} {{accepted}} coding convention {{that has changed}} little since August 1, 1941. Elements in the plot show the key weather elements, including temperature, <b>dewpoint,</b> wind, cloud cover, air pressure, pressure tendency, and precipitation. Winds have a standard notation when plotted on weather maps. More than a century ago, winds were plotted as arrows, with feathers on just one side depicting five knots of wind, while feathers on both sides depicted [...] of wind. The notation changed to that of half of an arrow, with half of a wind barb indicating five knots, a full barb ten knots, and a pennant flag fifty knots.|$|E
500|$|During the summer, the {{subtropical}} ridge in the Atlantic Ocean strengthens, bringing in increasingly humid {{air from the}} warm Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. [...] Once precipitable water values exceed , afternoon and evening thunderstorms break out at the western periphery of the {{subtropical ridge}} across the Southeast on a daily basis. [...] Summer {{is the time of}} the second rainfall maximum during the year across Georgia, and the time of the main rainfall maximum in Florida. [...] Evidence shows that increased air pollution is causing rainfall to reach a maximum in intensity {{during the middle of the}} week. [...] During the late summer and fall, tropical cyclones move into the region from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, supplying portions of the area with one-quarter of their annual rainfall, on average. [...] Fall is the time of the rainfall minimum across Louisiana. [...] Sometimes, Gulf moisture sneaks up the Front Range of Rockies as far north as the northern High Plains, bringing higher <b>dewpoint</b> air into states such as Wyoming and Montana.|$|E
500|$|<b>Dewpoint</b> values had {{ranged from}} the upper 60s°F (20°C) to the lower 70s°F (20–22°C), with {{temperatures}} in the low to mid-80s°F (27–30°C), and CAPE (a meteorological concept used to predict the force and power of potential storms and tornadoes) predicting referring to values ranging from 3500 to 5000 J/kg. Deep layer wind shear speeds of [...] would enhance storm organization and intensity. These factors, along with CAPE values in excess of 4000J/kg and an embedded speed maxima rotating around the southern periphery of the low, made the threat of significant severe thunderstorms increasingly likely. These ingredients were present ahead of a cold front extending from the low from the eastern Dakotas southwestward to western Oklahoma, and ahead of a dry line extending from western Oklahoma southward into western north and west-central Texas. The most intense severe weather activity was expected across the southern Great Plains, specifically central and eastern Oklahoma, during the afternoon hours. As such, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms during {{the early morning hours}} of May31 from southeastern Missouri to southwestern Oklahoma. The degree of wind shear, moisture and instability within the warm sector favored the development of discrete supercells. Very large hail and tornadoes were expected with the supercells, with the possibility of a few strong to violent tornadoes.|$|E
