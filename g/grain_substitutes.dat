50|$|The {{issue of}} a lack of grain was {{overcome}} in different ways {{in different parts of the}} country. In some areas, grain was made to go further using Dulse (Palmaria palmata; söl), Iceland Moss (Cetraria islandica; IS: fjallagrös) or Irish Moss (Chondrus crispus; fjörugrös) in compotes and breads, or by flattening the dough so thin that the bread became almost transparent. In the SE region (Skaftafellssýslur), locals knew how to use the lyme grass (Leymus arenarius) (melkorn; sometimes called the Icelandic grain) for centuries, where it was used in compotes, bread, pancakes, etc. These <b>grain</b> <b>substitutes</b> gave the bread a distinctive character. Dulse breads and biscuits can be made by mixing Dulse, rye, and Icelandic Moss in equal proportions.|$|E

40|$|Advantages {{of steam}} flaking grain are less {{with respect to}} growth {{performance}} and diet digestion when a portion of distillers <b>grains</b> is <b>substituted</b> for <b>grain.</b> Ruminal pH typically is lower in cattle fed flaked-grain diets than in cattle fed rolled-grain diets. Ruminal pH for cattle fed finishing diets based on steam-flaked corn is observed below pH 6. 0. Previous research observed a 5 % decrease in digestion of organic matter when 13 % distillers grains (dry-matter basis) was added to steam-flaked corn finishing diets. A decline in ruminal pH below 6. 2 reduces activity of ruminal fiber-digesting organisms. Furthermore, ruminal protein digestion declines with pH below 5. 5. It is plausible that low ruminal pH may restrict digestion of distillers grains in flaked-grain diets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{has been carried out}} to investigate he possible formation of magnetite, Fe 304, under ambient soil-forming conditions. Rapid and easy synthesis of magnetite was achieved through controlled oxidation of Fe 2 + solutions at room temperatures and near neutral pH values. The synthetic products were found to range in size between 0 - 01 - 0. 07 #m (mean diameter) and hence span the theoretical superparamagnetic-single-domain grain-size boundary. Until very recently the possibility of neoformation of magnetite, Fe 304, under ambient soil-forming conditions has been discounted. Magnetites found in soils have generally been attributed to lithogenic sources; as such, their environments of formation relate to extreme, non-contemporaneous conditions of high temperature and pressure, i. e. conditions associated with sub-crustal or magmatic environments. Such primary, igneous magnetites are usually large (1 - 50 /~m), multidomain (MD) <b>grains,</b> often <b>substituted</b> by Ti, V, Cr (Sanmagudas, 1971) and other elements, and generally exhibit a distinctive octahedral morphology (e. g.

40|$|Changes in {{the numbers}} and types of lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing {{bacteria}} in the rumen of sheep were followed during stepwise adaptation from a low- to a high-concentrate diet. The mean numbers of bacteria increased after each change in diet when increasing amounts of maize <b>grain</b> were <b>substituted</b> for maize stover. A surge in number of amylolytic bacteria always preceded an increase in lactate-utilizing bacteria, and with the final diet containing 71 % grain and molasses the two groups tended to balance each other, which resulted in low lactic acid accumulation. The lactate utilizers thus {{played a key role}} in controlling the fermentation. Orderly shifts occurred among the predominating amylolytic and lactate-utilizing bacteria in response to the gradual decrease in ruminal pH as the amount of maize meal in the diet increased. Among the lactate utilizers, the succession began with acid-sensitive Veillonella and Selenomonas, which were superseded by more acid-tolerant Anaerovibrio and Propionibacterium. Among the amylolytic bacteria, Bacteroides was superseded by more acid-tolerant Lactobacillus and Eubacterium.

Feeding diets with a more narrow calorie to protein ratio significantly reduced incidence in one experiment, and feeding an unpelleted diet from 3 to 7 weeks of age also significantly reduced the incidence below that of birds fed the same diet in pelleted form. Incidence of OBS was significantly less for birds housed in a separate building with lower temperature condi-tions than those maintained {{in a house with}} a higher environmental temperature.

India 2 ̆ 019 s current implementation of the world largest food aid program, the National Food Security Act (NFSA), experiences many challenges and needs rigorous analysis. Current study analyzes consumption patterns of wheat and rice delivered through the Public Distribution System in India. Further, impact of the subsidy on market grain consumption is quantified. The household consumption analysis using cross-sectional econometric techniques reveals targeting errors of the Public Distribution System. There is a negative self-selection of the richer households; however the migrant workers and female-led households are not well covered. The Above Poverty Line quota seems to have higher leakage rate, which strongly affects consumption of the subsidized grains.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the major {{premise of the}} arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) program in Kenya which states that increased crop production in the semi-arid areas {{will lead to a}} reduction in livestock numbers since dependence on livestock for subsistence needs will be reduced. Theoretical support for this position derives from a "school of thought" in pastoral studies which posits that indigenous livestock production systems in Eastern Africa are maintained mainly for the purpose of supplying a steady source of food (i. e., pastoral products) for the pastoral population. Evidence from Njemps Location, Baringo District suggests that while increased crop production has <b>substituted</b> <b>grain</b> for pastoral products in the diet, it has not undermined the role of livestock as a form of investment. It is further argued that a focus on "statistical" averages in livestock holdings, rather than the range and variation in property ownership, informs development planners little about which group or groups of livestock owners will respond to increased opportunities for agriculture. Capital and labour requirements for irrigated agriculture in Njemps are such that the wealthier livestock owners are the individuals which are most capable of taking advantage of crop production opportunities. The dilemma in Njemps Location arises {{due to the fact that}} groups of livestock owners are responding to irrigated agriculture for different reasons: the rich pastoralists are investing in agriculture as a mechanism for supporting their livestock holdings, while the poorer families are being forced into agriculture out of necessity to meet subsistence needs and these latter households have only a minimal impact on the livestock sector. Because of this second group of households it is argued that crop production, especially low cost methods of dry land farming, should be encouraged in Njemps Location, but should not be perceived as a mechanism for supporting range management programs...|$|R

The second trial evaluated the use of barley and field peas in feed lot rations for lambs, and the final trial evaluated narbon beans and vetch as <b>substitute</b> <b>grains</b> for field peas in feed lot rations for lambs. In the first experiment one hundred and twenty six Poll Dorset x (Border Leicester x Merino) mixed sex lambs with a mean liveweight of 40. 0 kg � 0. 3 kg were grazed on faba bean (FB) or chick pea (CP) stubble at a stocking rate of 6. 5 /ha and received a supplement of 300 g/hd/day of barley (+B) or were unsupplemented (-B). There was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in average daily gain (ADG) over the duration of the trial between lambs grazing faba bean and chick pea stubble, supplemented with barley or unsupplemented. Lambs supplemented with barley tended (P- 4. 06) to have a lower ADG in the first fortnightly period, and had significantly lower (P 0. 05) in ADG between lambs fed the treatment rations. Lambs fed B+FP were significantly different to lambs fed barley in the following: higher carcass weight (P 0. 05) in any of the measured characteristics between lambs fed restricted or lambs fed ad libitum. In the third experiment twenty four Poll Dorset x (Border Leicester x Merino) lambs with a mean liveweight of 28. 8 kg � 0. 45 kg were individually penned and fed ad libitum a ration of narbon beans (NB), vetch (V) or field peas (FP) mixed with wheat and formulated to 16 % crude protein. Milled hay was provided separately ad libitum. There was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in growth rate, carcass weight, dressing percentage, feed intake, or dry matter intake to liveweight gain ratio between lambs fed the three rations. The growth rate and feed intake of lambs fed FP was more consistent than lambs fed NB or V. Scouring was observed in lambs fed V. There was highly significant (P< 0. 001) separation and selection of wheat in the NB and FP based rations. Further research needs to be carried out to evaluate meat quality of lambs fed narbon beans and vetch, in particular to determine if there is any effect on flavour of the meat. The use of pulse stubbles, combined with lot feeding can form a feeding system to enable lambs to be finished in the autumn-winter period in the Wimmera region. The growth rate of lambs grazing pulse stubbles is dependent on the quantity of grain residue on the ground. The growth rate can be maintained as grain level declines by the introduction of a barley supplement. Lot feeding can be used to finish lambs when pulse stubbles have been grazed out. A combination of a cereal grain and a pulse grain formulated to 16 % crude protein can be fed ad libitum. Hay can be provided separately ad libitum, or a more controlled intake of hay can be achieved by feeding a calculated amount daily.

40|$|Since {{the coup}} d 2 ̆ 7 etat which {{brought about the}} {{overthrow}} of the monarchy, Egypt has undergone substantial political and economic transformations. From a mainly agricultural, free market trading with the Western World it turned into a more industrialized managed economy that traded mainly under bilateral agreements with the Eastern Block and was actively engaged in the armed conflicts between the Arab states and the state of Israel. ^ During this period Egypt was unable to solve its fundamental problem of imbalance between its demographic and economic growth. ^ This dissertation studies a few aspects of this basic problem, investigating the stagnation of agriculture, the slow development of industry and the possible economic implications of involvement in the Middle Eastern military confrontation. ^ The study of agriculture focuses on the issue of allocation of land and among crops, particularly between import <b>substituting</b> <b>grains</b> (wheat, maize) and exportable crops (cotton, rice). By using a multiproduct production function approach, a system of single crops production functions is derived. The dynamic form of these functions gives rise to the phenomenon of crop rotation. An empirical formulation of this model is tested, and long run price elasticities of agricultural supplies are computed. ^ The study of the industrial sector focuses on its growth under a critical shortage of foreign exchange and institutional constraints. A growth model is developed in which the production unit follows some managerial rules rather than the classical rules of cost minimization or profits maximization. Under this framework the labor demand is derived from utilization of capital, which is determined by the ratio of intermediate inputs to capital stock. As both intermediate inputs and investments are heavy users of foreign exchange, the effective shortage of the latter and the way it is allocated strongly affects the industrial growth. ^ This model is estimated and used to evaluate the shadow price of foreign exchange and its allocation policies. ^ These two sectors are combined together with other aspects of the economy into a full scale macro-econometric model. This model reflects the dual rural-urban nature of the economy and features several facets of its institutional framework: the industrial labor demand; the full employment policy, where the government is an employer of 2 ̆ 2 last resort 2 ̆ 2; the rules of foreign exchange allocation; and the pricing mechanism. ^ Econometric modeling for countries like Egypt is a controversial issue. The opposition is based on data problems and the implications of the changing institutional setting. Efforts were made to reduce these problems by trying to improve the data base and to choose appropriate assumptions. These efforts, however, could not free the model completely from these problems. ^ The full scale model is used to assess some aspects of the defense burden. Because of severe data problems with regard to defense expenditures, we avoided an explicit decomposition of the model into a civilian economy and defense sector. Instead, alternative scenarios are defined in political terms and translated into sets of assumptions regarding the components of the model which are relevant to this problem. The effects of reduced domestic military spendings and redirection of funds to investment, and the release of military manpower and partial recovery of foreign exchange used by the military are traced by simulating the model. The analysis includes retrospective simulations and forecasts. The results are shown in terms of deviations from base solution and include calculations measuring to some possible benefits from peace. ...|$|R
