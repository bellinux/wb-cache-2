40|$|Genetic {{structure}} of <b>Hessian</b> <b>flies</b> in Tunisia. The genetic {{structure of}} M. destructor and M. hordei was investigated by sampling 21 fields of cereals in 14 localities {{of central and}} southern Tunisia. As previously shown, there was no strict association between the cereal species (wheat, barley and oat) and the Mayetiola species. M. destructor males displayed no heterozygosity at the Pgm 3 locus, indicating that they were hemizygous as is the PGM locus in North America. In M. hordei, heterozygous males were observed at all loci, but strong heterozygote deficits were found at two loci (Mdh 2 et Hk). Since no such deficit was observed in females, the population structure of M. hordei was studied only in females. Although heterozygosity was two fold higher in M. hordei than in M. destructor, the two species were similar for other genetic characteristics, including a low (Fst < 0. 05) but significant (P < 0. 05) genetic differentiation, no isolation by distance, and similar rates of gene flow (5. 7 ≤ Nm ≤ 9. 6).

50|$|The <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> or barley midge, Mayetiola destructor, is {{a species}} of fly that is a {{significant}} pest of cereal crops including wheat, barley and rye. Though a native of Asia it was transported into Europe and later into North America, supposedly in the straw bedding of Hessian troops during the American Revolution (1775-83). There are usually two generations a year but may be up to five. In the spring the dark-coloured female lays about 250 to 300 reddish eggs on plants, usually where the stems are covered by leaves; the larvae feed on the sap and weaken the plants so that they cannot bear grain.The <b>hessian</b> <b>fly</b> was described by Thomas Say in 1817. It is a very harmful insect. It mainly attacks the stem, although if it is really hungry it will eat {{any part of the}} plant it can find.In 1836 a severe infestation of Hessian flies resulted in a crop shortage aggravating the financial problems of farmers prior to the Panic of 1837.|$|E

However, tillering of both cultivars was less at 4 or more puparia per stem, perhaps due to the depletion of plant nutrients. In general, for both cultivars there was a decrease in leaf length, number and wet weight as the number of puparia increased per tiller...|$|R

40|$|Symbionts, both {{pathogenic}} and beneficial, must integrate their physiology {{with that}} of their host {{in order to achieve}} a successful colonization. Effector proteins that enter the cytoplasm of host cells are widely utilized for this purpose by bacterial, fungal, oomycete, protistan, nematode, and insect symbionts. The soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae, one of the best characterized oomycete pathogens, encodes in its genome nearly 400 potential effector proteins with the cell-entry motif RXLR. We have recently identified the mechanism by which effector proteins from pathogens and mutualists from two different kingdoms of life, Fungi and Oomycetes, enter the cells of their plant hosts. The mechanism involves the previously undetected presence of the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol- 3 -phosphate (PI- 3 -P) on the outer surface of the plasma membrane of plant cells. The virulence proteins utilize PI- 3 -P as a receptor to gain entry via lipid-raft mediated endocytosis. More recently, we have discovered that two diverse insect pests of plants (<b>hessian</b> <b>flies</b> and aphids) also produce proteins that can bind PI- 3 -P via RXLR motifs in order to enter plant cells, where they suppress host defenses while the insects feed. We are current exploring methodologies for disrupting PI- 3 -P-mediated effector entry in order to create new means for managing oomycete and fungal diseases and insect pests...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this review, {{we argue}} for a {{research}} initiative on wheat's responses to biotic stress. One goal is to begin a conversation between the disparate communities of plant pathology and entomology. Another is to understand how responses {{to a variety of}} agents of biotic stress are integrated in an important crop. We propose gene-for-gene interactions as the focus of the research initiative. On the parasite's side is an Avirulence (Avr) gene that encodes one of the many effector proteins the parasite applies to the plant to assist with colonization. On the plant's side is a Resistance (R) gene that mediates a surveillance system that detects the Avr protein directly or indirectly and triggers effector-triggered plant immunity. Even though arthropods are responsible for a significant proportion of plant biotic stress, they have not been integrated into important models of plant immunity that come from plant pathology. A roadblock has been the absence of molecular evidence for arthropod Avr effectors. Thirty years after this evidence was discovered in a plant pathogen, there is now evidence for arthropods with the cloning of the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly's</b> vH 13 Avr gene. After reviewing the two models of plant immunity, we discuss how arthropods could be incorporated. We end by showing features that make wheat an interesting system for plant immunity, including 479 resistance genes known from agriculture that target viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects, and mites. It is not likely that humans will be subsisting on Arabidopsis in the year 2050. It is time to start understanding how agricultural plants integrate responses to biotic stress...|$|R

50|$|This second oldest {{house in}} the Bronx was built by Isaac Valentine, a prosperous {{blacksmith}} and farmer from Yonkers in 1758. It was built out of nearby natural resources such as pine trees for interior flooring and stone for the exterior walls. During the Revolutionary War, the British captured this house in 1776 and held British troops as George Washington was stationed in the nearby Van Cortlandt house. This house then became the scene of frequent conflict between British and American troops. Isaac Valentine often encountered unwelcomed visitors since the 3rd amendment (no soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house {{without the consent of}} the owner) was not established. Nevertheless, George Washington used the Valentine-Varian House as a strategic location to defeat the British. The house is situated on Gun Hill Road.

5000|$|It was {{not until}} {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century that any real advance was made in the study of {{economic}} entomology. Among the early writings, besides the book of Curtis, there was a publication by Pohl and Kollar, entitled Insects Injurious to Gardeners, Foresters and Farmers, published in 1837, and Taschenberg's Praktische Insecktenkunde. During the 19th century Italian entomologists made significant progress in controlling diseases of the silkworm moth, in the control of agricultural pests and in stored product entomology. Significant figures were: Agostino Bassi ( [...] 1773-1856), Camillo Róndani (1808-1879), Adolfo Targioni Tozzetti (1823-1902), Pietro Stefanelli (1835, 1919), Camillo Acqua (1863-1936) Antonio Berlese (1863-1927), Gustavo Leonardi(1869-1918) and Enrico Verson (1845-1927). In France Etienne Laurent Joseph Hippolyte Boyer de Fonscolombe, Charles Jean-Baptiste Amyot, Émile Blanchard, Valéry Mayet and Claude Charles Goureau were early workers, as was Jean Victoire Audouin, the author of Histoire des insectes nuisibles à la vigne et particulièrement de la Pyrale, Philippe Alexandre Jules Künckel d'Herculais, Joseph Jean Baptiste Géhin and Jean-Étienne Girard.

40|$|The <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly,</b> Mayetiola {{destructor}} (Say), is {{an important}} insect pest of wheat, Triticum spp. Incorporating major <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> resistance genes into wheat cultivars is the primary method of controlling this pest. However, genetic mutations in the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> have allowed certain genotypes to make this resistance ineffective. Therefore, greater knowledge of this insect 2 ̆ 7 s genetics is desirable. Two issues are central to this problem: (1) The anomalous mechanism of sex determination in the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> is poorly understood, and (2) there is an absence of a well characterized genetic map of the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> genome. My research addressed both problems. Sex determination in the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> was investigated using both bulked segregant analysis and individual females in a relatively large (N = 92) mapping population.

During the course of this investigation, I found that a previously developed AFLP-based genetic map was useful. To improve its utility further, I used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to test its precision. The physical positions of selected markers on the map were located on the salivary gland polytene chromosomes of the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly.</b> This work firmly established chromosome-linkage group correlations in the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly,</b> and identified problems in the map.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EntomologyMing-Shun ChenJohn C. ReeseKeeping in {{view the}} {{important}} roles of bacteria {{in almost every}} aspect of insect’s life, the current study is the first systemic and intensive work on microbes associated with <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly,</b> a serious pest of wheat crop. A whole body analysis of <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae, pupae, or adults suggested that a remarkable diversity of bacteria is associated with different stages of the insect life cycle. The overriding detection of genera Acinetobacter and Enterobacter throughout the life cycle of <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> suggested a stable and intimate relationship with the insect host. Adult Hessian flies have the most dissimilar bacterial composition from other stages with Bacillus as the most dominant genus. Analysis of 5778 high quality sequence reads obtained from larval gut estimated 187, 142, and 262 operational taxonomic units at 3 % distance level from the 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd instar respectively. Pseudomonas was the most dominant genus found in the gut of all three instars. The 3 rd instar larval gut had the most diverse bacterial composition including genera Stenotrophomonas, Pantoea, Enterobacter, Ensifer, and Achromobacter. The transovarial transmission of major bacterial groups provided evidence of their intimate relationship with the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly.</b> The <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> is known to manipulate wheat plants to its own advantage. This study demonstrated that the combination of a decrease in carbon compounds and an increase in nitrogen compounds in the feeding tissues of Hessian fly-infested plants results in a C/N ratio of 17 : 1, nearly 2. 5 times less than the C/N ratio (42 : 1) observed in control plants. We propose that bacteria associated with <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> perform nitrogen fixation in the infested wheat, which was responsible for shifting the C/N ratio. The following findings made in the current study i. e. the presence of bacteria encoding nitrogenase (nifH) genes both in <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> and infested wheat, exclusive expression of nifH in infested wheat, presence of diverse bacteria (including the nitrogen fixing genera) in the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae, presence of similar bacterial microbiota in <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae and at the feeding site tissues in the infested wheat, and reduction in survival of <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae due to loss of bacteria are consistent with this hypothesis. The reduction in <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> longevity after the loss of Alphaproteobacteria in first instar larvae, highest proportion of Alphaproteobacteria in insects surviving after the antibiotic treatments and the nitrogen fixation ability of associated Alphaproteobacteria strongly implies that Alphaproteobacteria are critical for the survival of <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae. This study provides a foundation for future studies to elucidate the role of associated microbes on <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> virulence and biology. A better understanding of Hessian fly-microbe interactions may lead to new strategies to control this pest...|$|E
40|$|Resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) to the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> (Mayetiola destructor), a major {{insect pest}} of wheat, {{is based on}} a gene-for-gene interaction.

40|$|Background: Wheat – <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> {{interaction}} {{follows a}} typical gene-for-gene model. <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae die in wheat plants carrying an effective resistance gene, or thrive in susceptible plants that carry no effective resistance gene. Results: Gene sets affected by <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> attack in resistant plants {{were found to}} be very different from those in susceptible plants. Differential expression of gene sets was associated with differential accumulation of intermediates in defense pathways. Our results indicated that resources were rapidly mobilized in resistant plants for defense, including extensive membrane remodeling and release of lipids, sugar catabolism, and amino acid transport and degradation. These resources were likely rapidly converted into defense molecules such as oxylipins; toxic proteins including cysteine proteases, inhibitors of digestive enzymes, and lectins; phenolics; and cell wall components. However, toxicity alone does not cause immediate lethality to <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae. Toxic defenses might slow down <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> development and therefore give plants more time for other types of defense to become effective. Conclusion: Our gene expression and metabolic profiling results suggested that remodeling and fortification of cell wall and cuticle by increased deposition of phenolics and enhanced cross-linking were likely to be crucial for insect mortality by depriving <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> larvae of nutrients from host cells.

40|$|The <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> has an {{intimate}} genetic relationship with wheat, {{and the two}} species have co-evolved.

40|$|<b>Hessian</b> <b>fly,</b> Mayetiola {{destructor}} (Say, 1817), {{is a major}} pest of wheat, and {{is controlled}} mainly through deploying fly-resistant wheat cultivars. The challenge for the plant resistance approach is that virulence of <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> populations {{in the field is}} dynamic, and wheat cultivars may lose resistance within 6 - 8 yr. To ensure continuous success of host plant resistance, <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> populations in the field need to be constantly monitored to determine which resistance genes remain effective in different geographic regions. This study investigated five <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> populations collected from Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, where infestation by <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> has been high in recent years. Eight resistance genes, H 12, H 13, H 17, H 18, H 22, H 25, H 26, and Hdic, were found to be highly effective against all tested <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> populations in this region, conferring resistance to ≥ 80 % of plants containing one of these resistance genes. The frequencies of biotypes virulent to resistance genes H 13 (biotype vH 13), H 18 (vH 18), H 21 (vH 21), H 25 (vH 25), H 26 (vH 26), and Hdic (vHdic) were determined, and were found to vary from population to population, ranging from 0 to 45 %. A logistic regression model was established to predict biotype frequencies based on the correlation between the percentages of susceptible plants obtained in a virulence test and the log-odds of virulent biotype frequencies determined by a traditional approach...|$|E
40|$|Background The <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> (Mayetiola destructor) is an {{important}} insect pest of wheat. It has tractable genetics, polytene chromosomes, and a small genome (158 Mb). Investigation of the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> presents excellent opportunities to study plant-insect interactions and the molecular mechanisms underlying genome imprinting and chromosome elimination. A physical map is needed to improve the ability to perform both positional cloning and comparative genomic analyses with the fully sequenced genomes of other dipteran species. Results An FPC-based genome wide physical map of the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> was constructed and anchored to the insect 2 ̆ 7 s polytene chromosomes. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones corresponding to 12 -fold coverage of the <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> genome were fingerprinted, using high information content fingerprinting (HIFC) methodology, and end-sequenced. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) co-localized two BAC clones {{from each of the}} 196 longest contigs on the polytene chromosomes. An additional 70 contigs were positioned using a single FISH probe. The 266 FISH mapped contigs were evenly distributed and covered 60...|$|E
40|$|Gall midges induce {{formation}} of host nutritive cells and alter plant metabolism to utilize host resources. Here {{we show that}} the gene Mayetiola destructor susceptibility- 1 (Mds- 1) on wheat chromosome 3 AS encodes a small heat-shock protein and is a major susceptibility gene for infestation of wheat by the gall midge M. destructor, {{commonly known as the}} <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly.</b> Transcription of Mds- 1 and its homoeologs increases upon insect infestation. Ectopic expression of Mds- 1 or induction by heat shock suppresses resistance of wheat mediated by the resistance gene H 13 to <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly.</b> Silencing of Mds- 1 by RNA interference confers immunity to all <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly</b> biotypes on normally susceptible wheat genotypes. Mds- 1 -silenced plants also show reduced lesion formation due to infection by the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. Modification of susceptibility genes may provide broad and durable sources of resistance to <b>Hessian</b> <b>fly,</b> B. graminis f. sp. tritici, and other pests...|$|E
