How can the parties agree to exclude or derogate from {{the application of the}} CISG if it is not yet clear whether they have agreed to anything at all? This article explores this narrow, but important question. Can the parties effectively exclude the application of the CISG or <b>derogate</b> from its <b>provisions</b> (i. e., “opt out”) on contract formation within the agreement for which contract formation is at issue? The article begins with a brief elaboration {{on the nature of the}} problem, suggests a means of resolving this issue by looking to the general principles underlying the CISG, and then applies those principles to a series of hypothetical formation problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{provisions}} of art. 312 of the Civil Code establish: a legal system, {{that is the}} community property regime and two types of conventional regimes: the regime of separation of goods and the regime of conventional community (the latter includes conventional derogation from community property regime). Legal matrimonial regime includes assets acquired by each spouse during marriage, except property required by law, which represents each spouse’s own assets. Community legal regime will apply in all situations in which prospective spouses opt for separation of property regime or the regime of conventional community. Separation of property regime {{is characterized by the}} fact that each of the spouses is the exclusive owner of their current assets and of those acquired alone after the dissolution of marriage, for the adoption of this regime the spouses being forced to draw up an inventory of movable property belonging to each one at the contracting of marriage.

40|$|Astoundingly, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) {{does not}} contain [a] {{derogation}} clause. Furthermore, it has been established by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Commission) {{in the case of}} Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme et des Libertes v Chad (Commission Nationale case) that a member state of teh ACHPR cannot derogate human rights in case of emergencies. Hence, the Commission's view may lead to a conclusion that all rights under the ACHPR are non-derogable. This raises the issue of whether it is tenable to conclude that a state facing a situation that endangers the nation, should not at all <b>derogate</b> from the <b>provisions</b> of the ACHPR. Emergency clauses, which permit derogation of human rights in times of emergencies, are also found in most domestic legal instruments. Most African states also encompass this clause in their constitutions. Although the levels of compliance by states are questionable, some of these constitutions also include a list of non-derogable rights. The constitutions of Ethiopia and Mozambique also provide for a derogation clause and a list of non-derogable rights. The aim of the study is to make a critical analysis of the African derogation system. Firstly, the study will analyse the concept of derogation and non-derogable rights in general. Secondly, the jurisprudence and the law of the African system with regard to derogation and non-derogable rights will be examined. In analysing the jurisprudence of the Commission effort will be made to critically study the cases that have been examined by the Commission in relation to derogation and non-derogable rights. Lastly, the compatibility of the Ethiopian and Mozambique constitutions in light of the African system and international standards will be discussed. [...] . Chapter one highlights the basis and structure of the entire study. Chapter two presents a brief historical evolution as well as conceptual framework of the system of derogation and non-derogable human rights in state of emergency. Chapter three focuses on the ACHPR and the jurisprudence of the Commission with regard to derogation and non-derogable rights in state of emergency. Chapter four assesses the compatibility of the non-derogable rights provided in the constitutions of African states with African and international standards. This chapter will [analyse], in particular, the constitutions and the practices of Ethiopia and Mozambique. Chapter five is a conclusion of the overall study stating specific recommendations.

40|$|Abstract When a ship {{is fixed}} on a voyage charter or time charter, the {{charterer}} may use tonnage {{which has been}} chartered to him to transport goods owned by third-party cargo owners. This thesis will discuss this situation: the charterer entered into the contract of carriage of goods by sea with sender, {{but it is the}} ship-owner who actually performs the carriage of goods as actual carrier. If the cargo is damaged or lost, whether the ship-owner shall be liable to the third party? If it is the case, on what legal basis third-party cargo owners can claim against ship-owners? What is the nature of ship-owner s liability to the third party? How does such ship-owner s liability system apply to business practice? All these questions will be analyzed in this paper. Firstly, I will present the legal relationship between parties involved in the carriage where the charterer uses the chartered vessel to carry third party cargo owner goods. It is known that the ship-owner has no contractual obligations to cargo owners, as the ship-owner is not the contracting party to the head contract of carriage of goods by sea. However Section 286 of NMC imposes statutory liability on ship-owners and Section 285 and 287 of NMC cause ship-owner and charterer jointly and severally liable to third-party cargo claimants. Such mandatory liability system aims to strengthen the economic position of cargo interests, but ship-owners and charterers are still free to insert clauses to allocate risks between them as long as such the clauses do not <b>derogate</b> from mandatory <b>provisions.</b> This paper will discuss two common clauses regarding ship-owner s liability, that is, demise clause and incorporation clause. I will analyze whether these clauses are caught by obligatory provisions and if they are not, how those clauses apply in practical business. Finally I will discuss indemnification claims between ship-owner and charterer. When the ship-owner is found liable under a bill of lading, and if such claim under the charter party would have allowed him to avoid of at least limit liability, the ship-owner has rights to seek indemnity from charterer according to Section 338 of NMC. However Section 338 does not provide cargo claimants with an absolute right to redress and certain requirements must be satisfied, that is, the greater obligations assumed by the ship-owner must result from different terms contained in the bill of lading and there must be contractual basis for indemnity in the charter party. All these issues mentioned above will be discussed mainly under Norwegian maritime law, but some comparison will be made between Norwegian maritime law and Chinese maritime law. Besides that, I will also take relevant international conventions into consideration including the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules...|$|R
40|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union faces a {{wide variety}} of human rights decisions. In common with {{national}} courts, it has to ensure that the actions of the European Union administration and legislature comply with human rights. These human rights are found in the general principles of Community law, including, inter alia, those of the European Convention of Human Rights, in addition to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. When doing so, the CJEU may find that it is judging not only the actions of the institutions of the European Union, but also actions of the administration and legislature of the Member States as they implement provisions of EU law, or act as agents of the EU administering EU law. In addition, the CJEU will adjudicate on actions of the Member States when they are acting within the sphere of European Union law. This can occur when Member States <b>derogate</b> from other <b>provisions</b> of EU law on the grounds of protecting human rights, or where Member States fail to implement European Union law provisions that either directly or indirectly protect human rights. This diverse nature of the human rights jurisdiction of the CJEU poses unique problems for human rights adjudication in the EU. The Court is at one and the same time protecting human rights from abuse by its own measures and policing the activities of its Member States. Moreover, the lines between these roles are blurred. For the CJEU to provide a human-rights compatible interpretation of the provisions of a Directive, for example, not only restricts the actions of the EU legislature, but also limits the actions of Member States. In addition, when the CJEU takes on the role of policing the actions of Member States, it does so {{within the context of the}} ECHR, given that all Member States, and potentially soon the EU itself, are signatories to the ECHR and the provisions of the ECHR are sources of general principles of Community law as well as being mirrored in the first Chapter of the Charter. Yet for the CJEU to perform the same function as the European Court of Human Rights would lead to replication of roles, as well as cause problems for the CJEU’s assertion of the supremacy of directly effective EU law over national law which would appear to run contrary to the margin of appreciation granted by the ECtHR to its signatory States. This chapter aims to provide the groundwork for developing a theory of human rights adjudication for the CJEU, looking specifically at the complexities that arise when deciding cases that require control over actions of Member States. It builds on consensus found in the literature calling for the need for the CJEU to be sensitive to competing requirements of consensus and divergence in the protection of human rights, drawing on the constitutional pluralism underpinning the EU. It will first explain the need for both uniformity and diversity in human rights protections in the EU. It will then explain how these needs can best be met through a dialogue theory of human rights adjudication, with Article 267 facilitating the provision of varying degrees of authority to determine rights-issues to either the CJEU or the national courts. The final section discusses the factors that should influence whether a rights-issue is more suited for resolution by the CJEU or national authorities, building on Weiler’s theory and explaining its precise application through a series of examples drawn from recent case law. </p...|$|R
