5|$|A <b>deck</b> <b>decompression</b> <b>chamber</b> (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two {{compartment}} {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient {{space in the}} main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E

One was designed for surface-supplied diving and limited to 75m. The diver breathed heliox as the bottom mix and 100% oxygen at the 6m stop. The other was designed for closed bell bounce diving and allowed for exposures up to 120 minutes, and depths to 120m. The diver breathed heliox {{in the water and}} in the bell, air after transfer into the <b>deck</b> <b>decompression</b> <b>chamber,</b> and finally oxygen on built in breathing system (BIBS) from 12m to the surface. These tables produced a relatively high incidence of decompression sickness.|$|E

50|$|Commercial diving {{operators}} now generally use {{a closed}} bell {{in conjunction with}} a surface hyperbaric chamber, These have safety and ergonomic advantages and allow decompression to be carried out after the bell has been raised to the surface and back on board the diving support vessel. Closed bells are often used in saturation diving and undersea rescue operations. The diving bell would be connected via the mating flange of an airlock to the <b>deck</b> <b>decompression</b> <b>chamber</b> or saturation system for transfer under pressure of the occupants.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after 0500 {{hours on}} February 17, Cannon began to convulse {{while working on}} the {{exterior}} of the habitat. Barth tried to save him, holding his head in the breathable gas pocket of the skirt surrounding SEALAB's entrance and unsuccessfully attempting to force the mouthpiece of the emergency aqua-lung regulator between Cannon's teeth. Finally, Barth dragged Cannon back toward the PTC, where his fellow aquanauts helped him bring Cannon inside and Reaves and Blackburn attempted resuscitation. When the PTC reached the surface it was obvious that Cannon was dead. His body was placed in the outer airlock of the <b>deck</b> <b>decompression</b> <b>chamber</b> (DDC), returned to surface pressure and brought to San Diego Naval Hospital. Cannon's funeral was held at Humphrey Mortuary in Chula Vista, California, on February 19. He was buried at Wacahoota Baptist Cemetery in central Florida.|$|E

50|$|La Chalupa {{was used}} as the primary {{platform}} for the Scott Carpenter Man in the Sea Program, an underwater analog to Space Camp. Unlike Space Camp, which utilizes simulations, participants performed scientific tasks while using actual saturation diving systems. This program, envisioned by Ian Koblick and Scott Carpenter, was directed by Phillip Sharkey with operational help of Chris Olstad. Also used in the program was the MarineLab Underwater Habitat, the submersible Sea Urchin (designed and built by Phil Nuytten), and an Oceaneering Saturation Diving system consisting of an on <b>deck</b> <b>decompression</b> <b>chamber</b> and a diving bell. La Chalupa was the site of the first underwater computer chat, a session hosted on GEnie's Scuba RoundTable (the first non-computing related area on GEnie) by then Scott Carpenter Man in the Sea Director Sharkey from inside the habitat. Divers {{from all over the world}} were able to direct questions to him and to Commander Carpenter.|$|E
