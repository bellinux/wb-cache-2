On her casting, Jackson said, [...] "Cate {{is one of my favorite}} actors to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life in the earlier films." [...] McCoy, the former Doctor Who star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a Royal Shakespeare Company's King Lear, was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a [...] "wizard" [...] in October 2010, leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown.

[...] On the casting of Stott, Jackson commented [...] "Fran and I have long been fans of Ken's work and are excited he will be <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> this journey."
