5|$|The king, while Catholic, {{was very}} {{tolerant}} {{and did not}} support the more aggressive policies of the Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; {{at the time of his}} death, it had 11. Despite his support for religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split. Despite his support for the Protestants, he did not stop the growing tide of intolerance, either in Poland or abroad, as shown by the fate of the Racovian Academy, or an international disagreement between the faiths. Neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> involved with the disagreement about the Orthodox Cossacks, a group that he respected and counted on in his plans.|$|E
25|$|Chung Keng Quee {{apart from}} being a man of vision was also a great risk-taker. Sir Hugh Low in his own notes {{describing}} negotiations over the leasing out of the Perak revenue farms compares Chung Keng Quee and Khoo Thian Teik. Chung Keng Quee {{had told him that}} he needed five thousand more coolies to make the venture successful while Khoo Thian Teik had talked of two or three hundred more. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> his coolies from China, Ah Quee also employed coolies from India.|$|E
500|$|Cannon {{joined the}} newly formed Oilers under head coach Lou Rymkus. As one of the highest-paid players in {{professional}} football, he was heckled early on by opposing players. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> along well with Rymkus, whom he described as [...] "unpleasant, confrontational, with a nasty disposition and an oversized ego." [...] In Cannon's rookie year, he led the team in rushing with 644 yards and caught five touchdown passes. His 88-yard touchdown reception from quarterback George Blanda in the 1960 AFL Championship Game helped the Oilers become the inaugural AFL champions. For his efforts, Cannon was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was a good}} bowler and batsman: but it was by his {{brilliant}} fielding that he made his reputation; and {{there can be little}} doubt that at long-leg or cover-point he had few equals in his own time. Many a batsman, having hit a ball in the direction of cover-point, started to run, being ignorant of his wonderful quickness and great reach, and feeling certain he could never get to it; but not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> to it, but picking it up with surprising quickness, he had it into the wicket-keeper's or bowler's hands like a flash and seconds before the batsman had reached his crease! ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{fact the}} said Pythagoras, while busily {{studying}} {{the wisdom of}} each nation, visited Babylon, and Egypt, and all Persia, being instructed by the Magi and the priests: {{and in addition to}} these he is related to have studied under the Brahmans (these are Indian philosophers); and from some he gathered astrology, from others geometry, and arithmetic and music from others, and different things from different nations, and only from the wise men of Greece <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> nothing, wedded as they were to a poverty and dearth of wisdom: so on the contrary he himself became the author of instruction to the Greeks in the learning which he had procured from abroad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Why? Why did I {{leave you}} many years ago? ... You thought, the boy seeks something, seeks such a special subtlety, that color {{descending}} like stars {{from the sky}} and landing, bright and transparent, like snow on our roofs. Where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> it? How would it come to a boy like him? I don't know why he couldn't find it with us, in the cityâ€”in his homeland. Maybe the boy is [...] "crazy", but [...] "crazy" [...] {{for the sake of}} art. ...You thought: [...] "I can see, I am etched in the boy's heart, but he is still 'flying,' he is still striving to take off, he has 'wind' in his head." ...

2500|$|In the Detroit Free Press, Seward Cramer wrote: [...] "The Pennsylvania men watched [...] {{above all}} others, {{and he could}} not make a move that was not followed[...] [...] [...] [...] Eleven times did Johnny Garrels try the famous fake play that has worked against every other team this season. [...] He would form for a punt and then try a dash for the harbor. [...] But Scarlett and Levine, the scout boats, would {{intercept}} him, and in ten plays of this character he was thrown for a total loss of sixty-five yards, and in only one <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>get</b> away with the goods for any substantial gain. [...] That was a run of twenty yards around Pennsylvania's left end." [...] Cramer blamed the [...] "almost total lack of interference" [...] for Garrels' inability to gain through Penn's line. A soggy field was also blamed for slowing Garrels.|$|E
