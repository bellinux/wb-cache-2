Some networks that require higher security use deep packet filter to capture packets {{that can not}} be detected by simple firewall. Deep packet filters use list of rules for determining safety of packets. There is a high degree of parallelism in processing these rules because each rule represent independent pattern matching process. We find that the underlying architecture for existing software and <b>hardware</b> <b>firewalls</b> do not fully take advantage of this parallelism. Thus, we design a deep packet filtering firewall on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) {{to take advantage of the}} parallelism while retaining its programmability.

40|$|Nowadays, {{security}} is a key constraint in MPSoC development as many critical and secret information can be stored and manipulated within these systems. Addressing the protection issue in an efficient way is challenging as information can leak from many points. However one strategic component of a bus-based MPSoC is the communication architecture as all information that an attacker could try to extract or modify would be visible on the bus. Thus monitoring and controlling communications allows an efficient protection of the whole system. Attacks can be detected and discarded before system corruption. In this work, we propose a lightweight solution to dynamically update <b>hardware</b> <b>firewall</b> enhancements which secure data exchanges in a busbased MPSoC. It provides a standalone security solution for AXI-based embedded systems where no user intervention is required for security mechanisms update.

40|$|A {{firewall}} is {{an essential}} component to provide network security and traffic control. It is widely used to prevent illegal accesses to private or corporate networks from external unsafe source like Internet. Firewalls are basically classified into two types, <b>hardware</b> <b>firewalls</b> and software firewalls. Hardware-based is a single external hardware to a system, but software-based is installed on a computer inside a system. Two such firewalls, Cisco ASA 5505 and Linux iptables are implemented and practical evaluated theirs performance. The performance test in this paper work primarily focuses on Network layer, and the main parameters include Throughput, Latency, and Concurrent Sessions. Different performance monitoring tools are also introduced in this paper. As a network layer firewall, the most impressive feature is through inspecting the packets to manage the traffic from the higher Layer 4 - 7 of OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which inevitably has a certain impact on the performance. The bottleneck of the whole network is determined by what extent the impact is. The primary objective of this thesis is through analyzing the test reports to evaluate the two type firewalls’ performance. Thus the results reported in this paper gives some ideas to new firewall customers about what aspects should be considered before selecting a suitable firewall product. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{firewall}} {{can be in}} {{the form}} of hardware, software or a combination of the two. It is basically used to prevent, block, and keep out unwanted intruders from entering a network. This applies to a home, small business, or a large corporation network. A firewall monitors all of the incoming and outgoing traffic from a personal computer or a local area network. The majority of people are not afraid of their Internet connection being hacked by an outsider. The chances of suffering from some type of Internet hack are on the rise, especially when connected to the Internet using a cable modem or some type of broadband service. People are surprised when they discover that their newly installed personal firewall reports that their home computer is being scanned from the Internet many times per day. This is why it’s so important to select and install a good firewall for your home or small business. The reason is simple: A firewall will help control the Spyware and Spam problems that have become so annoying with Internet usage. The research presented here will elaborate on some of the better software and <b>hardware</b> <b>firewalls</b> on the market.

40|$|Computers are {{networked}} {{together in}} order to share the information they store and process. The internet connects many of these networks together, offering a multitude of options for communication, productivity and entertainment. It also offers the opportunity for unscrupulous individuals to contact these networked computers and attempt to appropriate or destroy the data on them, the computing resources they provide, and the identity or reputation of the computer user. Measures to secure networks need to be implemented by network administrators and users to protect their computing assets. Firewalls filter information as it flows through a network. This filter can be implemented in hardware or software {{and can be used}} to protect computers from unwanted access. While software firewalls are considered easier to set up and use, hardware firewalls are often considered faster and more secure. Absent from the marketplace is an embedded hardware solution applicable to desktop systems. Traditional software firewalls use the processor of the computer to filter packets; this is disadvantageous because the computer can become unusable during a network attack when the processor is swamped by the firewall process. Traditional hardware firewalls are usually implemented in a single location, between a private network and the internet. Depending {{on the size of the}} private network, a <b>hardware</b> <b>firewall</b> may be responsible for filtering the network traffic of hundreds of clients.

40|$|Firewalls are an {{integral}} part of network security. They are pervasive throughout networks and can be found in mobile phones, workstations, servers, switches, routers, and standalone network devices. Their primary responsibility is to track and discard unauthorized network traffic, and may be implemented using costly special purpose hardware to flexible inexpensive software running on commodity hardware. The most basic action of a firewall is to match packets against a set of rules in an Access Control List (ACL) to determine whether they should be allowed or denied access to a network or resource. By design, traditional firewalls must sequentially search through the ACL table, leading to increasing latencies as the number of entries in the table increase. This is particularly true for software firewalls implemented in commodity server hardware. Reducing latency in software firewalls may enable them to replace <b>hardware</b> <b>firewalls</b> in certain applications. In this thesis, we propose a software firewall architecture which removes the sequential ACL lookup from the critical path and thus decreases the latency per packet in the common case. To accomplish this we implement a Bloom filter-based, stochastic pre-classification stage, enabling the bifurcation of the predicted good and predicted bad packet code paths, greatly improving performance. Our proposed architecture improves firewall performance 67 % to 92 % under anonymized trace based workloads from CAIDA servers. While our approach has the possibility of incorrectly classifying a small subset of bad packets as good, we show that these holes are neither predictable nor permanent, leading to a vanishingly small probability of firewall penetration...|$|R

40|$|DDoS {{attacks are}} {{increasingly}} becoming a major problem. According to Arbor Networks, the largest DDoS attack reported by a respondent in 2015 was 500 Gbps. Hacker News {{stated that the}} largest DDoS attack as of March 2016 was over 600 Gbps, and the attack targeted the entire BBC website. ^ With this increasing frequency and threat, and the average DDoS attack duration at about 16 hours, we know for certain that DDoS attacks will not be going away anytime soon. Commercial companies are not effectively providing mitigation techniques against these attacks, considering that major corporations face the same challenges. Current security appliances are {{not strong enough to}} handle the overwhelming traffic that accompanies current DDoS attacks. There is also a limited research on solutions to mitigate DDoS attacks. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a means of mitigating DDoS attacks in order to minimize downtime. One possible solution is for organizations to implement their own architectures that are meant to mitigate DDoS attacks. ^ In this dissertation, we present and implement an architecture that utilizes an activity monitor to change the states of firewalls based on their performance in a hybrid network. Both firewalls are connected inline. The monitor is mirrored to monitor the firewall states. The monitor reroutes traffic when one of the firewalls become overwhelmed due to a HTTP DDoS flooding attack. The monitor connects to the API of both firewalls. The communication between the rewalls and monitor is encrypted using AES, based on PyCrypto Python implementation. ^ This dissertation is structured in three parts. The first found the weakness of the <b>hardware</b> <b>firewall</b> and determined its threshold based on spike and endurance tests. This was achieved by flooding the <b>hardware</b> <b>firewall</b> with HTTP packets until the firewall became overwhelmed and unresponsive. The second part implements the same test as the first, but targeted towards the virtual firewall. The same parameters, test factors, and determinants were used; however a different load tester was utilized. The final part was the implementation and design of the firewall performance monitor. The main goal of the dissertation is to minimize downtime when network firewalls are overwhelmed as a result of a DDoS attack. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was {{airports}} network design and implementation {{and the introduction of}} a suitable network for most airports around the world. The following project focused on three main parts: security, quality, and safety. The project has been provided with different utilities to introduce a network with a high security level for the airport. These utilities are <b>hardware</b> <b>firewalls,</b> an IP access control list, Mac address port security, a domain server and s proxy server. All of these utilities have been configured to provide a secure environment for the entire network and to prevent hackers from entering sensitive departments like the flight management and service providers departments. Improving the performance of any network requires a high quality of techniques and services which help to improve the general task of the network. The technical services that have been placed in the airport’s network are failover firewalls utility, a Pre-boot Execution Environment (PXE) server, a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, a Domain Name System (DNS) server and a cabling system. These tools can increase the performance of the network in general and provide a stable internet service for the Air Traffic Control System by using dual internet service providers and the failover utility.
