The theoretical part is mainly focusing on the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> derivatives in the oil market and the explanation of the mechanism of most often used derivative contracts. The second and more practical part of the thesis examine the use of these derivatives and all benefits and risks associated with trading in commodity derivatives. The potential threats arising from using derivatives as oil market contracts are explained on the example of corporate trading strategy of Matallgesellschaft AG...|$|E
40|$|The paper explores utility {{measures}} {{by combining}} experiments with mathematical derivations in psychophysics paradigm. The analysis on ultimatum game experiment reveals an evidence for utility threshold and thus supports Bernoulli's utility logarithmic law. Both experimental results and theoretical derivations {{show that the}} logarithmic law is suitable for the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> choice and the power law for risk choice. The further mathematical demonstration indicates the logarithmic law for utility scaling to be a Klein-Rubin utility function, a utility function well defined in microeconomics. Based on this, the experimental utility measure is connected with the econometric model Linear Expenditure System, and presents an experimental procedure for testing the utility maximization hypothesis, which will remove a long unsettled perplexity in a fundamental stone of economics since Gossen proposed it in 1854.

40|$|A new machine {{learning}} approach for price modeling is proposed. The use of neural networks as an advanced signal processing tool may be successfully used to model and forecast energy commodity prices, such as crude oil, coal, natural gas, and electricity prices. Energy commodities have shown explosive {{growth in the}} last decade. They have become a new asset class used also for investment purposes. This creates a huge demand for better modeling as what occurred in the stock markets in the 1970 s. Their price behavior presents unique features causing complex dynamics whose prediction {{is regarded as a}} challenging task. The use of a Mixture of Gaussian neural network may provide significant improvements with respect to other well-known models. We propose a computationally efficient learning of this neural network using the maximum likelihood estimation approach to calibrate the parameters. The optimal model is identified using a hierarchical constructive procedure that progressively increases the model complexity. Extensive computer simulations validate the proposed approach and provide an accurate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> prices dynamics. © 2012 Massimo Panella et al...|$|R

5000|$|In his {{discussion}} of commoditization, he also presents the idea of singularization which occurs because [...] "there {{are things that are}} publicly precluded from being commoditized…are sometimes extended to things that are normally commodities—in effect, commodities are singularized by being pulled out <b>of</b> their <b>commodity</b> sphere." [...] Kopytoff goes on to describe ways in which commodities can be singularized, for example, through restricted commoditization, sacralization, and terminal commoditization. While singularization and commodity pathway diversion have stark similarities, and Kopytoff's singularization categories can be seen in Appadurai's <b>description</b> <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> pathway diversions, Appadurai critiques placing singularization and commoditization in direct opposition because, as he argues, diversion (singularization) and commoditization are fluidly occupied positions in the use life of an object.|$|R

40|$|We are {{concerned}} {{in this paper}} with creating a dynamic <b>description</b> <b>of</b> interregional <b>commodity</b> movements which has steady states consistent with the traditional Samuelson-Takayama-Judge (STJ) static spatial price equilibrium model. This is accomplished by introducing a disequilibrium adjustment mechanism which {{differs from that of}} other network spatial price tatonnement models in that prices and interregional flows follow distinct signals, and constraints ensuring balanced trade flows are not enforced prior to attaining an equilibrium. The disequilibria arising from our relaxation of the flow balance constraints are seen to provide a foundation for describing failures of spatial markets to clear. Also notable among the features of our model is its treatment of a general network topology and non-separable cost, supply and demand functions. We show through numerical experiments that the proposed adjustment process is seen to hold promise as means of calculating static spatial price equilibria. Furthermore, we discuss the circumstances under which disequilibrium states visited by the adjustment process describe actual time-varying commodity flows and prices, allowing the model to be used for predictive dynamic interregional freight modeling. ...|$|R

Substantial part of this work {{is devoted to the}} proteomics identification of barley proteins which change during malting and so become more stationary and they influence quality of beer (haze and foam in beer). For this experiment was used barley variety Jersey. In the theoretical part of this thesis there is information about beer, manufacturing <b>of</b> beer with <b>description</b> <b>of</b> important <b>commodities</b> for manufacturing <b>of</b> beer and information about barley malting and information about malting process. Next there is <b>description</b> <b>of</b> methods for separation of proteins (1 D gel electrophoresis and 2 D gel electrophoresis), MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and this use for the analysis and identification of proteins, the use of matrices and ways of the sample preparation.

2500|$|Of {{the four}} {{parameters}} defining the family, most {{attention has been}} focused on the stability parameter, α (see panel). Stable distributions have 0 < α ≤ 2, with the upper bound corresponding to the normal distribution, and α = 1 to the Cauchy distribution. The distributions have undefined variance for α < 2, and undefined mean for α ≤ 1. The importance of stable probability distributions is that they are [...] "attractors" [...] for properly normed sums of independent and identically-distributed (iid) random variables. The normal distribution defines a family of stable distributions. By the classical central limit theorem the properly normed sum of a set of random variables, each with finite variance, will tend towards a normal distribution as the number of variables increases. Without the finite variance assumption, the limit may be a stable distribution that is not normal. [...] Mandelbrot referred to such distributions as [...] "stable Paretian distributions", after Vilfredo Pareto. In particular, he referred to those maximally skewed in the positive direction with 1nbsp&<nbsp&αnbsp&<nbsp&2 as [...] "Pareto–Lévy distributions", which he regarded as better <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> stock and <b>commodity</b> prices than normal distributions.|$|R

40|$|The {{abundance}} {{of natural resources}} in Latin American countries {{has led to a}} challenge for governments when designing their public policies for economic growth.
