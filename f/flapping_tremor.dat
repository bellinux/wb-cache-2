5000|$|Asterixis (also {{called the}} <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor,</b> or liver flap) is a tremor {{of the hand}} when the wrist is extended, {{sometimes}} said to resemble a bird flapping its wings. This motor disorder is characterized by an inability to maintain a position, which is demonstrated by jerking movements of the outstretched hands when bent upward at the wrist. The tremor is caused by abnormal function of the diencephalic motor centers in the brain, which regulate the muscles involved in maintaining position. Asterixis is associated with various encephalopathies due especially to faulty metabolism. The term derives from the Greek a, [...] "not" [...] and stērixis, [...] "fixed position".|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Ammonia {{has still}} {{essential}} role in pathogenesis of encephalopathy. It is probable that helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection leads to hyperammonemia and aggravates the hepatic encephalopathy via urease activity or its effect on zinc level. This study was aimed to assess the effect of H pylori eradication on hepatic encephalopathy. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 42 cirrhotic patients with encephalopathy were enrolled the study. For evaluation the encephalopathy, <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor,</b> number connection test (NCT) and grade of encephalopathy was determined {{for all of the}} patients. The prevalence of H pylori infection was evaluated based on positive serology by ELAISA method (Genesis Kit, UK), and/or rapid urease test (RUT) during endoscopic evaluation. One month later, after treatment, grading of encephalopathy, NCT and <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor</b> was evaluated again and data were analyzed by software SPSS. Results: Serologic evaluation or RUT showed that 30 patients of 42 (71. 42 %) were positive for H pylori. In comparison between pre and post treatment, grade of encephalopathy and NCT were reduced significantly but alteration in <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor</b> was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our results indicate that eradication of H pylori may lead to improve the grade of hepatic encephalopathy and NCT...|$|E

40|$|Background: Peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric origin is a {{frequent}} event with poor survival. A new promising approach is the association of the Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) with the Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC), which yet is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. We report, to our knowledge, the first case of Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE) complicating CRS plus HIPEC. WE, caused by a deficiency of thiamine, is characterized by ataxia, ocular motor cranial neuropathies and changes in consciousness. Methods: A patient affected by gastric cancer with peritoneal seeding, submitted to CRS plus HIPEC, in 4 th post-operative day had manifested the appearance of <b>flapping</b> <b>tremors,</b> with positive manoeuvre of Mingazzini, impaired vision and mental confusion. The brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) confirmed the clinical suspicion of WE. Even though the appropriate therapy was promptly applied, the patient died in 10 th post-operative day. Conclusion: WE is an uncommon neurological disorder. Only 16 % of these patients inadequately treated recover fully, with a mortality rate of 10 – 20 %. We consider useful to report this case, {{because it is the}} first time that WE is correlated to CRS plus HIPEC...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the safety, efficacy and tolerability of Nigella sativa (N. sativa) {{in patients with}} hepatitis C not eligible for interferon (IFN) -&#x 3 B 1;. METHODS: Thirty patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, who were not eligible for IFN/ribavirin therapy, {{were included in the}} present study. Inclusion criteria included: patients with HCV with or without cirrhosis, who had a contraindication to IFN-&#x 3 B 1; therapy, or had refused or had a financial constraint to IFN-&#x 3 B 1; therapy. Exclusion criteria included: patients on IFN-&#x 3 B 1; therapy, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis&#x 2005;I&#x 2005;virus, hepatocellular carcinoma, other malignancies, major severe illness, or treatment non-compliance. Various parameters, including clinical parameters, complete blood count, liver function, renal function, plasma glucose, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and polymerase chain reaction, were all assessed at baseline {{and at the end of}} the study. Clinical assessment included: hepato and/or splenomegaly, jaundice, palmar erythema, <b>flapping</b> <b>tremors,</b> spider naevi, lower-limb edema, and ascites. N. sativa was administered for three successive months at a dose of (450 mg three times daily). Clinical response and incidence of adverse drug reactions were assessed initially, periodically, and at the end of the study. RESULTS: N. sativa administration significantly improved HCV viral load (380808. 7 1; 610937 vs 147028. 2 1; 475225. 6, P = 0. 001) and TAC (1. 35 1; 0. 5 vs 1. 612 1; 0. 56, P = 0. 001). After N. sativa administration, the following laboratory parameters improved: total protein (7. 1 1; 0. 7 vs 7. 5 1; 0. 8, P = 0. 001), albumin (3. 5 1; 0. 87 vs 3. 69 1; 0. 91, P = 0. 008), red blood cell count (4. 13 1; 0. 9 vs 4. 3 1; 0. 9, P = 0. 001), and platelet count (167. 7 1; 91. 2 vs 198. 5 1; 103, P = 0. 004). Fasting blood glucose (104. 03 1; 43. 42 vs 92. 1 1; 31. 34, P = 0. 001) and postprandial blood glucose (143. 67 1; 72. 56 vs 112. 1 1; 42. 9, P = 0. 001) were significantly decreased in both diabetic and non-diabetic HCV patients. Patients with lower-limb edema decreased significantly from baseline compared with after treatment [16 (53. 30 %) vs 7 (23. 30 %), P = 0. 004]. Adverse drug reactions were unremarkable except for a few cases of epigastric pain and hypoglycemia that did not affect patient compliance. CONCLUSION: N. sativa administration in patients with HCV was tolerable, safe, decreased viral load, and improved oxidative stress, clinical condition and glycemic control in diabetic patients...|$|R

40|$|Rifaximin {{has been}} {{reported}} to be effective for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in Europe. However, it is unknown whether Rifaximin is effective for the treatment of HE in Koreans, therefore we conducted a open-label prospective randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of rifaximin versus lactulose in Korean patients. Fifty-four patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy were enrolled. Thirty-two patients were randomized to receive rifaximin and 22 to receive lactulose both over a 7 -day periods. Before {{and at the end of}} treatment, gradation of blood ammonia, <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor,</b> mental status, number connection test (NCT) were performed and estimation of HE indexes determined. Both rifaximin and lactulose were effective in the majority of patients (84. 4 % and 95. 4 %, respectively, p= 0. 315). Blood NH 3, <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor,</b> mental status, and NCT was significantly improved by rifaximin and lactulose, and the posttreatment levels of these measures were similar for the rifaximin and lactulose-treated groups, as was the HE index (rifaximin group (10. 0 → 4. 2, p= 0. 000); lactulose group (11. 3 → 5. 0, p= 0. 000)).

40|$|A {{disturbing}} {{sequel to}} the operation of porta-caval anastomosis for portal hypertension is {{the high rate of}} neuropsychiatric complications. Walker, Shaldon, and Vowles (1961) found that 10 of their first 50 patients who had this operation developed these symptoms within five years, and Read, Laidlaw, and Sherlock (1961) reported that seven of their 21 patients had frank neuropsychiatric disorders and a further seven had symptomless electro-encephalographic changes. > The clinical features of porto-systemic encephalo-pathy in chronic liver disease are extremely varied. The psychiatric manifestations include personality change, intellectual deterioration, and lability of mood, all of which may be episodic in nature. Dis-turbances of sleep rhythm, bizarre behaviour, and sensory disorders may also be found (Davidson and Summerskill, 1956). The neurological abnormalities which have been described have included <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor</b> ofthe outstretched hands, increased tone in the limbs with ankle clonus, and in the later stages extensor plantar responses (Sherlock, 1963).

40|$|In th is study, we {{introduce}} {{a simple and}} cost-effective method based on image analysis {{that can be used}} in the objective assessment/measurement of tremor. Tremor can be defined as the involuntary rhythmic movement of body parts (usually hands). Types of tremor include, but not limited to essential tremor, athetose, chorea, and <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor.</b> Objective assessment of tremor is crucial in the diagnosis of many neuromuscular d iseases. Velocity and acceleration sensors utilizing semiconductor technology a re widely used for measurement of tremor. However, one major weakness of this type of sensors is that they cannot sa tisfactorily track slow or constant speed motion, because of their poor response in the low-frequency region, where some of tremors may have some significant spectral components. Therefore, accurate measurement of tremor for the diagnosis or prognosis of movement disorders is an important issue. The method that we devise consists of an in fra-red LED that is attached to the body part whose motion to be measured and a simple CCD camera that is a ttached to a personal computer.

40|$|Objectives: Severe hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{gives rise to}} asterixis, a striking motor symptom also called <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor,</b> which {{is characterized by a}} sudden ceasing of muscle tone in all muscles of a limb. In this study, we aimed at scrutinizing the cortical activation associated with asterixis and unraveling the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Material and methods: We recorded simultaneously neural activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and muscle activity with surface EMG in nine patients with manifest {{hepatic encephalopathy}} showing asterixis. Asterixis events were detected semiautomatically and served as triggers for averaging MEG signals. Evoked responses averaged time-locked to asterixis events were subjected to equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling. Additionally, we localized the strongest cortico-muscular coherence in the frequency of the co-occurring tremulousness. Results: Evoked fields averaged time-locked to asterixis events were best explained by a single dipolar source in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M 1, Talairach coordinates of mean localization: − 40, − 20, and 64; Brodmann area 4). This dipole showed a twofold field reversal, that is biphasic wave, with frontal dipole orientation at 49  ms before flap onset and 99  ms after flap onset. Conversely, two maxima with occipital dipole orientation were observed 2  ms and 160  ms after flap onset. Cortico-muscular coherence for the tremulousness was likewise localized in the contralateral M 1 confirming earlier findings in the present patient cohort. Conclusions: Our results reveal an involvement of M 1 in the generation of asterixis. As also tremulousness, also called mini-asterixis, was shown to originate in M 1, asterixis and mini-asterixis may share common pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{observe the}} changes in blood glucose in {{patients}} with liver cirrhosis and investigate the relationship between glucose metabolism and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). MethodsSixty patients with liver cirrhosis (cirrhosis group) and 30 patients without liver cirrhosis (control group), who were hospitalized in Department of Gastroenterology, Jiading District Central Hospital from August 2008 to August 2010, {{were included in the}} study. The general data were collected; the consciousness of patients was observed; the physical examination was performed for detecting flapping tremors; blood samples were collected for measuring blood glucose. The cirrhosis group was further divided into <b>flapping</b> <b>tremor</b> subgroup and non-flapping tremor subgroup. The cirrhosis group and control group were compared in terms of the incidence rate of abnormal glucose metabolism. The patients were divided into normal glucose metabolism group and abnormal glucose metabolism group, and the two groups were compared in terms of the incidence rates of flapping tremors and HE. ResultsOf the 60 patients in cirrhosis group, 28 had no flapping tremors, and 32 had flapping tremors. The incidence rate of abnormal glucose metabolism was significantly lower in the control group than in the cirrhosis group (13. 33 % vs 26. 67 %; χ 2 = 2  058, P＜ 0. 05). The incidence rates of flapping tremors and HE were 50. 00 % and 34. 09 % in the normal glucose metabolism group, versus 62. 50 % and 37. 50 % in the abnormal glucose metabolism group (P＞ 0. 05).

40|$|In mongrel dogs, {{the effect}} of end-to-side portacaval shunt on plasma, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) and brain tyramine, tyrosine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were studied. It {{was found that the}} level of tyramine in plasma, CSF, and selected brain regions increased steadily after the construction of the shunts. These elevations became more pronounced when the dogs manifested symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. In postshunted dogs with stage II and III hepatic encephalopathy, tyramine concentration in corpus striatum (1, 312 +/- 371), hypothalamus (400 +/- 67. 0), and midbrain (660 +/- 78. 7 ng/g) was significantly (P less than 0. 05) higher than the level in dogs with stage 0 and I hepatic encephalopathy and sham-operated dogs serving as controls (corpus striatum, 831 +/- 140; hypothalamus, 167 +/- 40. 0; and midbrain, 132 +/- 37. 4 ng/g). This was followed by a concomitant depletion of dopamine and norepinephrine in these brain regions (postshunt: dopamine 104 +/- 20. 0, 3, 697 +/- 977, and 105 +/- 14. 1; norepinephrine 521 +/- 71. 6, 81. 6 +/- 13. 7, and 218 +/- 31. 7 ng/g; vs. sham group: dopamine 532 +/- 83. 1, 8, 210 +/- 1, 126, and 192 +/- 35. 0; norepinephrine 1, 338 +/- 425, 124 +/- 21. 3, and 449 +/- 89. 7 ng/g) of encephalopathic dogs with portacaval shunt.

40|$|Alcohol {{dementia}} (ALD) usually follows long-term alcohol de-pendence. The major psychiatric {{features of}} ALD are general loss of short- and long-term memory combined with disturbances in con-centration and {{a decrease in}} intellectual capacity, all of which persist during abstinence. Despite its clinical importance, few studies have been published up to now on medical treatment of ALD and other alcohol-induced mental disorders [1]. The central nervous gluta-matergic system, with its N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, is suggested to be involved in toxic neuronal loss [2] due to an increased glutamatergic neurotransmission during repeated alcohol withdrawal and may subsequently {{contribute to the development of}} ALD. The low-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist memantine (ada-mantine, 1 -amino- 3, 5 -dimethyladamantine hydrochloride, CAS 41100 - 52 - 1) modulates the glutamatergic system most likely through Ca 2 + influx blockage of NMDA receptors [3] and shows positive effects on memory in the treatment of other psychogeriatric disorders with memory loss such as Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) or Parkinson’s disease [4]. We would like to report the case of a 71 -year-old female patient with chronic alcoholism for at least 30 years.
