5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable <b>estoppel</b> and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by <b>estoppel</b> (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E

50|$|Legal {{writers have}} failed to satisfactorily {{reconcile}} the bank’s undertaking with any contractual analysis.

25|$|To conclude, {{the above}} {{limitations}} help to clearly outline its parameters. This essay has defined {{with the use}} of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory <b>estoppel</b> to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory <b>estoppel,</b> manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory <b>estoppel,</b> may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory <b>estoppel</b> replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} {{possible}} detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor {{is allowed to}} revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V. Briscoe (1964) 1 WLR 1326 or where he alters his position {{as a result of}} relying on that promise when though he suffers no detriment. In Alan Co. Ltd V El Nasr & Import Co. (1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of promissory <b>estoppel.</b> Therefore, for a plea of promissory <b>estoppel</b> to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of promissory <b>estoppel</b> has been the core and central topic of discussion {{in the evolution of the}} doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{promises}} {{within a}} contract will be enforced under the promissory <b>estoppel</b> doctrine, when enforcing the contract promises avoids injustice.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{aspect of}} the debate among those who favour {{substantive}} fusion is (beyond whether rights in trusts are personal or proprietary) which underlying [...] "event" [...] to which different trusts [...] "respond". Adding to the scheme of Gaius, that saw obligations as coming from contracts and wrongs, unjust enrichment lawyers emphasised that their field was a neglected tertium quid. According to the most influential scheme advocated by Peter Birks, obligations divide into consents, wrongs, unjust enrichments, and [...] "miscellaneous" [...] other events. On this view, express trusts (like contracts, gifts, or <b>estoppels)</b> were consent based, some constructive trusts were too, while other constructive trusts produced rights (proprietary, or with priority in insolvency) for wrongs, and other constructive trusts and all resulting trusts were founded in unjust enrichment.|$|R

40|$|Legal {{force and}} {{enforcement}} of judgment Resumé In introduction of this work I write about principles and historical development of the Civil Procedure or civil proceedings at first from view to common development and then from the sight to development in Czech country. This introduction is important for outline {{and understanding of the}} civil proceedings as a whole and resulting connection with legal force {{and enforcement of}} judgment from this. In the next part of this work I interpret a fundamental conception of these subjects such as legal force, enforcement and decision. I analyze a basic concept of legal force and their effects on the participants in proceedings. The basic conditions which must be discharged for decision can really come info force and resulting state for affected person too. I analyze legal force and enforcement of judgment {{from the point of view}} of the formal legal force, material legal force and enforcement of judgment too. I give an attention to the conditions for the come into force issued decisions and <b>estoppels</b> to the further proceedings. I deal with rights of remedy such as regular remedy (in the case of use they suspend coming into force decisions), extraordinary relieves (they can contest decisions which already came into force), which are together a break point to the [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Note that Promissory <b>Estoppel</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>Estoppel</b> for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably.|$|E
25|$|In Yeomans Row Management Ltd v Cobbe the House {{overturned}} {{the decision of}} a fairly heavy-weight Court of Appeal on the very issue of <b>estoppel,</b> thereby illustrating the level of confusion {{about the meaning of}} the doctrine. Lord Scott of Foscote, with whom the other Lords agreed, described at length that someone who seeks to rely on proprietary <b>estoppel</b> must establish an actual or certain interest in the property to which he claimed a right. Without that, he is not off the starting blocks.|$|E
25|$|When a {{property}} owner misrepresents {{the existence of}} an easement while selling {{a property}} and does not include in the deed to the buyer an express easement over an adjoining property that the seller owns, a court may step in and create an easement. Easements by <b>estoppel</b> generally look to any promises not made in writing, any money spent by the benefiting party in reliance on the representations of the burdened party, and other factors. If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create an easement by <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{binding effect}} of a {{judgment}} {{is said to be}} based upon the principle that justice and expediency demand that a person who has had his 2 ̆ 2 day in court 2 ̆ 2 should not be permitted to relitigate the same issues in a subsequent action. However, a general rule existing concurrently with this principle has been that a person is not entitled to claim the benefits of an adjudication of any matter decided in an action to which he was not a party or privy to a party. These benefits have often been denied for the sole reason that such a person would not have been bound by a judgment in that action adverse to his interest and that granting such a windfall would violate the principle that 2 ̆ 2 <b>estoppels</b> must be mutual. 2 ̆ 2 As a result, a person who has already had his 2 ̆ 2 day in court 2 ̆ 2 and lost is given the opportunity to relitigate the same issues with a different opponent who is denied the right to rely on the former action. This troublesome inconsistency has led several courts to repudiate the concept that issues determined in one suit cannot be taken as conclusively established in a subsequent action unless both parties were mutually bound by the former judgment. As such, they have allowed a litigant to assert the findings of a previous action regardless {{of the fact that the}} person was not a party or privy to a party in that action and could not have been bound by an unfavorable judgment. The decisions presented in this article represent a widespread dissatisfaction with the rule of mutuality, and these are discussed briefly before examining the approach taken by the Nebraska courts.

25|$|Promissory <b>estoppel</b> is the {{doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. <b>Estoppel</b> is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of Promissory <b>Estoppel</b> was first developed in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co but was lost {{for some time}} until it was resurrected by Lord Denning in the leading case of Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estoppel</b> in English {{law is a}} {{doctrine}} {{that may be used}} in certain situations to prevent a person from relying upon certain rights, or upon a set of facts (e.g. words said or actions performed) which is different from an earlier set of facts.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} {{heard in the}} Southern District of New York in front of Judge Louis L. Stanton. The defendants, {{including}} Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., RCA Corporation, and several major newspapers, denied Steinberg's allegations of copyright infringement and asserted the affirmative defenses of (1) fair use as a parody, (2) <b>estoppel,</b> and (3) laches. Both parties moved for summary judgment.|$|E
25|$|Because Joe {{purchased}} the land believing {{that there would}} be access to the bridge and the driveway and Joe then paid for a house and a connection, Joe can be said to rely on Ray's promise of an easement. Ray materially misrepresented the facts to Joe. In order to preserve equity, the court will likely find an easement by <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
25|$|On March 23, 2006, Judge Lew {{concluded}} that, in the 1947-48 lawsuit (see above), Judge Young already {{addressed and}} rejected these arguments and that res judicata and collateral <b>estoppel</b> precluded re-litigation. Lew {{ruled that the}} Siegel heirs had effectively terminated Siegel's grant of the rights to Superboy. He also ruled that the protagonist of the television show Smallville was Superboy.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, persons under 18 are {{typically}} minor and their contracts are considered voidable; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits {{received by the}} minor must be returned. The minor can enforce breaches of contract by an adult while the adult's enforcement may be more limited under the bargain principle. Promissory <b>estoppel</b> or unjust enrichment may be available, but generally are not.|$|E
25|$|Promissory <b>estoppel</b> is not {{available}} when one party promises to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, unless the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed. This is the rule formulated in Pinnel's Case, and affirmed in Foakes v Beer. This rule has, however, been thrown into doubt by the recent decision of Collier v Wright Ltd.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if Ray had offered {{access to the}} bridge and {{driveway}} after selling Joe the land, {{there may not be}} an easement by <b>estoppel.</b> In this instance, it is merely inconvenient if Ray revokes access to the driveway. Joe did not purchase the land and build the house in reliance on access to the driveway and bridge. Joe will need to find a separate theory to justify an easement.|$|E
25|$|Re Hobley adopts the {{unconscionability}} rationale {{such that}} {{the imposition of a}} constructive trust is only justified by unconscionability, therefore there must be detrimental reliance. This would appear to be analogous to the doctrine of <b>estoppel.</b> Another consequence of this approach is that the trust must come into existence before the death of the first testator as otherwise {{the subject matter of the}} trust would be uncertain and could possible be avoided by inter vivos dispositions.|$|E
25|$|For example: Ray sells land to Joe on {{the promise}} that Joe can use Ray's {{driveway}} and bridge to the main road at any time, but Ray {{does not include the}} easement in the deed to the land. Joe, deciding that the land is now worth the price, builds a house and connects a garage to Ray's driveway. If Ray (or his successor) later decides to gate off the driveway and prevent Joe (or Joe's successor) from accessing the driveway, a court would likely find an easement by <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a {{trademark}} {{must be used}} to maintain rights in relation to that mark, {{a trademark}} can be 'abandoned' or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used. By comparison, patents and copyrights cannot be 'abandoned' and a patent holder or copyright owner can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright. Additionally, patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights. However, a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known infringer may give the defendant a defense of implied consent or <b>estoppel</b> when suit is finally brought.|$|E
25|$|A {{decision}} of the EPO to revoke a European patent is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the opposition proceedings at the EPO especially attractive for opponents. In contrast, a {{decision of}} the EPO not to revoke a European patent (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for revocation by the national court. The EPO decision does not create an <b>estoppel</b> precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent {{at the national level}} (at least before the English courts). The validity of a European patent can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a national court, and at the international level, before the European Patent Office during opposition. The same is not true for infringement proceedings, upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendants}} {{also argued}} that Steinberg was estopped from defending his copyright {{on the grounds that}} he had taken no action over a period of eight years to stop others from counterfeiting his posters and adapting his idea to other locations, and had not acted in response to newspaper ads promoting the movie. The court rejected this argument, holding that the defendants had not proved any of the elements of estoppel: (1) a representation in fact; (2) reasonable reliance thereon; and (3) injury or damage resulting from denial by the party making the representation. While the defendants argued that Steinberg had made a representation of his acquiescence to their use of his image in the movie poster by not complaining about the ads in the newspaper, the judge rejected this line of reasoning and noted that the defendants had continued to use the infringing advertisements even after becoming aware of Steinberg's objections. Further, there was no existing relationship between the parties that could give rise to <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter. A contract to do something beyond its power is void and unenforceable, and in fact the {{local government}} will be prohibited from performing its obligations under such a contract. The private party who performs under such a contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable <b>estoppel,</b> implied contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} a dispute over the {{interpretation}} of the House of Lords' intent in regards to the use of Hansard in court, sparked by Lord Steyn's Hart Lecture on 16 May 2000, titled [...] "Pepper v Hart: A Re-examination". Steyn suggested that Pepper v Hart was limited to [...] "an <b>estoppel</b> argument", and Hansards use in court should [...] "be confined to the admission against the executive of categorical assurances given by ministers to Parliament"; essentially, that Hansard should only be used if the purpose is to establish that ministers made certain assurances to Parliament, with the intent being to prevent the executive going back on its promises. Stefan Vogenauer disagrees that this was the House of Lords' intent in Pepper, pointing out that Hart's counsel had, during proceedings, made an argument along the lines of <b>estoppel</b> — one the Lords had completely ignored when making their decision.|$|E
500|$|In 1947 {{he decided}} in Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [...] KB 130 (known as the 'High Trees' case), {{which was a}} {{milestone}} in English contract law.

500|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury, a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the {{government is}} barred by collateral <b>estoppel</b> from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts.|$|E
