40|$|The {{efficiency}} of traffic flows {{in urban areas}} is known to crucially depend on signal operation. Here, elements of signal control are discussed, based on the minimization of overall travel times or vehicle queues. Interestingly, we find different operation regimes, some of which involve a "slower-is-faster effect", where a delayed switching reduces the average travel times. These operation regimes characterize different ways of organizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Besides the optimize-one-phase approach, we discuss the procedure and advantages of optimizing multiple phases as well. To improve the <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> platoons and support the self-organization of "green waves", it is proposed to consider the price of stopping newly arriving vehicles.

40|$|The {{automotive}} technical servicing system {{includes several}} kinds of technical activities, technical service, current repair and diagnostics. One of essential elements of the car technical service system is mileage in between servicing. During technical servicing oil is replaced, diagnostics and other servicing work planned by the car producers is performed. The automobile producers increase the car mileage in between servicing following marketing trend. If for highly forced engines the mileage in between servicing is technically groundlessly increased, {{it can lead to}} essential decrease of resources of motors and other systems. The aim of research is to determine influence <b>of</b> infrequent <b>servicing</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> on <b>vehicle</b> <b>service</b> life. According to the results of the research infrequent technical servicing leads to premature decrease of the automobile’s engine service life...|$|R
40|$|The motor {{industry}} plays {{a critical role}} in the economy of South Africa, with respect to both GDP and employment. Service quality is a fundamental aspect <b>of</b> <b>service</b> provision, and this is especially the case with motor vehicles, where substantial profits are generated in the <b>servicing</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The study was conducted using a convenience sample of 761 respondents who were owners of various brands <b>of</b> motor <b>vehicles.</b> The questionnaire was a self-completion questionnaire which consisted of three sections. Factor analysis of the research indicated that five service quality factors could be identified. Apart from the tangible factor, the factors identified differ from the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>service</b> quality proposed by Parasuraman et al. (1988). The dimensions identified also were differed from other studies conducted into service quality dimensions in this context, highlighting the variable nature <b>of</b> <b>service</b> quality in this context. The implications of this study are that the customer perceives {{the way in which the}} service is delivered as critical in evaluating service quality...|$|R
