5|$|Solomon Creek was {{devoid of}} <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s. However, since then several fish species, {{including}} brook trout, have inhabited {{the creek and}} its tributaries. A number of varieties of aquatic insects are also present.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 there arose a debate concerning access to <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> Norwegian territorial waters.

5|$|The oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) is {{a species}} of fish from the cichlid family known {{under a variety of}} common names, {{including}} tiger oscar, velvet cichlid, and marble cichlid. In tropical South America, where the species naturally resides, A. ocellatus specimens are often found for sale as a food <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the local markets.

5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of wild <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> West Creek. Brook trout and brown trout both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} brook trout are slightly more common than brown trout, with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the creek are sculpin, eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed.

5|$|Fishermen target many sharks {{for their}} jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> general.

40|$|We {{surveyed}} Oklahoma-licensed anglers who <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> eastern Oklahoma streams {{to describe}} their fishing preferences and socioeconomic characteristics. A screening telephone survey of 1992 Oklahoma license holders was conducted to identify individual license holders who <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> eastern Oklahoma streams and who would participate in a follow-up telephone survey.

Based on 1147 completed screening surveys, an estimated 12 % of Oklahoma license holders <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> and took one or more trips per year to eastern Oklahoma streams. Seventy percent of licensed anglers said they fished for black bass species, 53 % fished for catfish, and less than 20 % fished for other species such as temperate bass, sunfish, and trout. However, surveyed anglers who <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> Baron Fork sought black bass species more often than those who <b>fished</b> <b>in</b> Glover River. Eastern Oklahoma anglers used public areas more than private areas to access streams for fishing, and they fished from the bank or in a boat or canoe more often than by wading or in a floa...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} describes {{results of}} computing correlations between different CPUE series of hake (Northern Stock). Results show that significant correlations between some series appeared when same lag was allowed between series.

These correlations allow to become more confident on these CPUE series. However, {{it is difficult to}} believe that plots like the one in fig. 7 can prove that there is a direct cause to affect relationship between hake CPUE from "artisans" in subareas VII and VIII and hake CPUE from "hauturiers" <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> divisions IVa + VIa two years later...|$|R
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E
5|$|Many {{saltwater}} fish manufacture {{large amounts of}} trimethylamine oxide {{to protect them from}} the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles.

5|$|Murray cod {{are very}} long-lived, which is {{characteristic}} of many freshwater native <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that most adults participate {{in at least one}} exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades. Murray cod are the most long-lived freshwater native <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> Australia. The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age, and the even larger specimens of years past leave little doubt that the species can reach considerably greater ages, of 70 years or more.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> 2005.|$|E
