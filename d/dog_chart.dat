The subject is anatomy, replete with a <b>dog</b> <b>chart,</b> focusing on [...] "the south end of the backbone — for thereby hangs a tail". One of the [...] "students", a small bulldog, is addressed as Mr. Barker and questioned regarding his disinterest as to the functions of the tail. His response, [...] "please sir, because I haven't any tail", elicits derisive laughter from the dog sitting alongside him and they engage in [...] "sez you, sez me" [...] insults popularized by the 1926 silent hit film about World War I, What Price Glory. While the professor restores order by chastising them, [...] "fie, fie, gentlemen! fie, fie!", a dog newspaper vendor is seen shouting out, [...] "all extry! wuxtry! war declared! Airedale Republic declares war on the Kingdom of Dachshund! The professor immediately exhorts his students to volunteer — [...] "it's nice outdoor work and a fine chance to meet some swell French mamas". The laughing dog states, [...] "I'm crazy to go — say, how about you, slacker?" [...] Barker responds, [...] "I'm crazy, too — I'll go". All others also offer to enlist.|$|E
