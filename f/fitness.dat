5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary <b>fitness</b> of an organism. <b>Fitness</b> is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, <b>fitness</b> {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead <b>fitness</b> is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low <b>fitness.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple deterministic theoretical framework for analysing the gene frequency evolution of two alternative alleles {{at a single}} genetic locus in a habitat comprising two environments in which the genotypes have different relative <b>fitnesses.</b> We illustrate this for adaptation of pest insects, where one allele (resistance to toxins expressed in transgenic crops) is favoured in one environment (transgenic plants) and the other allele (susceptibility to toxins) is favoured in the other environment ('refuges' of non-transgenic plants). The evolution of allele frequencies depends on selection pressure because of relative sizes of the environments and relative <b>fitnesses</b> of the genotypes in each environment. We demonstrate that there are critical threshold proportions for habitat division that determine equilibrium allele frequencies. The stability of the system depends on relationships between the relative genotype <b>fitnesses.</b> In some cases, {{the division of the}} habitat in exactly the threshold proportions removes selection pressure and maintains polymorphism at all allele frequencies. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} isofemale strains {{extracted from}} a natural population of Nasonia vitripennis, we detected variation for the sex ratios produced in fresh hosts (first sex ratios) and in previously parasitized hosts (second sex ratios). Under simple assumptions of population structure, this between-strain heterogeneity of first sex ratios results in heterogeneity of <b>fitnesses.</b> There is approximately ten percent difference in average <b>fitnesses</b> between the strains. (The <b>fitnesses</b> of second sex ratios are analyzed {{in the accompanying}} paper.) Average first and average second sex ratios are uncorrelated. There is significant between-female heterogeneity within some strains for first sex ratios but not for second sex ratios. In addition, the average direct-developing and diapause first sex ratios (but not second sex ratios) are significantly correlated. There are significant correlations between the direct-developing and diapause sex ratios produced by the same female. The strains differ in their effects on the sex ratio and size of another female's brood in the same host. Data on these types of variation for sex ratio traits are essential for further progress {{in the study of}} sex ratio evolution...|$|R

40|$|Since natural {{selection}} requires variation to act, {{the amount of}} genetic variation in a given population is of central theoretical and experimental importance. This amount is estimated by the genetic variation present in current populations. Electrophoretic studies of natural populations reveal that ten to twenty percent of all loci have multiple alleles. These multi-allelic loci {{may be the result}} of the accumulation of unselected mutations (neutral theory) or of balancing selection (selectionist theory). The neutral theory views selection as primarily eliminating variation, whereas the selectionist theory views selection as often maintaining variation. Therefore, our view of selection and evolution depends upon the question of how multiple allelic systems evolve. To address whether balancing selection increases genetic variation, we examined Owen’s model in which selection varies in the two sexes (sex-dependent model) and compared it to a model in which selection is constant across the two sexes (sex-independent model). We explored these models for a single multi-allelic locus to explore more generally the effect of balancing selection on the maintenance and construction of multi-allelic systems. To do so, we constructed two computer models. The “fitness-space ” approach examines the proportion of all possible <b>fitnesses</b> capable of maintaining different sized allelic systems. The proportion of possible <b>fitnesses</b> is greater in balancing selection models. The “constructionist ” approach examines the ease in reaching this portion of possible <b>fitnesses.</b> The ease in reaching <b>fitnesses</b> is less in balancing selection models. Thus, in contrast to previous hypotheses, our research suggests that balancing selection may not increase the amount of variation present in natural populations...|$|R
