5|$|The ARVN III Corps commander, General Toan, {{organized}} five {{centers of}} resistance {{for the defense}} of the city.

South Vietnamese defensive forces around Saigon totaled approximately 60,000 troops. However, as the exodus made its way into Saigon, along with them were many ARVN soldiers, causing the number of men under arms in the city to exceed 250,000.
