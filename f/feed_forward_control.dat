50|$|One of {{the main}} driving forces for PAC (See also a more recent but related {{development}} in the pharmaceutical industry, called PAT) is to remove the bottleneck, and time lag, associated with sending the samples to the lab {{and waiting for the}} analysis results. By moving the analysis to the process, results can be obtained closer to real-time which effectively improves the ability for the control action to correct for process changes (i.e. feedback and <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> <b>control).</b>|$|E

30|$|A <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage <b>control</b> scheme {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{in order to enhance}} the FRT capability of the VSC HVDC connected WPPs under host power system faults. The proposed <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage <b>control</b> scheme considers both the DC voltage error between the reference and measured values, and the AC current from the WPP collector system ensuring fast and robust FRT. The PHIL tests show that the proposed <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage <b>control</b> scheme can fast and efficiently reduce the WPP collection system voltage when there is a voltage dip in the host power system and the wind turbines within the WPP can be triggered into the FRT model, and reduce active power and supply reactive power. As such, the proposed <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage can successfully enable the VSC HVDC connected WPP ride through faults in the host power systems.|$|R

30|$|Collectively, the {{experiments}} described above not only reveal the mechanism for nPTB down-regulation, but {{also suggest that}} the PTB-regulated REST/miR- 124 loop is automatically connected to the second nPTB-regulated Brn 2 /miR- 9 loop in mouse cells, but such two loops have to be separately activated in human adult fibroblasts. Such tight {{connection between the two}} loops in mouse, but not human cells might result from high-level activity of miR- 124 in mouse, but not human cells because both miR- 124 and miR- 9 {{have been found to be}} capable of targeting nPTB (Xue et al. 2016). The beauty of these regulatory networks by PTB and nPTB lies in the utilization of multiple regulatory mechanisms at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, rather than simple feedback and/or <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> <b>controls</b> among TFs. The PTB/nPTP-mediated neuronal reprogramming also emphasizes the “subtraction” approach through inactivating negative master regulators compared to the general “addition” approach widely used in the regenerative medicine field via overexpressing positive master regulators.|$|R
50|$|Some movements, however, occur {{too quickly}} to {{integrate}} sensory information, and instead {{must rely on}} <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> <b>control.</b> Open loop control is a feed forward form of motor control, and is used to control rapid, ballistic movements that end before any sensory information can be processed. To best study this type of control, most research focuses on deafferentation studies, often involving cats or monkeys whose sensory nerves have been disconnected from their spinal cords. Monkeys who lost all sensory information from their arms resumed normal behavior after recovering from the deafferentation procedure. Most skills were relearned, but fine motor control became very difficult.|$|E

To overcome this problem, multi-variable inferential <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> <b>control</b> strategy is proposed. This is partucylarly useful when disturbances cannot easily or economically be measured. In this strategy, the effects of disturbances on controlled process variables are inferred from the uncontrolled process variables (direct measurements of disturbances are not needed).

In the proposed FRT scheme, the WPP collector network AC voltage is actively controlled by considering both the DC voltage error and the AC current from the WPP AC collector system which ensures fast and robust FRT of the VSC HVDC connected offshore WPPs. The PHIL tests were carried out in order to verify the efficacy of the proposed <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage <b>control</b> scheme for enhancing the FRT capability of the VSC HVDC connected WPPs. The PHIL test results have demonstrated the proper control coordination between the offshore WPP and the WPP side VSC and the efficient FRT of the VSC HVDC connected WPPs.|$|R

40|$|Photosynthesis {{is arguably}} the most {{researched}} of all plant processes. A dynamic model of leaf photosynthesis that includes each discrete process from light capture to carbohydrate synthesis, e-photosynthesis, is described. It was developed by linking and extending our previous models of photosystem II (PSII) energy transfer and photosynthetic C 3 carbon metabolism to include electron transfer processes around photosystem I (PSI), ion transfer between the lumen and stroma, ATP synthesis and NADP reduction to provide a complete representation. Different regulatory processes linking the light and dark reactions are also included: Rubisco activation via Rubisco activase, pH and xanthophyll cycle-dependent non-photochemical quenching mechanisms, as well as the regulation of enzyme activities via the ferredoxin-theoredoxin system. Although many further feedback and <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> <b>controls</b> undoubtedly exist, it is shown that e-photosynthesis effectively mimics the typical kinetics of leaf CO 2 uptake, O 2 evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence emission, lumen and stromal pH, and membrane potential following perturbations in light, [CO 2] and [O 2] observed in intact C 3 leaves. The model provides a framework for guiding engineering of improved photosynthetic efficiency, for evaluating multiple non-invasive measures used in emerging phenomics facilities, and for quantitative assessment of strengths and weaknesses within the understanding of photosynthesis as an integrated process...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to gain insight into {{the relative importance of}} <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> (FF) <b>control</b> and different proprioceptive feedback (FB) pathways to ongoing ankle extensor activity during walking in the conscious cat. We assume that the FF signal can be characterized by a simple trapezoidal function, and that muscle modulation during level walking is due to feedback. Apart from testing this assumption, we want to verify the following main hypothesis: the same central command (FF signal) and the same proprioceptive gains used during level walking can automatically compensate for changes in the walking slope. Therefore, we formulate and solve two least-squares parameter estimation problems based on a simple muscle activity model to determine the relative contribution of the feedback signals and the <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> signal.

5000|$|Postural {{control is}} defined as achievement, {{maintenance}} or regulation of balance during any static [...] or dynamic activity for the regulation of stability and orientation. The interaction of the individual with the task and the environment develops postural control.

These stability and orientation challenges necessitate change in the task and environment, thereby making postural control the most essential pre requisite {{for most of the}} tasks. [...] There are two types of postural control strategies: predictive and reactive, which utilize the <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> and feedback postural control respectively in order to maintain stability during various circumstances.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{generating}} and stabilising a periodic walking pattern for a biped robot. A novel control framework based on adaptive oscillators combined with dynamic movement primitives was proposed. The proposed control system is a multi step process, where in the first step the system learns the dynamic walking trajectory which is demonstrated by imitating a spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) controller. The learning process is completely autonomous and it is done in real time. In the second step the periodic dynamic pattern is executed using a low gain feedback controller combined with <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> torque/force <b>control</b> signals. This allows compliant behaviour, smooth interaction with unstructured environment and generates stable ”open-loop” walking pattern.
