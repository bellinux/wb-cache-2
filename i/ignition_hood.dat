2500|$|The {{number of}} 98 body styles was reduced in 1975. Four were {{available}} consisting of coupes or 4-door hardtops in Luxury or Regency trim. Two door models {{were no longer}} hardtops. Standard equipment included: power brakes with front discs, cigarette lighter, electric clock, electronic <b>ignition,</b> <b>hood</b> release, bumper impact strips, lamp package, 455 CID engine, molding package, remote-controlled outside mirror, power seat, power windows, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, chrome wheel discs and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Standard tire size was J78-15. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a control {{relevant}} nonlinear dynamic model of grate sintering is presented. The model {{is designed for}} control purposes for use in future model predictive control #MPC# strategies. Amulti-model approachis utilized where the model {{is presented as a}} convex combination of locally a#ne models. The model performance is compared to global models listed in the literature by simulations and by comparison to industrial plant data. 1 Introduction The metallurgical process of sintering prepares the #iron# ore to form suitable feed for the blast furnace. Granulated ore and coke are mixed, moistened with water and micro-pelletized to form the charge. The charge is loaded onto a grate and leveled to form a bed whichis ignited by a gas-fueled <b>ignition</b> <b>hood.</b> A heat wave and coke combustion zone travels down through the bed under the in#uence of a suction pressure. Hot gas from the combustion zone passes through moist charge deeper in the bed where water evaporates. The process can be di [...] ...|$|E
