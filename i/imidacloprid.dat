5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with <b>imidacloprid</b> contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with <b>imidacloprid</b> suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of <b>imidacloprid</b> in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. <b>Imidacloprid</b> in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of <b>imidacloprid</b> in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid <b>imidacloprid</b> (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of <b>imidacloprid</b> on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of <b>imidacloprid</b> on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} when French beekeepers succeeded in banning neonicotinoids, the Clinton {{administration}} permitted pesticides that were previously banned, including <b>imidacloprid.</b> In 2004, the Bush administration reduced regulations further and pesticide applications increased.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} announced {{findings that}} sublethal exposure to <b>imidacloprid</b> rendered honey bees significantly {{more susceptible to}} infection by the fungus Nosema, thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD.|$|E
5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US {{have been attributed}} to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, <b>Imidacloprid</b> and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient <b>imidacloprid,</b> and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and <b>imidacloprid</b> in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
25|$|Moxidectin {{has been}} {{released}} in the United States as part of Advantage Multi (<b>imidacloprid</b> + moxidectin) topical solution for dogs and cats. It utilizes moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, foliar {{applications}} of insecticides reduced psyllid populations {{for a short}} time, but also suppressed the populations of predatory ladybird beetles. Soil application of aldicarb provided limited control of Asian citrus psyllid, while drenches of <b>imidacloprid</b> to young trees were effective for two months or more.|$|E
25|$|The cane beetle (also {{known as}} cane grub) can {{substantially}} reduce crop yield by eating roots; {{it can be}} controlled with <b>imidacloprid</b> (Confidor) or chlorpyrifos (Lorsban). Other important pests are the larvae of some butterfly/moth species, including the turnip moth, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), the Mexican rice borer (Eoreuma loftini); leaf-cutting ants, termites, spittlebugs (especially Mahanarva fimbriolata and Deois flavopicta), and the beetle Migdolus fryanus. The planthopper insect Eumetopina flavipes acts as a virus vector, which causes the sugarcane disease ramu stunt.|$|E
25|$|Neonicotinoids are a {{class of}} neuro-active {{insecticides}} chemically similar to nicotine. <b>Imidacloprid,</b> of the neonicotanoid family, is {{the most widely used}} insecticide in the world. In the late 1990s neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impact and were linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.|$|E
25|$|Only the {{insecticides}} spinosyn and abamectin {{are known}} to be effective against this pest. Neem based products are considered effective synergists. Product rotation is integral to resistance prevention programs. Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils are both effective, but only in very frequent, sometimes impractical spray schedules (at least once a week). Systemic neonicotinoids such as <b>imidacloprid</b> were once considered to be sparing of beneficial insects and natural predators, and recommended for integrated pest management of chilli thrips, especially when used as a soil soak or drip irrigation product. The past decade has revealed that neonicotinoids can seriously impact beneficial insects, especially bees, through effects that are not immediately apparent - even at trace concentrations.|$|E
500|$|A 2012 in situ study {{provided}} strong [...] {{evidence that}} exposure to sublethal levels of <b>imidacloprid</b> in {{high fructose corn syrup}} (HFCS) used to feed honey bees when forage is not available causes bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks after <b>imidacloprid</b> dosing. The researchers suggested, [...] "the observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by <b>imidacloprid</b> in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies." ...|$|E
500|$|In Europe, the {{interaction}} of the phenomenon of [...] "dying bees" [...] with <b>imidacloprid</b> has been discussed for quite some time. A study from the [...] "Comité Scientifique et Technique (CST)" [...] {{was at the center of}} discussion, and led to a partial ban of <b>imidacloprid</b> in France. The <b>imidacloprid</b> pesticide Gaucho was banned in 1999 by the French Minister of Agriculture Jean Glavany, primarily due to concern over potential effects on honey bees. Subsequently, when fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide and in Europe mainly labeled [...] "Regent", was used as a replacement, it was also found to be toxic to bees, and banned partially in France in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Also, in 2012, {{researchers}} in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and <b>imidacloprid</b> release {{large amounts of}} the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees. According to the study, [...] "Experimental {{results show that the}} environmental release of particles containing neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers." [...] Commonly used pesticides, such as the <b>imidacloprid,</b> reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels. [...] Lu et al. (2012) reported they were able to replicate CCD with <b>imidacloprid.</b> Another neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, causes navigational homing failure of foraging bees, with high mortality.|$|E
500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{study published}} in February 2016 strongly suggests a pattern linking <b>imidacloprid</b> to sublethal effects on honey bees, stating: [...] "trace dietary <b>imidacloprid</b> at field-realistic levels in nectar will have no lethal effects, but will reduce expected performance in honey bees by between 6 and 20%. Statistical power analysis showed that published field trials that have reported no effects on honey bees from neonicotinoids were incapable of detecting these predicted sublethal effects with conventionally accepted levels of certainty." ...|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees are {{in danger}} in many {{developed}} countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides (clothianidin, <b>imidacloprid,</b> and thiamethoxam) presented a high risk for bees. While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees, a study on B. terrestris showed that [...] "field-realistic" [...] levels of <b>imidacloprid</b> significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a [...] "considerable negative effect" [...] on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world.|$|E
500|$|Insecticides {{with active}} {{ingredients}} such as azadirachtin, <b>imidacloprid,</b> [...] emamectin benzoate, and dinotefuran are currently used {{since they are}} systemic (i.e., incorporated into the tree) and remain effective for one to three years depending on the product. Insecticides are typically only considered a viable option in urban areas with high value trees near an infestation. Ash trees are primarily treated by direct injection into the tree or soil drench. Some insecticides cannot be applied by homeowners and must be applied by licensed applicators. Initially, tree injections do not compromise tree health, but over many years drilling and chemical wounds can compromise the tree's health. Damage from emerald ash borer can continue to increase over time even with insecticide applications. Insecticide treatments are not feasible for large forested areas outside of urban areas.|$|E
500|$|Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority {{issued a}} {{declaration}} that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honey bees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led {{one of the}} key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling, said the decision [...] "begs the question {{of what was going on}} when these chemicals were first approved." [...] The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was [...] "ready to work with" [...] the EC and member states. [...] In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid insecticides. [...] The ban will restrict the use of <b>imidacloprid,</b> clothianidin, and thiamethoxam for use on crops that are attractive to bees. Eight nations voted against the motion, including the British government, which [...] argued that the science was incomplete. The ban can be seen as an application of the [...] "precautionary principle", established at the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment and Development, which advocates that [...] "lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heartworm {{prevention}} for cats {{is available}} as ivermectin (Heartgard for Cats), [...] milbemycin (Interceptor), or the topical selamectin (Revolution for Cats) and Advantage Multi (<b>imidacloprid</b> + moxidectin) topical solution.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{hypotheses}} were wildly different, including environmental change-related stresses, malnutrition, pathogens (i.e., disease including Israel acute paralysis virus), mites, or {{the class of}} pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which include <b>imidacloprid,</b> clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Unproven and less credible theories include radiation from cellular phones or other man-made devices, ...|$|E
2500|$|Nicotine {{constitutes}} approximately 0.6–3.0% of the {{dry weight}} of tobacco. It also occurs in edible plants, such Solanaceae, which include eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes, but at trace levels generally under 200 nanograms per gram, dry weight (less than [...]00002%). Nicotine functions as an antiherbivore chemical; consequently, nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past, and neonicotinoids, such as <b>imidacloprid,</b> are widely used.|$|E
2500|$|Prevention of {{heartworm}} infection can {{be obtained}} {{through a number of}} veterinary drugs. The drugs approved for use in the US are ivermectin (sold under the brand names Heartgard, Iverhart, and several other generic versions), milbemycin (Interceptor Flavor Tabs and Sentinel Flavor Tabs) and moxidectin (ProHeart) administered as pills or chewable tablets. Moxidectin is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, administered by veterinarians. [...] The injectable form of moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns in 2004, but the FDA returned a newly formulated ProHeart 6 to the market in 2008. ProHeart 6 remains on the market in many other countries, including Canada and Japan. Its sister product, ProHeart 12, is used extensively in Australia and Asia as a 12-month injectable preventive. [...] Topical treatments are available, as well. [...] Advantage Multi (<b>imidacloprid</b> + moxidectin) Topical Solution, uses moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms, as well as <b>imidacloprid</b> to kill adult fleas. [...] Selamectin (Revolution) is a topical preventive likewise administered monthly; it also controls fleas, ticks, and mites.|$|E
2500|$|Rice plants {{produce their}} own {{chemical}} defenses {{to protect themselves from}} pest attacks. Some synthetic chemicals, such as the herbicide 2,4-D, cause the plant to increase the production of certain defensive chemicals and thereby increase the plant’s resistance to some types of pests. Conversely, other chemicals, such as the insecticide <b>imidacloprid,</b> can induce changes in the gene expression of the rice that cause the plant to become more susceptible to attacks by certain types of pests. [...] 5-Alkylresorcinols are chemicals that can also be found in rice.|$|E
2500|$|All infested trees {{should be}} removed by {{certified}} tree care personnel {{to ensure that the}} process is completed properly, and chipped in place, their stumps ground to below the soil level.Insecticides such as <b>imidacloprid,</b> clothianidin, dinotefuran have been used to target adult beetles in canopies or as trunk injections to target larvae. [...] Insecticides within the tree may not translocate evenly, which causes some A. glabripennis to survive treatments. Combined with efficacy concerns, high cost, and non-target effects on other insects, widespread prophylactic treatment of trees in an infestation area concern scientists.|$|E
50|$|The {{main routes}} of {{dissipation}} of <b>imidacloprid</b> {{in the environment}} are aqueous photolysis (half-life = 1-4 hours) and plant uptake. The major photometabolites include <b>imidacloprid</b> desnitro, <b>imidacloprid</b> olefine, <b>imidacloprid</b> urea, and five minor metabolites. The end product of photodegradation is chloronicotinic acid (CNA) and ultimately carbon dioxide. Since <b>imidacloprid</b> has a low vapor pressure, it normally does not volatilize readily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Imidacloprid</b> is {{effective}} against sucking insects, some chewing insects, soil insects and fleas on domestic animals. It is systemic with particular efficacy against sucking insects {{and has a}} long residual activity. <b>Imidacloprid</b> {{can be added to}} the water used to irrigate plants. Controlled release formulations of <b>imidacloprid</b> take 2-10 days to release 50% of <b>imidacloprid</b> in water.It is applied against soil pests, seed, timber and animal pests as well as foliar treatments.|$|E
50|$|No {{studies have}} been {{published}} involving human subjects chronically exposed to <b>imidacloprid.</b> Effects of <b>imidacloprid</b> on {{human health and the}} environment depend on how much <b>imidacloprid</b> is present and the length and frequency of exposure. Effects also depend on the health of a person and/or certain environmental factors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Imidacloprid</b> {{was first}} {{registered}} in the United Kingdom in 1993 and in the United States and France in 1994. [...] In {{the mid to late}} 1990s, French beekeepers reported a significant loss of bees, which they attributed to the use of <b>imidacloprid.</b> In 1999, the French Minister of Agriculture suspended the use of <b>imidacloprid</b> on sunflower seeds and appointed a team of expert scientists to examine the impact of <b>imidacloprid</b> on bees. In 2003, this panel, referred to as the Comité Scientifique et Technique (CST, or Scientific and Technical Committee) issued a 108-page report, which concluded that <b>imidacloprid</b> poses a significant risk to bees. [...] In 2004, the French Minister of Agriculture suspended the use of <b>imidacloprid</b> as a seed treatment for maize (corn). Despite these bans, colony collapse disorder still is occurring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Imidacloprid</b> {{has been}} shown to turn off some genes that some rice {{varieties}} use to produce defensive chemicals. While <b>imidacloprid</b> is used for control of the brown planthopper and other rice pests, there is evidence that <b>imidacloprid</b> actually increases the susceptibility of the rice plant to planthopper infestation and attacks.|$|E
50|$|In France, {{sunflower}} {{and corn}} seed treatment with <b>imidacloprid</b> are suspended; <b>imidacloprid</b> seed treatment for sugar beets and cereals are allowed, as is foliar use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Imidacloprid</b> is a nicotine-derived {{systemic}} insecticide, {{belonging to}} a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids. Although it is off patent, the primary producer of <b>imidacloprid</b> is the German chemical firm Bayer CropScience. The trade names for <b>imidacloprid</b> include Gaucho, Admire, Merit, Advantage, Confidor, Provado, and Winner. <b>Imidacloprid</b> is a neurotoxin that is selectively toxic to insects relative to vertebrates and most non-insect invertebrates. It acts as an agonist on the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of motor neurones in insects. This interaction results in convulsions, paralysis, and eventually death of the poisoned insect. It is effective on contact and via stomach action. Because <b>imidacloprid</b> binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is selectively more toxic to insects than mammals. As a systemic pesticide, <b>imidacloprid</b> translocates or moves readily in the xylem of plants from the soil into the leaves, fruit, flowers, pollen, nectar, and guttation fluid of plants. Bees may be exposed to <b>imidacloprid</b> when they feed on the nectar, pollen, and guttation fluid of imidacloprid-treated plants.|$|E
50|$|Bayer CropScience {{studies show}} that the maximum dose of <b>imidacloprid</b> for which no adverse effects were {{observed}} in bees is 20 ppb. Since Bayer claims that residue levels are usually below 5 ppb in pollen and nectar, they contend that <b>imidacloprid</b> poses a negligible risk to bees. Nevertheless, Armengaud et al observed that <b>imidacloprid</b> 10-8M decreased bee brain metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Neonicotinoid is {{a family}} of {{insecticides}} which cause interference and blockage of the nicotinergic pathway in {{the central nervous system}} of insects. <b>Imidacloprid</b> is part of the neonictinoid family and has been used to control population of L. lineolaris. Previously, a study has been conducted to examine the resistance developed by the TPB to <b>imidacloprid.</b> The results of the study indicated that there were changes in gene expression which was related to resistance of <b>imidacloprid.</b> There was an over-expression of P450 and estrase genes which the researchers connected to <b>imidacloprid</b> resistance by L. lineolaris.|$|E
50|$|According to {{standards}} set by the environmental ministry of Canada, if used correctly (at recommended rates, without irrigation, and when heavy rainfall is not predicted), <b>imidacloprid</b> does not characteristically leach into the deeper soil layers despite its high water solubility (Rouchaud et al. 1994; Tomlin 2000; Krohn and Hellpointner 2002). In a series of field trials conducted by Rouchaud et al. (1994, 1996), in which <b>imidacloprid</b> was applied to sugar beet plots, it was consistently demonstrated that no detectable leaching of <b>imidacloprid</b> to the 10-20 cm soil layer occurred. <b>Imidacloprid</b> was applied to a corn field in Minnesota, and no <b>imidacloprid</b> residues were found in sample column segments below the 0-15.2 cm depth segment (Rice et al. 1991, as reviewed in Mulye 1995).|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with <b>imidacloprid</b> contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with <b>imidacloprid</b> suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of <b>imidacloprid</b> in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. <b>Imidacloprid</b> in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of <b>imidacloprid</b> in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>imidacloprid</b> {{breaks down}} rapidly in {{water in the}} {{presence}} of light, it remains persistent in water in the absence of light. It has a water solubility of [...]61 g/L, which is relatively high. In the dark, at pH between 5 and 7, it breaks down very slowly, and at pH 9, the half-life is about 1 year. In soil under aerobic conditions, <b>imidacloprid</b> is persistent with a half-life of the order of 1-3 years. On the soil surface the half-life is 39 days. Major soil metabolites include <b>imidacloprid</b> nitrosimine, <b>imidacloprid</b> desnitro and <b>imidacloprid</b> urea, which ultimately degrade to 6-chloronicotinic acid, CO2, and bound residues. 6-Chloronicotinic acid is recently shown to be mineralized via a nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) pathway in a soil bacterium.|$|E
