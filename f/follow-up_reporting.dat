30|$|To {{take into}} account the growth in {{international}} travel and trade, to which one can add changes in environmental conditions—including climate change—impacting on vector-borne diseases, in 2005, WHO revised its International Health Regulations (IHR), which entered into force in 2007 (WHO 2005). In addition to the notifiable diseases, these call for any event of potential international public health concern to be declared, including those of unknown causes or sources and those involving events or diseases other than those listed, if the public health impact is serious. The IHR are thus no longer restricted to a specific set of infectious diseases. According to WHO, with <b>follow-up</b> <b>reporting</b> in 2014, only 64 nations (33 %) reported that they had fully implemented the IHR. The other 67 % of the nations either requested another 2 -year extension (81) or reported nothing at all (48) (Katz and Dowell 2015).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This review {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the effectiveness of}} reconstructive procedures for treating peri-implantitis. Searches of electronic databases and cross-referencing were performed for human comparative clinical trials with ≥ 10 implants for ≥ 12 months of <b>follow-up,</b> <b>reporting</b> radiographic defect fill {{and at least one}} of the following parameters: probing depth reduction, clinical attachment level gain, bleeding on probing reduction, and mucosal recession. The searches retrieved 430 citations. Only 1 randomized controlled trial was identified, which compared reconstructive therapy and open flap debridement. Case series studies were also included to evaluate the overall performance of the reconstructive procedures. Twelve studies were finally included. Meta-analysis revealed that the weighted mean radiographic defect fill was 2. 17 mm (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 46 - 2. 87 mm), probing depth reduction was 2. 97 mm (95 % CI: 2. 38 - 3. 56 mm), clinical attachment level gai...|$|E
30|$|Although UGN {{was first}} {{demonstrated}} under fluoroscopy control by Comfort et al. [47], it was Farin et al. [33] who described use of US for bursal lavage and needling. Since then, {{it has been}} a commonly used intervention, as it is inexpensive and can be carried out on an out-patient basis under local anaesthesia (Fig. 1 c). Gonzalez et al.

A recent systemic review of literature [50] for the efficacy of UGN in CT concluded that, due to the variation in studies and the low quality of evidence, the efficacy of UGN could not be firmly established and additional high-quality studies are required.|$|E

30|$|For the {{systematic}} review, two authors independently assessed {{the quality of}} the included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool [28] with a priori formulated criteria adopted from the studies of Pas et al. [29] and Winters et al. [30]. Five domains of bias were appraised: selection bias (random allocation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of personnel and participants), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (loss to <b>follow-up),</b> <b>reporting</b> bias (outcome reporting), and other biases. Each item was scored as low (+), high (−), or unclear (?) risk of bias. Studies were considered low risk of bias when all domains were scored as low risk of bias or if one item was scored as high risk or unable to determine. If two domains were scored as high or unable to determine risk of bias, the study received a moderate risk of bias. Finally, when more than two domains were scored as high risk of bias, the study was regarded to possess a high risk of bias. In case of disagreement between authors, consensus was sought during a consensus meeting. If no consensus was reached, a third author was asked to provide a final verdict. Publication bias was determined for the meta-analysis using an approach where differences in baseline assessments were checked for all intervention groups. Next, the interventions were divided into non-significant (p[*]>[*] 0.05) or significant (p[*]<[*] 0.05) results to determine the percentage of interventions with non-significant differences (these procedures were followed as per another meta-analysis) [23].|$|E

40|$|Background: The optimal type {{of bearing}} for hip {{arthroplasty}} remains a matter of debate. Ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP) bearings are frequently used in younger and more active patients to reduce wear and increase biocompatibility compared to Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) bearings. However, in comparison to metal heads, the fracture risk of ceramic heads is higher. In addition, ceramic head fractures pose a serious complication which often necessitates major revision surgery. To date, there are no long-term data (> 20 years of <b>follow-up)</b> <b>reporting</b> fracture rates of the ceramic femoral heads in CoP bearings. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate long-term CoP fracture rate. Methods: We evaluated the clinical and radiographic results of 348 cementless THAs treated with 2 nd generation Biolox ® Al 2 O 3 Ceramic-on-Polyethylene (CoP) bearings consecutively implanted between January 1985 and December 1989. The mean age at implantation was 57 years. The patients were followed for a minimum of 20 years. At the final 111 had died, and 5 were lost to follow-up. The cumulative incidence of ceramic head fractures in the long-term was estimated using a competing risk analysis. Results: The cumulative incidence of ceramic head fracture after 22 -years was estimated with a competing risk analysis at 0. 29 % after 22 -years (SE = 2. 09 %; 95 %- CI: 0. 03 - 1. 5 %). The radiographic analysis revealed no impending failures at final follow-up. Discussion/Conclusion: The fracture rate of second-generation ceramic heads using a CoP articulation remains very low into the third decade after cementless THA...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Rehabilitation {{following}} hip arthroscopy is {{an integral}} component of the clinical outcome of the procedure. Given the increase in quantity, complexity, and diversity of procedures performed, a need exists to define the role of rehabilitation following hip arthroscopy. OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine the current rehabilitation protocols utilized following hip arthroscopy in the current literature, 2) to determine if clinical outcomes are significantly different based on different post-operative rehabilitation protocols; and 3) to propose the best-available evidence-based rehabilitation program following hip arthroscopy. DATA SOURCES: Per PRISMA guidelines and checklist, Medline, SciVerse Scopus, SportDiscus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Level I-IV evidence clinical studies with minimum two-year <b>follow-up</b> <b>reporting</b> outcomes of hip arthroscopy with post-operative rehabilitation protocols described were included. DATA EXTRACTION: All study, subject, and surgery parameters were collected. All elements of rehabilitation were extracted and analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Study methodological quality was analyzed using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS). RESULTS: 18 studies were included (2, 092 subjects; 52 % male, mean age 35. 1 +/- 10. 6 years, mean follow-up 3. 2 +/- 1. 0 years). Labral tear and femoroacetabular impingement were the most common diagnoses treated and labral debridement and femoral/acetabular osteochondroplasty the most common surgical techniques performed. Rehabilitation protocol parameters (weight-bearing, motion, strengthening, and return-to-sport) were poorly reported. Differences in clinical outcomes were unable to be assessed given heterogeneity in study reporting. Time-, phase-, goal-, and precaution-based guidelines were extracted and reported. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature of hip arthroscopy rehabilitation lacks high-quality evidence to support a speci...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesModel-based {{cost-effectiveness}} analyses support decision-making. To augment model credibility, evaluation via {{comparison to}} independent, empirical studies is recommended. MethodsWe developed a structured reporting format for model evaluation and conducted a structured literature review to characterize current model evaluation recommendations and practices. As an illustration, we applied the reporting format {{to evaluate a}} microsimulation of human papillomavirus and cervical cancer. The model's outputs and uncertainty ranges were compared with multiple outcomes from a study of long-term progression from high-grade precancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]) to cancer. Outcomes included 5 to 30 -year cumulative cancer risk among women with and without appropriate CIN treatment. Consistency was measured by model ranges overlapping study confidence intervals. ResultsThe structured reporting format included: matching baseline characteristics and <b>follow-up,</b> <b>reporting</b> model and study uncertainty, and stating metrics of consistency for model and study results. Structured searches yielded 2963 articles with 67 meeting inclusion criteria and found variation in how current model evaluations are reported. Evaluation of the cervical cancer microsimulation, reported using the proposed format, showed a modeled cumulative risk of invasive cancer for inadequately treated women of 39. 6 % (30. 9 – 49. 7) at 30 years, compared with the study: 37. 5 % (28. 4 – 48. 3). For appropriately treated women, modeled risks were 1. 0 % (0. 7 – 1. 3) at 30 years, study: 1. 5 % (0. 4 – 3. 3). ConclusionsTo support external and projective validity, cost-effectiveness models should be iteratively evaluated as new studies become available, with reporting standardized to facilitate assessment. Such evaluations are particularly relevant for models used to conduct comparative effectiveness analyses...|$|E
