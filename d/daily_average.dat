5|$|SR410 {{begins as}} a freeway at an {{interchange}} with SR167 near Downtown Sumner. The highway travels southeast across suburban areas, crossing the Stuck River and passing a partial cloverleaf interchange with Linden Drive, also named Traffic Avenue. After a second partial cloverleaf interchange with Thompson Avenue, SR410 goes under a railroad trestle owned by BNSF Railway and used by Amtrak's Cascades rail service, near the northern bank of the Puyallup River. After turning northeast, SR410 encounters the western terminus of SR162 {{by way of a}} diamond interchange. SR162 travels north into Downtown Sumner as Valley Avenue and south over the Puyallup River towards Orting. The freeway section near the interchange was the busiest recorded part of SR410 in 2008 with a <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> of 59,000motorists using the freeway.

5|$|US2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for {{the first}} time north of {{downtown}} Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, over the state line that runs along the Montreal River. The highway crosses the river into Gogebic County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown. Running along Cloverland Drive, US2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. US2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of Bessemer. While bypassing the community of Ramsay, the highway crosses a branch of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield {{on the south side of}} Sunday Lake, meeting M‑28 at a stoplight in town. As the US Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the Presque Isle River. US2 and M‑64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the Presque Isle in the community of Marenisco. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) recorded a <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> usage along the stretch of 770vehicles, compared to the overall average of 5,188vehicles for the highway.

In this thesis a short informational overview of remote sensing, a description of EUMETSAT, satellites, which it used, its part CM- SAF and a search retrieval of current research is given at first. Then the study is focused on the cloud satellite products, especially on CFC (cloud fractional cover) and CTY (cloud type) products. Data sets of <b>daily</b> <b>averages</b> of these products are compared with the <b>daily</b> <b>averages</b> created from the surface SYNOP observations of the total cloud cover and cloud type in the area of the Czech Republic. In the case of big variances between the two examined datasets of <b>daily</b> <b>averaged</b> cloud coverage, possible causes like the sampling error, dependence on season, localization of the station and the elevation and type of cloudiness, are searched.

40|$|The present studies {{examined}} the relationship between fasting blood glucose and Hb A 1 c in C 57 BL/ 6 J, DBA/ 2 J, and KK/HlJ mice with and without diabetes mellitus. <b>Daily</b> <b>averaged</b> blood glucose levels based on continuous glucose monitoring and effects of 6 -h vs. overnight fasting on blood glucose were determined. <b>Daily</b> <b>averaged</b> blood glucose levels were highly correlated with Hb A 1 c, as determined with a hand-held automated device using an immunodetection method. R 2 values were 0. 90, 0. 95, and 0. 99 in KK/HIJ, C 57 BL/ 6 J, and DBA/ 2 J, respectively. Six-hour fasting blood glucose correlated more closely with the level of <b>daily</b> <b>averaged</b> blood glucose and with Hb A 1 c than did blood glucose following an overnight fast. To validate the immunoassay-determined Hb A 1 c, we also measured total glycosylated hemoglobin using boronate HPLC. Hb A 1 c values correlated well with total glycosylated hemoglobin in all three strains but were relatively lower than total glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic DBA/ 2 J mice. These results show that 6 -h fasting glucose provides a superior index of glycemic control and correlates more closely with Hb A 1 c than overnight-fasted blood glucose in these strains of mice...|$|R

The rise in tonnage demonstrates the collapse of the transport network, which meant raw materials could not be transported or moved effectively from the mineheads to the factories. It is estimated that production fell by 22 percent between May 1944 and January 1945. Of this reduction, some 50–60% of this was due to attacks on transportation.|$|E
