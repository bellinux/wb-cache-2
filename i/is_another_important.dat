5|$|The National Museum of Transylvanian History <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> {{museum in}} Cluj-Napoca, {{containing}} {{a collection of}} artefacts detailing Romanian history and culture from prehistoric times, the Dacian era, medieval times and the modern era. Moreover, the city also preserves a Historic Collection of the Pharmacy, {{in the building of}} the its first pharmacy (16th century), the Hintz House.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's most {{important}} economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely {{of the production}} of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%). Exported services amount {{to a third of}} exports. The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and international organisations – <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> industry for Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|The service {{industry}} {{is the largest}} economic contributor in South Dakota. This sector includes the retail, finance, and health care industries. Citibank, which was the largest bank holding company in the United States at one time, established national banking operations in South Dakota in 1981 {{to take advantage of}} favorable banking regulations. Government spending <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> segment of the state's economy, providing over ten percent of the gross state product. Ellsworth Air Force Base, near Rapid City, is the second-largest single employer in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aziridines from imines <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> {{application of the}} Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from oxaziridines. Though less widely applied, the reaction has a similar substrate scope and functional group tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent. The examples shown below are representative; in the latter, an aziridine forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding amine.|$|E
5|$|Chemical defense <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> defense {{found among}} species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, {{such as the}} monarch butterfly. They obtain their {{toxicity}} by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E

5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Indo-Caribbean {{music plays}} {{a vital role}} in various annual festivals like the springtime phagwa, where chowtal is {{traditionally}} performed competitively and in teams. Indo-Caribbean Shia Muslims celebrate Hosay (Muharram) with floats accompanied by barrel drums called tassa. Wedding music <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> part of Indo-Caribbean music, and is dominated by tan singing. Tan singing is accompanied by the dholak drum and dhantal, and sometimes includes verbal duels influenced by picong. Indo-Caribbean popular music gained international attention in the late 1980s, with the rise of chutney music. Chutney is a dance music, in its modern form accompanied by soca instrumentation, such as synthesizers and pressure drums. This style is called chutney-soca.|$|E
5|$|Mangalore United is a Mangalore-based Karnataka Premier League (KPL) {{franchise}} {{owned by}} Fiza Developers. Mangalore Premier League (MPL) is a cricket tournament {{organized by the}} Karnataka Regional Cricket Academy. The Central Maidan or Nehru Maidan in Mangalore <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> venue hosting domestic tournaments and many inter-school and collegiate tournaments. The Mangalore Sports Club (MSC) is a popular organisation {{in the city and}} has been elected as the institutional member for the Mangalore Zone of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA). Lokesh Rahul, commonly known as KL Rahul and Budhi Kunderan, a former Indian wicket keeper was from Mangalore. Ravi Shastri, who represented India for several years in international cricket as an all-rounder and captained the team, is of Mangalorean descent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>important</b> {{figure in}} the {{development}} of art psychology was Wilhelm Worringer, who provided some of the earliest theoretical justification for expressionist art. The Psychology of Art (1925) by Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) <b>is</b> <b>another</b> classical work. Richard Müller-Freienfels <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> early theorist.|$|R
5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> {{geographic}} factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E
5|$|Fire <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> {{element in}} the {{maintenance}} of the Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} 14 missions in which the player plays as Joanna Dark. Each mission provides a number of objectives that the player has to complete to progress. To successfully clear a mission, the player must complete all primary objectives, and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player will have to start the level again. The missions also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, a device called Datathief allows the player to hack into electronic devices, while another called Loctopus {{can be used to}} open locked doors. Stealth <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>important</b> element of the gameplay, as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by sneaking up behind them. Unlike the original Perfect Dark, every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint. However, checkpoints are removed as the player plays through a higher difficulty. There are four difficulty settings through which a mission can be played: Agent, Secret Agent, Perfect Agent, and an extra one called Dark Agent, which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent. As the player plays on higher difficulties, the game adds more objectives and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge.|$|E
