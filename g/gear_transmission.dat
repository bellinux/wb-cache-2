5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face <b>gear</b> <b>transmission</b> to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E

The purpose of this work is to propose a design methodology for the kinematic design of automatic <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> with planetary <b>gear</b> trains for bicycles.

5000|$|Toyota's HSD system replaces {{a normal}} <b>geared</b> <b>transmission</b> with an {{electromechanical}} system. An {{internal combustion engine}} (ICE) delivers power most efficiently over a small speed range, but the wheels need to be driven over the vehicle's full speed range. In a conventional automobile the <b>geared</b> <b>transmission</b> delivers different discrete engine speed-torque power requirements to the wheels. <b>Geared</b> <b>transmissions</b> may be manual, with a clutch, or automatic, with a torque converter, but both allow the engine and the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The driver can adjust the speed and torque delivered by the engine with the accelerator and the transmission mechanically transmits {{nearly all of the}} available power to the wheels which rotate at a different rate than the engine, by a factor equal to the gear ratio for the currently selected gear. However, there are a limited number of [...] "gears" [...] or gear ratios that the driver can choose from, typically four to six. This limited gear-ratio set forces the engine crankshaft to rotate at speeds where the ICE is less efficient, i.e., where a liter of fuel produces fewer joules. Optimal engine speed-torque requirements for different vehicle driving and acceleration conditions can be gauged by limiting either tachometer RPM rate or engine noise in comparison with actual speed. When an engine is required to operate efficiently across a broad RPM range, due to its coupling to a <b>geared</b> <b>transmission,</b> manufacturers are limited in their options for improving engine efficiency, reliability, or lifespan, as well as reducing the size or weight of the engine. This is why the engine for an engine-generator is often much smaller, more efficient, more reliable, and longer life than one designed for an automobile or other variable speed application.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 6 th May 2018. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. The dynamic {{behavior}} of <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> poses several challenges {{from the standpoint}} of design and requires the availability of more advanced models capable of simulating a wide range of operating conditions. In this paper, several formulations to represent efforts related to the lubricant in <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> subjected to reduced torque levels has been assessed. Under these conditions, the lubrication regime is hydrodynamic and the dynamic behavior of the meshing contacts can happen in different scenarios depending on both the lubricant properties and operating conditions. Such problems are cumbersome in <b>gear</b> <b>transmissions</b> in which acoustic performance is a determining design factor, such as in car applications. In this regard, gear rattle is one of the subjects of concern by powertrain designers. In spite of several authors have approached this phenomena, the most recent interest is focused on the role played by the lubricant. The variety of fundamentals and aims of the developed models in this respect requires {{a better understanding of the}} effect taken into account by the different formulations in the accurate modeling of hydrodynamic lubrication in gears subjected to low torques. This is the reason why, in this work, several alternatives currently available in the literature to address the formulation of efforts in hydrodynamic regime was collected and presented. Such formulations were implemented in a transmission model previously developed by the authors which was used to simulate different operating conditions in order to assess the results obtained with each one of the considered formulations...|$|R
