5|$|Megalodon {{inhabited}} a {{wide range}} of marine environments (i.e., shallow coastal waters, areas of coastal upwelling, swampy coastal lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and exhibited a transient lifestyle.

Megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E
