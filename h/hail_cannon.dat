5000|$|There is also {{reason to}} doubt the {{efficacy}} of <b>hail</b> <b>cannons</b> from a theoretical perspective. For example, thunder {{is a much more}} powerful sonic wave, and is usually found in the same storms that generate hail, yet it doesn't seem to disturb the growth of hailstones. Charles Knight, a cloud physicist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado said in a July 10, 2008 newspaper article that [...] "I don't find anyone in the scientific community who would validate <b>hail</b> <b>cannons,</b> but there are believers in all sorts of things. It would be very hard to prove they don't work, weather being as unpredictable as it is." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was {{developing}} an advocacy program for hail cannons use in agricultural practices. The project was initiated to help farmers promote <b>hail</b> <b>cannon</b> usage within communities, so the farmer may protect their crops from hail damage. In order to capture {{a wide array of}} opinions, farmers throughout Kings, Tulare and Fresno counties completed a questionnaire to give background on current problems and statistics regarding hail cannons. An advocacy strategy was given to provide guidance for farmers to promote hail cannons. By utilizing the <b>hail</b> <b>cannon</b> advocacy strategy, farmers should notice their communities are more accepting of <b>hail</b> <b>cannon</b> use and be able to continue using hail cannons in the future...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hail {{suppression}} is {{an uncertain}} meteorological subject in premature agricultural servitude. Commonly known is {{the method of}} seeding menacing cumulonimbus clouds with silver iodide by means of rockets or aircraft flares. Less discussed but widely practised alternatives are also reviewed here, in particular the useless but still quite popular practice to attempt destroying hailstones with explosives or with sound blasts from so-called <b>hail</b> <b>cannons.</b> The {{state of the art}} of hail formation detection with radar, and of hailfall probability nowcasting, is briefly reviewed.

50|$|These assaults {{were not}} made simultaneously, however, {{allowing}} the guns of Fort Davidson to be directed at each Confederate unit in turn. Just one brigade actually reached the fort itself, under a withering <b>hail</b> of <b>cannon</b> and musket fire, {{only to find the}} earthworks too steep to climb. During the assault, Union defenders were given hand grenades from the fort's magazines; these wood-finned impact devices were tossed over the walls, forcing the Rebels to break off their attack. The disorganized Southerners fell back and prepared to assault the fort again the following day.|$|R
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{also saw}} {{action at the}} Battle of Mallavelly in March 1799 {{and went on to}} form part of the storming party at the Siege of Seringapatam in April 1799 during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. It subsequently saw action at skirmishes in spring 1803 during the First Anglo-Maratha War and went on to fight at the Battle of Assaye in April 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War: at Assaye the regiment suffered terrible losses under a <b>hail</b> of <b>cannon</b> fire. From a strength of about 500, the 74th lost ten officers killed and seven wounded, and 124 other ranks killed and 270 wounded. The regiment went to fight at the Battle of Argaon in November 1803 and the Capture of Gawilghur in December 1803. It returned to England in February 1806 and then lost its Highland status due to recruiting difficulties, becoming the 74th Regiment of Foot in April 1809.|$|R
25|$|The President of the United States of America, {{under the}} {{provisions}} of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Air Force) to Captain Ralph Sherman Parr, United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Pilot of an F-86 type aircraft of the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, in action against enemy forces in the Republic of Korea on 30 June 1953. On that date, while leading a formation of two F-86 type aircraft on a combat air patrol deep in enemy territory, Captain Parr was attacked by a formation of ten enemy MIGs. Exhibiting superb airmanship and extraordinary gallantry, Captain Parr positioned himself on the attackers. Despite the imminent threat from the <b>hail</b> of <b>cannon</b> fire from behind, Captain Parr selected his target, and with a long burst from his guns, destroyed one of the enemy MIGs. Against superior numbers of enemy aircraft, Captain Parr, although under a continual <b>hail</b> of enemy <b>cannon</b> fire, and with complete disregard for his personal safety, again valiantly counter-attacked another of the threatening aircraft. Utilizing extraordinary flying skill, Captain Parr tenaciously followed the enemy through a series of violent, evasive maneuvers until he gained the advantage and scored multiple hits on the MiG, causing it to burst into flame. While turning to move to surprise another of the enemy aircraft, Captain Parr broke off his attack to answer a call of distress from a friendly aircraft. Although dangerously low on fuel, Captain Parr, at great risk to his life, provided aggressive and determined protection for the distressed friendly aircraft, escorting it safely back to base. Captain Parr's keen flying skill in turning the tide of battle despite overwhelming odds and his high personal courage in protecting a fellow pilot evidenced conspicuous gallantry in action, and reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces and the United States Air Force.|$|R
