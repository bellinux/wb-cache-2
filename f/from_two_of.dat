5|$|Back to Basics: Live and Down Under is {{the fourth}} video album by American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera. It premiered on {{television}} on January 26, 2008 on VH1, and was released on DVD on February 4, 2008, by RCA Records.

5|$|His {{subjects}} resented {{paying taxes}} that were spent on his mistresses and their children, {{many of whom}} received dukedoms or earldoms. The present Dukes of Buccleuch, Richmond, Grafton and St Albans descend from Charles in unbroken male line. Diana, Princess of Wales, was descended <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Charles's illegitimate sons: the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond. Diana's son, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, second in line to the British throne, {{is likely to be}} the first British monarch descended from Charles II.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1914, Spalato was decommissioned, {{as she was}} by {{this time}} in very poor condition. After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, she was stationed as a guard ship outside Pola from 15 April 1914 to 24 May 1915. At some point in 1915, most of her guns were removed, apart <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the 12cm guns and the four 47mm QF guns. With Austria-Hungary's defeat, the Allies seized most of the Austro-Hungarian fleet as war prizes, and Spalato was allocated to Italy, which scrapped her thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Since no {{consensus}} could be reached, the committee {{decided to put}} these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the three proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf planet and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers {{taking part in the}} ballot.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play the flute. They recognize that while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, England were outplayed by Spain but {{got through}} to a penalty shootout after a goalless draw. Shearer scored the first England penalty, while the Spaniards failed to score <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> theirs, sending England into the semi-final against Germany. Shearer headed England into the lead after three minutes, but the Germans quickly {{equalised}} and the match went to penalties again. This time, Germany won from the spot; although Shearer scored, his teammate Gareth Southgate missed his kick and England were eliminated. Shearer's fivegoals made him the competition's top scorer, and together with teammates David Seaman and Steve McManaman, was listed in the official UEFA team of the tournament.|$|E

25|$|The Sheffield Supertram {{network is}} {{organised}} around Park Square and comprises three lines. The lines, with termini at Meadowhall Interchange, Halfway and Hillsborough, all serve Sheffield city centre and meet at Park Square where a triangular junction was constructed to provide interchange between lines and operational flexibility. Two small branches serving Malin Bridge, from Hillsborough Interchange, and Herdings Park branch out <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the main lines.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{is associated with}} a number of the region's museums and galleries, including the Great North Museum project, which is primarily based at the world-renowned Hancock Museum. The Great North Museum: Hancock also contains collections <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the university's other museums, the Shefton Museum and the Museum of Antiquities. The university's Hatton Gallery is also a part of the Great North Museum project, and remains within the Fine Art Building.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, on the {{retirement}} of Sir Edward Kay, L.J., {{he was promoted to}} the Court of Appeal. There he added to his reputation as a lawyer and a judge, proving that he possessed considerable knowledge of the common law as well as of equity. He married in 1858 Clara Jessie, daughter of Chief Baron Pollock, leaving children who could claim descent <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the best-known English legal families of the 19th century.|$|E

Her father left the family when she was four, and in 1988 her mother married builder Paul Price, after which she acquired the surname Price. <b>From</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> her mother's other marriages, she has an older half-brother named Daniel and a younger half-sister named Sophie. Her maternal grandmother was Jewish, but she is not religious.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{damaged or}} {{destroyed}} a number of UNRWA facilities claiming that they were used for war purposes and thus legitimate targets. According to a UN report, Israel struck seven Gaza shelters, which led to at least 44 Palestinians killed and at least 227 injured. It also said Palestinian groups stored weapons in three schools and likely fired rockets <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them. UN Sec Gen Ban Ki Moon condemned the use of shelters as a weapons depot.|$|E
25|$|In service, the Tennessees {{went through}} less {{refitting}} than the Pennsylvanias, as many features retrofitted to the latter, such as automatic ammunition hoist structures and longitudinal turret bulkheads, {{had already been}} built into the former from the outset. Their power plants were standardized, with Babcock & Wilcox boilers instead of the less reliable Niclausse {{that had to be}} removed <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the Pennsylvanias. Also, since the Tennessees were commissioned up to three years after the first units of the Pennsylvania class, they reached obsolescence earlier in their careers.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Linz-Urfahr on 17 May 1809 saw {{soldiers}} from the Austrian Empire fighting against troops <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Napoleon's allies, the Kingdom of Württemberg and the Kingdom of Saxony. An Austrian corps led by Feldzeugmeister Johann Kollowrat attacked General of Division Dominique Vandamme's Württembergers who held a fortified bridgehead on the north bank of the Danube opposite the city of Linz. As the combat got underway, Saxons led by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte began reinforcing the defenders. This prompted Kollowrat to order a retreat, which was followed up by Napoleon's German allies.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{high command}} was {{concerned}} about this development and took steps to reinforce the Army of Tennessee. General Joseph E. Johnston's army dispatched on loan two weak divisions (about 9,000 men) from Mississippi under Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge and Maj. Gen. William H. T. Walker by September 4, and General Robert E. Lee dispatched a corps under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet from the Army of Northern Virginia. Only five brigades (about 5,000 effectives) <b>from</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Longstreet's divisions arrived {{in time for the}} second day of the Battle of Chickamauga on September 20.|$|E

Abramoff was reimbursed by The National Center for Public Policy Research, the nonprofit organization that arranged the trip.
