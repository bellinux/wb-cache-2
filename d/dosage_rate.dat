40|$|Objective: High {{ketanserin}} {{levels are}} found in the umbilical cord after maternal treatment. However, the effect on the circulation of the neonate has never been investigated. Study design: A prospective, observational study was performed at the neonate ward at the Medical Centre Leeuwarden, The Netherlands. All neonates exposed in utero to ketanserin administered to the mother, from May 2007 to December 2009 (n = 58), were included. We studied the effect of ketanserin exposure on the circulation of the neonate, by monitoring heart rate and blood pressure during the first 24 h of life. Non-parametric as well as parametric tests were used to analyze the effect of gestational age, birth weight, gender, various ketanserin factors (cumulative dosage, duration of therapy and last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate),</b> other maternal drug use and maternal diagnosis on the blood pressure of the neonate. Results: Eight neonates became hypotensive during the first 8 h of life (13. 8 %). The last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> as well as the mean <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> (cumulative dosage divided by duration of therapy in hours) were significantly higher in the group with hypotension (P=. 005 and P=. 002, respectively). All hypotensive neonates were exposed to a last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of at least 8 mg/h. Maternal HELLP syndrome was diagnosed more often in hypotensive compared to normotensive neonates (P=. 048). Conclusion: In utero exposure to ketanserin lowers the blood pressure of the neonate. The risk of hypotension is associated with the last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of maternal ketanserin treatment and the coexistence of maternal HELLP syndrome. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Background As the {{etiology}} of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy remains unclear, treatment is directed at lowering blood pressure and preventing complications for mother and child. Ketanserin, a selective serononin 2 -receptor antagonist, is an antihypertensive agent used {{for the treatment of}} severe hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. There is evidence of transplacental transmission of ketanserin. The high concentration found in umbilical cord blood and long half-life time of ketanserin in infants, suggest pharmaceutical effects in infants. Research directed at the effect of ketanserin on the infant is lacking. By this study we aimed to analyze the effect of ketanserin exposure on the circulation of the infant. Methods From May, 2007, through December, 2009, we prospectively studied 57 infants admitted to the high care of our secondary hospital because of in utero exposure to ketanserin. We used 15 values of blood pressure and heart rate recorded during the first day of life. We analyzed the effect of gestational age, birth weight, gender, ketanserin aspects (cumulative dosage, duration of therapy, last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate),</b> maternal diagnosis and other maternal drug use on blood pressure of the infant and the occurrence of hypotension. Results A total of 12. 3 % of our study population became hypotensive during the first day of life with need for treatment. All of these infants had been in utero exposed to a last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of 8 mg/hour or higher. Maternal HELLP-syndrome was related to hypotension of the infant. Last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> and mean <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of ketanserin were negatively correlated with blood pressure and associated with hypotension. In hypotensive infants, blood pressure dysregulation started in the first eight hours after delivery. These infants did not show a natural rise in blood pressure during delivery. Discussion This research provides evidence for the blood pressure lowering effect of ketanserin. HELLP-syndrome is the main causal factor in developing hypotension besides last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of ketanserin. Our results show that monitoring of blood pressure after delivery is only necessary when an infant is exposed to a last <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of at least 8 mg/hour or when a mother suffers from HELLP-syndrome and is treated with ketanserin. Monitoring can be shortened to 12 hours when no problems arise during the first half day of life. ...|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{growth of}} {{bio-based}} chemical {{products in the}} world market has typically been stunted due to their higher production costs as compared to crude petroleum derived products. However due to {{the rising cost of}} oil, increasing demand for environmentally friendly products from a growing population and limited amount of nonrenewable resources, growth for bio-based chemical products has increased. This market growth has propelled the number and size of bio-refineries to increase in the past 10 years. However, the rise in the cost of oil has been accompanied by soaring prices for asphalt because of reductions in its supply. This reduction is primarily due to oil refiners maximizing on the production of transportation fuels through coking. As a result, a substantial amount of binder is produced that cannot be used for production of asphalt mixtures. Warm mix asphalt occurs when mixing and compaction temperatures are lowered by 20 °C to 55 °C in the production and laydown of asphalt mix. This has also {{led to the development of}} bio-derived material additives for warm mix asphalt applications. Depending on the production process, bio-refineries can produce a sizable amount of material with surfactant characteristics. Due to surfactant characteristics, these materials can be used as a bio-based warm mix asphalt (WMA) additive technology. Within this thesis, a bio-derived material - isosorbide distillation bottoms (IDB) -was studied as a warm mix asphalt additive technology, as opposed to other commercially available additive technologies, through a thorough examination of binder rheology and mix performance with various asphalt binders. The first step of this study was to investigate binder rheology to determine the optimum <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of the IDB to various asphalt binders for use in warm mix asphalt. This part of the work resulted in an estimated <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 5 % by weight of the total binder. Then, the additive was blended at the recommended <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 5 % to create binders for use in mix production. Warm mix asphalt mixtures were produced for testing at intermediate and low temperatures and compared to warm mix asphalt without an additive and with commercially available additives at the recommended <b>dosage</b> <b>rate.</b> The results showed that IDB performs statistically the same as the other commercial additives; as well as, the same as the control mix.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the susceptibility of the DFTD to vincristine. Escalating dosage rates of vincristine (0. 05 to 0. 136 mg/kg) were given to Tasmanian devils in the early stages of DFTD (n = 8). None of these dosage rates impacted the outcome of the disease. A <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 105 mg/kg, a rate significantly higher than that given in humans or domestic animals, was found to the highest <b>dosage</b> <b>rate</b> that could be administered safely.

Plasma clearance (1. 8 ml/min/kg) was slower in the Tasmanian devil than in humans, suggesting that pharmacodynamics and not pharmacokinetics explain the Tasmanian devil’s ability to tolerate high dosage rates of vincristine.

40|$|AbstractIn {{developing}} {{designs for}} engineered mixtures to improve soil with stabilizers, {{it is always}} required that the effective rate of the stabilizer be determined in the stabilization. However, {{there seems to be}} an insufficient amount of effort in the decision-making related to the accuracy and the reliability of the effective rate. This paper presents an application of a factorial experimental analysis, together with an effect size estimation, to investigate the effective <b>dosage</b> <b>rates</b> of bottom ash to improve a fine-grained soil. Unconfined compression tests have been conducted to measure the strength parameters considered in the mixtures of soil+bottom ash for which the bottom ash dosages were 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 % by dry weight of the mixture. The effective <b>dosage</b> <b>rates,</b> based on the strength parameters, have been evaluated primarily by multiple comparisons and Cohen׳s d. The results indicate that while there is a significant strength development with “moderate” to “strong” sizes on the untreated soil, due to the 30 % bottom ash (p 1. 15), the strength is insignificantly changed (increased or decreased) below the 30 % dosage (p> 0. 05, Cohen׳s d≤ 0. 41). It is found from the experimental analysis that a factorial approach and an effect size estimation compare well in the decision-making. It is suggested from the results that bottom ash can be adequately added to soil in the stabilization for both improvement (i. e., at 30 % dosage) and replacement (i. e., below 30 % dosage). The proposed use of bottom ash would also be beneficial for recycling and the sustainable development of the environment...|$|R
