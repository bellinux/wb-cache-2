5|$|The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It is the 2008 third studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. After independently releasing his 2004 album Ray Ray, Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects {{and developed a}} partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic soul music and recorded The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It primarily at his North Hollywood studio with the engineer.|$|E

5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It was {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers. It sold steadily and spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching sales of 282,000 copies in the United States by May 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It received generally positive reviews from critics and {{was seen as an}} exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E

5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq and Brungardt disregarded their {{previous}} experience in recording production while making The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It. Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques {{in an attempt}} to recreate the Motown music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album draws on the Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, described it as a series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq {{promoted}} Stone Rollin with a North American spring tour, {{performing a}} series of concerts during March to June 2011. It began on March 15 at the House of Blues in Dallas and concluded on June 8 at Stubb's in Austin, Texas. Some concert dates featured electronic music duo Quadron as an opening act. The tour included performances at music festivals such as South by Southwest and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, for which Saadiq played songs from The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It and Stone Rollin, as well as unreleased material.|$|E

5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} Stone Rollin at Blakeslee Recording Company, his {{recording studio}} complex in Los Angeles, California. He spent approximately one year {{working on the}} album, including writing its music and lyrics. He worked on the album's production with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt. The two shared an interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques, which they had applied in recording The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It. However, for Stone Rollin, they sought to eschew its predecessor's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style, in keeping with Saadiq's other musical projects.|$|E
5|$|Stone Rollin expands on the {{traditional}} soul music style of his 2008 album The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> It, with exploring rhythm and blues, rock, funk, and blues styles. A widespread critical success and deemed by some reviewers as Saadiq's best work, the record was noted for its stylistic breadth, groove-based compositions, varied subject matter, and incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard. It also became Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. He supported the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011.|$|E
