She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|Nash was {{selected}} as captain of South Melbourne for the 1937 season to replace the retiring Jack Bisset, {{becoming part of the}} first father and son team to captain a VFL/AFL side. It is thought that South Melbourne's newly appointed coach Roy Cazaly influenced the selection of Nash as captain, as Cazaly, Nash's coach in Tasmania, believed Nash to be the best footballer <b>ever.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> some controversy over Nash's selection as captain, as it had been expected that vice-captain Brighton Diggins would be named captain. In response, Diggins quit South.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's final {{large-scale}} orchestral {{works were}} his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> music from another planet, this is surely it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing." [...] Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work Commotio, was premiered posthumously in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft's {{most popular}} {{book in the}} 1790s. It sold well and was {{reviewed}} positively by most critics. Godwin wrote [...] "if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears {{to me to be}} the book." [...] It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic.|$|E
500|$|In his Wisden obituary, Jardine was {{described}} as one of England's best captains, while Jack Hobbs rated him the second best captain after Percy Fender.

500|$|In March, Megadeth {{embarked}} on the Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour, {{which took place}} in North America and had support from Testament and Exodus. During the tour, Megadeth played Rust in Peace in its entirety. Prior {{to the start of the}} tour, original bassist Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. In an interview for Classic Rock, he stated that Shawn Drover contacted him, informing him that bassist LoMenzo was leaving the band, saying [...] "if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a time for you and Dave [...] to talk, now is it".|$|E
500|$|Variety did not so qualify its review. [...] " [...] one {{of those}} rare {{instances}} where none can review it, or talk about it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same breath as the actors and director." [...] Variety also praised the cast, writing that [...] "Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [...] a diabolic characterization if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly." ...|$|E
500|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft's {{most popular}} {{book in the}} 1790sâ€”it sold well and was {{reviewed}} favorably by most critics. Wollstonecraft's future husband, philosopher William Godwin, wrote: [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears {{to me to be}} the book." [...] It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic. While the book initially inspired readers to travel to Scandinavia, it failed to retain its popularity after the publication of Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1798, which revealed Wollstonecraft's unorthodox private life.|$|E

500|$|Herriman died in {{his sleep}} in his home near Hollywood on April 25, 1944, after a long illness. An incompletely inked penciling of a week's worth of daily strips was found on his drawing board. On his death certificate, {{the cause of death}} was listed as [...] "non-alcoholic {{cirrhosis}} of the liver", and despite his mixed-race heritage, he was listed as [...] "caucasian". The New York Journal-American ran a front-page obituary. His funeral at Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Memorial Park was attended by few. [...] Cartoonist Harry Hershfield spoke at the funeral, saying, [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a saint on earth, it was George Herriman". According to his request, his body was cremated and his remains were scattered over Monument Valley.|$|E
500|$|... "Human Nature" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a positive review, stating that [...] "for years, Madonna spoke in metaphors, fantasies and blatant shock tactics, but the performer indignantly struck {{back at her}} critics on 'Human Nature'. She didn't just hold up a mirror, she became the mirror". Barbara O'Dair from Rolling Stone also gave a positive review of the song, commenting that [...] "Madonna does a drive-by on her critics, complete with a keening synth line straight outta Dre", adding that [...] "Madonna's message is still 'Express yourself, don't repress yourself.' This time, however, it comes not with a bang but a whisper". Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 11 on his list of [...] "30 Ultimate Madonna Singles", stating that the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets" [...] was a [...] "Madonna mantra if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one".|$|E
500|$|Seltzer and the Press later {{received}} harsh {{criticism for}} their {{handling of the}} case. Federal district judge Carl A. Weinmann, in his 1964 ruling that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial, partially blamed the media, particularly the Press: [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a trial by newspaper, {{this is a perfect}} example. And the most insidious example was the Cleveland Press. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury". The United States Supreme Court ruled on June 6, 1966 in Sheppard v. Maxwell that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial because of the negative publicity he received in the press. F. Lee Bailey, one of Sheppard's lawyers, later wrote that [...] "Seltzer used his newspaper like a club, ordering politicians around like minions and intimidating everyone who disagreed with him. If Seltzer was roused, he would spread a personally penned editorial across eight columns of his newspaper, seeking to grind some unfortunate dissident under his heel".|$|E

500|$|The {{line was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics and Stefani was appreciated for taking fashion seriously {{even though she}} is a celebrity. Fern Mallis of IMG praised the line and Stefani as well and said, [...] "the L.A.M.B. line is clearly at the top of these lines and is as unique and individual as Gwen herself." [...] The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, [...] " ... these shoes aren't for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani's music and fashion - sense." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "L.A.M.B.'s embellished tracksuits, Rasta-inspired knits, and gaucho-heel combos deliver the edge" [...] Nicole Phelps of Style.com said, [...] "The collection, which looked like the sixties as seen by someone {{who grew up in the}} eighties, was altogether more wearable and on trend." [...] Fashion journalist Cathy Horyn of The New York Times differed and said, [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a reason for a pop star to concentrate on her vocal skills, it was Gwen Stefani's fashion meltdown." ...|$|E
500|$|Gradually, Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to her literary life, becoming involved with Joseph Johnson's circle again, in particular with Mary Hays, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears {{to me to be}} the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration." [...] Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, they moved into two adjoining houses, known as The Polygon, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.|$|E
500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now... if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a time when it was}} necessary to put our house in order, it is now." [...] The members of the populist Tea Party movement have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.|$|E

2500|$|One might {{question}} why labor spy agencies exist. A labor spy boss from Cleveland, who asserted c. 1920 that [...] "I own every union in this town" [...] (which {{is to say}} that he had control of the union executives), explains simply that many labor spies are ex-criminal detectives, and [...] "here's more money in industry than <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> in crime." ...|$|E
