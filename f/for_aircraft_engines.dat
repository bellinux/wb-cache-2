5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E
25|$|The NPL {{was also}} {{responsible}} for perhaps the first deliberately engineered aerospace material, Y alloy.

25|$|Unable {{to secure}} a large {{contract}} for its airplanes during the war, Benoist Aircraft began to experience financial problems by 1915. To reduce costs, Benoist moved the company first to Chicago, Illinois, and then to Sandusky, Ohio, where it affiliated with the Roberts Motor Company, which was Benoists preferred source <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines.</b> Benoist designed the Type XVI flying boat and Type XVII landplane, both of which appeared in 1916.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} Lend-Lease {{in support of}} Britain helped lift Connecticut from the Great Depression, with the state a major {{production}} center for weaponry and supplies used in World War II. Connecticut manufactured 4.1 percent of total U.S. military armaments produced during World War II, ranking ninth among the 48 states, with major factories including Colt for firearms, Pratt & Whitney <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines,</b> Chance Vought for fighter planes, Hamilton Standard for propellers, and Electric Boat for submarines and PT boats. In Bridgeport, General Electric produced a significant new weapon to combat tanks: the bazooka.|$|E
25|$|Ricardo {{worked on}} {{spark-ignition}} engines throughout his career, including pioneering work on direct injection gasoline engines <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> in the 1930s, but his best-known work {{was in the}} development of high-speed diesel engines, in particular for cars. He was responsible for designing the combustion-chamber for the first diesel car engines produced in quantity for the Citroën Rosalie in the mid-thirties. Later, various versions of Ricardo's Comet pre-combustion chamber were deployed in almost all car diesel engines over six decades, up to the mid 1990s, and the Comet remains one of Ricardo's best-known personal achievements in automobile engineering.|$|E
25|$|The Fort de Liers is one {{of twelve}} forts built {{as part of the}} fortifications of Liège in the late 19th century in Belgium. It was built between 1881 and 1884 {{according}} to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Liège. Liers was never upgraded like the other forts of Liège. It is now used as a test site <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> and is not accessible to the public.|$|E

25|$|Hangar 7 was {{the fourth}} timber framed igloo on the airfield, located some {{distance}} from the others at the end of straight six for security reasons. It became the workshops for the ATAIU, and was rectangular in plan with personnel access from centrally located skillion roofed door openings. The west end was clad with weatherboard, with a large central doorway for aircraft access. The building had corrugated iron roof sheeting with flush skylights as it had no artificial lighting. Internally it was divided by low partitions, creating separate cells for the various tasks associated with dismantling, analysing and reassembling the captured aircraft. Each cell had its own specialisation, which included workshops <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines,</b> navigation systems, radio, weapons, and body reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|The {{octane rating}} became {{important}} as the military sought higher output <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>engines</b> in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output. Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power. In 1943, the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower (984kW) using 100 RON fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement. By the time of Operation Overlord during World War II both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using 150 RON fuel (100/150 avgas), obtained by adding 2.5% aniline to 100 octane avgas. By this time the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel.|$|E

50|$|Also {{influencing}} {{the construction of}} this extension was a May 1943 request by General Douglas MacArthur for an engine overhaul capacity within Australia of 1,950 engines per month, 600 per month {{of which would be}} Allison engines.
