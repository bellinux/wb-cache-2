50|$|<b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> {{testing is}} an ASTM {{standard}} method {{of determining the}} impact resistance of materials. A pivoting arm is raised to a specific height (constant potential energy) and then released. The arm swings down hitting a notched sample, breaking the specimen. The energy absorbed by the sample is calculated from the height the arm swings to after hitting the sample. A notched sample is generally used to determine impact energy and notch sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The test {{is similar}} to the Charpy impact test but uses a {{different}} arrangement of the specimen under test. The <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> test differs from the Charpy impact test in that the sample is held in a cantilevered beam configuration as opposed to a three-point bending configuration. The test is named after the English engineer Edwin Gilbert Izod (1876-1946), who described it in his 1903 address to the British Association, subsequently published in Engineering.|$|E
30|$|When {{filler content}} {{increased}} from 2 % to 30 % at 150  μm, the <b>Izod</b> notched <b>impact</b> energy increased from 1.45 to 1.92  kJ/m. At 212  μm, it increased from 1.48 to 1.97  kJ/m. At 250  μm, it increased from 1.51 to 2.00  kJ/m. At 300  μm, it increased from 1.56 to 2.06  kJ/m. As {{the concentration of}} the filler content increased, <b>Izod</b> notched <b>impact</b> energy increased due to more energy required to propagate the crack. Izod notch {{is a measure of}} crack propagation. This is in line with that observed with wood polypropylene composites (Stark 1997).|$|R

As the figures show, there is very good agreement with the {{artificial neural network}} predictions and experimental results.|$|R
50|$|The {{toughness}} of {{a material}} {{can be measured}} using a small specimen of that material. A typical testing machine uses a pendulum to strike a notched specimen of defined cross-section and deform it. The height from which the pendulum fell, minus the height to which it rose after deforming the specimen, multiplied {{by the weight of}} the pendulum {{is a measure of the}} energy absorbed by the specimen as it was deformed during the impact with the pendulum. The Charpy and <b>Izod</b> notched <b>impact</b> strength tests are typical ASTM tests used to determine toughness.|$|R
50|$|Impact strength, is the {{capability}} of the material to withstand a suddenly applied load and is {{expressed in terms of}} energy. Often measured with the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> strength test or Charpy impact test, both of which measure the impact energy required to fracture a sample. Volume, modulus of elasticity, distribution of forces, and yield strength affect the impact strength of a material. In order for a material or object to have a high impact strength the stresses must be distributed evenly throughout the object. It also must have a large volume with a low modulus of elasticity and a high material yield strength.|$|E
50|$|Impact {{tests are}} used in {{studying}} the toughness of material. A material's toughness is a factor {{of its ability to}} absorb energy during plastic deformation. Brittle materials have low toughness {{as a result of the}} small amount of plastic deformation that they can endure. The impact value of a material can also change with temperature. Generally, at lower temperatures, the impact energy of a material is decreased. The size of the specimen may also affect the value of the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> test because it may allow a different number of imperfections in the material, which can act as stress risers and lower the impact energy.|$|E
50|$|The ASTM International {{standard}} for <b>Izod</b> <b>Impact</b> testing of plastics is ASTM D256. The results {{are expressed in}} energy lost per unit of thickness (such as ft·lb/in or J/cm) at the notch. Alternatively, the results may be reported as energy lost per unit cross-sectional area at the notch (J/m or ft·lb/in). In Europe, ISO 180 methods are used and results are based only on the cross-sectional area at the notch (J/m). The dimensions of a standard specimen for ASTM D256 are 63.5 × 12.7 × 3.2 mm (2.5 × 0.5 × 0.125 in). The most common specimen thickness is 3.2 mm, but the width can vary between 3.0 and 12.7 mm.|$|E

50|$|Cavitation {{is common}} in epoxy resins and other craze {{resistant}} toughened polymers, and is prerequisite to shearing in <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> strength testing. During the deformation and fracture of a toughened polymer, cavitation of the strained rubber particles occurs in crazing-prone and non-crazing-prone plastics, including, ABS, PVC, nylon, high impact polystyrene, and CTBN toughened epoxies. Engineers use an energy-balance approach to model how particle size and rubber modulus factors influence material toughness. Both particle size and modulus show positive correlation with brittle-tough transition temperatures. They are both shown to affect the cavitation process occurring at the crack tip process zone early in deformation, preceding large-scale crazing and shear yielding.|$|E
50|$|A Notch in {{mechanical}} and materials engineering {{refers to a}} deliberately introduced v-shaped, u-shaped or circular defect in a planar material whereby stress is concentrated. Notch geometries {{play an important role}} in fracture mechanics and materials characterisation. Notches are most often found in impact testing of materials where the presence of a crack origin of controlled morphology in necessary in order to achieve standardised characterisation of fracture toughness. This is most commonly realized using the Charpy impact test , in which the impact of a pendulum hammer (striker) with a horizontal notched specimen and the height of its subsequent swing-through is used to infer the energy absorbed in fracture of the specimen. Impact testing of notched bars is also applied in the <b>Izod</b> <b>impact</b> strength test, typically applied to a cantilever configuration with a vertically positioned specimen. Charpy testing is conducting with U- or V-notches whereby the striker contacts the specimen directly behind the notch, whereas the now largely obsolete Izod method involves a circular notch facing the striker. Notched specimens find use in other characterization protocols, including tensile testing and fatigue.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Materials and Design and the definitive published version is available at [URL] 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Carbon fabric-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates employed in sports products are usually subjected to large-deflection quasi-static and dynamic bending deformations during service. Such loading conditions induce damage within the material affecting its strength, stiffness and energy-absorbing capability. To study this, mechanical behaviour of woven CFRP composites in on- and off-axis orientations is first quantified by carrying out large-deflection quasi-static bending tests followed by dynamic ones employing an <b>Izod</b> type <b>impact</b> tester. CFRP laminates of various orientations were tested at loads increasing up to failure to determine their energy-absorbing capability. On-axis laminates demonstrated better strength and stiffness whereas off-axis laminates exhibited good energy-absorbing capability. However, for applications demanding strength, stiffness and energy absorption as in sports products, {{a combination of both}} types of plies, as in a quasi-isotropic layup, is an optimum choice. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis of the tested specimens showed that matrix cracking, delamination and tow debonding were the dominant damage modes at the specimen's impact location, whereas fabric fracture occurred at the bending location. Further, a catastrophic brittle fracture was observed in the on-axis laminates whereas the off-axis laminates exhibited pseudo-ductile behaviour thanks to matrix cracking and fibre trellising before their failure at higher energies...|$|R
