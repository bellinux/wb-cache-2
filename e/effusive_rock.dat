These three categories are: igneous or volcanic rocks (basalt, granic, etc.), sedimentary or deposit rocks (limestone, sandstone, arenite, etc.), and metamorphic rocks (marble, slate, gypsum, etc.). Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling and/or solidification of magma {{and the formation of}} a dense network of crystals—below the Earth's surface as intrusive rock or on the surface as <b>effusive</b> <b>rock.</b> Sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition of the remains of other rock caused by the action of atmospheric influences. Metamorphic rocks are formed by the transformation of existing rock through the action of temperature and pressure, which cause profound physical and/or chemical changes.|$|E

40|$|In {{his recent}} study the writer {{discovered}} a {{differences between the}} plagioclase twinning of the igneous rocks {{and that of the}} metamorphic rocks, and proposed a new method (plagioclase twin method) for the study of "granite problem". In the present paper are described the features of plagioclase twinning in some slightly contact-metamorphosed basic effusives (meta-basalts and meta-andesites). The groundmass plagioclases of these meta-volcanics are richer in untwinned plagioclases and poorer in A-twins comparing with those of non-metamorphosed basic effusives, the amounts of C-twins being not so different. As to the phenocrysts, however, there are no such differences in the mode of twinning between these two types of <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (Fig. 1). The explanation seems to be sought in the disappearance of twinning (albite law) in some A-twins of groundmass plagioclases due to thermal metamorphism. Thus the features of plagioclase twinning may be used as a clue to determine the thermal effect operated upon slightly contact-metamorphosed <b>effusives</b> <b>rocks.</b> On that basis the so-called basic (or dark) inclusions in some granodiorites of southern Abukuma Plateau are explained as xenoliths derived from some diabases or allied basic igneous rocks (Fig. 6) ...|$|R

The considered lithotypes span {{a wide range of}} porosity mostly due to macropores dispersed in a continuous ground mass. Strength values are distributed over a wide range and are mainly controlled by porosity. Results were merged with literature strength data on other <b>effusive</b> volcanic <b>rocks.</b> Outcomes from laboratory tests indicate that the ratios between the uniaxial strength (σf) and the point load strength index IS, 50 and between σf and the tensile strength (σt) significantly depart from those proposed by ISRM (1985) and decrease as the porosity increases. Conversely the relationship between strength ratio σt / IS, 50 and porosity was found to be more or less constant. These results suggest that macroporosity affects in different ways shear and tensile modes of failure (typical of UC and B/PL tests, respectively). This is confirmed by the evidence that porosity has virtually the same influence on B and PL strengths...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Soils {{formed in}} high mountainous regions in {{southern}} Brazil {{are characterized by}} great accumulation of organic matter (OM) in the surface horizons and variation {{in the degree of}} development. We hypothesized that soil properties and genesis are influenced by the interaction of parent materials and climate factors, which differ depending on the location along the altitudinal gradient. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize and classify the soil, evaluate soil distribution, and determine the interactive effects of soil-forming factors in the subtropical mountain regions in Santa Catarina state. Soil samples were collected in areas known for wine production, for a total of 38 modal profiles. Based on morphological, physical, and chemical properties, soils were evaluated for pedogenesis and classified according to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification, with equivalent classes in the World Reference Basis (WRB). The results indicated that pedogenesis was strongly influenced by the parent material, weather, and relief. In the areas where basic <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (basalt) were observed, there was formation of extensive areas of clayey soils with reddish color and higher iron oxide contents. There was a predominance of Nitossolos Vermelhos and Háplicos (Nitisols), Latossolos Vermelhos (Ferralsols), and Cambissolos Háplicos (Cambisols), highlighting the pedogenetic processes of eluviation, illuviation of clay, and latosolization in conditions of year-long, large-volume, well-distributed rainfall and stability of land forms. In areas with acid <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (rhyodacites), medial or clayey soils were observed with lower iron oxide content, invariably acidic, and with low base content. For these soils, relief promoted substantial removal of material, resulting in intense rejuvenation, with a predominance of Cambissolos Háplicos (Cambisols) and lesser occurrence of Nitossolos Brunos (Nitisols) and Neossolos Litólicos (Leptosols). Soils formed from sedimentary rocks also tended to be more acidic, but with higher sand content, and the soils identified were Cambissolos Háplicos and Húmicos (Cambisols). Cluster analysis separated the soil profiles into three groups: the first and largest was formed by profiles originating from sedimentary rocks and rhyodacites; the second, smaller group was formed by four profiles in the Água Doce region (acidic rocks); and the third was formed by profiles derived from basalt. Discriminant analysis was effective in grouping soil classes. Thus, the study highlighted the importance of geology in the formation of soils in this landscape associated with climate and relief...|$|R

In the Italian {{portion of the}} South-Eastern Alps these archives are managed by the Veneto Region and by the provinces of Bolzano and Trento, {{as part of the}} Italian Inventory of Landslides. About 750 rockfall events recorded in these archives were checked, put together and completed to create a new integrated database. Information on 24 new rockfalls were added from different research sources. Descriptive statistic shows that the most affected slopes with the highest frequency of rockfall are the southern ones. The distribution of rockfalls during the year presents three peaks in March, June and November.

Even though at present there is no accepted GGP model of the Brunhes chron, we found interesting to clarify the details of this negative test. While such an incompatibility is clear enough for the TKmodel, because of its too small dipole coefficient, the incompatibility of the QCmodel was due the 12 per cent of the data with very small intensities; remaining 88 per cent of data is fully compatible with QC model QC. The troublesome, low-palaeointensity records belong to different sites and ages so their excess presence is not an effect of particular location or time. We found no evidence that the marked discrepancy between the empirical data and theoretical calculations on the QC model {{can be explained by the}} possibility that the low-intensity values belong to known excursions of the geomagnetic field. As an alternative, we conjecture that selected low-intensity values can possibly stem from acquisition of chemical remanent magnetization instead of the thermoremanence...|$|R

The tectonostratigraphic study made it possible to determine three sections characterized by the predominance of effusive, pyroclastic or sedimentary deposits.

The end of the volcanic rifting event was marked by a decrease in the volume of the volcanic rocks and the occurrence of low-relief effusive aggradational volcanic edifices and lava fields in close relation with alluvial, deltaic and lacustrine units. The analysis of the syn-rift sequence in the Sañicó depocentre showed the complex relationships between tectonic and volcanic controls which occurred in different magnitudes and times during the rifting evolution...|$|R

Its validity in the Czech part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (Carboniferous, Mississippian to Pennsylvanian — Lower Namurian to Westphalian A) {{is the subject of}} this study. It is based on over 29, 000 analyses of the volatile matter moisture- and ash-free (Vdaf) from surface and underground boreholes drilled in 1946 – 1989. Vitrinite reflectance (Rmax) cannot be used as a measure of coalification in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin: the number of reflectance measurements is small and their distribution over the basin area is very uneven. Statistical data on Vdaf for the individual stratal units were processed. Modelling of the trends in the volatile matter moisture- and ash-free (Vdaf) depending on “stratigraphic depth” proved the general applicability of Hilt's law. The distribution of this parameter in selected boreholes and segments of the basin was also studied, and coalification gradients were calculated. Coalification in specific examples (boreholes) is, however, highly variable and shows numerous deviations from Hilt's law even within individual boreholes, which is documented on a real example. The causes of some of the deviations are relatively well known (e. g., effect of elevated pressure in tectonically deformed areas, effect of <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> or paleoweathering zones) while others can be presumed (heat flows due to Variscan and Carpathian orogenies affected by the lithology of the Carboniferous massif).

Structures of the power waterway are located in the minimum faulted tectonic block composed mainly of clastolavas of basalt porphyrites and lava breccias formed by clastolavas and lavaclastites. The distinguishing features of construction the MH complicating the process are the following: distinctive characteristics of the design (large chamber excavation located nearby—machine and transformer halls), complicated engineering-geological conditions (shear-risk dikes steeply dipping towards excavations and tectonic fractures of order—V), employment of explosion mass up to 2000  kg and intensive mining operations resulting in a rapid exposure of large areas of the MH walls favoring an embrittle-blocky de-stressing of the rock mass. The most unfavorable combinations of the above mentioned factors is observed in the inter-chamber pillar (ICP) between the machine and transformer halls (TH). At the initial stage the MH construction was accompanied by an intensive large-block inrush of rocks occurring on dipping surfaces of the V-order fractures. In this situation the underground opening construction need the monitoring of the stability of the MH walls especially at the ICP sector. In the first stage of construction numerous ultrasonic survey in the anchor drill holes as well as seismic refraction and tomography in the walls were performed. Statistical presentation about forming and structure of the unloading zones was got.

40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{application of}} polymer composites in several industrial {{fields and the}} environmental requirements for reinforcements in polymer matrices, the reinforcement potential of newer fibres is currently investigated. During the last decade, the possible use of basalt fibres as reinforcing material for polymers has been studied extensively. Basalt fibres are produced by melt-spinning from naturally existing basalt rocks which are volcanic and <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> saturated with 45 - 52 wt% SiO 2. Due to its origin, basalt fibre shows excellent properties: high Young’s modulus, excellent heat resistance, good insulation properties (acoustic and thermal) and good damping characteristics. Impact resistance of composite materials is an important area of research. Fibre reinforced polymer composites (FRP) typically show poor resistance to impact events. Moreover, uncertainties about the dominant mechanisms of damage {{make it difficult to}} assess the effect of impact on the performance and residual strength of FRPs. This situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} often the damage produced is not visible. It is therefore essential to understand the impact behaviour of composites to properly design and use them. The primary focus of this research has been aimed at investigating the response to low velocity impact of two different laminates, namely a glass and a basalt woven fabric reinforced vinylester composites. The specimens were manufactured by Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM), using 14 layers of glass and basalt fibres and keeping constant the laminate thickness (3 mm). Plain woven glass and basalt fabrics were used as reinforcement with the same fibre areal weight (220 g/m 2) for comparison purposes. An epoxy based vinylester resin was used as matrix material. All laminates were impacted at various levels of energy (from 5 to 15 Joules) using an hemispherical drop weight striker and then subjected to post impact three-point bending tests. Moreover, non-impacted specimens were tested in flexure for comparison purposes. The trend of flexural properties (strength and modulus) as a function of impact energy along with scanning electron microscopy observations allowed us to assess the difference in performance between the two types of laminates...|$|R

Samples from Sumber Uul (62. 2 ± 0. 9 Ma) and Khuts Uul (57. 1 ± 0. 8 Ma) localitieswere dated using the K-Ar Cassignol–Gillot technique. Stepwise thermal and alternating field demagnetizations isolated a stable A component of magnetization carried by single domain (SD) to nearly SD magnetite. We interpret this A component to be the primary magnetization of these basaltic lava flows. The Sumber Uul and Tulga data were combined and recomputed at the Sumber Uul locality because of their similar ages. The palaeopoles computed from the A components lie at λ = 85. 2 ◦N, φ = 92. 5 ◦E, dp/dm = 3. 9 / 4. 9 (n = 14 flows) for Sumber Uul-Tulga (average age: 62. 1 ± 5. 9 Ma) and λ = 69. 6 ◦N, φ = 148. 0 ◦E, dp/dm= 6. 3 / 7. 3 (n= 14 flows) for Khuts Uul (average age: 57. 1 ± 0. 8 Ma). The palaeomagnetic inclinations are steeper than expected at the sites and consequently our palaeopoles occupy a near-sided position with respect to the 60 Ma reference apparent polar wander path (APWP) pole for Europe (Besse & Courtillot 2002). However, they appear to fully conform to the new high-resolution APWP poles for the 65 – 42 Ma period of Moreau et al. (2007). Following these authors, we interpret this anomalous near-sided position of our poles as arising from a rapid true polar wander (TPW) event in the Palaeocene, highlighted by a cusp at anomalies 26 – 25 (61 – 56 Ma), inexistent in the European APWP of Besse & Courtillot (2002).

40|$|Data on thermal {{properties}} of rocks such as thermal conductivity (λ), thermal diffusivity (α), {{specific heat capacity}} (cp) are necessary for many aspects of exploration and exploitation of geothermal fields (Popov et al., 2012), in both high-low enthalpy and geo-exchange systems. However, there are still several difficulties in characterize geological materials, because their {{thermal properties}} are extremely dependent on scale of measurement. From a micro- and mesoscale point of view, porosity (in sedimentary and volcanic rocks), the dominant mineral phase (in metamorphic and plutonic rocks), and anisotropy (in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks) are important controlling factors on thermal conductivity. Texture have been scarcely investigated. Anyway, thermal conductivity as a tensor depends {{not only on the}} volume fraction and thermal conductivity of rock components, but also on their distribution, on geometry and internal structure, and on the heat transfer conditions at the contacts between them (Schön, 2011). Thus, understanding the influence on thermal properties of the texture is a present-day challenge whose results could provide a huge contribution to the scientific community now involved in geothermal energy topics. The main goal of the present project is to provide an example of a new approach that could take into account the thermo-physical properties of rocks at the microscale as well as those at meso- and macroscale. Some techniques have been tested on two different lithologies, dolomites on one hand and trachytes on the other, and results have been discussed separately. μ-XRF seems to be the “turning point” technique for analyses of petro-physical properties on <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> as trachytes since the image analysis on the elemental X-ray maps provides reliable quantitative information on texture and rock-forming minerals in relatively short analysis times. In the same way, a good applicability of the technique is assumed on intrusive rocks. Conversely, the micro-XRF doesn’t provide the expected results for dolomites. Among those tested, the He pycnometer technique remains the most accurate one for measuring porosity. In addition, a search on literature was made to understand how thermal properties of rock-forming minerals were and can be measured; an overview on the models for the computation of thermal conductivity of rocks starting from rock-forming minerals values is provided. A continuation of this study is necessary in order to (1) test the validity of the proposed methods on other lithologies, (2) deepen the study of texture influences on thermal conductivity, (3) contribute to the compilation of rock thermal properties database collected by several authors, (4) apply the acquired information for numerical modelling purposes...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} petrological {{nature of the}} mantle-crust {{transition}} zone (MCTZ) based on detailed field observations of the northern Oman ophiolite. Two kinds of MCTZ, early-gabbroin-dunite and late-dunite-in-gabbro transition zones, can be recognized between the residual peridotite and the layered gabbro sequence. They are distinguished by an intrusive relationship between gabbro and dunite. In the early-gabbro-in-dunite transition zone, gabbro forms network-like sills and has intrusive contact with dunite. The frequency of the gabbro sills gradually increases {{from the top of}} residual peridotite to the base of layered gabbro, which itself has a sharp boundary with the underlying dunite. All constituents of the earlygabbro-in-dunite transition zone are deformed, and lithological boundaries are parallel to foliation of the rocks. On the other hand, in the late-dunite-in-gabbro transition zone, dunite has intrusive contact with gabbro sills and layered gabbro. Clinopyroxenite produced by reaction/partial melting occurs frequently along the intrusive contact. The late-dunite-ingabbro transition zone is of secondary origin, being modified from the primary layered gabbro to the early-gabbro-in-dunite transition zone by later dunite intrusion. Degree of serpentinization is irregularly distributed, and antigorite, a high-temperature serpentine species, is not found in the peridotite portion. This indicates the Hess model that the oceanic Moho is placed within peridotite as a serpentinization front is not deduced from observations of the Oman ophiolite. We propose a model for the formation of two kinds of MCTZ. The gabbro sills in dunite were originally formed beneath a mid-oceanic ridge as a network of upward-moving melt within residual harzburgite. Dunite was produced by a reaction between melt and harzburgite. The network-like gabbro and dunite were deformed to become elongated by the horizontal mantle flow with leaving the spreading ridge. The boundary between the melt-rich part (center of paleo-melt flow) and melt-poorer part later became the layered gabbro/dunite boundary. The early-gabbro-in-dunite transition zone is the part between the layered gabbro/dunite boundary and the residual harzburgite. An off-ridge magmatism formed socalled late-intrusive plutonic bodies including dunite, cutting the primary rocks formed at the spreading ridge. The dunite formed intrusive contacts throughout the pre-existing crustal sequence, that is, the secondary late-dunite-in-gabbro transition zone. The intrusive bodies have island-arc geochemical signatures and are genetically linked to <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> of islandarc type including picrite. The late-dunite-in-gabbro transition zone probably formed at an island-arc setting during detachment and obduction of a slice of oceanic lithosphere as an ophiolite suite. The early-gabbro-in-dunite transition zone may occur frequently beneath the ocean floor, especially that of the fast-spreading ridge system. We predict a common latedunite-in-gabbro transition zone beneath some oceanic island arcs and back-arc basins...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of a very}} {{variable}} geological {{composition of}} the Czech Republic, there is a various scale of all genetic types of rocks that are used {{for the production of}} crushed stone. The most often used group of <b>rocks</b> are <b>effusive</b> magmatic <b>rocks,</b> which represent about 34 % of crushed stone marketed (Starý et al. 2010). These rocks are used for all kinds of construction purposes including roads. The experimental material of crushed stone used in this thesis was sampled from 40 active quarries in the Czech Republic. The studied volcanic rocks originated from Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic complexes of Barrandien, Carboniferous and Permian of Krkonose Piedmont Basin, Carboniferous and Permian of Intrasudetic basin, area of ordovician Železné Hory, from the main volcanic center of Bohemian Massif in the north-west Bohemia (České středohoří Mts. and Doupov Mts.), Neovolcanic area of Czech Cretaceous basin and area of Neovolcanic East and West Sudeten. Petrographic study was carried out in a form of standard petrographic analysis of thin sections and chemical analysis, which helped inclusion of rocks to a classified systems. The whole suite of volcanic rocks was separated to five petrographic-technologic subgroups defined as: (1) rhyolites / porphyres, (2) phonolites, (3) basalts s. l., (4) spilites and (5) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Sardinian {{segment of}} the Variscan chain is divided into four tectono-metamorphic zones from NE to SW: 1) Inner zone, with medium- to {{high-grade}} metamorphic rocks and migmatites; 2) Internal Nappe zone, with low- to medium-grade rocks; 3) External Nappe zone, with low-grade metamorphic rocks; 4) External zone, with very low- to low-grade rocks. Metabasite lenses, with eclogite and granulite relics, occur in the migmatites. Pre-Variscan ages are attributed to the E-W trending folds below the Sardic unconformity (SW Sardinia). Five Variscan deformation phases have been distinguished, the principal ones being: D 1, compressional, with SW-vergent folds and S 1 schistosity; D 2, extensional, with S 2 schistosity transposing S 1. Later, a composite network of post-D 3, syn-D 4 shear zones was active from an older HT/LP shear event to a younger MT-LT/LP one. The late D 5 phase produced kilometric flexures with an axis parallel to the orogenic trend. For Inner zone sequences, a complete prograde sequence has been recognised, from the chlorite zone to the sillimanite + K-feldspar one. The Nappe zone shows decreasing metamorphic grade from bottom to top of the Nappe pile, {{as well as in}} each single unit. The Variscan P-T-t path is the clockwise loop typical of continental collision. For the Barrovian stage, thermobarometers yielded a Ppeak of  1. 2 GPa (end of D 1) and Tpeak of  750 °C (early D 2). For HP/HT metamorphic relics, calculations indicated: eclogite stage, T  550 °- 700 °C, P  1. 3 - 1. 7 GPa; granulite stage, T  650 °- 900 °C, P  0. 8 - 1. 2 GPa; amphibolite stage: T  550 °- 650 °C, P  0. 3 - 0. 7 GPa. Pre-Variscan igneous rocks consist of Lower to Middle Paleozoic metabasites with MORB or WPB affinity and Middle Ordovician calc-alkaline intrusive and <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks.</b> The Corsica-Sardinia microplate belongs to the southern passive margin of the Hun Superterrane of the Swiss authors. The beginning of Variscan continental collision is marked by a probable eclogite-producing HP event. Ages of 355 - 335 Ma and 335 - 320 Ma for the first two Variscan metamorphic phases and 310 - 280 Ma and 290 - 280 Ma for late-post orogenic Variscan magmatism in Sardinia match those of the same events in the northern Hun Superterrane active leading margin. The Variscan Corsica-Sardinia batholith is made up of late-orogenic calc-alkaline intrusive rocks and post orogenic leucogranites. The greater volumes (surface area 6000 Km 2) and long gestation times of the Corsica-Sardinia batholith as compared to those of the northern Hun Superterrane batholiths is attributed to the collision between the southern Hun Superterrane margin, including Corsica-Sardinia, and the huge Gondwana Supercontinent. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} tectonics, the Deryugin basin (Fig. 1) {{is a part}} of the epi-Mesozoic Okhotsk plate {{comprising}} the heterogeneous basement that is mainly pre-Cenozoic (the lower structural stage) and the sedimentary cover that is mainly represented by the Paleogenic-Neogenic-Quaternary deposits with the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary rocks observed locally without a visible hiatus (the upper structural stage). The acoustic basement (AB) is composed of the metamorphosed Upper Cretaceous-Paleogenic silty-clayey-siliceous deposits (the western part of the region), amphibolites, gneisses, crystalline schists, weakly metamorphosed sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones (often siliceous), as well as intrusive and <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks</b> of basic, intermediate, and rarely persilic composition (the eastern part of the region). AB is generally dated as Mesozoic–Paleozoic. Results of tectonic zoning of the sedimentary cover based on material (lithophysical) indicators (Fig. 2) are represented in the format of maps showing lithophysical complexes (LC) within the limits of four regional seismo-stratigraphic complexes/structural layers (RSSC I-IV) corresponding to the following time intervals: the pre-Oligocene К 2 –P 1 - 2 (RSSC I), the Oligocene – Lower Miocene P 3 –N 11 (RSSC II), the Lower – Mid Miocene N 11 – 2 (RSSC III), and the Upper Miocene – Pliocene N 13 –N 2 (RSSC IV). Diverse lithological-facies associations composing the RSSCs are grouped into the following lithophysical complexes (LC) : 1 - coal-bearing silty-clayey-sandy terrigenous, 2 - sandy-silty-clayey terrigenous, 3 - silty-clayey-siliceous, and 4 - sandy-silty-clayey volcanic [Sergeyev, 2006]. In the studied area (Fig. 2), the deposits of the pre-Oligocene RSSC are identified in limited areas within its northern, northwestern, and southwestern parts; they are represented by coal-bearing silty-clayey-sandy terrigenous and silty-clayey-siliceous LCs. Other RSSCs (II, III, and IV) in this area represented mostly by sandy-silty-clayey terrigenous and silty-clayey-siliceous LCs, and only the extreme southwestern part along the eastern Sakhalin coast contains narrow bands of the coal-bearing silty-clayey-sandy LC. The sandy-silty-clayey volcanic LC is absent in the Deryugin basin. Tectonic zoning of the sedimentary cover based on structural indicators is carried out with reference to the sediment-thickness map [Sergeyev, 2006] that was significantly revised in its segment showing the area of the Deryugin basin. Results of such zoning are represented in the format of a structural-tectonic map (Fig. 3) showing orientations and morphology of the structural elements of the sedimentary cover, the thickness of the sedimentary cover, and amplitudes of relative uplifts and troughs. With reference to the structural-tectonic map (see Fig. 3), the structural elements of different orders are grouped by their sizes, spatial positions and orientations and thus comprise structural zones (Fig. 4) that include relative uplifts and troughs that are considered as structural elements of smaller sizes (Fig. 5). Tectonic zoning of the sedimentary cover based on structural-material (lithophysical) indicators (Fig. 7 – 10) is carried out with reference to the maps of the lithophysical complexes of the four regional seismo-stratigraphic complexes/structural layers (see Fig. 2) and the map of high-order structural elements in the sedimentary cover (see Fig. 5).    </p...|$|R
40|$|The Iricoumé group {{consists}} of very well preserved pyroclastic and <b>effusive</b> volcanic <b>rocks</b> {{as a part}} of an extensive volcano-plutonic event, which marked {{the central part of the}} Amazonian craton during the Orosirian. Such rocks occur in the southern part of the southwestern of Erepecuru-Trombetas Domain (NW of the Pará state), south of the Guyana Shield. Petrographic study allows distinction of two volcanic types. A dominant explosive volcanism is characterized by pyroclastic rocks (ignimbrites, rheoignimbrites, lapilli-tuff related to surge deposit, and co-ignimbrite fall tuff) while a subordinated effusive volcanism is represented by coherent lavas flows and hypabissal rocks (andesites, lamprophyres and latites). Most of the pyroclastic rocks exhibit features of deposition under high temperature suggesting formation in a caldera-related environment. Pb-Pb zircon ages of 1888 +- 2. 5 and 1889 +- 2 Ma have been obtained for the formation of trachydacitic ignimbrites and confirm that the dominant volcanism is part of the Iricoumé group. The Pb-Pb zircon age of 1992 +- 3 Ma yielded by an andesite points to the occurrence in the area of an older Orosirian magmatic episode, which has been previously recognized locally southward in the Tapajós domain. These new results constitute a further evidence of the wide extent of the Iricoum group and correlated volcanic rocks in the central part of the Amazonian craton, and reinforce the assumption that this volcanic episode and correlated magmatism may be considered as a silicic large igneous province (SLIP), as previously proposed by some authors...|$|R
40|$|Alluvial {{sediment}} investigations provide fundamental {{tools to}} infer {{the processes that}} control geomorphological evolution of mountain environments. By analyzing sediment stratigraphy in depth, {{it is possible to}} retrieve the source, the geology, the time of deposition, the relative distance travelled by material as well as to distinguish among different type of transport (i. e., gravitational, fluvial or glacial). In this work, we present a combination of log stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating and geophysical surveys carried out on the valley floor of the But River (Carnic Alps, North East Italy). The But River basin drains an area of 326 km 2 with a range in elevation from 2769 to 323 m a. s. l.; the bedrock mainly consists of carbonates and quartz arenites with minor inclusions of <b>effusive</b> <b>rocks.</b> After Pleistocene the gravitational deposits from mountain slopes have impounded the But River several times. In particular, we analyzed a sector of the upper portion of the But valley close to the confluence of the Moscardo Torrent, frequently affected by debris flows. A borehole was drilled in the But River floodplain, at the intersection with the Moscardo Torrent alluvial fan, down to a depth of 80 m. The analysis of the core samples allowed discerning three sedimentary levels rich in clay and organic materials, which testify the presence of small dam lakes, originated from the Moscardo debris-flow deposits. Three samples of wood and plant debris were collected from 13, 14 and 23 m of depth, respectively. They were analyzed through radiocarbon dating {{in order to determine the}} age of the lakes and, thus, to infer the activity of the debris flows building the Moscardo cone. The calibrated ages of the 3 samples are close to the younger limit of the radiocarbon method indicating a fast aggradation of the valley floor, starting from a period ranging between 1450 - 1632 AD. Historical maps and documents confirm the presence of the lakes until 19 th century and they permit to assess their extent and the maximum depths. Two passive seismic campaigns were carried out near the borehole site and along the But valley at different elevations. The aim was to investigate the depth of the buried bedrock and therefore to indirectly characterize the thickness of alluvial deposits. We calibrated the fundamental frequency of each site by constraining average shear velocity of the alluvial sediments close to the borehole site with known stratigraphy. Eight HVSR (Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio, Nakamura, 1989) were carried out, and thus a first sketch of the buried valley floor along a longitudinal profile of about 5 km was depicted. The values of the derived bedrock depth allow to quantify the differences in thickness between the alluvial deposits and the Moscardo Torrent fan deposits. This information helps to address the contribution of the debris-flow processes in damming the upper But River during the last five centuries. The results confirm the role of debris-flow deposits from the Moscardo Torrent in shaping the morphology of the valley floor of But River and show suitability of an integrated approach, encompassing log stratigraphy, geophysical surveys and analysis of historical documents, for gaining insights on the evolution of alpine valleys...|$|R
40|$|The Delčevo Basin {{is located}} in the NE part of the Republic of Macedonia. To the norhteast, the basin extends locally to the area of Crna Skala (close to the Macedonian/Bulgarian border), and {{continues}} on the territory of Bulgaria (Fig. 1). The Paleogene sediments of the Delčevo Basin are developed in several outcrops with NNW-SSE trends, usually lying transgressively upon the high-grade metamorphic and magmatic rocks of the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, and mostly covered by Neogene <b>effusive</b> and sedimentary <b>rocks.</b> At some places the Paleogene sediments were found to be disrupted. The first evidence for the presence of Paleogene in the Delčevo Basin was provided by Belmustakov (1948), who dated these sediments as Oligocene. Based on the study of gastropods, bivalves and other fossil gropus, Temkova (1957) and Gjuzelkovski (1959) determined the overal age of the Paleogene rocks in the Delčevo Basin as Late Eocene, and Kovačevič et al. (1973) referred them to the Priabonian. This study aims to achieve a further understanding of the age of the Paleogene sediments from the Delčevo Basin by means of micropaleontological examination of foraminifer fauna...|$|R
