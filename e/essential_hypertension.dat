40|$|The {{quality of}} life of {{adolescents}} aged 14 to 17 with <b>essential</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> has been studied using the questionnaire MOS SF- 36. The results of the study indicate a significant drop in both mental and physical health of adolescents. It has been established that the level of arterial blood pressure is not the only factor determining a deteriorated {{quality of life}} of adolescents with <b>essential</b> arterial <b>hypertension.</b> A deterioration in the quality of life is most characteristic of adolescents with labial arterial hypertension: this was found on all of the 8 scales in the questionnaire. In adolescents with stable arterial hypertension, a definite reduction in the quality of life was revealed only on six out of 8 scales examined. Physical activity in adolescents both with stable and labial arterial hypertension was limited to the same extent, however, psychoemotional stress was more common in adolescents with labial arterial hypertension. In the authors’ view, the revealed differences indicate the different extent to which psychosomatic mechanisms are involved in the development of arterial hypertension and a need for tailor-made approach to treating this category of adolescents.

25|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} – {{a poorly}} understood condition first called Syndrome X by Gerald Reaven. It is currently {{not clear whether}} the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for insulin response in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as <b>essential</b> <b>hypertension,</b> obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) to develop.|$|E
25|$|Single gene {{mutations}} {{can cause}} Mendelian forms of high blood pressure; ten genes {{have been identified}} which cause these monogenic forms of hypertension. These mutations affect blood pressure by altering renal salt handling. There is greater similarity in blood pressure within families than between families, which indicates a form of inheritance, {{and this is not}} due to shared environmental factors. With the aid of genetic analysis techniques, a statistically significant linkage of blood pressure to several chromosomal regions, including regions linked to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found. These findings suggest that there are many genetic loci, in the general population, each with small effects on blood pressure. Overall, however, identifiable single-gene causes of hypertension are uncommon, consistent with a multifactorial cause of <b>essential</b> <b>hypertension.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may {{be superior to}} either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT1 receptor. This 'dual blockade' {{may be more effective}} than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways. Preliminary studies suggest this combination of pharmacologic agents may be advantageous in the treatment of <b>essential</b> <b>hypertension,</b> chronic heart failure, and nephropathy. However, the more recent ONTARGET study showed no benefit of combining the agents and more adverse events. While statistically significant results have been obtained for its role in treating hypertension, clinical significance may be lacking. There are warnings about the combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs.|$|E

25|$|The {{endothelium}} {{of blood}} vessels produces an extensive range of substances that influence blood flow and, in turn, is affected by changes in the blood and the pressure of blood flow. For example, local nitric oxide and endothelin, which are secreted by the endothelium, are the major regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. In patients with <b>essential</b> <b>hypertension,</b> the balance between the vasodilators and the vasoconstrictors is upset, which leads {{to changes in the}} endothelium and sets up a “vicious cycle” that contributes to the maintenance of high blood pressure. In patients with hypertension, endothelial activation and damage also lead to changes in vascular tone, vascular reactivity, and coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Alterations in endothelial function are a reliable indicator of target organ damage and atherosclerotic disease, as well as prognosis.|$|E
500|$|The renal {{dopamine}}rgic {{system is}} located in the cells of the nephron in the kidney, where all subtypes of dopamine receptors are present. Dopamine is also synthesized there, by tubule cells, and discharged into the tubular fluid. [...] Its actions include increasing the blood supply to the kidneys, increasing the glomerular filtration rate, and increasing the excretion of sodium in the urine. Hence, defects in renal dopamine function can lead to reduced sodium excretion and consequently result in the development of high blood pressure. There is strong evidence that faults in the production of dopamine or in the receptors can result in a number of pathologies including oxidative stress, edema, and either genetic or <b>essential</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Oxidative stress can itself cause hypertension. Defects in the system can also be caused by genetic factors or high blood pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Pathophysiology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} which explains {{the function of the}} body as it relates to diseases and conditions. The pathophysiology of hypertension is an area which attempts to explain mechanistically the causes of hypertension, which is a chronic disease characterized by elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension can be classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90–95% of hypertension is <b>essential</b> <b>hypertension.</b> [...] Some authorities define <b>essential</b> <b>hypertension</b> as that which has no known explanation, while others define its cause as being due to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of potassium. Secondary hypertension indicates that the hypertension is a result of a specific underlying condition with a well-known mechanism, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the aorta or kidney arteries, or endocrine disorders such as excess aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines. Persistent hypertension is a major risk factor for hypertensive heart disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the interrelation of the structural state of brachiocephalic arteries with {{the characteristics of the}} daily profile of blood pressure (BP) in middle-aged and elderly patients with <b>essential</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> stage II.

In group I, a significantly higher prevalence of stenotic atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries was found in comparison with the patients of group II. In elderly patients with stenotic carotid artery atherosclerosis, a significantly higher level of systolic blood pressure (BP) was established at night time. The increase of carotid intima media thickness in patients with impaired circadian BP rhythm was associated with the insufficient degree of nocturnal decrease in systolic BP.

40|$|Background. A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that effective blood pressure reduction may inhibit the progression of microvascular damage in patients with <b>essential</b> arterial <b>hypertension.</b> However, the potential influence of anti-hypertensive drugs on ocular circulation has not been studied sufficiently. Purpose. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of anti-hypertensive therapy on blood flow in the central retinal artery in patients with systemic arterial hypertension. Material and methods. Twenty patients with <b>essential</b> arterial <b>hypertension,</b> aged 32 – 46 years, were examined with Doppler ultrasonography (10 MHz ultrasound probe). Blood flow velocities, pulsatility, and vascular resistance were determined before and 3 hours after systemic application of either bisoprolol 5 mg or cilazapril 2. 5 mg. Results. Administered bisoprolol significantly decreased maximum (9. 8 ± 0. 5 cm/s versus 8. 5 ± 0. 6 cm/s; P < 0. 05) and minimum (2. 75 ± 0. 19 cm/s versus 1. 75 ± 0. 27 cm/s; P < 0. 02) velocity, increased the Pourcellot’s index (0. 71 to 0. 79; P < 0. 05) in central retinal artery. There were no statistically significant changes in central retinal artery blood flow after administration of cilazapril. Conclusion. Systemic application of beta-blockers may unfavourably disturb the ocular blood flow. Key words: Bisoprolol, central retinal artery, cilazapril, Doppler ultrasonograph...|$|R
