40|$|Given {{the hard}} problem of {{consciousness}} (Chalmers, 1995) {{there are no}} brain electrophysiological correlates of the subjective experience (the <b>felt</b> <b>quality</b> of redness or the redness of red, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual field, {{the sound of a}} clarinet, the smell of mothball, bodily sensations from pains to orgasms, mental images that are conjured up internally, the <b>felt</b> <b>quality</b> of emotion, the experience of a stream of conscious thought or the phenomenology of thought). 	 	However, there are brain occipital and left temporal electrophysiological correlates of the subjective experience (Pereira, 2015). 	Notwithstanding, as evoked signal, the change in event-related brain potentials phase (frequency is the change in phase over time) is instantaneous, that is, the frequency will transiently be infinite: a transient peak in frequency (positive or negative), if any, is instantaneous in electroencephalogram averaging or filtering that the event-related brain potentials required and the underlying structure of the event-related brain potentials in the frequency domain cannot be accounted, for example, by the Wavelet Transform or the Fast Fourier Transform analysis, because they require that frequency is derived by convolution rather than by differentiation. 	However, as I show in the current original research report, one suitable method for analyse the instantaneous change in event-related brain potentials phase and accounted for a transient peak in frequency (positive or negative), if any, in the underlying structure of the event-related brain potentials is the Empirical Mode Decomposition with post processing (Xie et al., 2014) Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition...|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{analyze the}} {{aesthetic}} dimensions of {{a sequence of}} mathematical events found in an unusual first grade lesson in order to demonstrate how sequencing may affect an individual’s experience of mathematical beauty. By approaching aesthetic as a sense or <b>felt</b> <b>quality</b> of an experience in context (Sinclair, 2001, 2011), this analysis explains how sequence can affect the way mathematical objects or actions are experienced by an individual. Thus, rather than questioning whether or in what ways a set of mathematical objects are beautiful or not, this paper addresses under what conditions is the mathematics in play beautiful. It is argued that with {{a better understanding of}} the temporal dimension of mathematical beauty, educational experiences with mathematics can be designed to captivate attention and nurture interest and positive disposition by students toward mathematics...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged that verbal auditory imagery, the reader’s sense of hearing {{the words on}} a page, matters in the silent reading of poetry. Verbal auditory imagery (VAI) in the silent reading of narrative prose, on the other hand, is mostly neglected by literary and other theorists. This is a first attempt to provide a systematic theoretical account of the <b>felt</b> <b>qualities</b> and underlying cognitive mechanics of VAI, based on convergent evidence from the experimental cognitive sciences, psycholinguistic theory, and introspection. More generally, {{the aim is to}} isolate a new set of embodied experiences which, along with more widely researched phenomena such as sensorimotor enactment or emotion, contribute to our understanding of literary narrative. The central argument is that distinctions within the domain of embodied VAI also apply to higher-order meaning-making, i. e., that discrete types of VAI are associated with discrete tendencies in spontaneous literary interpretation. Spontaneous literary interpretation stands for any process of meaning-making, however inarticulate, that reaches the reader’s consciousness in an uninterrupted course of reading...|$|R
40|$|Supervenience is {{a concept}} {{borrowed}} from moral philosophy by philosophy of mind to solve the mind-body problem. The mind-body problem is actually a set of problems, among which the major ones are the Consciousness problem (Illustrative instance: how can physical states have <b>felt</b> <b>qualities?)</b> and the Intentionality Problem (Illustrative instance: How can physical states be about something, or be directed towards something else?). One of the major physicalist strategies for solving the mind-body problem has been reduction, i. e., the strategy is {{to argue that the}} mind is “nothing-but” some physical state. However, many physicalists have found this route very unsatisfactory, so there are also non-reductive physicalist theories of the mind (theories which hold that the physical level is the fundamental level of understanding, but which also hold that the mind cannot be reduced to the brain or any other physical level). Most computational theories of the mind (Newell's SOAR model, Anderson's ACT and ACT* models, and work by Chomsky, Minsky, Fodor and Pylyshyn) belong to this category. Supervenience is appealed to by this kind of physicalist theories to explain the mind-body relation...|$|R
50|$|A famous {{lithographer}} {{and publisher}} who strongly supported {{the production of}} chromolithographs was Louis Prang. Prang was a German-born entrepreneur who printed the first American Christmas card. He felt that chromolithographs could look just as good as, if not better than, real paintings, and he published well-known chromolithographs based on popular paintings, including one by Eastman Johnson entitled The Barefoot Boy. The reason Prang decided {{to take on the}} challenge of producing chromolithographs, despite criticisms, was because he <b>felt</b> <b>quality</b> art should not be limited to the elite. Prang and others who continued to produce chromolithographs were sometimes looked down upon because of the fear that chromolithographs could undermine human abilities. With the Industrial Revolution already under way, this fear was not something new to Americans at the time. Many artists themselves anticipated the lack of desire for original artwork since many became accustomed to chromolithographs. As a way to make more sales, some artists had a few paintings made into chromolithographs so that people in society would at least be familiar with the painter. Once people in society were familiar with the artist, {{they were more likely to}} want to pay for an original work.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is an exploration of BDSM experience as it emerges from the complex interactions of kink activities and relationships. It argues that practices which are ostensibly not religious can be understood as contributing to personal processes of religioning. Enriching debates about living religion, I offer the idea of gestalt as a tool to address the question of how examples of a given practice which is a part of religioning might be distinguished from those where it is not. A gestalt is something felt to be more or other {{than the sum of its}} constituent parts; it is an emergent, <b>felt</b> <b>quality</b> that is neither perceptual nor cognitive. A sense of gestalt arises unpredictably from an individual's whole experience of a given phenomenon as it is integrated into their world and, when it appears, it changes the value, significance and meaning of the phenomenon. Thus, kink experience is presented as a crucible where personal outcomes and meaning can be distilled from the concentrated matter therein. I argue that the significance of a given experience is not located solely within any intrinsic quality ascribed to it, rather, it is in what the experiencer subsequently constructs from the refined experience...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate over}} low-volume, high-intensity {{training}} versus high-volume, low-intensity training, {{commonly known as}} Quality versus Quantity, respectively, is a frequent topic of discussion among swimming coaches and academics. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore expert coaches’ perceptions of quality and quantity coaching philosophies in competitive swimming and to investigate their current training practices. A purposeful sample of 11 expert swimming coaches was recruited for this study. The study was a mixed methods design and involved each coach participating in 1 semi-structured interview and completing 1 closed-ended questionnaire. The main findings of this study were that coaches <b>felt</b> <b>quality</b> training programmes would lead to short term results for youth swimmers, but were in many cases more appropriate for senior swimmers. The coaches suggested that quantity training programmes built an aerobic base for youth swimmers, promoted technical development through a focus on slower swimming and helped to enhance recovery from training or competition. However, the coaches continuously suggested that quantity training programmes must be performed with good technique and they felt this was a misunderstood element. This study was a critical step towards gaining a richer and broader understanding on the debate over Quality versus Quantity training from an expert swimming coaches’ perspective which was not currently available in the research literature...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{multiple}} and contested spaces of belonging {{that may be}} evoked by ritualised musical performance. It makes an ethnographic case study of the Zorn Badge Auditions in Sweden, in which musicians play before a jury {{in the hope of}} being awarded a Zorn Badge and a prestigious but also contested title: Riksspelman. Building on theories of ritual and performance in combination with Sara Ahmed’s theorisation of orientation, the thesis attends to sensory ways of experiencing and knowing music while tracing the various ways in which Swedish traditional music is performed, felt, heard, sensed and understood in audition spaces. It draws on interviews with players and jury members, participant observations of music auditions and the jury’s deliberations, showing how musical value is negotiated through processes of inclusion and exclusion of repertoires, instruments and performance practices. The study also illuminates how anxiety and uncertainties are felt {{on both sides of the}} adjudication table. The auditions trigger feelings of belonging and harmony, but also rupture and distance. A brimming of <b>felt</b> <b>qualities</b> contributes to the sensing of history, tradition, memory, place and geography, as well as close emotional connections between music and individual performers. The thesis reveals how gradual adaptation, and the lived experiences of time within tradition, allow the Zorn institution to negotiate change and thereby maintain its position within Swedish society...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on workplace creativity by combining insights on epiphanies with theory on the embodied and relational nature of understanding. We explore and develop the concept of epiphany, defined as a sudden and transient manifestation of insight. Primarily, we are interested in the implications of the concept’s artistic and philosophical origins for organizational creativity. We start from a consideration of the importance of epiphany in the literary works of Joyce, who underlined the crucial aspect of the conjunction of different human senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching). Next, we draw up upon the theory of insights as embodied, experientially <b>felt</b> <b>qualities,</b> as described by Mark Johnson (2007) and predecessors in pragmatism. Using three sets of empirical snippets as aids to reasoning, we arrive at renewed understanding of epiphany as a phenomenon in creativity that is experientially multi-sensuous and collective rather than merely cognitive and individual. Epiphanies are typically manifest as a series of felt occurrences arising within collective practice, follow from a history of preparation, and do not solely involve breakthrough ideas but can also include feelings of doubt, movement, opening up or disconfirmation. Understanding epiphanies in this way extends research on organizational creativity as collective practice. The article suggests further attention be paid to the transient and noetic qualities of work on ideas in organizations, such as visual and material stimuli in sensorial preparations of creativity and the use of openness in marking felt insights...|$|R
