Regarding SET generation, we investigate {{the dependence of}} the generated SET pulse width on the struck node capacitance.

SET propagation in logic chains is also studied, and it is shown that significant broadening or attenuation of the propagated transient pulse width may be observed. It is shown that the chain design (propagation delay of high to low and low to high transitions) has a major impact on broadening or attenuation of the propagated transient pulse.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{mechanism of}} amplification of phonons by phonons {{on the basis}} of nonlinear band-gap transmission (supratransmission) phenomenon is presented. As an example a system of weakly coupled chains of anharmonic oscillators is considered. One (source) chain is driven harmonically by boundary with a frequency located in the upper band close to the band edge of the ladder system. Amplification happens when a second (<b>gate)</b> <b>chain</b> is driven by a small signal in the counter phase and with the same frequency as first chain. If the total driving of both chains overcomes the band-gap transmission threshold the large amplitude band-gap soliton emerges and amplification scenario is realized. The mechanism is interpreted as nonlinear superposition of evanescent and propagating nonlinear modes manifesting in a single or double soliton generation working in band-gap or band-pass regimes, respectively. The results could be straightforwardly generalized for all-optical or all-magnonic contexts and has all the promises for logic gate operations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Random bits are an {{important}} construct in many applica-tions, such as hardware-based implementation of probabilistic algorithms and weighted random testing. One approach in generating random bits with required probabilities is to synthesize combinational circuits that transform a set of source probabilities into target probabilities. In [1], the authors proposed a greedy algorithm that synthesizes circuits {{in the form of}} a <b>gate</b> <b>chain</b> to approximate target probabilities. However, since this approach only considers circuits of such a special form, the resulting circuits are not satisfactory both in terms of the approximation error and the circuit depth. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to synthesize combinational circuits for generating random bits. Compared to the previous one, our approach greatly enlarges the search space. Also, we apply a linear property of probabilistic logic computation and an iterative local search method to increase the efficiency of our algorithm. Experimental results comparing the approximation errors and the depths of the circuits synthesized by our method to those of the circuits synthesized by the previous approach demonstrate the superiority of our method.

50|$|About 6:00 pm of the 6th, Shortland {{discovered}} a hole {{from one of}} the five prisons to the barrack yard near the gun racks. Some prisoners were outside the fence, noisily pelting each other with turf, and many more were near the breach (and the gambling tables), though the signal for return to prisons had sounded. Shortland was convinced of a plot, and rang the alarm bell to collect the officers and have the men ready. This precaution brought back a crowd just going to quarters. Just then a prisoner broke a <b>gate</b> <b>chain</b> with an iron bar and a number of the prisoners pressed through to the prison market square. After attempts at persuasion, Shortland ordered a charge which drove some of the prisoners in. Those near the gate, however, hooted at and taunted the soldiery, who fired a volley over their heads. The crowd yelled louder and threw stones, and the soldiers, probably without orders, fired a direct volley which killed and wounded a large number. Then they continued firing at the prisoners, many of whom were now struggling to get back inside the blocks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of a comprehensive investigation of the effects device sizing, complexity and scalability on the driver capacitance (C d) to the total load capacitance (C total) ratio and its impact on maximum power-efficiency of pass transistor digital circuits in low-voltage CMOS. The study also analyzes the impact of temperature variations on the optimum supply voltage and on the maximum power-efficiency. It was found that the previously proposed low-power design methodology by Rabaey and Pedram does not hold under certain conditions in pass-transistor circuits in low-voltage CMOS. Specifically, a significant variation from the previously defined C d= 0. 5 C total has been observed with respect to a complexity and scalability. In addition, it was also found, that the power-efficiency of a device or a system deteriorates rapidly with increased temperature (room temp to 110 C) by up to 32 % in 0. 25 μm CMOS. As a result of this effect, the optimum supply voltage shifts as well. The findings have been analytically and experimentally verified using Double Pass Transistor Logic <b>gate</b> <b>chains</b> with various fanouts and fanins and fabricated in 0. 35 μm and 0. 25 μm CMOS technology. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simple yet powerful general theoretical framework and efficient implementation for removal of clock network timing pessimism. We address pessimism in static timing analysis (STA) tools caused by considering delay variation along common segments of clock paths. The STA tools compute setup (hold) timing slack based on conservative combinations of late (early) launching and early (late) capturing arrival times. To avoid exponential-time path-based analysis the STA tools use both {{early and late}} arrival times on gates common to both launching and capturing paths. It is impossible in real circuit and is observed as the clock network pessimism in STA. Our approach supports any kind of delay variation though the typical causes of the pessimism are process, voltage, and temperature on-chip variation, and reconvergence in clock network. We propose a new theoretical framework that allows to apply known graph algorithms instead of time consuming forward and backward multi-pass tracing algorithms and heuristics that are limited to some network topologies [4]. The new graph-based framework supports clock networks of virtually any size and type, e. g., tree, mesh, hybrid, clock <b>gating,</b> <b>chains</b> of multipliers and dividers, loops in such chains, etc. The implementation based on the proposed framework has proven its strength in a commercial sign-off static timing analyzer and thus is helping hundreds of designers to achieve faster clock speeds of their chips...|$|R
