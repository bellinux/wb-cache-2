Student teachers practiced microteaching and classroom lessons three times within a period of teaching practice and the results were considered.

Microteaching is divided into three types, such as standard, reduction and magnification. Especially in reduction type some problems are pointed out. The trainees want to teach many more things in microteaching lessons despite {{a short period of time}} and their lessons tend to be teacher-centered by abstract explanations. Therefore, it is too difficult for trainees to notice significant points in lessons and the attainment of normal classroom lesson's object itself in microteaching is of too high grade for pupils to learn. Comparative investigation between microteaching and classroom lessons was done concerning their object, content, method and it must be emphasized that the evaluation of lessons based on their characters' differences is necessary for trainees...|$|R

Statistical methods employed in this study were general linear model, simple discriminant analysis, and principle component analysis were used to construct phylogenic trees. The results showed that Tomohon 2 ̆ 7 s horse population had higher body weights and body measurements (P< 0. 05) than those from three other areas (Manado, South Minahasa, and Minahasa).

The SAS software version 9. 1. 3 was used for data analysis, with the level of significance set at 5 % (p < 0. 05). Nursing students and professionals showed a vulnerability to TB related to knowledge about transmission, preventive and biosafety measures, and diagnosis of the disease.

40|$|Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a {{major cause}} of late-stage {{clinical}} drug attrition, market withdrawal, black-box warnings, and acute liver failure. Consequently, it has been an area of focus for toxicologists and clinicians for several decades. In spite of considerable efforts, limited improvements in DILI prediction have been made and efforts to improve existing preclinical models or develop new test systems remain a high priority. While prediction of intrinsic DILI has improved, identifying compounds with a risk for idiosyncratic DILI (iDILI) remains extremely challenging {{because of the lack of}} a clear mechanistic understanding and the multifactorial pathogenesis of idiosyncratic drug reactions. Well-defined clinical diagnostic criteria and risk factors are also missing. This paper summarizes key data interpretation challenges, practical considerations, model limitations, and the need for an integrated risk assessment. As demonstrated through selected initiatives to address other types of toxicities, opportunities exist however for improvement, especially through better concerted efforts at harmonization of current, emerging and novel in vitro systems or through the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategies</b> for implementation of preclinical DILI models across the pharmaceutical industry.
