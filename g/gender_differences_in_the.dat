25|$|Studies suggest <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reminiscence bump. Researchers {{found that}} men have more {{positive}} life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 {{but there is a}} small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; {{they want to}} move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality. College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no significant <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.|$|E

30|$|Previous studies did {{not find}} a <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{frequency}} of employer change; however they did find a <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> returns of employer changes. Men seem to benefit to more from changing employer than women (Loprest 1992; Del Bono and Vuri 2011; Johnston and Lee 2012; Merluzzi and Dobrev 2015). Both the frequency of job change and its return should, therefore, be examined {{in an analysis of}} <b>the</b> temporal changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gender pay gap.|$|R

25|$|Differences {{in sexual}} {{infidelity}} {{as a function}} of gender have been commonly reported. It is more common for men compared to women to engage in extradyadic relationships. The National Health and Social Life Survey found that 4% of married men, 16% of cohabiting men, and 37% of dating men engaged in acts of sexual infidelity compared to 1% of married women, 8% of cohabiting women, and 17% of women in dating relationships. These differences have been generally thought due to evolutionary pressures that motivate men towards sexual opportunity and women towards commitment to one partner. In addition, recent research finds that differences in gender may possibly be explained by other mechanisms including power and sensations seeking. For example, one study found that some women in more financially independent and higher positions of power, {{were also more likely to}} be more unfaithful to their partners. In another study, when the tendency to sensation seek (i.e., engage in risky behaviours) was controlled for, there were no <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> likelihood to being unfaithful. These findings suggest there may be various factors that might influence the likelihood of some individuals to engage in extradyadic relationships, and that such factors may account for observed gender differences beyond actual gender and evolutionary pressures associated with each.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{reports have}} found that adolescent, young adult, and middle-aged adult girls and {{women are more likely}} to be diagnosed with unipolar depression and report greater symptoms of depression when compared to boys and men of similar ages. What is less well-known is whether this <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> persists into late life. This literature review examines whether <b>the</b> well-known <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> unipolar depression continues into old age, and, if it does, whether the variables that are known to contribute to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> unipolar depression from adolescence through adulthood continue to contribute to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly, and/or whether there are new variables that arise in old age and contribute to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly. <b>In</b> this review of 85 empirical studies from every continent except for Antarctica, we find substantial support for <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression in individuals who are 60 and older. More research is necessary to determine which factors are the strongest predictors of <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression in late life, and particularly whether the factors that seem to be responsible for <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression in earlier life stages continue to predict <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly, and/or whether new factors come into play in late life.

Within [...] Generation Z, there were several important gender differences in sexual identity: young men {{were more likely to}} identify as completely heterosexual than young women (73% v. 59%) whereas young women had higher chances to identify as non-exclusively straight (19%) and bisexual (14%) than young men (10% and 5%, respectively). There were no significant <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> share identifying as predominantly or exclusively homosexual (5% for each sex), but Generation Z men {{were significantly more likely to}} refuse to disclose their sexual orientation (7%) than their female counterparts (3%). Significantly more white youth identified as exclusively homosexual (3%) than those of ethnic minority backgrounds (0%) but no other ethnic differences were found. Exclusively heterosexual youths were also less likely to describe themselves as fairly or very active in politics, but they were more likely to believe that they enjoy a better life than Millennials.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{variety of}} studies suggest the {{existence}} of a distinct phenotype of somatic depression, i. e., depression accompanied by significant somatic symptomatology. Previous research suggests that <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of depression is primarily due to a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> somatic depression. <b>The</b> aim {{of this study was to}} compare <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of somatic depression and of depression not accompanied by significant somatic symptomatology (labelled "pure" depression) in two representative samples, the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) and the Zurich Study. METHOD: <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> lifetime somatic depression was compared to that of pure depression based on analyses weighted back to <b>the</b> general population <b>in</b> two representative samples. The NCS-R analyses involved a narrow definition of somatic depression with items from the DSM criteria for depression [...] appetite, sleep, and fatigue. The analysis of the Zurich study added headaches, body image issues, and breathing difficulties to the criteria and comparison to atypical depression. RESULTS: <b>In</b> both samples, <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depressive prevalence was due to a large <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> somatic depression with other phenotypes showing little or no <b>gender</b> <b>difference.</b> The <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> were found to be due to the somatic symptoms rather than the number of symptoms and were much larger for somatic than for atypical depression. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of depression results from the higher prevalence among women of a specific phenotype, somatic depression...|$|R
