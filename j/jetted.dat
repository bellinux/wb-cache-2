40|$|Astrophysical <b>jets</b> reveal strong {{signs of}} radial structure. They {{suggest that the}} inner region of the <b>jet,</b> the <b>jet</b> spine, {{consists}} of a low-density, fast-moving gas, while the outer region of the <b>jet</b> consists of a more dense and slower moving gas, called the <b>jet</b> sheath. Moreover, if <b>jets</b> carry angular momentum, the resultant centrifugal forces lead to a radial stratification. Current observations {{are not able to}} fully resolve the radial structure, so little is known about its actual profile. We present three active galactic nuclei <b>jet</b> models in 2. 5 D of which two have been given a radial structure. The first model is a homogeneous <b>jet,</b> the only model that does not carry angular momentum; the second model is a spine-sheath <b>jet</b> with an isothermal equation of state; and the third <b>jet</b> model is a (piecewise) isochoric spine-sheath <b>jet,</b> with constant but different densities for <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath. In this paper, we look at the effects of radial stratification on <b>jet</b> integrity, mixing between the different <b>jet</b> components and global morphology of the jet-head and surrounding cocoon. We consider steady <b>jets</b> that have been active for 23 [*]Myr. All <b>jets</b> have developed the same number of strong internal shocks along their <b>jet</b> axis at the final time of simulation. These shocks arise when vortices are being shed by the jet-head. We find that all three <b>jets</b> maintain their stability {{all the way up to}} the jet-head. The isothermal <b>jet</b> maintains part of its structural integrity at the jet-head where the distinction between <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath material can still be made. In this case, mixing between <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath within the <b>jet</b> is fairly inefficient. The isochoric <b>jet,</b> on the other hand, loses its structural <b>jet</b> integrity fairly quickly after the <b>jet</b> is injected. At its jet-head, little structure is maintained and the central part of the <b>jet</b> predominantly consists of <b>jet</b> sheath material. In this case, <b>jet</b> spine and <b>jet</b> sheath material mix efficiently within the <b>jet.</b> We find that the propagation speed for all three models is less than expected from simple theoretical predictions. We propose this is due to an enlarged cross-section of the <b>jet</b> which impacts with the ambient medium. We show that in these models, the effective surface area is 16 times as large in the case of the homogeneous <b>jet,</b> 30 times as large in the case of the isochoric <b>jet</b> and can be up to 40 times as large in the case of the isothermal <b>jet...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is <b>jetted,</b> producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E
