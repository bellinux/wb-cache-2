5|$|The Labour Party {{came into}} {{government}} {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a working majority of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some <b>good</b> <b>decisions</b> during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E

She has since stated that there is a conspiracy with pharmaceutical companies and the medical community to cover-up vaccine related problems, because of financial incentives.

500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists {{as much as he}} did the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by <b>good</b> <b>decisions</b> made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E

A key problem is achieving <b>good</b> <b>decision</b> fitness within time and cost constraints. While many decision-making theories and processes address the fundamental decision-making process, there is limited research on improving the group decision-making framework to eliminate bias and promote effective communication. Using a collaborative approach built on systems engineering and decision-making theories, this thesis aims to improve the group decision-making framework to ensure <b>good</b> <b>decision</b> fitness and proper risk management. This thesis discusses how organizations in Singapore can make group decisions under time and cost constraints by leveraging efficient communication of information, considering the critical elements to ensure <b>good</b> <b>decision</b> fitness, and managing the decision loss quality through the computation of risk value.

Although alone it cannot guarantee successful decision making, SA does support the necessary input processes (e.g., cue recognition, situation assessment, prediction) upon which <b>good</b> <b>decisions</b> are based (Artman, 2000).|$|E
