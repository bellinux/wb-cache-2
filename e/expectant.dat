5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} to conceive {{a child of}} their own, Monica and Chandler discover that they are both infertile, and ultimately settle upon adoption as an alternative, deciding to adopt the yet-to-be-born child of <b>expectant</b> single mother Erica (Anna Faris). The couple is very much surprised when Erica gives birth to twins, and name the boy Jack after Monica's father, and the girl Erica after her birth mother.|$|E
50|$|Since April 2016 {{the first}} phase of the project in {{distribution}} of free medicines for <b>expectants,</b> nursing mothers and children and also the distribution of medical equipment for medical facilities has been realizing. Three medical institutions in Gorlovka have received all about 180 types of specialized medical equipment with a total value of approximately 15 million rubles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lie on!' {{cried the}} usurer, 'with your iron tongue! Ring merrily for births that make <b>expectants</b> writhe, and marriages {{that are made}} in hell, and toll ruefully for the dead whose shoes are worn already! Call men to prayers who are godly because not found out, and ring chimes for the coming in of every year that brings this cursed world nearer to its end. No bell or book for me! Throw me on a dunghill, and let me rot there, to infect the air!' ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{few moments}} more, and the throng of <b>expectants</b> {{was at the}} foot of the hall steps, just as the lanzknecht reached the arched entrance. His comrade Hans took his bridle, and almost lifted him from his horse; he reeled and {{stumbled}} as, pale, battered, and bleeding, he tried to advance to Freiherinn Kunigunde, and, in answer to her hasty interrogation, faltered out, [...] "Ill news, gracious lady. We have been set upon by the accursed Schlangenwaldern, and I am the only living man left." ...|$|R
5|$|Brown promised free {{prescription}} cancer medicines, {{which became}} available in January 2009, although concerns {{were raised in}} September that year that many patients entitled to such prescriptions were not benefiting from them. A Health in Pregnancy Grant which provided financial assistance to <b>expectant</b> mothers was also introduced. In 2008, a Local Housing Allowance for people on low incomes or on benefits who were renting from private landlords was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Every Mother Counts was {{released}} by Starbucks retail music concept and record label Hear Music in 2011. The collection serves as a companion piece to Christy Turlington's documentary film No Woman, No Cry (2010), which follows four <b>expectant</b> mothers in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Tanzania, and the United States, and the healthcare challenges they encounter. The album {{is the first in}} Starbucks series of the same name; Every Mother Counts 2012 {{was released}} the following year.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's wife, Catherine, {{had become}} {{well known in}} Oxford for her piety and {{ministry}} to <b>expectant</b> mothers. She also enjoyed carving faces into plum stones. She had died childless in the February before Vermigli left. Soon after Vermigli's departure, Cardinal Pole had her disinterred and thrown on a dungheap. Following the accession of Protestant Queen Elizabeth in 1558, she was re-interred with the relics of Saint Frithuswith in Christ Church Cathedral.|$|E
5000|$|He was consecrated {{archbishop}} on June 27, 404. Chrysostom, {{on hearing}} of it, denounced him [...] "as a spiritual adulterer, and a wolf in sheep's clothing". The diocese soon made it plain that they regarded the new archbishop as an intruder. With {{the exception of}} a few officials, the dependants of the court party, and the <b>expectants</b> of royal favour, the people of Constantinople refused to attend any religious assembly at which he might be expected to be present. Deserting the sacred edifices, they gathered in the outskirts of the city, and in the open air.|$|R
6000|$|The young {{commander}} was not deceived; {{for a light}} cutter, {{that played}} like a bubble on its element; was soon approaching the shore, where the three <b>expectants</b> were seated. When it was near enough to render sight perfectly distinct, and speech audible without an effort, the crew ceased rowing, and permitted the boat to lie {{in a state of}} rest. The mariner of the India-shawl then arose in the stern-sheets, and examined the thicket behind the party, with a curious and suspicious eye. After a sufficient search, he signed to his crew to force the cutter still nigher to the land, and spoke: ...|$|R
60|$|The bright sun-shine was {{sleeping}} in a thousand places on every side of the silent and deserted wreck. The sea had subsided to such a state of utter rest, {{that it was only}} at long intervals that the huge and helpless mass on which the ark of the <b>expectants</b> lay was lifted from its dull quietude, to roll heavily, for a moment, in the washing waters, and then to settle lower into the greedy and absorbing element. Still the disappearance of the hull was slow, and even tedious, to those who looked forward with such impatience to its total immersion, as to the crisis of their own fortunes.|$|R
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of <b>expectant</b> mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 1773, Edgeworth's {{first wife}} Anna Maria Elers {{gave birth to}} their fifth child, Anna Maria Edgeworth, {{at the age of}} 29. Ten days later she died from puerperal fever. Edgeworth was still in Lyon to avoid temptation leaving his <b>expectant</b> wife in the care of Day. On {{learning}} of the death of his wife, Edgeworth travelled to London, where he consulted Day as to Honora Sneyd's situation. On learning that she remained in good health and unattached, he promptly headed to Lichfield to see Honora at the Sneyds, with the intention of proposing. His offer was accepted immediately, and {{there was no mention of}} the conventional waiting period before remarrying after widowhood. Although Mr. Sneyd was opposed to his daughter's marriage, the couple were married at Lichfield Cathedral on 17 July 1773, officiated by Canon Thomas Seward, Anna Seward being a bridesmaid. After marrying, problems with the Edgeworth family estates in Ireland required the couple to immediately move to Edgeworthstown, County Longford in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by <b>expectant</b> mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
60|$|Manual, who {{had been}} at a loss how to {{construe}} {{the manner of the}} other, perceived at once a good deal of plain English in this request, and he dislodged one of Colonel Howard's dusty bottles, with a dexterity that denoted the earnestness of his purpose. Borroughcliffe had made a suitable provision of glasses; and extracting the cork in a certain scientific manner, he tendered to his companion a bumper of the liquor, before another syllable was uttered by either of the <b>expectants.</b> The gentlemen concluded their draughts with a couple of smacks, that sounded not unlike the pistols of two practised duellists, though certainly a much less alarming noise, when the entertainer renewed the discourse.|$|R
6000|$|It hath {{likewise}} been a maxim among politicians, [...] "That {{the great}} increase of {{buildings in the}} metropolis, argues a flourishing state." [...] But this, I confess, hath been controlled from the example of London; where, by the long and annual parliamentary session, such a number of senators, with their families, friends, adherents, and <b>expectants,</b> draw such prodigious numbers to that city, that the old hospitable custom of lords and gentlemen living in their ancient seats among their tenants, is almost lost in England; is laughed out of doors; insomuch that, {{in the middle of}} summer, a legal House of Lords and Commons might be brought in a few hours to London, from their country villas within twelve miles round.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{were the}} words which burst from the train, <b>expectants</b> all of them of similar grants {{at the expense of}} King Richard's {{followers}} and favourites, if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer also assented to the general proposition, observing, however, [...] "That the blessed Jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She was 'communis mater'--the mother of all Christians. But he saw not," [...] he declared, [...] "how the Knight of Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from this, since he" [...] (the Prior) [...] "was assured that the crusaders, under Richard, had never proceeded much farther than Askalon, which, as all the world knew, was a town of the Philistines, and entitled to none of the privileges of the Holy City." ...|$|R
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{also stated}} that the flag was once held in an iron chest, within Dunvegan Castle. The key to the chest was then always {{in the possession of}} the hereditary flag bearers. The c.1800 manuscript related how, on the death of the MacLeod chief Tormod, son of lain Breac, the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of Talisker. The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir, knowing herself to be pregnant (although she had only been married six weeks previous to her widowhood). In time, she gave birth to Tormod, the next chief. The c.1800 manuscript stated that at around this time, a man who wished to curry favour with the <b>expectant</b> heir (MacLeod of Talisker) attempted to steal the flag. Even though the Fairy Flag was later found, both the staff and iron chest were never seen again. Historically, the old chief, Tormod (son of Iain Breac), died in the autumn of 1706, and his son, Tormod, was born in July 1705.|$|E
5|$|HMS Shannon {{had been}} off Boston for 56 days and was running short of provisions, whilst the {{extended}} period at sea {{was wearing the}} ship down. She would be at a disadvantage facing USS Chesapeake, fresh from harbour and a refit. A boat was despatched carrying the invitation, manned by a Mr Slocum, a discharged American prisoner. The boat had not reached the shore when Chesapeake was seen underway, sailing out of the harbour. She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed 'Free Trade and Sailor's Rights'. Shannon carried 276 officers, seamen and marines of her proper complement, eight recaptured seamen, 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship, of whom only four could speak English, and 24 boys, of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age. Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels, {{with the aim of}} killing their gun crews, rather than attempting to disable the enemy ship by firing at the masts and rigging. This was, however, the standard Royal Navy practise of the time, only Broke's efficiency in gunnery training distinguished him in this regard. Lawrence, meanwhile, was confident in his ship, especially since she carried a substantially larger crew. Previous American victories over Royal Navy ships left him <b>expectant</b> of success. Just before the engagement, the American crew gave three cheers.|$|E
25|$|Cambor {{landed the}} lead as an <b>expectant</b> father on Notes from the Underbelly after the sitcom's creator had caught his {{performance}} in a Los Angeles production of The Cherry Orchard, opposite veteran actors Annette Bening and Alfred Molina. From 2006-2008, Cambor {{played the role of}} the <b>expectant</b> father, starring opposite Jennifer Westfeldt, in Notes from the Underbelly (on the ABC Television network).|$|E
5000|$|They were Arabs, {{belonging}} to the Bani Mazyad from the Powerful Banu Asad Tribe. They established themselves with {{the strength of their}} swords on the banks of Euphrates. They were the refuge of those who were in need of it, the shelter for the <b>expectants,</b> the helpers of those who sought help and supporters of the weak. People with expectation were attracted towards them and scholars found money with them. What they did in spending on good purpose is too well known and talks of their generosity too common. Sadaqa shook with pride when he listened to poetry and set aside for the poet a special part of his generosity. He made them free from poverty. He accepted them in his audience. He was all ears to listen to the requests of people and very generous in giving them what they needed.|$|R
60|$|But so {{the fact}} stands at present. It is plain that the court and country party here, (I mean in the House of Commons,) very seldom agree in {{anything}} but their loyalty to his present Majesty, their resolutions to make him and his viceroy easy in the government, to the utmost of their power, under the present condition of the kingdom. But the persons sent from England, who (to a trifle) are possessed of the sole executive power in all its branches, with their few adherents in possession who were born here, and hundreds of <b>expectants,</b> hopers, and promissees, put on quite contrary notions with regard to Ireland. They count upon a universal submission to whatever shall be demanded; wherein they act safely, because none of themselves, except the candidates, feel the least of our pressures.|$|R

Our {{primitive}} kitchen is a square wooden box, lined with clay, {{and filled with}} sand, upon which three or four large stones are placed to form a hearth. Preparations are now made for the evening meal, which is of the simplest description. A little rice, a few dates, or an onion, will keep a man alive in our position; a single [...] "good dinner" [...] would justify long odds against his seeing the next evening. Moreover, it is impossible in such cases to have an appetite-fortunately, as our store of provisions is a scanty one. Arabs consider it desirable on a journey to eat hot food once in the twenty-four hours; so we determine to cook, despite all difficulties. The operation, however, {{is by no means}} satisfactory; twenty <b>expectants</b> surround the single fire, and there is sure to be a quarrel amongst them every five minutes.|$|R
25|$|Soap was {{exhausted}} in 1941 and substituted with small quantities of poor quality French soap, skin complaints resulted. Babies, children, <b>expectant</b> mothers and invalids received different rations.|$|E
25|$|Lawry's unimaginative, deep field-settings for his spinners sent {{a highly}} <b>expectant,</b> eager-for-victory crowd of 65,000 home unhappy. Even the most loyal Victorian could see, and admit, that Lawry {{was not the}} captain to arrest those {{escaping}} Ashes.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} limerence {{results in a}} more {{intrusive}} thinking pattern. This thinking pattern is an <b>expectant</b> and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object‚Äôs admirable qualities: crystallization. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} funeral pomp set forth; saulies with their batons and gumphions of {{tarnished}} white crape, {{in honour of}} the well-preserved maiden fame of Mrs. Margaret Bertram. Six starved horses, themselves the very emblems of mortality, well cloaked and plumed, lugging along the hearse with its dismal emblazonry, crept in slow state towards the place of interment, preceded by Jamie Duff, an idiot, who, with weepers and cravat made of white paper, attended on every funeral, and followed by six mourning coaches, filled with the company. Many of these now gave more free loose to their tongues, and discussed with unrestrained earnestness {{the amount of the}} succession, and the probability of its destination. The principal <b>expectants,</b> however, kept a prudent silence, indeed ashamed to express hopes which might prove fallacious; and the agent or man of business, who alone knew exactly how matters stood, maintained a countenance of mysterious importance, as if determined to preserve the full interest of anxiety and suspense.|$|R
60|$|There is a fable told by Lucian, {{that while}} {{a troop of}} monkeys, well drilled by an {{intelligent}} manager, were performing a tragedy with great applause, the decorum of the whole scene was at once destroyed, and the natural passions of the actors called forth into very indecent and active emulation, by a wag who threw a handful of nuts upon the stage. In like manner, the approaching crisis stirred up among the <b>expectants</b> feelings of a nature very {{different from those of}} which, under the superintendence of Mr. Mortcloke, they had but now been endeavouring to imitate the expression. Those eyes which were lately devoutly cast up to heaven, or with greater humility bent solemnly upon earth, were now sharply and alertly darting their glances through shuttles, and trunks, and drawers, and cabinets, and all the odd corners of an old maiden lady's repositories. Nor was their search without interest, though they did not find the will of which they were in quest.|$|R

La mayor√≠a de las gestantes an√©micas (80, 74 %) se trataron con tabletas prenatales solamente y aportaron reci√©n nacidos con un peso menor de 3 000 g A descriptive {{cross-sectional study}} was conducted between January and September, 1998, {{in the area of}} the "Santos Su√°rez" Polyclinic in order to determine the prevalence of anemia in pregnant women, its relatioship with age, maternal nutritional state and birth weight. The sample was composed of 209 pregnant women that were caught in this period. The obstetric medical histories were reviewed and the data were collected in forms created to this end. The percentage calculstion was used for their processing. The prevalence of anemia among the studied <b>expectants</b> was of 64. 59 %. 83. 74 % were between 20 and 35 years old. Those pregnant women with initial weighted assessment (IWA) considered as low weight I-II-III-IV an adequate weight developed anemia with higher frequency. Haemoglobine from 109 to 100 g/L predominated during the 3 trimesters of pregnancy independently of I. W. A.

25|$|Hanks is {{perceived}} to be amiable and congenial to his fans.

6000|$|As I have fancied I {{could read}} the French {{character}} in the national palace of the Tuileries, so I have pictured to myself some of the traits of John Bull in his royal abode of Windsor Castle. The Tuileries, outwardly a peaceful palace, is in effect a swaggering military hold; while the old castle, on the contrary, {{in spite of its}} bullying look, is completely under petticoat government. Every corner and nook is built up into some snug, cozy nestling place, some [...] "procreant cradle," [...] not tenanted by meager <b>expectants</b> or whiskered warriors, but by sleek placemen; knowing realizers of present pay and present pudding; who seem placed there not to kill and destroy, but to breed and multiply. Nursery maids and children shine with rosy faces at the windows, and swarm about the courts and terraces. The very soldiers have a pacific look, and when off duty may be seen loitering about the place with the nursery-maids; not making love to them in the gay gallant style of the French soldiery, but with infinite bonhomie aiding them {{to take care of the}} broods of children.|$|R
60|$|The {{operation}} of this law, however certain, {{might be too}} slow. The present possessors might happen to be long-lived. The legislature knew the natural impatience of <b>expectants,</b> and upon this principle they gave encouragement to children to anticipate the inheritance. For it is provided, that the eldest son of any Papist shall, immediately on his conformity, change entirely the nature and properties of his father's legal estate: if he before held in fee simple, or, in other words, had the entire and absolute dominion over the land, he is reduced to an estate for his life only, with all {{the consequences of the}} natural debility of that estate, by which he becomes disqualified to sell, mortgage, charge, (except for his life,) or in any wise to do any act by which he may raise money for relief in his most urgent necessities. The eldest son, so conforming, immediately acquires, and in the lifetime of his father, the permanent part, what our law calls the reversion and inheritance of the estate; and he discharges it by retrospect, and annuls every sort of voluntary settlement made by the father ever so long before his conversion. This he may sell or dispose of immediately, and alienate it from the family forever.|$|R
6000|$|Arrayed, as {{her sons}} loved to see her, in black velvet, and with pearl-bordered cap, Christina sat by her aunt in the tapestried balcony, and between them stood or sat little Thekla von Adlerstein Wildschloss, whose father had {{entrusted}} her to their care, {{to see the}} procession pass by. A rich Eastern carpet, of gorgeous colouring, covered the upper balustrade, over which they leant, in somewhat close quarters with the scarlet-bodiced dames of the opposite house, but with ample space for sight {{up and down the}} rows of smiling <b>expectants</b> at each balcony, or window, equally gay with hangings, while the bells of all the churches clashed forth their gayest chimes, and fitful bursts of music were borne upon the breeze. Little Thekla danced in the narrow space for very glee, and wondered why any one should live in a cloister when the world was so wide and so fair. And Dame Johanna tried to say something pious of worldly temptations, and the cloister shelter; but Thekla interrupted her, and, clinging to Christina, exclaimed, [...] "Nay, but I am always naughty with Mother Ludmilla in the convent, and I know I should never be naughty out here with you and the barons; I should be so happy." ...|$|R
