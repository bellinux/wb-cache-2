50|$|An agarophyte is a seaweed, {{typically}} a red alga, {{that produces the}} hydrocolloid agar in its cell walls. This agar can be harvested commercially for use in biological experiments and culturing. In some countries (especially in the developing world), the harvesting of agarophytes, either as natural stocks or a cultivated crop, is of considerable economic importance. Notable genera of commercially exploited agarophytes include Gracilaria and <b>Gelidium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Seaweed {{farming is}} the {{practice}} of cultivating and harvesting seaweed. In its simplest form, it consists of the management of naturally found batches. In its most advanced form, it consists of fully controlling {{the life cycle of}} the algae. The main food species grown by aquaculture in Japan, China and Korea include <b>Gelidium,</b> Pterocladia, Porphyra, and Laminaria. Seaweed farming has frequently been developed as an alternative to improve economic conditions and to reduce fishing pressure and over exploited fisheries. Seaweeds have been harvested throughout the world as a food source as well as an export commodity for production of agar and carrageenan products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gelidium</b> amansii is an {{economically}} important species of red algae commonly found and harvested {{in the shallow}} coast (3 to 10 meters or 10 to 33 feet of depth below the water) of many east Asian countries including North and South Korea, China, Japan, Singapore, and northeast Taiwan. G. amansii is an important food source in East Asian countries and {{has been shown to}} have medicinal effects on dieting. This algae is used to make agar, whose components are the polysaccharide agarose and agaropectin, from the large amount of algin which is located in the algae's cell wall, as well it is sometimes served as part of a salad, puddings, jams, and other culinary dishes in producing regions. Agar is a gelatinous substance that is commercially used as an incubation matrix for microbials and other products that require an ecologically friendly gelatinous matrix. <b>Gelidium</b> amansii can be purple, red, to yellowish red because it contains the class of pigments known as anthocyanins instead of chlorophyll, which is commonly used by photosynthesizing organisms. Its branching body is cartilaginous and can grow up to a height of 8 to 30 centimeters or 3 to 12 inches. G. amansii may have 4 to 5 opposite compound lobed pinnate leaves on each branch. G. amansii is uniaxial with an apical cell and whorled cells coming from the axial towards the exterior of the algae. The pith is compacted with apical cells and the epidermis is formed by rounded whorled cells. G. amansii is being studied as a cheap biofuel.|$|E
5000|$|Agarose is {{available}} as a white powder which dissolves in near-boiling water, and forms a gel when it cools. Agarose exhibits the phenomenon of thermal hysteresis in its liquid-to-gel transition, i.e. it gels and melts at different temperatures. The gelling and melting temperatures {{vary depending on the}} type of agarose. Standard agaroses derived from <b>Gelidium</b> has a gelling temperature of 34 - 38 C and a melting temperature of 90 - 95 C, while those derived from Gracilaria, due to its higher methoxy substituents, has a gelling temperature of 40 - 52 C and melting temperature of 85 - 90 C. [...] The melting and gelling temperatures may be dependent on the concentration of the gel, particularly at low gel concentration of less than 1%. The gelling and melting temperatures are therefore given at a specified agarose concentration.|$|E
50|$|Returning to Ireland in 1939, de Valéra {{became an}} {{assistant}} {{in the department}} of natural history at University College Galway (UCG). Being the only botanist on the staff, de Valéra taught all of the botanical courses, with the work load doubling when the lectures were offered in Irish. Due to the workload, and her isolation from other phycologists, she did not publish during this time, but continued with fieldwork. In 1942 she reported the first record of Asparagopsis armata in the UK or Ireland. During World War II de Valéra was involved in a survey of marine algae as potential sources of agar on behalf of the Industrial Research Council from 1943 to 1946. Much of this fieldwork was carried own along the west coast of Ireland, and it led to her writing the foreword of Notes on some common Irish seaweeds in 1950. The work she conducted on Pterocladia and <b>Gelidium</b> during this time was the basis of her doctoral thesis, being awarded her PhD by NUI in 1945.|$|E
50|$|The {{marine iguana}} forages almost {{exclusively}} on algae in the inter- and subtidal zones, and 4-5 red algal species are their food of choice. During neap low tides, however, the usually avoided Ulva lobata, a species of green algae, is eaten more often since the preferred red algae are not easily available. Among the red algae genera often consumed are Centroceras, <b>Gelidium,</b> Grateloupia, Hypnea, Polysiphonia and Pterocladiella, and in some populations Ulva dominates the diet. Several other red, green and brown algae species have been recorded, and at least 10 genera of red and green algae are regularly consumed. The algal diet varies in accordance to the algal abundance, preferences and foraging behaviour, and this also depends on the season and exact island. Some species with chemical deterrents, such as Bifurcaria, Laurencia and Ochtodes, are actively avoided, but otherwise algal food choice mainly depends on energy content and digestibility. At Punta Espinoza on northeastern Fernandina Island {{it has been estimated}} that the approximately 2,000 marine iguanas eat about 28 tonnes per year, but this is counterbalanced by the very high growth rate of the algae. Rarely they may feed on crustaceans, insects, and sea lion feces and afterbirth. The population on North Seymour Island also feeds on the land plant Batis maritima and these iguanas have a higher survival rate during periods where their normal algal food is reduced. However, the hindgut of marine iguanas is specially adapted to algae feeding, likely restricting the possibility of efficiently switching to other plant types. In the first months after hatching, the juveniles mainly feed on feces from larger marine iguanas, gaining the endosymbiotic bacteria needed for digesting algae.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} notes {{refer to}} the typification of the two oldest species names applied in the genus <b>Gelidium,</b> including also comments on other related topics. <b>Gelidium</b> {{is probably the most}} confused genus, both nomenclaturally and taxonomically, of the Rhodophyta. This investigation began in an attempt to determine the correct names to be applied to the British species of the genus, but it was soon discovered that a much wider geographical consideration was necessary. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the help and assistance which has been afforded by Dr. J. Th. Koster in this and other investigations, over a period of many years. Extreme ecological and seasonal polymorphism are the principal causes of the present situation in the genus <b>Gelidium.</b> Extensive fieldwork over the past seventeen years has given some indication of the limits of taxa (Dixon, 1958, 1966), in so far as the European representatives are concerned. The nomenclatural problems are, however, still largely untouched. The purpose of the present paper is to examine critically the typification of the two oldest epithets referred to the genus <b>Gelidium.</b> These are: 1. cartilagineum, based on Fucus cartilagineus Linnaeus (1753), 2. corneum, based on Fucus corneus Hudson (1762) ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} species of {{macroalga}} grow in marine ecosystem and potentially as raw material for bioethanol resource. Bioethanol is a conversion result of carbohydrate, one of macroalgae biomass content. The exploration of macroalgae require information about  growth rate ability to determine availability in the nature. This research analyze growth rate and carbohydrate content of marine macroalga <b>Gelidium</b> latifolium on cultivation using varied injection {{of carbon dioxide and}} aeration. The treatments were control (K), 2000 cc CO 2 injection and aeration (P 1), 3000 cc CO 2 injection and aeration (P 2), 2000 cc CO 2 injection without aeration (P 3), and 3000 cc CO 2 injection without aeration (P 4). Samples weight were 3 gram in early cultivation on laboratorium scale for 42 days observation. The results showed that the daily growth rate <b>Gelidium</b> latifolium during the study ranged from 0. 02 - 1. 06 %. The highest daily growth rate was 1. 06 ± 0. 14 % (P 2). Carbohydrate yield was 18. 23 % in early cultivation then 19. 40 % (K and P 2), 20. 40 % (P 1), 16. 87 % (K 3), and 16. 40 % (P 4) after cultivation. The high of carbohydrates value may not guarantee the sustainable <b>Gelidium</b> latifolium biomass utilization as raw material for bioethanol production because of the low growth rate, thus it is necessary to modified and encourage cultivation method effectively.

40|$|The {{value of}} any seaweed crop is {{enhanced}} by the name under which the seaweed is sold, for the kind {{and quality of the}} seaweed product is announced with its name. Thus, though chemists may say that the agar from <b>Gelidium</b> species is the same as that from Gracilaria species, industry will pay more for <b>Gelidium</b> than for Gracilaria. (It might be so because the agarose fraction is higher in <b>Gelidium,</b> and agarose commands a higher price on its own.) In the case of the seaweeds that produce the colloid carrageenan, some species form only kappa-carrageenan (which produces a firm gel), others produce only iota- carrageenan (which forms a soft gel), and still others form only lambda-carrageenan (which does not gel). In geographic areas or developing countries where the identity of seaweeds is not known or is uncertain, the economic potential for using this untapped seaweed resource is unrealized. For Japan and China, on the contrary, which have and use many named seaweed species, the financial gain in the world market can be more easily accomplished, since demand for certain colloids currently exceeds supply. One of Chile's major exports is seaweed, sold for extraction of colloids in other countries. We chose to focus on the four economically important seaweeds that have warm-water representatives because the useful temperate algae are fairly well known and do not have taxonomic or nomenclatural problems that approach those in the tropics.
