While Central Storage is limited to 2GB additional memory can be configured as <b>expanded</b> <b>storage.</b> With <b>Expanded</b> <b>Storage</b> 4KB pages can be moved between Central <b>Storage</b> and <b>Expanded</b> <b>Storage.</b> <b>Expanded</b> <b>Storage</b> can be used for a number of things such as ultra-fast paging, for disk caching and virtual disks within the VM/CMS operating system.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} way to learn automatically grapheme-to-phoneme mapping rules for English by using Kohonen's concept of <b>Dynamically</b> <b>Expanding</b> Context. This method constructs rules that are most general in the sense of an explicitly defined specificity hierarchy. As the hierarchy, we have used the amount of expanding context around the symbol to be transformed, weighted towards the right. To apply this concept to English text-to-speech mapping, we have used the 20008 -word corpus provided in the public domain by Sejnowski and Rosenberg, that was also used in the NETTALK-experiments. Phoneme-level mapping accuracies of 91 per cent with data not used in training demonstrate that the <b>Dynamically</b> <b>Expanding</b> Context is able to capture quite efficiently the contextdependent relationships in the corpus. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem addressed in this paper is automatic learning of grapheme-to-phoneme mapping rules.

40|$|Most CBR systems {{rely on a}} fixed {{library of}} cases, where each case {{consists}} {{of a set of}} facts specified in advance. This paper describes techniques for dynamically extracting cases for analogical reasoning from general-purpose knowledge bases, and <b>dynamically</b> <b>expanding</b> them during the course of analogical reasoning. These techniques have several advantages: (1) Knowledge authoring is simplified, since facts can be added without regard to which case(s) they will be used in. (2) Reasoning is more efficient, since task constraints can be used during case extraction to focus on facts likely to be relevant. (3) Larger problems can be tackled, since cases can be <b>dynamically</b> <b>expanded</b> with more details during the matching process itself, rather than starting with completely detailed cases. We describe algorithms for case extraction and case expansion, including how a version of the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) has been modified to incorporate this new matching technique. The utility of this technique is illustrated by results obtained with two large knowledge bases, created by other groups, and used to answer questions in the DARPA High...|$|R
