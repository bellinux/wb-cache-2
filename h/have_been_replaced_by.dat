5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was transposed from C major to E-flat major at Leipzig, where the recorders may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> transverse flutes.|$|E

5|$|For years Oldham's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and mechanical engineering. Since the deindustrialisation of Oldham in the mid-20th century, these industries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> home shopping, publishing, healthcare and food processing sectors, though factory-generated employment retains a significant presence. Many of the modern sectors are low-skill and low-wage.|$|E
5|$|Maes {{stated that}} time proved Rimsky-Korsakov correct {{when it came}} to posterity's re-evaluation of Mussorgsky's work. Mussorgsky's musical style, once {{considered}} unpolished, is now admired for its originality. While Rimsky-Korsakov's arrangement of Night on Bald Mountain is still the version generally performed, Rimsky-Korsakov's other revisions, like his version of Boris Godunov, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Mussorgsky's original.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres was {{the first}} tyre {{manufacturer}} {{in the world to}} fully eliminate high-aromatic oils from its production process. Used as plasticising agents in tread production and to facilitate the compounding of rubber, they contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a carcinogen, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> low-aromatic oils. In 2006, Nokian Tyres received a commendation in the Finnish round of the European Business Awards for the Environment.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the end of}} the 1870s, much of the {{original}} land grant <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> tracts of 40 acre. By 1880, cattle raising <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> agriculture as the most important local industry. During the years between 1910 and 1940, most of the agricultural land <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> homes and factories.|$|R

5|$|On Cape Cod, Vonnegut made most of {{his money}} writing pieces for {{magazines}} such as Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and Cosmopolitan. He also did a stint as an English teacher, wrote copy for an advertising agency, and opened the first American Saab dealership, which eventually failed. In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory workers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> machines.|$|E
5|$|Since the deindustrialisation of {{the region}} in the mid-20th century, these {{industries}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> newer sectors and industries, although many of the civic developments that accompanied industrialisation remain in the form of public buildings; a town hall, public baths and library. The few surviving cotton mills are now occupied by warehousing and distribution companies, or used as space for light industry.|$|E
5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E

5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E
5|$|However, {{their larger}} sizes and very {{aggressive}} behavior also {{make them a}} serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, YouTube {{introduced}} videos {{playing at}} 60 frames per second, {{in order to}} reproduce video games with a frame rate comparable to high-end graphics cards.

The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, SMRT Corporation and Land Transport Authority (LTA) {{announced}} that the last ten refurbished trainsets would have one-third of their seats replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space. The move was justified on grounds of allowing more standing space onboard during peak-hour services. The reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters; the decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against the operator and LTA. As of December 2015, all 66 C151s from one-third of their seats <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> metal bars to create extra standing space.|$|E
5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E
5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E

5|$|The boards on the {{exterior}} of the barn are made from a mixture of oak, elm and softwoods such as pine and fir. Some are of modern or relatively modern origins; those on {{the south end of the}} barn are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and are the result of the repairs made after the 1972 fire. Each side of the barn's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76,000 tiles, which were originally held in place by oak pegs. Many of the tiles have been replaced over the years and the oak pegs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> galvanised peg nails due to the effects of decay.|$|E
5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk {{encased in a}} horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
5|$|A youth named Guybrush Threepwood {{arrives on}} the fictional Mêlée Island™, {{with the desire}} to become a pirate. He seeks out the island's pirate leaders, who set him three trials that must be {{completed}} to become a pirate: winning a sword duel against Carla, the island's resident swordmaster, finding a buried treasure, and stealing a valuable idol from the governor's mansion. These quests take Guybrush throughout the island, where he hears of stories of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck, who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious Monkey IslandTM, an act that was meant to win the love of the governor Elaine Marley. Guybrush meets several characters of interest, including a local voodoo priestess, Stan the Used Boat Salesman, Carla the Sword Master, a prisoner named Otis, and Meathook, whose hands <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> hooks.|$|E
