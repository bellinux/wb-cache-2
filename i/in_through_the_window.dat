5|$|Home met one of {{his future}} closest friends in 1867; the young Lord Adare (later the 4th Earl of Dunraven). Adare was fascinated by Home, and began documenting the séances they held. The {{following}} year, Home {{was said to have}} levitated out of the third storey window of one room, and back <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the adjoining room in front of three witnesses (Adare, Captain Wynne, and Lord Lindsay).|$|E
25|$|Colombina's husband Pagliaccio {{has gone}} away until morning, and Taddeo {{is at the}} market. She anxiously awaits her lover Arlecchino, who comes to serenade her from beneath her window.

25|$|He {{responded to}} these criticisms by attacking his detractors {{in the pages}} of Murray's Magazine, {{supporting}} vigilante activity, which the police on the streets knew was a bad idea, and publicly complaining about his lack of control of CID, which brought an official Home Office reprimand for discussing his office publicly without permission. Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent on the force visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn of phrase as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a rent collector who looked <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of her room in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E
2500|$|Rolf, a young messenger, {{delivers}} a telegram and then meets with the oldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims {{he knows what}} is right for her {{because he is a}} year older than she ("Sixteen Going on Seventeen"). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings [...] "The Lonely Goatherd" [...] to distract them.|$|E
2500|$|Her friend's {{attitude}} immediately {{takes on}} a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters. [...] He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who was staring at her in the club. [...] She quickly wakes up from the dream, only to see that the television is playing what it was {{at the start of the}} dream and the phone is ringing with her mother on the other end as the black cat comes <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

50|$|Attack on SDLP {{councillor}}'s office - In January 2002, SDLP councillor P. J.

Then she returned to Hannah, who seized her.|$|R
2500|$|The main depot-laying {{journey of}} the {{expedition}} began in September 1915. Although privately recording that he thought the programme to be followed [...] "impossible", Hayward threw his physical might into the job. He {{was one of the}} party of six that undertook the longest stage of the depot-laying journey, from 80°S to the Beardmore Glacier. This journey was completed on 26 January 1916. On the return journey Mackintosh and parson/photographer Arnold Spencer-Smith fell victims to scurvy and had to be carried on the sledge, drawn by Joyce, Ernest Wild, Dick Richards and Hayward. When the food situation became acute Hayward, by now showing scurvy symptoms himself, nevertheless went forward with Joyce and Richards to obtain life-saving food and fuel {{for the rest of the}} party. [...] Eventually, after suffering both physical and mental breakdown, Hayward was lashed to the sledge and on 18 March was hauled to the shelter at Hut Point where, since the doorway was iced up, he was hoisted <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Spencer-Smith died and was buried in the ice; Mackintosh barely survived. Joyce had expected Hayward to die, but he too survived.|$|E
2500|$|Items {{found in}} Toole's car {{show that he}} drove to California where he visited the Hearst family mansion and then to Milledgeville, Georgia. Here he most likely {{attempted}} to visit Andalusia, the home of deceased writer Flannery O'Connor, although her house was not open to the public. This was succeeded by a drive toward New Orleans. It was during this trip that he stopped outside Biloxi, Mississippi, and committed suicide by running a garden hose from the exhaust pipe <b>in</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his car on March 26, 1969. His car and person were immaculately clean, and the police officers who found him reported that his face {{showed no signs of}} distress. An envelope discovered in the car was marked [...] "to my parents". The suicide note inside the envelope was destroyed by his mother, who later gave varying vague accounts of its details. In one instance she said it expressed his [...] "concerned feeling for her" [...] and later she told a Times-Picayune interviewer that the letter was [...] "bizarre and preposterous. Violent. Ill-fated. Ill-fated. Nothing. Insane ravings." [...] He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in New Orleans. A few years earlier, Toole had driven his army buddy David Kubach to the exact spot where he would later commit suicide. As the location was unremarkable, Kubach did not understand why Toole had taken him there. He left his parents a $2,000 life-insurance policy, several thousand dollars in savings, and his car. Toole's funeral service was private and only attended by his parents and his childhood nursemaid Beulah Matthews. The students and faculty at Dominican College were grief-stricken over Toole's death, and the school held a memorial service for him in the college courtyard. The head of Dominican gave a brief eulogy; however, as the institution was Catholic, his suicide was never mentioned.|$|E

50|$|The only {{surviving}} civilian {{account of}} the siege is from Dean Bernard, a Protestant cleric, though a Royalist.

They then broke into the house firing their weapons, but were stopped from killing those inside when an officer known to Bernard identified them as Protestants. The fate of Irish Catholic civilians may therefore have been worse.|$|R
