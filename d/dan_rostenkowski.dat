The group also investigated the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski.</b> Later, he, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the Contract with America in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Blagojevich {{surrendered}} {{his seat}} in the state house to campaign in , based on the North Side. The district had long been represented by <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski,</b> who {{served as chairman of}} the House Ways and Means Committee. Rostenkowski was defeated for re-election in 1994 after pleading guilty to mail fraud and had been succeeded by Republican Michael Patrick Flanagan. However, Flanagan was a conservative Republican representing a heavily Democratic district, and was regarded as a heavy underdog. Blagojevich soundly defeated Flanagan by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, with support from his father-in-law. He was elected two more times, taking 74% against a nominal Republican challenger in 1998 and having only a Libertarian opponent in 2000.|$|E
25|$|By 1967, {{there were}} nine Polish Americans in Congress {{including}} four from the Chicago area. The three best known were Democrats who specialized in foreign policy, taxes and environmentalism. Clement J. Zablocki of Milwaukee served 1949–83, and became chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1977 {{until his death in}} 1983; although liberal on domestic issues, he was a hawk regarding the Vietnam War. <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski</b> served 1959–95, and became chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the tax laws. His father was an influential alderman and party leader from the center of Polonia on the Northwest side of Chicago. Even more influential has been John Dingell of Detroit, who was first elected to Congress in 1955 and is still there (with the second longest tenure on record). A liberal Democrat known for hard-hitting investigations, Dingell has been a major voice in economic, energy, medical and environmental issues. His father John D. Dingell, Sr. held the same seat in Congress from 1933 to 1955. He was the son of Marie and Joseph A. Dzieglewicz, Polish immigrants.|$|E
500|$|In 1981, Rangel {{shifted to}} become {{chairman}} of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, which gave him power {{in dealing with the}} Reagan administration's cuts in social spending. [...] By 1983 he was the third-ranking member on Ways and Means, and worked well with its powerful chairman, <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski.</b> [...] Rangel also became a protégé of Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, who made him Deputy Majority Whip that same year. [...] In the United States presidential election, 1984, Rangel supported former Vice President Walter Mondale, rather than the primary campaign of Jesse Jackson.|$|E
500|$|In late 2008 {{and again}} in September 2009, the {{government}} watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Rangel one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress. [...] Media pieces compared Rangel's woes with those unethical former Ways and Means chairs Wilbur Mills and <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski.</b> [...] Pelosi, a long-time friend of Rangel's, withheld any possible action against Rangel pending the House Ethics Committee report. [...] Rangel evinced impatience with that body, saying [...] "I don't have a complaint now, except that it's taking too goddamn long to review this thing and report back." ...|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{is known}} as an energetic, genial, and sociable politician, one {{who is able to}} gain {{friendship}} and influence by means of charm, humor, and candor. [...] He is called [...] "Charlie" [...] by everyone in Congress, from the highest-ranking members to the custodial employees. [...] Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski</b> said, [...] "Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you to change your position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is." [...] The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called [...] "Rangeling" [...] by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. [...] Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide Chris Matthews said these members were [...] "tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent." ...|$|E
500|$|Kemp had {{his first}} {{encounter}} with supply-side economics in 1976, when The Wall Street Journals Jude Wanniski interviewed him at his Congressional office. [...] Kemp questioned Wanniski all day (until midnight, at Kemp's Bethesda, Maryland home) and was eventually converted to University of Southern California professor Arthur Laffer's supply-side discipline. Thereafter, Kemp espoused supply-side economics freely, and in 1978 he and Sen. Bill Roth of Delaware proposed tax-cutting legislation. Kemp has been credited as responsible for supply-side economics' inclusion in President Reagan's economic plan, although {{at the time of}} Robert Mundell's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to Mundell, Laffer, Robert Bartley, and Wanniski. In 1979, Kemp wrote An American Renaissance (...) , to deliver his message that [...] "A rising tide lifts all boats." [...] Although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to Reagan, they were initiated by Kemp and Roth through their 1981 Kemp–Roth Tax Cut legislation. Reagan's budget based on this legislation passed over the objection of United States House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski.</b>|$|E

Chicago's Taste of Polonia festival is celebrated at the Copernicus Foundation, in Jefferson Park, every Labor Day weekend. Nearly 3 million people of Polish descent {{live in the}} area between Chicago and Detroit, including Northern Indiana, a part of the Chicago metropolitan area. [...] The community has played a role as a staunch supporter of the Democratic machine, and has been rewarded with several congressional seats. [...] The leading representative has been Congressman <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski,</b> {{one of the most powerful}} members of Congress (1959 to 1995), especially on issues of taxation, before he went to prison.|$|E
2500|$|Politics in {{the state}} have been infamous for highly visible {{corruption}} cases, {{as well as for}} crusading reformers, such as governors Adlai Stevenson and James R. Thompson. In 2006, former Governor George Ryan was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a -year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor Rod Blagojevich was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President Barack Obama to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. [...] In the late 20th century, Congressman <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski</b> was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge Otto Kerner, Jr. was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State Paul Powell was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) Orville Hodge was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor Len Small was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.|$|E
2500|$|The 29, {{also known}} as the [...] "Vrdolyak 29", were led by Alderman Ed Vrdolyak and Finance Chair Edward Burke. Parks {{superintendent}} Edmund Kelly also opposed the mayor. The three were known as [...] "the Eddies" [...] and were supported by the younger Daley (now State's Attorney), U.S. Congressmen <b>Dan</b> <b>Rostenkowski</b> and William Lipinski, and much of the Democratic Party. During his first city council meeting, Washington and the 21 supportive aldermen walked out of the meeting after a quorum had been established. Vrdolyak and the other 28 then chose committee chairmen and assigned aldermen to the various committees. Later lawsuits submitted by Washington and others were dismissed because it was determined that the appointments were legally made. Washington ruled by veto. The 29 lacked the 30th vote they needed to override Washington's veto; female and African American aldermen supported Washington despite pressure from the Eddies. Meanwhile, in the courts, Washington kept the pressure on to reverse the redistricting of city council wards that the city council had created during the Byrne years. During special elections in 1986, victorious Washington-backed candidates in the first round ensured at least 24 supporters in the city council. [...] Six weeks later, when Marlene Carter and Luís Gutiérrez won run-off elections, Washington had the 25 aldermen he needed. His vote as president of the City Council enabled him to break 25-25 tie-votes and enact his programs.|$|E
