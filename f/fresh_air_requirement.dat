The advantages of using a displacement ventilation system include increased cost effectiveness in operation, improved air quality within occupied zone, greater operational efficiency, ability to conceal, quiet, and finally flexibility. The minimum <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirement</b> at CH2 is 22.5 litres/second/person. This is much higher than the Australian Standard of 10 litres/second/person (AS 1668.2)The higher turnover rate was chosen because research has shown that low fresh air requirements can be directly linked to low productivity and sickness, including colds and flu.|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{office building}} design, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirements</b> are estimated for full occupancy in the building. Typically, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirements</b> range from 5 to 15 {{cubic feet per}} minute per person expected to occupy the building. While the design total amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> used is satisfactory for full occupancy of the building, there are many instances less than the design occupancy. Thus, there may be many instances in a commercial building where more <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> is used than is actually required because the occupancy is below the design occupancy. In hot and humid climates, such as the Gulf Southwest, a considerable portion of the cooling energy in a commercial building is expended cooling and dehumidifying the air needed to maintain <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirements.</b> If {{the total amount of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> could be reduced to just match that needed by the number of occupants in a building, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the energy use for cooling. This paper summarizes the design and use of an occupancy counter/transmitter that can be used to count the number of people entering/leaving a building and make adjustments in the amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> used in the building.

This is {{the first}} of a series of four papers that {{describe}} a 3 -year EU-funded research project into the application of passive downdraught evaporative cooling to non- domestic buildings. In this paper various evaporative cooling techniques are reviewed. By spraying fine drop lets of water at the top of atria, a downdraught of air cooled by evaporation can be produced. Such direct eva porative cooling using an evaporation tower appears to be a suitable approach for partly displacing the need for air-conditioning in hot, dry climates. It can satisfy <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirements</b> and reduce or eliminate demand for mechanical cooling. Examples of this cooling technique in Southern Europe and the Middle East have already demonstrated its operation and potential energy sav ings.

50|$|Warm, {{moist air}} is {{drawn into the}} unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a {{crossflow}} plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the extracted air close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is determined either by legislation on <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirements,</b> or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. <b>Fresh</b> <b>air</b> is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the supply fan (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the extract air from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process {{as well as the}} energy input to the compressor. The warm dry air is then discharged to the room.|$|R

The paper focuses on the effects of occupation rate profiles with IEQ thermal parameters; (those are air dry-bulb temperatures, relative humidity, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirements,</b> and local <b>air</b> velocities), on yearly energy demands. It is applied on, in-service, real project as a case study " 10 -Stories Hostel of 6000 m 2 built-up area" that is utilized by Non-Local students as a transferred Egyptian citizens [EC] from different governorates. It was concluded that. during energy simulation, occupation rate schedules and operation profiles for each source of heat inside space shall simulate the reality. These profiles and schedules should be added to the local energy code as a guideline for designers. Although in this case study results from simulation task reach the real bills, but sometimes, with multi-use apartments there is another required schedule for the Pre-Action days. Those days before holidays and feasts on which the air conditioning system shall operate in a certain procedure for cleaning or scavenging. Another important issue is the effect of Effective Temperatures [ET] (Temperature for constant thermal sensations) that could implement to reduce the cooling capacity by increasing the room temperature against indoor relative humidity for the same comfort sensation. These two concepts will save 17 % to 22 % of the project total energy demand, In addition to introducing new design criteria for acceptable indoor conditions in the new rural developed zones in Egypt and similar regions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the potential market for the dual-service residential integrated water heater/dehumidifier (WHD). Its principal purpose is to evaluate the extent to which this integrated appliance might penetrate the residential market sector, given current market trends, producer and consumer attributes, and technical parameters. The report's secondary purpose is to gather background information leading to a generic framework for conducting market analyses of technologies. This framework can be used to assess market readiness as well as factor preferred product attributes into the design to drive consumer demand for this product. This study also supports analysis for prototype design. A full market analysis for potential commercialization should be conducted after prototype development. The integrated WHD is essentially a heat-pump water heater (HPWH) with components and controls that allow dedicated dehumidification. Adequate residential humidity control is a growing issue for newly constructed residential homes, which are insulated so well that mechanical ventilation may be necessary to meet <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirements.</b> Leveraging its successful experience with the energy-efficient design improvement for the residential HPWH, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL's) Engineering Science and Technology Division's (ESTD's) Building Equipment Group designed a water-heating appliance that combines HPWH efficiency with dedicated dehumidification. This integrated appliance could be a low-cost solution for dehumidification and efficient electric water heating. ORNL is partnering with Western Carolina University, Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, American Carolina Stamping Company, and Clemson University to develop this appliance and assess its market potential. For practical purposes, consumers are indifferent to how water is heated but are very interested in product attributes such as initial first cost, operating cost, performance, serviceability, product size, and installation costs. The principal drivers for penetrating markets are demonstrating reliability, leveraging the dehumidification attributes of the integrated WHD, and creating programs that embrace first-cost and life-cycle cost principles...|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} air-conditioning system, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{volume is}} always restricted to save energy, which sacrifices {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) to some extent. However, removing the latent load of air by liquid desiccant rather than by cooling is an alternative way of reducing energy consumption. Therefore, IAQ can be improved by increasing the volume of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> introduced into an air-conditioning system. In this paper, a liquid desiccant based air-conditioning system is studied, with the system performance under various <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratios analyzed using simulation tests. In addition, the proposed system and a conventional system are compared. In the proposed system, {{with the increase in}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio, the heating load for solution regeneration rises, the dehumidification efficiency increases and the regeneration efficiency drops. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the liquid desiccant based system decreases sharply when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio exceeds 60 %.
