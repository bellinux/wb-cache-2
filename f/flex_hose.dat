40|$|As the {{provision}} of potable water is critical for successful habitation of the International Space Station (ISS), life support systems were installed in December 2008 to recycle both humidity from the atmosphere and urine to conserve available water in the Station. In-flight pre-consumption testing from the dispensing needle at the Potable Water Dispenser (PWD) indicated that bacterial concentrations exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 colony-forming units (CFU) ml- 1. Subsequent investigations revealed that a corrugated stainless steel <b>flex</b> <b>hose</b> upstream of the dispensing needle in the PWD was filled with nonsterile water and left {{at room temperature for}} more than 1 month before launch. To simulate biofilm formation that was suspected in the flight system, sterile flex hoses were seeded with a consortium of bacterial isolates previously recovered from other ISS water systems, including Ralstonia pickettii, Burkholderia multivorans, Caulobacter vibrioides, and Cupriavidus pauculus. After incubation for 5 days, the hoses were challenged with various chemical disinfectants including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), colloidal silver, and buffered pH solutions to determine the ability of the disinfectants to decrease and maintain bacterial concentrations below ISS specifications.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} of a <b>flex</b> <b>hose</b> {{that will be}} used in the umbilical arms of the Space Launch Systems mobile launcher needed to be determined in order to properly qualify ground umbilical plate behavior during vehicle separation post T- 0. This data is also necessary to properly size and design the motors used to retract the umbilical arms. Therefore an experiment was created to determine the {{stiffness of}} the hose. Before the test apparatus for the experiment could be built, the structure had to be analyzed to ensure it would not fail under given loading conditions. The design model was imported into the analysis software and optimized to decrease runtime while still providing accurate rest~lts and allow for seamless meshing. Areas exceeding the allowable stresses in the structure were located and modified before submitting the design for fabrication. In addition, a mock up of a deep space habitat and the support frame was designed and needed to be analyzed for structural integrity under different loading conditions. The load cases were provided by the customer and were applied to the structure after optimizing the geometry.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine how technology innovations, potential risks, plant configuration and size, operating strategy, and financial incentives affect the electricity output, financial payback, and net energy performance of a concentrating solar power plant. A set of engineering performance, financial and net energy models were developed as tools to predict a plant?s engineering performance, cost and energy payback. The models were validated by comparing the predicted results to operational data from an actual solar power plant. The models were {{used to analyze the}} effect of several combinations of design and operating parameters on the amount and cost of electrical output. In addition, they were used to assess the risk of particular component failures and their effect on plant engineering and financial performance, and to conduct an analysis to predict energy payback. The results show some fundamental conclusions. First, the electricity production could be improved by adjusting plant configuration, increase the storage system size and increase the scale of plant. Second, the cost of electricity generated from a CSP plant will be higher (as much as 400 %) than that of fossil fuel based power plants. Several methods could be used to lower the cost, such as constructing large plants, adopting new material and innovation components. However, the cost reduction will not be enough. Survival and future development of CSP plants may rely on external support, which might include incentives or supportive policies. Third, generally a CSP plant will have a positive net energy with an energy payback of approximately 5 years. Last, <b>flex</b> <b>hoses</b> are the most vulnerable components in the solar field.

40|$|The part-load {{behavior}} of a typical 30 -MWe SEGS (solar electric generating systems) plant was studied using a detailed thermodynamic model. As part of this analysis, a new solar field model was derived, based on measurement results of an LS- 2 Collector and accounting for various conditions of receiver tubes, lost mirrors and measured reflectivity. A comparison {{was made of the}} model results to real plant conditions for a winter and summer day in order to test the accuracy of the model. The effects of bare tubes, different wind speeds, mirror reflectivity and other factors were studied showing, e. g., that heat losses due to wind are predicted to be very low. The comparison also shows that the model still lacks the capability to fully account for actual solar field conditions. The model was also compared to the SOLERGY model, showing differences between the assumptions used in both models. Finally different operating conditions of the plant were studied for a summer, fall, and winter day to provide {{a better understanding of how}} changing solar field outlet temperatures affect gross and net output of the plant. This clearly indicates that the lowest possible superheating temperature maximizes the gross electric output. On a net basis this conclusion is modified due to the high parasitics of the HTF (heat transfer fluid) pumps. It was found that the optimum operating strategy depends on the insolation conditions, e. g., different superheating temperatures should be chosen in summer, fall and winter. If the pressure drop in the solar field is reduced due to replacement of <b>flex</b> <b>hoses</b> with ball joints, increasing the HTF flow is more reasonable, so that at low isolation conditions the lowest possible superheating temperature also leads to the maximum net output...|$|R

The original aqueous IATCS coolant used in Node 1, the Laboratory Module, and the Airlock consisted of water, borate (pH buffer), phosphate (corrosion control), and silver sulfate (microbiological control) at a pH of 9. 5 +/- 0. 5. Chemical changes occurred after on-orbit implementation including a decrease to pH 8. 4 due to the diffusion of carbon dioxide through the Teflon hoses, an increase in nickel ions due to general corrosion of heat exchanger braze coatings, a decrease in phosphate concentration due to precipitation of nickel phosphate, and the rapid disappearance of silver ions due to deposition on hardware surfaces. Also associated with the coolant chemistry changes {{was an increase in}} planktonic microorganisms from less than 100 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml to approximately 1 million CFU per 100 ml. Attachment and growth of microorganisms to the system surfaces (biofilm) was suspected due to the levels of planktonic microorganisms in the coolant. Biofilms can reduce coolant flow, reduce heat transfer, amplify degradation of system materials initiated by chemical corrosion, and enhance mineral scale formation...|$|E
40|$|The present master’s thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} new test rig for the {{investigation}} of durability and failure mechanisms of flexible pipe connections – so called Rotation and Expansion Performing Assemblies (REPAs) –, which are utilized in Parabolic Trough Collector power plants. Said assemblies compensate for the motion of the absorber tubes relative to the fixed piping of the header connection. The work focusses on the test rig’s design in view of a realistic simulation of all loads a REPA is exposed to in commercial applications. To achieve this, all possible requirements of the components, which are supposed to endure a lifetime of up to 30 years in power plants, are depicted. A literature research is carried out in order to investigate and evaluate existing test rigs for REPAs or their single components. By means of the findings, a specification sheet is derived. The test rig is composed of two main assemblies. On the one hand, a Kinematics Unit is used to reproduce the cyclic rotational and translational motions of a Parabolic Trough Collector. On the other hand, an HTF cycle (Heat Transfer Fluid cycle) conduces to set up pressure, temperature and flow rate circulating through the test specimens. The main part of the thesis contributes to the integration of the externally designed Kinematics Unit into the HTF cycle – taking into consideration realistic operation conditions and a complete and precise measurement of all parameters. Special emphasis is put on an accurate acquisition of the mechanical loads the test objects have to cope with. As a result of this work, a test rig is erected enabling realistic endurance tests of two serially connected REPAs in less than three months. The hydraulic properties are adjustable in terms of mass flow (6 − 60 m 3 /h), pressure (up to 40 bars) and temperature (up to 450 °C).

40|$|Propulsion {{systems that}} utilize hypergolic {{propellants}} {{have been used}} to power space vehicles {{since the beginning of the}} space program. Liquid methane and oxygen propulsion systems have emerged as an alternative and have proven to be more environmentally friendly. The incorporation of liquid methane/liquid oxygen (LOX) into the propulsion system has demonstrated an increase in engine performance, as well as a reduction in the volume, size and complexity of the system. Consequently, reducing the total mass of the vehicle which is a crucial aspect that is considered when planning space missions to both the Moon and Mars [1]. Project Morpheus has made significant advancements in liquid oxygen/liquid methane propulsion system technologies by incorporating a LOX/methane propulsion system to a vertical test bed. The vehicle consisted of a 5, 000 lb main engine and four 20 lb remote control system (RCS) engines that utilize liquid methane/LOX as its propellant [1]. The vehicle completed successful flight testing at Kennedy Space Center in 2014 which marked the completion of the Morpheus project. Subsequent projects utilizing Morpheus' vertical test bed have been developed to make further advancements. One of the subsequent projects consisted of the addition of a smaller 2, 000 lb main engine and a cold helium heat exchanger which would make it possible for a pressurant tank systems to be send to Mars or the Moon by significantly decreasing the overall mass and volume of the pressurant tank. The hot fire tests of the integrated system with the smaller main engine and cold helium heat exchanger were successful at sea level, but further studies are being conducted to better understand how the vertical test bed will behave under thermal-vacuum conditions. For this reason, the integrated vehicle will be taken to Plum Brook to be tested in a chamber capable of simulating these conditions. To ensure that the vehicle will function properly under vacuum conditions, testing will be first completed at the component level. During this process, the igniter of the main engine and the RCS thrusters will be tested under a vacuum. To complete the testing of the components, the test setup first needed to be finalized. The CryoCart is being used to feed the propellants to the test article. The CryoCart is a movable test set-up that was developed in 2009 to provide a mobile platform for testing oxygen/methane systems with hot-fire capability up to 100 lbf. The CryoCart consists of three different systems: Oxygen, Methane, and liquid Nitrogen. The Oxygen and Methane systems are placed into two different carts while the liquid nitrogen system is mainly located in the methane cart. Over the years, the CryoCart has been utilized for different projects and has undergone deterioration. For this reason, a new phase has been developed to rebuild it to working conditions once again. During my internship, I was aiding in the construction and restoration of the CryoCart. In the initial stages of the process, I updated the fluid and electrical schematics for the oxygen, methane, and test article systems. The original CryoCart consisted of an electrical panel that utilized electromechanical relays and a terminal to drive the igniter power and signal, as well as the main fuel and oxygen valves. This electrical panel connected to the CryoCart through various wire harnesses that could be found exiting from the CryoCart. First, it was determined how these harnesses connected to the electromechanical relays so that they worked correctly. Once the electrical system was understood, an alternative for the electromechanical relays and the Molex connectors used throughout the system was sought since these components can often prove to be unreliable. Solid State relays and MIL connectors were purchased to serve as replacements. Upon arrival of the parts, crimping and wiring was completed to install the new solid state relays and MIL connectors. During the replacement of the relays and connectors, system checks of the electrical system were ran to ensure that the system was working correctly. While completing system checks, the pressure transducers that were not functioning properly were also replaced and any issue with the wiring or signal was addressed. Once the electrical components were replaced, the restoration of the fluid system began. Parts of the tubing in the CryoCart had to be rebuild and often consisted of sizing, cutting, bending, filing, and sanding the tubing to prepare it to be flared. Many components had to be proof-tested to bring their certifications up to date, and several components had to be replaced. Various <b>flex</b> <b>hoses,</b> valves, and fittings were send to the Clean Lab because they were new, dirty, or had gone through proof-testing. Once they arrived from the cleaning lab they had to be put back to the system and leak checks and functional tests were conducted. In the Nitrogen system, the copper tubing located in the Oxygen cart was rebuild and Aerogel insulation was added to this section. A new gaseous nitrogen system was added to the CryoCart to purge the vacuum tube which will serve as the test chamber. Once the CryoCart was completed, construction of parts of the vacuum tube began. A flange was manufactured with welded fittings to hold the line of the vacuum pump as well as some extra fittings which will serve as extra inlets used to introduce fluid lines to the vacuum tube. Stress analysis was ran in this flange to ensure that it would not fail under vacuum conditions. The fluid lines leading from the air side of the vacuum to the test article were also constructed and added to the mount that had already been manufactured. Three different sets of tubing were constructed to accommodate the seven different RCS thruster and the main engine igniter that are going to be tested. Full electrical system checks were completed to ensure that all the wire harnesses and valves were functioning. Upon the completion of the CryoCart and the vacuum tube, hot fire testing for the RCS thrusters and the main engine igniter are going to begin. During this time any issues encountered with the engines or igniter will be addressed to ensure that the components function under vacuum conditions. After successful completion of testing, the vertical test bed, Morpheus, will be rebuilt and prepared to be sent to Plum Brook. In Plum Brook, the vehicle will be tested in the thermal-vacuum chamber to demonstrate that integrated lox-methane propulsion system operation in space-like conditions. This internship has allowed me the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience and to develop skills that will aid in my education as well as in the workforce, while at the same time helping me determine that I would like to further pursue a career in propulsion engineering...|$|R
