Wines from the Chassagne side are called [...] "Le Montrachet" [...] and from the Puligny side simply [...] "Montrachet" [...] - there are 4 hectares of each. Above Montrachet proper is the 7.59ha of Chevalier Montrachet (all in Puligny), at the bottom of the slope lies Bâtard Montrachet (6.02ha in Puligny). The names of these two Grand Crus supposedly reflect the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> of the Seigneur de Montrachet between his two sons, one of whom had been a knight in the Crusades, the other was illegitimate. Puligny also contains the Grand Cru of Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet (3.69ha).|$|E

[...] The erection of this gateway is attributed to Henry Loftus, Earl of Ely from 1769 to 1783 who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the new gate on Frizell's map of 1779. After the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> in 1913 the arch became {{the entrance to the}} Castle Golf Club but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct Woodside Drive entrance. The area around the arch is a haven for wildlife, with the nearby River Dodder home to brown trout, otter and many water-birds including kingfisher, dipper and grey heron. Woodside Estate is home to red fox, rabbits and grey squirrels.|$|E

In <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nobility, <b>the</b> <b>estates,</b> which nobles held, {{played an}} {{exceptional}} role. These estates were material base of their survival and power, and noble {{status of a}} person or family/kindred was tightly linked to them. Because <b>of</b> that <b>the</b> ways in which <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> were acquired or inherited, the ways they were managed, also had such exceptional importance. This article deals with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questions connected to the proprietary relations, that is with <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> among members <b>of</b> noble kindreds and families.

The analysis shows that, even though the division sometimes occurred between fathers and sons, the more frequent was the division occurring only after father’s death, and that those who more frequently conducted division were cousins than brothers. The article also points to {{the changes in the}} ways in which <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> were divided which occurred through time, that is to {{the fact that in the}} earlier period <b>the</b> <b>estates,</b> if there were more of them, were divided in the way that one whole estate was given to a kindred branch and another to the another, while from <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth century each branch of a kindred received a part <b>of</b> each <b>estate.</b> <b>The</b> possible reasons for such changes and their connection to the changes in <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kindreds have been also discussed...|$|R

50|$|In {{the period}} that {{followed}} the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> changed hands many times.

The co-heirs pledged themselves henceforth only to transfer {{their share of the}} estate to one another, not to anyone outside the community. Only Comburg Abbey was allowed, in 1717, to buy the share of the estate belonging to the lords of Stetten, because they had formerly been members of the Ganerbschaft.|$|E
5000|$|A secundogeniture (from secundus [...] "following, second," [...] and [...] "born") was a {{dependent}} territory {{given to a}} younger son of a princely house and his descendants, creating a cadet branch.
