50|$|The LDV Rule accomplishes its {{objectives}} primarily through a traditional command-and-control approach. The most substantial requirements {{come in the}} form of two separate CO2 standards (one for cars and the other for trucks, expressed on a <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> basis) that apply to a manufacturer's fleet of vehicles. To determine compliance with the requirements of the rule, manufacturers must calculate a production-weighted fleet average emissions rate at the end of a model year and compare it to a fleet average emission standard. The emission standard for a manufacturer in a given model year is calculated based on the footprints of the vehicles in its fleet and the number of vehicles produced by the manufacturer at each footprint. The standards are designed so that they gradually become more stringent each year from 2012 to 2016. The LDV Rule also includes standards of 0.010 gram/mile and 0.030 gram/mile for N2O and CH4, respectively. These standards were primarily put in place as an anti-backsliding measure as N2O and CH4 are already emitted from motor vehicles in relatively low amounts.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, 2004, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted {{emissions}} {{standards for}} GHGs from new passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles. Not unlike the LDV Rule, California's regulations establish standards for CO2 equivalent emissions from {{two classes of}} vehicles on a <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> basis. Also {{like those in the}} LDV Rule, California's standards become more stringent over time. CARB initially requested a waiver from EPA for these standards on December 21, 2005. EPA denied that request on March 6, 2008, stating that the State did not need the standards to address compelling and extraordinary conditions (as is required by CAA section 209(b)(1)(B)) because the effects of climate change in California were not extraordinary compared to the effects {{in the rest of the}} country. Upon reconsideration, EPA later withdrew its previous denial and approved California's waiver request on July 8, 2009. Fifteen states have adopted California's standards. Further, California and EPA have worked together so that the two programs converge and allow automakers to produce a single national fleet, which complies with both programs.|$|E

For nearly a decade, Argonne has been evaluating membrane-based methods to control the composition of air used in combustion. Membranes are the only practical method of modifying air composition for on-board use. The applicability of the technique depends strongly on both the technical and economic feasibility of implementing it on a vehicle. Over the past 10 years, significant technical advances {{have been made in the}} development of air-separation membranes. Researchers have developed and commercialized novel membrane materials that can efficiently separate air at the concentrations required for vehicle applications and have developed compact membrane modules that can be incorporated into vehicle design. Previous analysis by Argonne and others has demonstrated the effectiveness of oxygen enrichment at reducing PM, smoke, hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions while increasing engine power output. Under appropriate oxygen-enriched operating conditions, diesel engines have achieved a net increase of 10 - 20 % in power density and a decrease of 30 - 60 % in PM emissions. Nitrogen-enriched air can be used as an alternative to exhaust gas recirculation to control NO{sub x} emissions and can also be used to generate a monatomic nitrogen plasma for exhaust post-treatment to reduce emissions of NO{sub x}. Argonne has recently identified an operating regime that can simultaneously reduce NO{sub x} and PM while increasing power output when oxygen-enriched combustion air is used. This promising technique, which will be verified by additional experimental work at Argonne (using a range of engine sizes), will require the use of membranes similar to those analyzed in this study...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common criticisms of {{pollution}} taxes is that they are often believed to be inequitable — i. e., low income households are thought to be disproportionately harmed. In this paper, we assess the distributional impacts of three taxes aimed at reducing emissions from motor vehicles: (i) a tax on total annual emissions, (ii) a tax on emissions rates (in <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> <b>mile),</b> and (iii) a tax on annual miles traveled. We use two alternative measures of economic well-being, annual household income and a constructed measure of lifetime income. We find that all three fees look regressive, both on the basis of annual and lifetime income — though much less so on a lifetime income basis. However, if one of these fees is used to substitute for existing vehicle registration fees, the differential impacts over existing fees are quite small: on a lifetime income basis, the mileage-based fee looks almost identical to the current system, while the total emissions fee is a little more regressive and the emissions rate-based fee slightly more regressive still than the current system. These results highlight the importance of tax shifting to help the environment. ...|$|R

The program will also, for the first time, apply the same set of federal standards to all passenger cars, light trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. Light trucks include “light light-duty trucks” (or LLDTs), rated at less than 6000 pounds gross vehicle weight and “heavy light-duty trucks” (or HLDTs), rated at more than 6000 pounds gross vehicle weight). 1 “Medium-duty passenger vehicles ” (or MDPVs) form a new class of vehicles introduced by this rule that includes SUVs and passenger vans rated at between 8, 500 and 10, 000 GVWR.

Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> <b>mile,</b> qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to concerns related to climate change, and {{an attempt to}} encourage more sustainable behavior, individuals are often provided with information on greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) of consumer items, such as personal vehicles. Currently in the US, information on vehicle efficiency is provided as grams of carbon dioxide (CO 2) <b>per</b> <b>mile.</b> Previous research presenting CO 2 as a mass and testing willingness-to-pay through Discrete Choice Experiment has found that such information can influence vehicle choice. However, other research has questioned whether how this information is presented might affect choice. That research argues that CO 2 emission information generally lacks contextualization that allows for interpretation. As well, it argues {{that the type of}} contextualization may affect choices. That research though did not test willingness-to-pay and the strength of its influence is not clear.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the behavioral and stochastic aspects of modeling emission reductions from vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs. Forecasts {{of the potential}} emission reductions from such programs have been modeled {{by the use of}} the Environmental Protection Agency's MOBILE Model, EPA's computer model for estimating emission factors for mobile sources. We examine the structure of this Model and review the way behavior of drivers, mechanics and state regulatory authorities is incorporated in the current generation of the Model. We focus particularly on assumptions about vehicle repair under I/M, compliance with I/M requirements, and the impact of test measurement error on predicted I/M effectiveness. We also include some preliminary comparisons of the Model's outcomes to results of the I/M program in place in Arizona. Finally, we perform some sensitivity analyses to determine the most influential underlying parameters of the Model. We find that many of the assumptions of the I/M component of the Model are based on relatively small data sets on vehicle done in a laboratory setting, and that the output of the Model makes it difficult to compare the results against real world data from on-going state programs. In addition, the Model assumes that vehicles will either be repaired or receive a waiver. In the Arizona program {{there appears to be a}} third category of vehicles � those which fail the test and do not receive passes. This share may be as high as a third of all failing vehicles. Vehicles which do not eventually pass the test would be treated in the Model as non-compliant. However, in current programs, states do not seem to be measuring and entering the compliance rate correctly. The paper also {{examines the}} evidence about whether emissions deteriorate over the life of vehicle in a <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> basis (as assumed by the Model) or a <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> gallon basis. It finds support for the argument that emissions deteriorate on a <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> gallon basis. We find through sensitivity analysis that the repair effectiveness assumed by the Model to occur in an IM 240 test are much greater than for the idle test, and that identification rates and repair effectiveness vary a great deal according to the cutpoint. These results are based on small numbers of vehicle tests in a laboratory setting and could be compared to real world evidence. Examining costs and cost-effectiveness of variations in I/M programs is important for determining improvements in I/M programs. States may not have incentives to develop cost-effective programs based on current Model that forecast emission reduction "credits" that are overly optimistic. ...|$|R
40|$|General. This report {{provide an}} {{overview}} of basic assumptions and general results for all of the fuel, feedstock, and light-duty vehicle combinations treated in the LEM, and somewhat more detailed results and discussions for the longer-term advanced options, including compressed or liquefied hydrogen from natural gas, compressed or liquefied hydrogen from water via electrolysis, and liquid biofuels developed from wood, grass, or corn. It considers fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCVs) as well as internal-combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Target years. The LEM has the capability of modeling lifecycle environmental impacts in any target year from 1970 to 2050. For this analysis we have estimated results for the near term (2010) and the long term (2050). (We originally proposed to run the LEM for three dates, 2005, 2020, and 2050, but for three reasons have modeled 2010 and 2050 instead: there is not enough difference between 2005 and 2020 to warrant separate runs; having three target years instead of two increases the already large number of results tables by 50 %; and Nissan has the LEM and hence the capability to run any year it is interested in.) Countries. The LEM also has the capability of modeling lifecycle environmental impacts in up to 30 countries simultaneously. For this project, we have performed lifecycle analysis for Japan, China, the U. S., and Germany, using existing data in the LEM. (We originally proposed to run the LEM for Poland, Italy, and the U. K. as well, but for several reasons we omitted them: the data for these countries are not as good as the data for China, Japan, and the U. S.; presenting results for three more countries would greatly multiply the already-large number of results tables; and Nissan has the LEM and hence the capability to run any country it is interested in.) Results reported. The LEM produces a wide range of quantitative outputs related to lifecycle emissions from the use of alternative transportation fuels and modes. For this report we provide estimates of lifecycle CO 2 -equivalent GHG emissions in <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> <b>mile,</b> by stage of lifecycle and fuel/feedstock/vehicle combination; emissions of pollutants from the "upstream" fuel cycle (i. e., all stages of the fuel lifecycle excluding end use) in <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> million BTU of fuel, by individual pollutant including CO 2 -equivalent and fuel/feedstock combination; and emissions of pollutants from the vehicle and materials lifecycle, in <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> pound of material, by individual pollutant (including CO 2 -equivalent) and vehicle type.

Since electricity production in the United States varies significantly from region to region, the EPA considered three scenarios/ranges with {{the low end of}} the range corresponding to the California powerplant emissions factor, the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor, and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the Rockies. The following table shows the Prius PHEV tailpipe emission plus total upstream [...] emissions for the three scenarios, compared with other six popular plug-in hybrids and the average gasoline-powered car: ...|$|R
40|$|The seed {{moisture}} level marking {{the onset of}} imbibitional injury (breakpoint) was determined for two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cvs `Tendercrop' (TC) and `Kinghorn Wax' (KW). At 20 °C the breakpoints were 0. 15 gram H 2 O/gram dry weight (<b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram)</b> for TC and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW. When seeds were imbibed at 5 °C, the breakpoints were 0. 19 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (TC) and 0. 16 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (KW). Below the breakpoint germination changed 4. 6 %/ 0. 01 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for all treatments. Imbibition rates were maximal at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> after 20 minutes imbibition. Rates of electrolyte leakage were correlated with the imbibition rate maximum at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> but were unaffected by the maximum at 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> The transition from tightly bound to semibound water occurred at 0. 09 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW and TC, respectively. T 1 values increased exponentially as seed moisture decreased from 0. 47 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> to 0. 05 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> 13 C-NMR sugar signals increased at {{moisture level}}s above 0. 14 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and plateaued at approximately 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> seed moisture. These {{results suggest that the}} breakpoint moisture level for imbibitional damage is a function of temperature while the injury process is similar at both 5 and 20 °C. Imbibition and leakage rate maxima reflect transitions in the states of seed water. NMR data support the application of the Water Replacement Hypothesis to seeds. Thus, imbibitional injury may be related to specific, temperature dependent moisture levels that are determined by water binding characteristics in the seed tissue...|$|R

50|$|The {{maximum amount}} of sugar allowed for a trocken {{designation}} depends {{on the level of}} acid in the wine. For wine low in acid, a maximum of 4 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> liter sugar is allowed. If the acid level exceeds 2 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> liter, the sugar may exceed the acid level by 2 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> liter, up to a maximum of 9 <b>grams</b> of sugar <b>per</b> liter. Most high-quality German white wines have a high enough acidity to be allowed up to 9 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> liter of sugar under the trocken level. When used, the requirements in Austria are exactly the same.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{include a}} blueish or greenish {{discoloration}} of the blood, skin, and mucous membranes, {{even though a}} blood count test may not show any abnormalities in the blood.This discoloration is called cyanosis, and is caused by greater than 5 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> cent of deoxyhemaglobinemia, or 1.5 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> cent of methemaglobinemia, or 0.5 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> cent of sulphemaglobinemia, all serious medical abnormalities.|$|R
50|$|When {{used for}} {{sparkling}} wine, the term trocken actually means 17 to 35 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> liter of sugar. This parallels the term sec ("dry") in French, which indicates a sparkling wine {{of the same}} sugar level as trocken. Drier wines are designated extra trocken at 12 to 20 <b>grams</b> of sugar <b>per</b> liter, while completely dry sparkling wines are given the designation brut (0-15 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> liter) or extra brut (0-6 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> liter).|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of batches of wine {{produced}} for the commercial market, the process of alcoholic fermentation must be halted (less than two <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> litre of fermentable sugar) and malolactic fermentation carried out.

The volatile acidity of the wine must not exceed 13.26 milliequivalents (i.e. 0.79 expressed as <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> litre of acetic acid or 0.65 g/L of H2SO4) {{in the first year}} of aging (up to 31 July).
