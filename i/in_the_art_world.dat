5|$|Stuart {{ended his}} 18-year stay in Britain and Ireland in 1793, leaving behind {{numerous}} unfinished paintings. He {{returned to the}} United States and settled briefly in New York City. In 1795, he moved to Germantown, Pennsylvania, near (and now part of) Philadelphia, where he opened a studio. It was here that he gained a foothold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world</b> and lasting fame with pictures of many important Americans of the day.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world,</b> among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|The K Foundation {{was an art}} {{foundation}} set up by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty (The KLF) in 1993, {{following their}} 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo's post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money {{in a number of}} ways, including on a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world,</b> focusing in particular on the Turner Prize. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, they burned a million pounds in cash.|$|E

5|$|Warhol's {{production}} of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first {{took place in}} 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil drawings of the subject. In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with {{a wider variety of}} hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while inverting and reversing the images. Some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world</b> consider Warhol's work completed after his 1968 shooting—which occurred the day before the Bobby Kennedy assassination— to be less significant than that done before it.|$|E
5|$|The first {{strand of}} the novel follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member of}} the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend to write a story for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) about the use of locative technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world.</b> Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements. Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS grid square on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to his admiration for The Curfew.|$|E

25|$|During that period, Theo van Doesburg {{started looking}} for other artists {{to set up a}} journal and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more {{successful}} writing about art than working as an independent artist.

25|$|Despite {{rapid changes}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world</b> {{in the early}} 20th century, Thayer's {{reputation}} remained strong. Yale University offered him an honorary degree in 1916, and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh mounted an exhibition of his work in 1919 that included over fifty paintings. The view from his home of Mt. Monadnock became a favorite subject, and when the area was threatened with development Thayer campaigned successfully for its preservation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, de Hory again {{decided to try}} his hand at painting, hoping to exploit his new-found fame: this time, he would sell his own, {{original}} work. While he had gained some recognition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world</b> he made little profit, and he soon learned that French authorities were attempting to extradite him to stand trial on fraud charges. This took quite some time, as Spain and France had no extradition treaty at that time.|$|E

Emsley took 15 weeks to complete the painting, which was presented to the trustees of the gallery in November 2012. The Duchess, contrary to considerable criticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world,</b> highly praised the portrait after viewing it initially in a private family gathering.|$|E
25|$|In {{the postmodern}} era, the nude has {{returned}} to gain some acceptance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world,</b> but not necessarily the art model. Figure drawing is offered in most art schools, but may not be required for a fine art degree. Peter Steinhart says that in trendy galleries, the nude has become passé, while according to Wendy Steiner {{there has been a}} revival in the importance of the figure as a source of beauty in contemporary art. Some established living artists work from models, but more work from photographs, or their imagination. Yet privately held open drawing sessions with a live model remain as popular as ever.|$|E

25|$|J.P. was a complex, {{intelligent}} and highly creative individual, {{as well as}} a devoted family man, an artist and an accomplished musician, and was well known for his fondness for collecting things. Anything and everything, wherever he went, he collected stuff. His obsession with collecting sprang from his belief that all objects were art, all objects have beauty and were worthy of standing alone as art or of disassembling and re-working to enhance the art inherent within. He had been inspired and influenced by his beatnik artist friends, and by the revolution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world</b> earlier last century that produced the Dada/Anti-Art movement and the found-art philosophy of Marcel Duchamp.|$|E
25|$|Joan Miró {{was among}} the first artists to develop {{automatic}} drawing as a way to undo previous established techniques in painting, and thus, with André Masson, represented the beginning of Surrealism as an art movement. However, Miró chose not to become an official member of the Surrealists in order to be free to experiment with other artistic styles without compromising his position within the group. He pursued his own interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world,</b> ranging from automatic drawing and surrealism, to expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Four-dimensional painting was a theoretical type of painting Miró proposed in which painting would transcend its two-dimensionality and even the three-dimensionality of sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Between 1947 and 1948, Klein {{conceived}} his Monotone Symphony (1949, formally Monotone Silence Symphony) that {{consisted of}} a single 20-minute sustained chord followed by a 20-minute silence—a precedent to both La Monte Young's drone music and John Cage's 4′33″. During the years 1948 to 1952, he traveled to Italy, Great Britain, Spain, and Japan. In Japan, {{at the age of}} 25, he became a master at judo receiving the rank of yodan (4th dan/degree black-belt) from the Kodokan, which at that time was a remarkable achievement for a westerner. He also stayed in Japan in 1953. Klein later wrote a book on judo called Les Fondements du judo. In 1954, Klein settled permanently in Paris and began in earnest to establish himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
