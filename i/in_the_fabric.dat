5|$|Concealed shoes hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, {{as well as in}} other parts of the world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric,</b> igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E

There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard, so Kirk and Spock (voiced by Zachary Quinto) take a shuttle to rescue the crew. They encounter T'Mar, a childhood friend of Spock, who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device, which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan; the team inadvertently opened a rip <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> of space. Beaming to New Vulcan, Kirk and Spock meet with T'Mar's father Surok, who explains the station's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures—who call themselves the Gorn— from the rip. The Gorn infect some of the crew with a virus that makes them aggressive. Kirk and Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors, but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{penetration}} {{failure mechanisms}} of “armor-grade ” fiber-reinforced composites with very low resin content were assessed under transverse impact loading {{in comparison with}} those of dry reinforcing fabrics. Failure of dry <b>fabrics</b> consisted of <b>the</b> suc-cessive fracture of individual yarns along {{the periphery of the}} penetrating head as well as the movement of yarns slipping off from <b>the</b> penetrator. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> principal yarns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> composites, which faced the penetrating head, failed to carry the load mostly through fracture due to the constraint of the resin matrix and the reduced yarn mobility. As a result, the composites absorbed more energy than <b>the</b> <b>fabrics.</b> <b>The</b> ratio of the number of broken yarns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabrics</b> to that of the composites correlated quite well with the corresponding ratio of energy absorbed, confirming that fiber straining is responsible for most of <b>the</b> en-ergy absorption <b>in</b> penetration failure. Numerical modeling was utilized to show that yarn slippage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabrics</b> results <b>in</b> a smaller effective penetrator radius leading to a decrease in energy absorption capacity with equal penetrator masses. Although the resin matrix itself did not absorb significant amounts of energy, it certainly had an indirect effect on the en...|$|R

25|$|On {{the advice}} of {{acoustics}} firm, Kirkegaard Associates, the lack of reverberation and the difficult performance conditions for musicians were corrected by changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> of the auditorium. Surfaces that had previously absorbed sound were transformed to support and sustain that sound. The tapestries on the back walls of the boxes were gathered up to increase reverberation, but can be redeployed, together with additional absorbent blinds above the stage and around the Hall whenever needed. The wooden wall panels of the Hall were relined to change their acoustic qualities and the undulating plaster ceiling panels were completely reconstructed using more robust materials to provide greater warmth of sound and support for bass frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The chapel, and its liturgical collection, was {{produced}} {{during the late}} phase of the Irish Arts and Crafts movement (1894–1925).

This accounts for an overall unity of style and design and the rich interplay of Celto-Byzantine motifs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> {{of the building and}} the ornate furnishings, altar plate, hangings and vestments. The traditions of Celtic art and Hiberno-Romanesque architecture were blended with tastes for Symbolism (arts) and Art Nouveau popular in Europe before the outbreak of the First World War (1914–18). In Ireland this was known, artistically, as the Celtic Twilight: a time for rediscovering a lost national identity through Celtic art and myths. This is seen in the poetry of W. B. Yeats and the plays of J. M. Synge. Visually, the patrons of the Honan commission were searching for a new sense of Irish national identity on the threshold of political independence from Britain.|$|E
