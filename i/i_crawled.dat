500|$|Bruce, a boyhood fan of Newcastle United, {{claims to}} have sneaked into St James' Park without paying to watch the team play, saying [...] "I {{have always been a}} Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> under the {{turnstiles}} to get in to try and save a bob or whatever it was. They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it's in-bred, you follow the club still the same today." [...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|... couldn’t {{stand on}} it and my boot was full of blood. <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> over to Captain Brey ...|$|E
60|$|Throwing {{more water}} on the canvas until it was sopping wet, <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> in beside him.|$|E
6000|$|Now, with {{my little}} gun, <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> [...] All in the dark along the wall, [...] And follow round the forest track [...] Away behind the sofa back.|$|R
6000|$|The yellow water, {{thick as}} pap, [...] <b>Is</b> <b>{{crawling}},</b> crawling to the thwarts, [...] And as they mark its upward lap, [...] So fear goes crawling up their hearts.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "not often, anyway. If Mrs. Nansen wants {{a couple}} <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> {{down to the}} long grass with the rifle and get them for her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> {{across the}} deck and stood upright beside him in {{the shelter of the}} sheet steel.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the door}} closed, {{and he was}} no longer with us. And <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> out of the bombproof shelter.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>crawled.</b> The frost {{gathered}} on my lips, icicles hung from my moustache, I was white with the freezing atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Something Creeping in The Dark (Qualcosa striscia nel buio, {{also known}} as Something <b>Is</b> <b>Crawling</b> in the Dark) is a 1971 Italian horror film {{directed}} by [...] and starring Farley Granger and Lucia Bosè.|$|R
60|$|His back is towards me, and <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> forward inch by inch. I have a {{knife in}} my hand, with a strong, curved blade; and when I am near enough I kill him as he kneels there.|$|R
6000|$|... "So far, so good," [...] James said. [...] "Now, do {{you stop}} here, while <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> forward to the water. The first thing to {{discover}} is whether they have a sentinel stationed anywhere {{near the bottom of}} this path." ...|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes more}} and the {{schooner}} was alongside. A rope was thrown over, and, thoroughly exhausted, <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> on board.|$|E
6000|$|... [Picture: Man with walking stick] I {{had walked}} into that reading-room a happy, healthy man. <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> out a {{decrepit}} wreck.|$|E
60|$|This {{put me in}} a great fear, and <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> {{under cover}} of the nearest live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.|$|E
60|$|But have they? At {{the very}} next stop, I see a lantern thrust under the next truck to mine {{at the other end}} of the car. They are searching the rods for me. I must make my {{get-away}} pretty lively. <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> on my stomach under the brake-beam. They see me and run for me, but <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> on hands and knees across the rail on the opposite side and gain my feet. Then away I go for the head of the train. I run past the engine and hide in the sheltering darkness. It is the same old situation. I am ahead of the train, and the train must go past me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am the pilot," [...] {{said the}} voice, [...] "and this boat by the rig {{of her and}} her signals should be the Swallow of The Hague, but why must <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> aboard of her across the corpse of a dead man?" ...|$|R
5000|$|When I cannot walk, I'll <b>crawl.</b> When <b>I</b> cannot <b>crawl</b> I'll roll; but I'll get there.|$|R
60|$|I was {{too tired}} to tease our captive lions that evening; even the glowing camp-fire tempted me in vain, and <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> into my bed with eyes already glued shut.|$|E
60|$|So I set off myself, up {{the valley}} between the close, snow-topped mountains, whose white gleamed above me as <b>I</b> <b>crawled,</b> small as an insect, along the dark, cold valley below.|$|E
6000|$|The tunnel {{through which}} <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> {{was low and}} dark. I had {{followed}} it for several hundred yards when I felt a knot beneath my fingers. [...] "Beyond the knots lies danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three days, as I said, was {{the trip}} to New Orleans. The general man and me got to be cronies of the deepest dye. Bananas we ate until they were distasteful to the sight and an eyesore to the palate, but to bananas alone was the bill of fare reduced. At night <b>I</b> <b>crawls</b> out, careful, on the lower deck, and gets a bucket of fresh water.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{thing has}} had its effect on me, and I guess you feel it too. He was your partner quite a while," [...] he said. [...] "We {{want to get a}} move on and work this {{depression}} out of us. Well, you can make camp--a little farther back--while <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> along between the willows and the range. I want to see what's back of them. There's an idea in my mind." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{seem to be}} in everybody's way; and to get out of it, <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> into a dark, draughty {{corner and}} crouch there among cinders. Around me, great engines {{fiercely}} strain and pant like living things fighting beyond their strength. Their gaunt arms whirl madly above me, and the ground rocks with their throbbing. Dark figures flit to and fro, pausing {{from time to time to}} wipe the black sweat from their faces.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the first}} break of day <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> from the tomb, {{followed}} that same road by which I had entered, though I {{found it hard}} to climb up through the entrance hole.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt very}} sad and lonely as <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> along the {{difficult}} footing. My own predicament weighed less heavily upon me than {{the loss of}} Perry, for I loved the old fellow.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> from my hiding-place {{and made}} my way with all {{possible}} speed to the trap-door. I reached up and knocked upon it softly, {{and in a moment}} Dibble opened it from above.|$|E
60|$|Once again, when <b>I</b> had <b>crawled</b> {{into the}} warm hole of my {{sleeping}} bag, was I hailed from the other tent.|$|R
5000|$|Emerson, Lake & Palmer {{played a}} 27-minute version of Tarkus on Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends... Ladies and Gentlemen, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. A brief sample of King Crimson's [...] "Epitaph" [...] ("Confusion {{will be my}} epitaph, as <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> a cracked and broken path, if we make it we can all sit back and laugh...") appears as a coda to Battlefield, {{followed}} by Aquatarkus and an extended solo by Emerson.|$|R
6000|$|... "I then pass to {{the back}} of the stage and lie down on my stomach, still holding the skull before my eyes. After holding this posture for some time, <b>I</b> <b>crawl</b> slowly forward, portraying by the {{movement}} of my legs and stomach the whole sad history of Yorick. Finally I turn my back on the audience, still holding the skull, and convey through the spasmodic movements of my back Hamlet's passionate grief at the loss of his friend." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> on a {{few yards}} to a thick clump and squatted down, for I could not stir another inch. So it came about that I heard them all talking on the other side.|$|E
60|$|Once more <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> {{beneath the}} canvas. I {{had not heard}} a single cry, and I was {{inclined}} to think that Phil had been mistaken concerning a person on the wreckage he had seen.|$|E
60|$|I {{was doing}} my best to skim through this bright little volume when the bell rang. <b>I</b> <b>crawled</b> off the sofa and opened the door. A kind of darkish sort of respectful Johnnie stood without.|$|E
6000|$|She {{proposed}} {{taking a}} large house and rerenting rooms, but Robert would not hear to it. [...] "As long as <b>I</b> can <b>crawl</b> about we'll {{leave that to}} others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} be the only {{prisoner}} in the camp," [...] whispered Ben. [...] "I wonder if <b>I</b> can't <b>crawl</b> up and cut him loose. I did that once for Gilbert Pennington." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Post-Editor Z sys-tem {{submitted to the}} L 2 writing assis-tant task in SemEval- 2014. The aim of task {{is to build a}} translation assistance system to translate untranslated sentence fragments. This is not unlike the task of post-editing where human translators improve machine-generated translations. Post-Editor Z emulates the manual pro-cess of post-editing by (<b>i)</b> <b>crawling</b> and ex-tracting parallel sentences that contain the untranslated fragments from a Web-based translation memory, (ii) extracting the pos-sible translations of the fragments indexed by the translation memory and (iii) apply-ing simple cosine-based sentence similar-ity to rank possible translations for the un-translated fragment...|$|R
