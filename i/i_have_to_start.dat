5000|$|While chasing {{his dream}} of {{becoming}} a rock-and-roll star in L.A. in the ‘70s, Arnold worked for free at the United Western Studios and learned {{the ins and outs of}} music production. [...] "I was setting up mics and stuff like that, but I was getting to watch people like Neil Diamond and the Beach Boys record. But eventually <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> paying the bills." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of {{his early}} musical {{experiences}} Mydland has stated: [...] "Late into high school I got into playing rock 'n' roll {{with friends and}} it was like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from the beginning almost, because if <b>I</b> didn't <b>have</b> a piece of music in front of me I couldn't do much. I changed my outlook on playing real fast after that. <b>I</b> think dope <b>had</b> something <b>to</b> do with that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne doesn't want {{to marry}} me, and," [...] he added, after a moment's hesitation, [...] "I don't {{want to marry}} Anne. You forget that I am an outcast from life. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> things all over again. What should I do with a wife who {{has been used to}} the sort of life Anne has always led?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} of that sort, John. It is {{another sort of}} {{business}} altogether, {{and yet it is}} quite as serious as the last.

[...] And so the Master of the Brake Hounds took himself to his repose.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{now you see}} me, my boy,' said Mr Meagles, shaking him by {{the hand}} stoutly; 'and now you shall have any {{explanation}} and every explanation. The fact is, I was here--came straight {{to you from the}} Allongers and Marshongers, or I should be ashamed to look you in the face this day,--but you were not in company trim at the moment, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> off again <b>to</b> catch Doyce.' ...|$|R

It's {{not so much}} what has happened as what it represents that matters. This elopement has {{marked the end of}} a phase of my life. I think I have it now. My life has been such a series of jerks. I dash along--then something happens which stops that bit of my life with a jerk; and then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> over again--a new bit. I think I'm getting tired of jerks. I want something stodgy and continuous.|$|E
6000|$|The name of Maria Clutterbuck {{had become}} odious to John Eames. As long as Miss Demolines would {{continue}} to talk about herself he could listen with some amount of gratification. Conversation on that subject was the natural progress of the Bayswater romance. And if Madalina would only call her friend by her present name, he had no strong objection to an occasional mention of the lady; but the combined names of Maria Clutterbuck {{had come to be}} absolutely distasteful to him. He did not believe in the Maria Clutterbuck friendship,--either in its past or present existence, as described by Madalina. Indeed, he did not put strong faith in anything that Madalina said to him. In the handsome gentleman with two thousand a year, he did not believe at all. But the handsome gentleman had only been mentioned once {{in the course of his}} acquaintance with Miss Demolines, whereas Maria Clutterbuck had come up so often! [...] "Upon my word I must wish you good-by," [...] he said. [...] "It is going on for eleven o'clock, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> to-morrow at seven." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{resume the}} defence of this indefensible book. These {{articles}} have another disadvantage {{arising from the}} scurry {{in which they were}} written; they are too long-winded and elaborate. One of the great disadvantages of hurry is that it takes such a long time. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> for High-gate this day week, I may perhaps go the shortest way. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> this minute, I shall almost certainly go the longest. In these essays (as I read them over) I feel frightfully annoyed with myself for not getting to the point more quickly; but I had not enough leisure to be quick. There are several maddening cases in which I took two or three pages in attempting to describe an attitude of which the essence could be expressed in an epigram; only {{there was no time for}} epigrams. I do not repent of one shade of opinion here expressed; but I feel that they might have been expressed so much more briefly and precisely. For instance, these pages contain a sort of recurring protest against the boast of certain writers that they are merely recent. They brag that their philosophy of the universe is the last philosophy or the new philosophy, or the advanced and progressive philosophy. I have said much against a mere modernism. When I use the word [...] "modernism," [...] I am not alluding specially to the current quarrel in the Roman Catholic Church, though I am certainly astonished at any intellectual group accepting so weak and unphilosophical a name. It is incomprehensible to me that any thinker can calmly call himself a modernist; he might as well call himself a Thursdayite. But apart altogether from that particular disturbance, I am conscious of a general irritation expressed against the people who boast of their advancement and modernity in the discussion of religion. But I never succeeded in saying the quite clear and obvious thing that is really the matter with modernism. The real objection to modernism is simply that it is a form of snobbishness. It is an attempt to crush a rational opponent not by reason, but by some mystery of superiority, by hinting that one is specially up to date or particularly [...] "in the know." [...] To flaunt the fact that we have had all the last books from Germany is simply vulgar; like flaunting the fact that we have had all the last bonnets from Paris. To introduce into philosophical discussions a sneer at a creed's antiquity is like introducing a sneer at a lady's age. It is caddish because it is irrelevant. The pure modernist is merely a snob; he cannot bear to be a month behind the fashion Similarly I find that I have tried in these pages to express the real objection to philanthropists and have not succeeded. I have not seen the quite simple objection to the causes advocated by certain wealthy idealists; causes of which the cause called teetotalism is the strongest case. I have used many abusive terms about the thing, calling it Puritanism, or superciliousness, or aristocracy; but I have not seen and stated the quite simple objection to philanthropy; which is that it is religious persecution. Religious persecution does not consist in thumbscrews or fires of Smithfield; the essence of religious persecution is this: that the man who happens to have material power in the State, either by wealth or by official position, should govern his fellow-citizens not according to their religion or philosophy, but according to his own. If, for instance, there is such a thing as a vegetarian nation; if there is a great united mass of men who wish to live by the vegetarian morality, then I say in the emphatic words of the arrogant French marquis before the French Revolution, [...] "Let them eat grass." [...] Perhaps that French oligarch was a humanitarian; most oligarchs are. Perhaps when he told the peasants to eat grass he was recommending to them the hygienic simplicity of a vegetarian restaurant. But that is an irrelevant, though most fascinating, speculation. The point here is that if a nation is really vegetarian let its government force upon it the whole horrible weight of vegetarianism. Let its government give the national guests a State vegetarian banquet. Let its government, in the most literal and awful sense of the words, give them beans. That sort of tyranny is all very well; for it is the people tyrannising over all the persons. But [...] "temperance reformers" [...] are like a small group of vegetarians who should silently and systematically act on an ethical assumption entirely unfamiliar to the mass of the people. They would always be giving peerages to greengrocers. They would always be appointing Parliamentary Commissions to enquire into the private life of butchers. Whenever they found a man quite at their mercy, as a pauper or a convict or a lunatic, they would force him to add the final touch to his inhuman isolation by becoming a vegetarian. All the meals for school children will be vegetarian meals. All the State public houses will be vegetarian public houses. There is a very strong case for vegetarianism as compared with teetotalism. Drinking one glass of beer cannot by any philosophy be drunkenness; but killing one animal can, by this philosophy, be murder. The objection to both processes is not that the two creeds, teetotal and vegetarian, are not admissible; it is simply that they are not admitted. The thing is religious persecution because it is not based on the existing religion of the democracy. These people ask the poor to accept in practice what they know perfectly well that the poor would not accept in theory. That is the very definition of religious persecution. I was against the Tory attempt to force upon ordinary Englishmen a Catholic theology in which they do not believe. I am even more against the attempt to force upon them a Mohamedan morality which they actively deny.|$|E
