He spends the next episode, [...] "Death's Door", in a coma, trying to reawaken to reveal the Leviathan's plot. Despite efforts to save him, Bobby flatlines from his injuries; his last word being [...] "idjits" [...] (sic, idiots) to Sam and Dean after passing on a sequence of numbers. The episode ends with a reaper asking Bobby if he is going to become a ghost or move on to the afterlife. It's indicated that he stayed as a ghost to help the boys as there have been times since his death when the <b>information</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> inexplicably makes itself known to them, but they were initially unable to confirm or deny Bobby's possible presence. During [...] "Party On, Garth," [...] Sam reveals that he tried to use a talking board to contact him if he is still around, but received no response. However, Garth registers high readings on an EMF detector around Bobby's old flask, and when Dean needed a sword to slay a shojo, it inexplicably slid across the ground to him, leading him to believe that Bobby had helped him. At the end of the episode, Bobby's spirit {{can be seen in the}} brother's motel room, and he is annoyed when Dean comes in, looks right at him, and does not see him, instead grabbing his flask.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, Colburn founded Engineering in London as {{a weekly}} rival to The Engineer using funds {{provided}} by Henry Bessemer, the English engineer and inventor known chiefly {{in connection with}} the Bessemer process for the manufacture of steel.

30|$|Panelists {{expressed}} that the {{training on the}} method gave them <b>information</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to complete their assignment.

2500|$|William F. Schulz, Executive Director of the U.S. {{section of}} Amnesty International, found Dershowitz's ticking-bomb {{scenario}} unrealistic because, he argued, {{it would require}} that [...] "the authorities know that a bomb has been planted somewhere; know it {{is about to go}} off; know that the suspect in their custody has the <b>information</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to stop it; know that the suspect will yield that information accurately {{in a matter of minutes}} if subjected to torture; and know that there is no other way to obtain it."

2500|$|Moscoe {{has often}} called for {{reforms in the}} Toronto Police Service, {{particularly}} as regards the force's relations with racial minority groups. Following the 1990 shooting of a black teenager by Toronto police, he introduced a motion at the Federation of Canadian Municipalities calling for police officers to be trained with [...] "the <b>information</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to deal sensitively with racial and ethnic minorities". He was {{a founding member of}} Metro Toronto's Council Action Committee to Combat Racism but resigned in January 1991, saying that it had rendered itself ineffectual by declining to make police issues a priority. Metro Chairman Alan Tonks, who established the committee, argued that an emphasis on police issues would duplicate the work of the Metro Police Commission and reduce police morale. Moscoe sought an appointment to the Police Commission in late 1990, but withdrew his name after failing to win Tonks's support.|$|E
