500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking. [...] But the people who worked with <b>her</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> viewed her differently; her exercise rider in 2013, David Nuesch, described her as [...] "straightforward", explaining, [...] "she kind of likes it to be her idea and doesn't want to be told too much what to do." [...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E

After Caril's sister introduced the two, they continued to talk, even after the relationship of Charles and her sister had ended. Starkweather {{had dropped out of}} Lincoln High School in his senior year and became employed at a Western Union newspaper warehouse.

2500|$|After her husband's execution, Lady Rochford {{was absent}} from court for several months. She spent this time {{securing}} her financial position by negotiations with her father-in-law, Sir Thomas Boleyn, but mainly with Thomas Cromwell, the king's chief minister. The Boleyns eventually allocated her the sizable annual pension of £100, precisely {{what they had}} given their eldest daughter Mary, {{when she had been}} widowed eight years earlier. It was much less than her previous income as sister-in-law to the queen-consort, but it was enough to keep her as a noblewoman, which was essential for her return to Court, something Jane worked doggedly for in 1536 and 1537. It is unknown when she returned to court, but she was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Jane Seymour, so she probably returned within a year of her husband's death. (Jane Seymour died soon after childbirth, within eighteen months of becoming Henry's wife.) As a viscountess, she was allowed to bring a number of her own servants with her, lodge in the palace, and be addressed as [...] "Lady Rochford". Fine meals were provided for <b>her</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> from the budget of the queen's household.|$|E
2500|$|The song is a ballad, {{beginning}} with a simple guitar-based arrangement, however later expanding to a band and orchestra arrangement. The song's lyrics are an extended narrative that {{tell the story of}} Uemura and her grandmother. When she was a 3rd grader (8 years old), she lived at her grandmother's house next door to her parents, playing gomoku, eating nanban-style duck noodle soup when they went out shopping, watching videotapes of the comedy program Yoshimoto Shinkigeki and helping <b>her</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> Uemura was not very fond of cleaning toilets, so her grandmother told her that a beautiful goddess lives in the toilet, if she cleaned it every day, this goddess would make her into a beautiful woman. As Uemura grew older, the communication gap between her and her grandmother worsened and the two grew apart. Uemura, feeling resentful, moved away from home with her then boyfriend and rarely came home to visit. [...] Her grandmother later became more ill and was hospitalized two years after Uemura left for Tokyo. Uemura visited her, saying [...] "Grandma, I'm home!" [...] as she used to when she was little, before the two began to fight. Her grandmother could not say much and the next morning died quietly in her sleep. Uemura believes her grandmother was waiting for her, besides being left alone from her all this time. She feels regret for hurting her grandmother and says thank you to her {{at the end of the}} song.|$|E

He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see <b>her</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. [...] "Great loss for me and all of us," [...] he wrote. [...] "Greater than I would have thought." [...] He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with G. H. von Wright; to London to stay with Rush Rhees; then to Oxford to see Elizabeth Anscombe, writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then {{returned to}} Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into Storey's End at 76 Storey's Way, the home of his doctor, Edward Bevan, and his wife Joan; he had told them {{he did not want to}} die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.By the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, [...] "My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does."
