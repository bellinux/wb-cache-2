40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives</b> of foreign firms entering international joint ventures, foreign parent control, and joint venture performance in the context of Sino-European IJVs. Using an integrative approach, this study incorporates market power, transaction costs, and organisational learning theories which provide a more comprehensive understanding of IJV <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives.</b> The findings reveal that foreign partners consider market-developing and knowledge-acquiring objectives as important and IJV performance in relation to these objectives as satisfactory. This study found different categories of objectives perform differently in IJVs. The relationship between parent control and IJV overall performance received strong support. Direct and indirect relationships between <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives</b> and IJV overall performance are found. The empirical evidence confirms the significant moderating effects of parent control on attainment of <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives.</b> The moderating effects of parent control do not merely intensify or weaken {{the relationship between}} <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives</b> and satisfaction in relation to these objectives, but also parent control has different moderating effects in relation to different <b>strategic</b> <b>objectives.</b> Research in international joint ventures is often associated with financial problems because of geographical constraints.
