40|$|Since the 1920 s, {{the only}} {{respiratory}} protection which coal miners had available during exposure to toxic or irrespirable environments was a <b>filter</b> <b>self-rescuer</b> that catalytically converted carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO 2). The deficiencies of this self-rescuer, {{which have been}} described elsewhere (37) led to the support by the Bureau of Mines {{of the development of}} a new generation of self-rescuers which utilized potassium superoxide (KO 2) as the air-revitalization chemical. Since KO 2 reacts with exhaled breath and releases oxygen (O 2) while it absorbs CO 2, the new self-rescuers were closed-circuit devices which isolated the miner from contact with toxic or irrespirable atmospheres. A device with a one-h duration developed by Lockheed under contract with the Bureau of Mines (18) utilized 1. 5 Ib of KO 2, weighed 4. 54 Ib and measured 6. 5 by 3. 6 by 7. 7 in. Since the earlier, <b>filter</b> <b>self-rescuer</b> weighed about 2. 5 lb and was worn continuously by the miner, the one-h, KO 2 -based device represented a substantial addition to the equipment that the miner was accustomed to carrying and, therefore, was considered to be too large and too heavy...|$|E
40|$|IIn December of 2006, TPI {{responded to}} two RFP's from NIOSH seeking {{technical}} proposals {{to design and}} build novel respirators {{for use in the}} mining industry. One RFP sought a dockable, self-contained, self-rescuer (SCSR) to allow for extended respiratory protection during mine escape, and the other was for a hybrid mine escape respirator incorporating both air-purifying, and self-contained types of respirators, also for the purpose of extending the time available for escaping miners to receive respiratory protection. TPI recognized a commonality in the two RFPs and responded to both with designs that could be produced independently, but which shared several fundamental features. In evaluating TPI's responses to the RFPs, NIOSH recognized a benefit in the shared design features and awarded one contract for TPI to pursue both concepts resulting in one conceptual product referred to as the dockable/hybrid SCSR. This SCSR would be configured to allow any suitably equipped breathing device (CO Filter Self Rescuer or another SCSR) to connect (dock) to the base unit and to allow the user to switch between them without 'breaking seal. ' This dockable unit would retain the capacity to accept multiple changes of O 2 supply or filters over an extended period as the useful life of any individual add-on unit is expended. As the project developed it resulted {{in the development of a}} new carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered Self-Rescuer (FSR) to dock to the SCSR and a small electronic sensor, the Breathing Air Monitor (BAM), to alert the user to certain hazards in the local ambient air: Self Contained Self Rescuer (SCSR). The TPI SCSR is a 60 -min compressed O 2 rebreather that protects the user from all adverse breathing conditions. TPI uses Micropore's Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) catalyst to absorb the retained CO 2. TPI's SCSR is supplied with a docking valve that allows users to change out nearly spent devices with fresh devices without breaking seal or having to hold their breath. Carbon Monoxide <b>Filter</b> <b>Self-Rescuer</b> (CO FSR). TPI also developed, via a supply agreement with 3 M Company, a carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered Self-Rescuer (FSR) that uses a proprietary precious metal catalyst providing 8 hours of protection. TPI's CO FSR can be supplied with a flanged fitting that docks to TPM's SCSR or it can be supplied with a mouthbit for use as a self-contained device for CO protection alone. Breathing Air Monitor (BAM). Finally TPI developed, in cooperation with the Kohler-Bright Star Company, a Breathing Air Monitor (BAM) that would give the user an indication of when it is necessary to use the SCSR because of an oxygen deficient environment and when it safe to use just the CO filter (normal O 2 but high CO) or if is safe to not use either. This warning system will avoid the user expending the breathing device unnecessarily (e. g. the atmosphere is still breathable). The resultant technology is a module containing the sensors, electronics, PC board and alarms that fits on the miner's cap lamp battery, between the body and top cap. By the end of this contract TPI had demonstrated prototypes of all three products. The project did not result in certified devices by the completion of the contract but TPI has negotiated licensing agreements for these three products and they are being prepared for certification submission by the licensee.
