The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
500|$|Many scholars, {{early and}} contemporary, {{consider}} Cotton {{to be the}} [...] "preeminent minister and theologian of the Massachusetts Bay Colony." [...] Fellow Boston Church minister John Wilson wrote: [...] "Mr. Cotton preaches with such authority, demonstration, and life that, methinks, when he preaches out of any prophet or apostle I hear not him; <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> very prophet and apostle. [...] Yea, I hear the Lord Jesus Christ speaking in my heart." [...] Wilson also called Cotton deliberate, careful, and {{in touch with the}} wisdom of God. [...] Cotton's contemporary John Davenport founded the New Haven Colony, and he considered Cotton's opinion to be law.|$|E

Soon promoted to [...] sergeant, he gained his commission as a second lieutenant on 29 October. He was assigned to training recruits, but this rear-echelon role irked him. In an attempt to see action, he transferred early the following year to the North Midlands Cyclist Company, Divisional Mounted Troops, but remained confined to a posting in England. On 24 February 1915, he wrote to his parents, [...] "I have just sent five boys to France, and <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> they will be in the firing line on Monday.

500|$|After the duel {{between the}} two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy {{officials}} who witnessed the battle that Monitors design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates. In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of [...] "liquid fire", scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders. Wise who was aboard and inspected Monitor after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: [...] "With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken {{the upper part of}} her in as many seconds... <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> hot water pipes are arranged so as to scald the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her." [...] The chance to employ such a tactic never arose. There are conflicting accounts as to whether such an anti-personnel provision was installed.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, Solis {{defended the}} work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the Current Population Survey it puts out monthly {{reported}} that unemployment in the United States had fallen below eight percent for this first time since Obama took office. Some critics, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election. [...] Solis said, [...] "I'm insulted when <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> because we have a very professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They've been doing these calculations. These are our best trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement." [...] For the year, the Labor Department set a record for the most back pay it had ever collected due to wage violations, $280million going to some 300,000workers.

500|$|Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini {{remarked to}} the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the {{completed}} album. [...] Albini commented {{years later that}} in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation [...] "from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. [...] All I know is... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. [...] A few weeks later <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone". [...] While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. [...] Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author [...] "ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [...] information"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. [...] Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek {{to complain about the}} article.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E

Napier wrote to the Chief of the Staff on Christmas Day of this action [...] "Although they did not lose many men killed, the capture of their horses and property must tend greatly to cripple and break up the party. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> two of the elephants were left in the Arone jungles, and may be recovered; there are, therefore, only two remaining with the enemy.|$|E

2500|$|... "Orinoco Flow" [...] was {{the final}} track written for the album, {{but it was one}} that Enya {{recalled}} was difficult to work on, which involved several breaks from recording before coming back to it several weeks after. She later pointed out the absence of deadlines to complete the album, as granted in her contract with Warner, which allowed the song to be developed {{over a period of time}} until [...] "we were able at the end to listen to it and say 'this is good'". It originated from a riff she had developed after Nicky suggested to play a melody in five different octaves; they left the arrangement as it was, until they realised the album needed one more track. The song developed around the initial riff, itself becoming part of the chorus hook. An earlier version of the song contained no middle eight and had the line [...] "Sail away..." [...] after every line which Dickens later said, [...] "drove me crazy", but recognised its potential if it was worked on. Its pizzicato introduction, which has been compared to Andy Williams' 1963 single [...] "Can't Get Used to Losing You", was the genesis of Roma's inspiration for the song's lyrics after she had heard the introduction as she looked out of the studio window and saw her children skipping. Dickins and Cullum are referenced in the lyrics in the lines: [...] "We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel. We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies", the latter being a reference to the region of Antarctica known as Ross Dependency. Dickins only found out about it after the album had been pressed which embarrassed him at first and initially wanted it changed, but soon warmed to it after the single went to number one. [...] "All these years later", he said, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> line ... I can't help smiling." ...|$|E

My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad.
