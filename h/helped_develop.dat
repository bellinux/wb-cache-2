5|$|Fenton {{succeeded in}} getting the club once again {{promoted}} to the top level of English football in 1958. With the considerable input of player Malcolm Allison, Fenton <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Ham's approach to the game.|$|E
5|$|Innovation led to {{business}} {{growth in the}} region. In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and {{played a crucial role}} in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> the first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> the US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011, a {{few months}} prior to Muglia's last day at Microsoft, Juniper Networks {{announced}} it would hire Muglia as the {{executive vice president of}} its software division. He reported to then Juniper CEO Kevin Johnson, who (along with other Juniper staff) is also a former Microsoft executive. Muglia was hired to consolidate Juniper's software groups under a new division called Software Solutions. He also <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> Juniper's software-defined networking (SDN) strategy.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, a {{statistical}} means of describing {{aspects of the}} kinetic theory of gases. He is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks (trusses) like those in many bridges.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{became an}} intern at New York's Uptown Records. While talent {{director}} at Uptown, he <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> Jodeci and Mary J. Blige. In his college days Combs {{had a reputation}} for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants. In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game. The event was oversold, and a stampede occurred in which nine people died.|$|E

5|$|Euler <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation, {{which became}} a {{cornerstone}} of engineering. Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics, Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized {{by a number of}} Paris Academy Prizes {{over the course of his}} career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the parallax of the sun. His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate longitude tables.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{was also}} a {{founding}} member of the American Law Institute, where he <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> the influential Restatements of the Law serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields. One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality, for which reason the July–August 1955 issue of the Mattachine Society Review, the magazine of the country's first nationwide homosexual organization, published a salute to Judge Hand featuring his photograph on the cover.|$|E
5|$|His {{governance}} greatly stabilized and <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> {{the southern}} third of Vietnam, {{turning it into}} a wealthy and peaceful region. In addition, Duyệt opposed Emperor Minh Mạng's ascension and defended Christian missionaries and converts from the emperor's isolationist and Confucian policies. These attitudes brought Duyệt into conflict with Minh Mạng and led to the posthumous desecration of Duyệt's tomb, which provoked his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi to revolt against the court. Later, Emperor Thiệu Trị, the successor of Minh Mạng, rehabilitated Duyệt and restored his tomb.|$|E

5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} measure {{well-being}} more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, {{such as the}} Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in Das Capital by Karl Marx. That model considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living. This refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.|$|E
5|$|Kahin <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> Indonesian {{studies in}} the United States {{at a time when}} the {{majority}} of material on Indonesia was held at Leiden University in the Netherlands. At Cornell, he introduced a postgraduate education program for diplomats from around the world who were in the middle of their careers. He also helped many Indonesian intellectuals, including Deliar Noer and sociologist Selo Soemardjan, obtain education in the United States. Several of Kahin's students and associates, including Herbert Feith, went on to establish similar programs at the universities where they subsequently taught.|$|E

Together with his teacher John McCarthy and other classmates, he was part of the team that wrote the Kotok-McCarthy program which took part in the first chess match between computers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be In This Light and on This Evening and that they would be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E
