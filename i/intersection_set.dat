40|$|Considering {{uncertainty}} of spatial data in any GIS analysis is {{a theme of}} actual research, but far from practicability. One prerequisite is the availability of descriptions concerning uncertainty (meta-data), and another is the attachment of uncertainty to spatial analysis. In our contribution we propose a method to determine the topological relation between two positional uncertain regions. The decision is based on morphological distances along a skeleton through uncertain <b>intersection</b> <b>sets.</b> These measures are equivalent to the known representation by <b>intersection</b> <b>sets,</b> but yield additionally metric information. These distances are applied to a statistical model of the observation process. A Bayesian classi cation yields distance classes which allow to deduce the topological relationship. We discuss also importance and perspectives of the method. ...|$|R
