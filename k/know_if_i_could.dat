500|$|Following {{publication}} of William Wharton's 1978 novel Birdy, Alan Parker received galley proofs {{of the book}} from his agent, who advised him that the novel {{was going to be}} optioned. Upon reading the novel, Parker discussed it with his colleague, producer Alan Marshall, before turning down the opportunity to direct a film adaptation. Parker explained, [...] "So much of the story happened inside the boy's head, and the poetry of the book was literary. To make it cinematic - I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make the jump." [...] In September 1979, Orion Pictures optioned the novel for $150,000.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Cleveland after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, {{with more than}} 1,000 people in {{attendance}} at the Carter Hotel. Feller said to the crowd: [...] "The real heroes didn't come home." [...] Later that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians' game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits {{in the game and}} earned a win in the Indians' 4–2 victory. [...] "I was so tired from all the receptions I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> finish the game", Feller said. For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5–3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50ERA.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his debut, the Philadelphia club {{retained}} several talented pitchers, including Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs. Coveleski admitted that he [...] " [...] <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have beat them out for a spot in the rotation." [...] After the 1914 season, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League wanted Coveleski, and traded five players to Spokane to acquire him. While Connie Mack had an agreement with Spokane that Coveleski would be promoted after playing there for a time, the Athletics fell under new ownership in 1913 and lost control of him due to the Athletics' rights expiring. Coveleski spent his time in Portland learning to throw the spitball; originally using chewing tobacco, he later used alum. In his lone season with Portland, he won and lost 17 games, and had a 2.67 ERA. After the season ended, the Cleveland Indians purchased Coveleski from Portland, and he joined the major league squad in 1916.|$|E

"In my {{old age and}} on my beam-ends," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Wiggett, [...] "I remembered them {{words of}} old Sol, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only find ’im my troubles were over. I knew that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> creep into ’is little harbour and lay snug. I knew that what Sol said he meant. I lost my leg saving ’is life, and he is grateful." ...|$|R
60|$|I trembled {{even before}} I {{looked up into}} her flushed face and arch eyes; and after that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not frighten her out of this daring mood I would have to yield despite my {{conviction}} that she only trifled. As my manhood, as well as duty to Steele, forced me to be unyielding, {{all that was left}} seemed to be to frighten her.|$|R
60|$|And I {{told him}} {{he ought to be}} ashamed of himself going around working off his worthless, old, green {{watermelons}} on trusting purchasers who had to rely on him. How could they tell from the outside whither the melons were good or not? That was his business. And if he didn't reform, I told him I'd see that he didn't get any more of my trade--nor anybody, else's <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help it.|$|R
2500|$|After Carter died of {{complications}} of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for [...] "a year or so", Ralph faced a hard {{decision on whether}} to continue performing on his own. [...] "I was worried, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it by myself. [...] But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of 'em, and phone calls [...] [...] [...] I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted me to go on, and he said, 'Hell yes! You might be better than both of them.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Off the field, {{he helped}} Red Sox pitcher Josh Beckett win a bet against catcher Doug Mirabelli. Breslow {{calculated}} {{how many times}} a baseball spins when it's thrown 90 miles an hour from the pitcher's mound to home plate. [...] "Josh wanted to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> figure out how many times a baseball spins {{on the way to}} the plate", Breslow said. [...] "There's a lot of variables, but I put in some figures and came up with answers for a fastball, curve, or slider. It's rather simple once you do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{left the}} boat in September 1920. Without a job. Without a future, really. I accidentally met a boy who told me about an {{agricultural}} high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask me one thing about my education. He didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> read or write. Said {{you look like a}} big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for four years [...] reasonably basic preparation." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to bassist/singer Randy Jackson, jazz fusion is an {{exceedingly}} difficult genre to play; [...] "I … picked jazz fusion because I {{was trying to}} become the ultimate technical musician-able to play anything. Jazz fusion {{to me is the}} hardest music to play. You have to be so proficient on your instrument. Playing five tempos at the same time, for instance. I wanted to try the toughest music because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do that, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Hoopdriver. [...] "That's it. You can't do much at drapery without capital, you <b>know.</b> But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get really}} educated. I've thought sometimes..." ...|$|R
6000|$|After a moment's silence, he resumed: [...] "I {{left the}} wood, I hardly knew why, and with wild and bewildered feelings; and as I came {{out into the}} faint moonshine I saw that old lawyer {{standing}} quietly, but staring at me like an owl. At least, the light touched his red hair with fire, but his square old face was in shadow. But <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have read it, {{that it was the}} face of a hanging judge." ...|$|R
2500|$|After the Appeals court ruling, Dell'Utri {{expressed}} {{his admiration for}} the late Vittorio Mangano, a convicted Mafioso who up to his death in prison denied that any link existed between Cosa Nostra and Dell'Utri and Berlusconi. [...] "He was a sick inmate who was asked to testify against me and Berlusconi and always refused to do so. If he had, anything {{he would have said}} would have been believed. But he preferred to stay in prison, and die there, rather than to make unjust accusations," [...] Dell'Utri said. [...] "He was my hero. I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have resisted as much as he did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Widlar {{was a hard}} {{person to}} work with, but the few {{men and women who}} could, like Talbert and Jack Gifford, joined his inner circle for life. Widlar and Talbert closely guarded their trade secrets and kept {{unwanted}} co-workers out of the loop. Gifford, one of those accepted by Widlar and Talbert, said that Widlar [...] "would almost talk to nobody and he would only talk to me on, you <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get him in the right mood. And he was still secretive as hell". Talbert pushed Widlar's experimental orders through his plant at top speed, saving his partner four weeks on every batch {{at the expense of other}} orders. Fairchild executive Don Valentine said in 2004: [...] "This was a phenomenal duo of highly eccentric — or whatever the word is beyond eccentric — individuals". Former Fairchild photographer Richard Steinheimer said in 1995: [...] "Talbert handling the fabrication and Widlar handling the design, they ruled the world and led the world in linear integrated circuits for a couple of decades." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So I {{should have}} <b>known</b> you, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have seen you; but I couldn't, and you spoke so gruff. I didn't {{think you could}} speak gruff to me, Mark, at first coming back.' ...|$|R
60|$|After toiling {{in and out}} of passageways {{under the}} shadows of these strangely formed cliffs, and coming again and again to the same point, a blind pocket, I grew desperate. I named the {{baffling}} place Deception Pass, and then ran down a slide. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> keep my feet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> beat the avalanche. More by good luck than management I outran the roaring stones and landed safely. Then rounding the cliff below, I found myself on a narrow ledge, with a wall to my left, and to the right the tips of pinyon trees level with my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing; only, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get any man {{to look at}} me as {{that man}} looks at you, I'd--I don't know what I'd do. But he hates me. Oh, how he hates me!' ...|$|R
2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rose, drew myself up, and, endeavouring to {{look very}} solemn, said that I was, and demanded to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do {{anything}} for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] replied my father, with a laugh, [...] "I didn't {{want you}} to <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done without you, I should not have told you now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Jordan dear, I'll {{be better}} soon," [...] said Aunty Nan {{with her own}} sweet smile. [...] "'The {{inhabitant}} shall not say I am sick,' you <b>know.</b> But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only see little Joscelyn first!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” he returned, “I {{guess you}} <b>know,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> let you fix me we’d {{probably}} have some big times. But I seem to strike opportunities—well, {{in excess of}} my powers. I don’t seem able to respond.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Can {{you read}} the {{inscription}} on that flag, auntie?" [...] I asked. [...] "It's an old photograph I {{picked up in the}} attic at The Grange, and I'd like to <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> at what place it was taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{the quickest}} dodge for getting {{him away from}} that tray," [...] he explained. [...] "My throat was so dry that I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> shout loud enough. And {{this was not a}} case for shouting, either." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I figured I {{was going}} to get the outside the last restart.

That’s what I did. Did I have a plan? Was that exactly my plan? No. I was just going to drive it as hard as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and make {{whatever}} happened happen. It worked, just off the cuff." ...|$|R

Now that sounds bombastic, but I’m not sure that it is. Anyway, I’m going to England presently.” ...|$|R

6000|$|The purser {{smiled a}} little incredulously.

2500|$|Evert versus Goolagong was {{the match}} for the 1975 US Open title, which the first set went to the superbly playing Googlagong in five games to seven. Goolagong was playing a {{slashing}} and attacking style of game during the first set and into {{the first part of}} the second set, but Evert fought back with a track down ever ball mentality, which this allowed Evert to win the second set six games to four. In the final set, Evert was down one game to two, she rallied off five more games in a row to win six games to two. To this, Evert responded [...] "I was down on myself the whole match. I felt the pressure. But after two-all in the third set, I don't know what happened but I got more confident. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stay in there <b>I</b> <b>could</b> win the match." [...] This is exactly what she did, and this was her first-time that she won the US Open, which is her national open.|$|R
