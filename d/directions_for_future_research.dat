50|$|The Computer and the Brain is an {{unfinished}} book by mathematician John von Neumann, begun {{shortly before his}} death and first published in 1958. Von Neumann was an important figure in computer science, and the book discusses how the brain {{can be viewed as a}} computing machine. The book is speculative in nature, but von Neumann discusses several important differences between brains and computers of his day (such as processing speed and parallelism), as well as suggesting <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E

50|$|Using a pre-post {{research}} design, 70 {{patients with}} chronic tension or migraine headache were treated with wet-cupping. Three primary outcome measures were considered at the baseline and 3 months following treatment: headache severity, days of headache per month, and use of medication. Results suggest that, compared to the baseline, mean headache severity decreased by 66% following wet-cupping treatment. Treated patients also experienced the equivalent of 12.6 fewer days of headache per month. It was concluded that wet-cupping leads to clinical relevant benefits for primary care patients with headache. Possible mechanisms of wet-cupping efficacy, as well as <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> are discussed.|$|E

As the authors put it [...] "developments in information technology ... enable customers to create value by collaborating with the firm". The main contribution of the authors {{in this article is}} a conceptual model of the intensity of customer participation as function of product characteristics, market and customer characteristics, firm characteristics. In their conclusions and <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> the authors deal with three promising topics. First they propose to study supply-side issues and how increasing communication, participation from the customers and the emergence of communities enable customers to interact between them, sometimes leading to new creations. Second they see the [...] "locus of innovation" [...] as of interest and in particular how the shift of firm-centric networks to user-centric networks can lead to increased innovation capabilities. Third they wonder whether demand-side issues may not result in negative consequences on satisfaction. The third issue is already mentioned by Bendapuli and Leone: [...] "A customer who believes he or she has the expertise and chooses to co-produce {{may be more likely to}} make self-attributions for success and failure than a customer who lacks the expertise. A customer who lacks the expertise but feels forced to co-produce ... may make more negative attributions about co-production".|$|E

Data from Israeli customers mostly support the model. Some drivers (uncertainty avoidance, self-efficacy and Machiavellianism) enhance the probability of all three reactions whereas others increase the probability of only one (e. g., perceived-control switching; self-confidenceNWOM). The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed and <b>directions</b> <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> are provided.
