In general, learning process in the institutions has not been capable in optimizing students’ participation in the interaction process of the lectures. This research aimed at producing an effective “active learning” model {{to improve the quality}} of the learning process of learning strategies subject in Institutes of Education Workforce Education, especially in regards with students’ participation in the interaction process during lectures. The research employed Research and Development (R & D) method consisting of three stage; they are preliminary study, model development, and model validation. The preliminary study covered two parts: literature study and field survey. The development stage involved three parts: first <b>draft</b> <b>composition,</b> limited-scale try out and large-scale try out. Meanwhile, the third stage was an experiment to test the validity of the resulted product. The experiment was a quasi experimental design using pretest-posttest-control group design. The subjects of this research were lecturers and students who attended learning Strategies subject in four Institutes of Education Whorkforce Education in Yogyakarta; they are UNY, UAD, UPY, and UST. The data were collected through questionnaires, interview, observation, test, and document analysis. The data analysis technique employed qualitative and quantitative techniques. Based on the theoretical study and field study results which were buttressed with the results of limited-scale try out and large-scale try out, an appropriate learning model was produced to improve the learning process quality in terms of students’ participation in the interaction process during the Lecture of Learning Strategies subject in four Institutes of Education Whorkforce Education, which is an active learning model with grouping method. The development of this learning model was based on the concept of brain-performance-based learning theories, constructivist theories, and collaborative/ cooperative learning theories. The resulted model consisted of three parts: planning model, implementation model (orientation, shaping and team assignment, exploration, learning to be expert team, reorientation, team presentation, understanding checking, reflection and conclusion, and formative evaluation), and learning model evaluation. The results of the experiment and validation of the learning model showed that: (1) there were quantitative improvements among students who were actively involved in the learning interaction process; (2) there were improvements in the students’ average scores of achievement; there was significant difference between the scores before and after the treatment using active learning with grouping method in the process during the lecture of Learning Strategies; (3) the resulted learning model was better in improving the number of students who actively participated in the learning process than the learning model that the lecturers used to apply in the class; and (4) the resulted learning model was better in improving the average scores of the students than the previous learning model used by the lecturers with significant differences. Based on the findings, it is recommended that lecturers of Institutes of Education Workforce Education use this learning mode...|$|E

40|$|Learners’ {{effective}} and conscious use of metacognitive writing strategies (MWS) {{has proved to}} be beneficial in enhancing self-directed and autonomous learning, and also, in some cases, in improving their writing performance. Due to the fact that not every learner is equipped with a wide repertoire of writing strategies, researchers in the area of second language writing have stressed the importance of explicitly teaching strategies to students. Given the relevance of these issues, the aims of this study were two-fold: (a) to implement a strategies-based instruction on the MWS of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluating integrated to the regular classes of the subject English Language II in an English Teacher Training College in Argentina; and (b) to study its effects on the students’ strategy deployment and on their writing performance. In order to accomplish these purposes, a quasi-experimental design was adopted following a single group pre-test + post-test + delayed post test design; and data were collected by means of self-report questionnaires, diary entry tasks, a survey, and writing tests. Findings show that at post instruction the participants began employing a greater number of Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluating strategies, {{and they were able to}} focus on both global and local writing features when monitoring and evaluating their compositions. At post instruction, the participants of this study seemed to have acquired some of the aspects which Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) consider to be characteristic of expert writers, namely devoting considerable time to planning, considering the goal of the text, and attending to several aspects such as content, form, audience, and organization. In addition, results obtained from the delayed post test indicated that this change in strategy deployment was sustained over the medium-term. In addition, the participants reported having improved their overall performance as writers due to the strategy instruction received, and also that the use of the strategies learned had helped them identify and check different kinds of mistakes. Thus, these results are in line to those studies which ascertain that strategies can be taught, and that the deployment of metacognitive writing strategies allows learners to have major control over their learning process. Another finding obtained in this study was that although the participants became more strategic and even felt they had become better writers, the scores obtained for the first <b>drafts</b> of their <b>compositions</b> seemed to suggest that the students’ writing performance did not improve at post instruction. Nevertheless, further research would be needed to investigate whether the participants’ perceived improvement in their compositions did correlate with a better performance in their second and third <b>drafts</b> of their <b>compositions...</b>|$|R

This 77-page draft, which was written in pencil and on two (sometimes three) staves, was completed by 14 January 1854. The following month (1 February) he proceeded to make a second complete draft. It seems that his first intention {{was to make a}} <b>composition</b> <b>draft</b> in ink, just as he had done for Lohengrin, but as such a draft of the opening Prelude – which consists of little more than an arpeggiated E♭ major triad – would have been to all intents and purposes a full score, he decided to skip the intermediate stage and draft the full score in ink right away. This he proceeded to do with the Prelude, significantly revising some of its details in the process. When, however, he reached the beginning of Scene 1, he found that the remainder of the opera required too much revision and elaboration to allow him to develop a full score without first making a second complete draft. He therefore abandoned the full score in ink and proceeded to develop instead an instrumentation draft in pencil, in which he worked out most of the vocal and orchestral details of the four remaining scenes. This Instrumentationsskizze, as Wagner himself styled it, was completed by 28 May 1854.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined how}} sixth-grade students utilized evaluations and goals while revising their texts, {{to determine if}} those students who were identified as better writers also had more success when revising, and if specific types or configurations of operations lead to more successful revision. A coding system was developed to identify evaluations and goals according to the functions that they served during revision. Evaluations were categorized as either acceptance or rejection evaluations, depending on their judgment of the text. Goals were categorized as text strategy or guidance goals, depending on whether they instituted a specific strategy to counter a perceived problem in the text, or instituted a procedure or action that constituted management of the revision task. Think-aloud protocols and <b>drafts</b> of <b>compositions</b> provided a trace of students' revision activity. Identification of evaluations and goals by the functions that they served during revision provided a method for monitoring {{the connection between the}} process students used in revising and the product (if any) that resulted. Revisions produced were categorized as surface or text-base, with both their accumulative and individual impact on the text assessed. The coding system identified all evaluations and goals, even those that did not result in text changes but that were associated with considerations and attempts. Therefore, all revising behaviors, including emerging skills, were acknowledged. Results revealed that those students identified as better writers were not better revisors in terms of using evaluations or goals in a manner that resulted in the production of more sophisticated or more effective revisions. Students identified as low to high level writers all experienced various revision difficulties, as reflected by the absence of specific types of evaluations and/or goals that could have facilitated revision, yet were not used. Terminal revising was the common approach and involved reviewing a textual area only once, and setting a limited number of evaluations and goals to address a perceived problem. However, a sub-group of students who were identified as poorer writers did use an iterative revising strategy, which resulted in improved text quality. This strategy involved successive reviews of the text, resulting in the implementation of related multiple evaluations and goals addressing one textual area. Educators can consider the revising strategies (i. e., terminal and iterative revising) and operations (i. e., functional evaluations and goals) specifically identified in this research to assess how students' revise and to determine what strategies and operations need to be encouraged to foster absent or underdeveloped revision skills. Collaborative student and teacher interactions designed to encourage the utilization of these specific strategies and operations have the potential to lead to more effective revising...|$|R

Likewise, with the widespread implementation of communicative approaches to language teaching, writing has turned to a Cinderella skill in current EFL classes {{since most of the}} attention is paid to speaking and listening activities. However, improving writing ability has always been a concern for teachers, materials developers, and researchers. In this paper, the role of critical thinking (CT) in improving the writing ability of EFL learners was investigated. For this purpose, 70 EFL learners were asked to write a composition about a unique topic they had never thought before. A placement test was given to learners to divide them into proficient and less-proficient groups to see whether there is any variation between them. The common themes of the writings of these two groups were examined before introducing the principles of CT.

The results showed that after explicitly teaching the principles of CT, learners’ writings, in both groups, improved qualitatively and quantitatively; however, it had better effects on proficient learners.

The findings proved that CT remained useful even when learners did not have any background information about the topic they were asked to write. Critical thinking was a way to provide learners with specific tools, namely, imaginative, supportive, and disciplinary. Finally, some recommendations are given...|$|R
