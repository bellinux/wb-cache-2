500|$|Turnbull {{commented on}} several points {{that he felt}} went unnoticed by the module's proofreader. The maps did not contain a scale, which he assumed was [...] per square. It is unclear what {{triggers}} one of the traps in the first module. In the second module, an exit from map level {{one does not have}} an entrance marked on the second level map. Ultimately he found the errors minor, and easily fixed. Turnbull's most major criticism was that the adventure was aimed at parties of too high a level. Summing up, he said [...] "No DM should be without them, for even if he never <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> run them, they are a source of much excellent design quality." ...|$|E

Simply staged, it is equal parts funny and sexy... If its possible for one video to sum up Madonna's Madonna-ness, 'Human Nature' is that video". Louis Virtel from The Backlot ranked the video at number 22 on a list for [...] "Madonna's 55 Best Videos", and called it [...] "tongue-in-cheek, pleather-heavy". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "It's rare that Madonna <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be both harsh and hilarious in a music video", and in this one, [...] "Madonna basically does whatever the hell she wants. Brandish a chihuahua? Mock and celebrate kinkiness? Sneer at the camera like a bored third-grader? She does it all, and even in black cornrows, she's a vision of coolness and sexual superiority". Carol Vernallis, writer of Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context noted that the concept of black outfit against a white background [...] "works well, but the snare drum, which corresponds to nothing in the imagery, seems to float above the soundtrack".|$|E

500|$|THEM Anime Review's Carlos Ross said, [...] "The voice-acting is remarkable, the {{directing}} is solid, {{and music}} is quite competent. But the real kicker {{here is the}} animation quality, which actually equals (and sometimes exceeds) that of excellent television series like Vandread and Full Metal Panic...there is a remarkable amount of storyline; the plot is well-written and executed, and never <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be too drawn out. And Shinkai gives equal time to the slick action sequences and the well-handled, genuinely touching romance". IGN's [...] A.E. Sparrow said, [...] "While [...] was visually {{one of the best}} pieces of eye-candy I have seen in a year or so, it's ultimately a voice track over a sequence of pretty pictures. Don't get me wrong, it was absolutely beautiful, but it left me wanting more". Mania's Chris Beveridge commended ADV Films for obtaining [...] the original computer files that were used to create it. He said, [...] "the transfer here is simply gorgeous. Colors are amazingly lush and deep, saturated without bleeding. Cross coloration is non-existent and only a few very minor areas of aliasing occur. The only real 'flaw' that I could see with this transfer is during some of the panning sequences up and down, there’s a slight stutter that’s simply inherent in the materials". DVDs Worth Watching's Johanna Draper Carlson said, [...] "the character designs are familiar and uninspired, and the cross-cutting choppy".|$|E

Anupama Chopra {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars in The Hindustan Times: [...] "Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbaai Dobaara! had me cheering for the bad guy. Which, {{at least in the}} movies, is never a bad thing. The film gets one extra star for Akshay Kumar, who makes a stellar killer". Madhureeta Mukherjee awarded the film 3.5 out of five stars in The Times of India, telling readers to watch the film only for its flattering dons and their heroines, saying [...] "there's nothing criminal about it!" [...] She praised Milan Luthria for capturing the essence of the film's setting and Kumar's portrayal of Shoaib Khan: [...] "Bhai act with flamboyance and mojo ... He <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> do what he does best – herogiri (albeit less menacing, more entertaining), with charisma and clap-trap dialoguebaazi" [...] but criticised Imran Khan's [...] "ill-at-ease" [...] rogue, {{the second half of the}} film for being [...] "at times too overbearing" [...] and said, [...] "this film has its moments, but it's not as compelling as the prequel." [...] Vinayak Chakrovorty gave the film two-and-a-half out of five stars in India Today: [...] "OUATIMD should remind Bollywood what we all always knew: Never make a sequel just for the heck of it if you don't have a genuine idea to entertain". Subhash K. Jha termed the film as [...] "one of the most ill-timed gangster dramas" [...] criticising the acting of all the three leads, praising only the short cameo of Sonali Bendre.|$|E
500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E
