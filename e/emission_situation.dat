40|$|AbstractCement {{is one of}} {{the three}} main {{building}} materials, which provides important support for other related industrials. Concerning the emission characteristics during the production procedure, it has a vital significance to analyze the current <b>emission</b> <b>situation</b> and forecast its emission trends. However, recent research mainly focused on static analysis of the direct emissions, which is not conductive to decision makers to grasp the emission potential in cement industry. This study presented a simulation model to depict the future emission trends based on system dynamics, and aimed to put up with different optimization scenarios in view of current energy conservation and emission reduction targets. The results may help decision makers identify the current <b>emission</b> <b>situation</b> and predict precisely the emission trend, thus realizing the emissions targets in view of the whole process of the cement industry in China...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{goal of the}} EU - Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to achieve a good chemical status of surface waters. According to Article 1 (c) "specific measures for the progressive reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of priority substances" must be implemented. For the priority hazardous substances, discharges, emissions and losses must be stopped or phasedout. Therefore {{the goal of this}} project was, on the one hand, to analyse the <b>emission</b> <b>situation</b> of the 33 priority substances and to work out propositions to limit emissions, taking particular account of the situation in Germany. On the other hand, the goal was to technically monitor and support the ongoing work at EU-level, including a juridical examination of the EU-Commission's proposals. Substance-specific data sheets were compiled for the 33 priority substances in order to present the information and data in a compact form. The relevance of the substances for Germany was evaluated based on the existing monitoring data, current use and <b>emission</b> <b>situation.</b> The important emission paths were analysed in detail for those substances relevant in Germany.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{an improved}} approach to Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plot analysis, {{based on a}} new type of intercept correction factor. This factor is more cleanly defined than the factor previously used. General enabling theory is given that applies to any type of FN plot of data that can be fitted using a FN-type equation. Practical use is limited to <b>emission</b> <b>situations</b> where slope correction factors can be reliably predicted. By making a series of well-defined assumptions and approximations, it is shown how the general formulas reduce to provide an improved theory of orthodox FN-plot data analysis. This applies to situations where the circuit current is fully controlled by the emitter characteristics, and tunneling can be treated as taking place through a Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier. For orthodox emission, good working formulas make numerical evaluation of the slope correction factor and the new intercept correction factor quick and straightforward. A numerical illustration, using simulated emission data, shows how to use this improved approach to derive values for parameters in the full FN-type equation for the SN barrier. Good self-consistency is demonstrated. The general enabling formulas also pave the way for research aimed at developing analogous data-analysis procedures for non-orthodox <b>emission</b> <b>situations.</b> Comment: Paper is extended version of poster presented at the 25 th International Vacuum Nanoelectronics Conference, Jeju island, South Korea, July 2012.

(2) According to the LMDI decomposition results, the key driver boosting the per-capita carbon emissions in the three economic regions of China between 1997 and 2009 was economic development, and the energy efficiency was much greater than the energy structure after considering their effect on restraining increased per-capita carbon emissions. (3) Based on the decomposition, the factors that affected per-capita carbon emissions in the panel co-integration test showed that Central China had the best energy structure elasticity in its regional per-capita carbon emissions.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the emission characteristics of GHG (CH 4 and N 2 O) under four reduced tillage systems from October 2007 to August 2009 based on a 10 -yr tillage experiment in the North China Plain, which included no-tillage (NT) and three reduced tillage systems of subsoil tillage (ST), harrow tillage (HT) and rotary tillage (RT), with the conventional tillage (CT) as the control. The soil under the five tillage systems was an absorption sink for CH 4 and an emission source for N 2 O. The soil temperature positive impacted on the CH 4 absorption by the soils of different tillage systems, while a significant negative correlation was observed between the absorption and soil moisture.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} in progress {{is to examine the}} effect of CO 2 -emission trading and the intensified application of renewable energy sources to the liberalized power market. The research approach applies methods from a combination of economics, natural sciences and computer science in order to obtain decision support for the planning of future power plant structures, investment decisions, and emission scales. Besides the liberalization, future power markets are increasingly influenced by regulatory acts which are mainly responding to the necessity of a structured reduction of CO 2 -emissions. For CO 2 -eminssions, which are generated by the production of electric power, an emission trading system with obligatory participation is being launched from 2005 on. Since in the same period, the amount of power which has to be produced from renewable energy sources is increased dramatically, an additional incoming aspect is the fluctuating character of many of those sources. These changed general conditions in the industrial power sector cause novel structures at international power markets and additionally a new <b>emissions</b> <b>situation.</b> The aim of {{this research}} is the conception of a methodologically innovative concept to simulate power markets based on multi-agent systems (MAS) and agent-based computational economics (ACE) which fulfils the described desiderata. Since heterogeneous utility functions for individual market participants can be modelled - in comparison to existing centrally steered simulation methods - a multi-agent based simulation approach promises more realistic simulation results. Specific behaviour and the dynamic adoption of the strategies of individual participants based on the experiences derived from market behaviour can explicitly be simulated. The aim of the research approach is to obtain a strengthened understanding of the mutual effects among heterogeneous participants and the dynamics of the market of CO 2 -emissions as well as renewable energy resources.

40|$|One of the {{important}} sources of greenhouse gases is the emission of methane from rice fields. Methane emission from rice fields {{is the result of}} a complex array of soil processes involving plant-microbe interactions. The cumulative effects of these processes at the level of individual plants influence the global atmospheric composition and make it necessary to expand our research focus from small plots to large landscapes and regions. However, present extrapolations (`upscaling¿) are tenuous at best because of methodological and practical problems. The different steps taken to calculate regional emission strengths are discussed and illustrated by calculations for a case-study in the Philippines. The applicability of high quality, process-based, models of methane emission at the level of individual plants is limited for regional analysis by their large data requirements. Simplified models can be used at the regional level but are not able to capture the complex <b>emission</b> <b>situation.</b> Data availability and model accuracy are therefore often difficult to match. Other common sources of uncertainty are the quality of input data. A critical evaluation of input data should be made in every upscaling study to assess the suitability for calculating regional emissions. For the case-study we show effects of differences in input data caused by data source and interpolation technique. The results from the case-study and similar studies in literature indicate that upscaling techniques are still troublesome and a cause of large uncertainties in regional estimates. The results suggest that some of the stumbling blocks in the conventional upscaling procedure are almost impassable in the near future. Based on these results, a plea is made for meso-level measurements to calibrate and validate upscaling methods in order to be better able to quantify and reduce uncertainties in regional emission estimate...|$|E

Previous {{scientific}} publications have shown that ships contribute significantly to atmospheric concentrations of NO x, particulate matter and ozone. Especially in the case of particulate matter and ozone, this influence can even be seen in regions far away from the main shipping routes. In order to quantify the effects of North Sea shipping on air quality in its bordering states, it is essential to determine the emissions from shipping as accurately as possible. Within Interreg IVb project Clean North Sea Shipping (CNSS), a bottom-up approach was developed and used to thoroughly compile such an emission inventory for 2011 that served as the base year for the current <b>emission</b> <b>situation.</b> The innovative aspect of this approach was to use load-dependent functions to calculate emissions from the ships' current activities instead of averaged emission factors for the entire range of the engine loads. These functions were applied to ship activities that were derived from hourly records of Automatic Identification System signals together with a database containing the engine characteristics of the vessels that traveled the North Sea in 2011. The emission model yielded ship emissions among others of NO x and SO 2 at high temporal and spatial resolution that were subsequently used in a chemistry transport model in order to simulate the impact of the emissions on pollutant concentration levels. The total emissions of nitrogen reached 540  Gg and those of sulfur oxides 123  Gg within the North Sea – including the adjacent western part of the Baltic Sea until 5 ° W.

The world’s most sizeable populations live in middle-income countries with emerging economies and growing <b>emissions.</b> This <b>situation</b> requires political intervention to facilitate economic growth, job creation and poverty eradication alongside {{efforts to control}} emissions growth. This interdisciplinary study draws on concepts and methods from sociology, political science, science and technology studies and the management literature. The authors combine social network and discourse network analysis in an innovative way. The methodology analyses both the interactions between researchers {{as well as their}} actual knowledge contributions. The study argues that there is a substantial network of knowledge holders involved in knowledge creation on climate and development co-benefits. Our analysis shows the type of interactions between two knowledge networks as well as new knowledge emerging from these networks. Research groups and practitioners have produced 17 novel knowledge contributions, ranging from definitions of co-benefits, methodology and implementation. Yet the networks remain loosely connected. Practitioners who have less time to assess academic literature could benefit from closer interactions with more academically oriented experts and vice versa...|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} set-up is proposed {{to investigate the}} noise generated by airfoils. It consists of two adjacent plane jets ducted into an anechoic room, and the airfoils under investigation are placed in the median jet. Besides the benefit in the acoustical conditions of the experiments (decrease of the background noise due to the jets, shift of the preferred frequencies of the jets below the range of interest for the airfoil <b>emission),</b> the aerodynamic <b>situation</b> itself is improved (increase in length of the potential zone, decrease of induced flow fluctuations). There is therefore the possibility to investigate airfoil noise with longer chords and higher incident velocities. I...|$|R
