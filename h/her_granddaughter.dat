5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage.

In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau.

5|$|Sarah’s {{personal}} income was now considerable, {{and she used}} the money to invest in land; she believed this would protect her from currency devaluation.

Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry <b>her</b> <b>granddaughter,</b> Lady Diana Spencer, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, for which she would pay a massive dowry of £100,000. However, Robert Walpole, the First Lord of the Treasury (effectively the same as today's Prime Minister) vetoed the plan. Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, {{good relations with the}} royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by Queen Caroline, who attempted to cultivate her friendship.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{book of the}} Ecclesiastical History of the English People, {{completed}} by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 731, celebrates the monastery at Ely and focuses on Æthelthryth's piety and the translation of her relics. Bede does not mention the matrilinear succession established at Ely by Æthelthryth, where power passed in turn to Seaxburh before subsequently transferring to Seaxburh's daughter Eormenhild and to <b>her</b> <b>granddaughter,</b> Werburh. He praises the virtues of Æthelthryth, a princess who was married twice but still preserved her virginity. Seaxburh receives little praise from Bede, as she had borne children before becoming a nun. He only mentions Seaxburh's marriage to Eorcenberht, succession as abbess and translation of her sister's relics.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, the Torah and yad Rosenberg {{left with}} King Kalākaua were {{included}} in an exhibition of royal possessions at a bazaar held by King Kalākaua's wife, Queen Kapiolani. After King Kalākaua's death in 1891, his stepson David Kawānanakoa inherited the items. When Kawānanakoa's wife, Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa, inherited them after David's death, she loaned them {{to members of the}} Hawaiian Jewish community on religious holidays. <b>Her</b> <b>granddaughter,</b> Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa, later acquired the items. The yad was bequeathed to Temple Emanu-El in 1959, and formally dedicated for use in Torah readings the next year. The Torah was lost in the 1940s, but was recovered in 1972 when a Honolulu attorney found the scroll in the possessions of a recently deceased client and donated it to the temple. The Torah had been damaged and could not be used in services, but the temple later installed a plaque describing Rosenberg below a glass display case housing the Torah and yad.|$|E
