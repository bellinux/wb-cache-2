5|$|The Supreme Court {{announced}} its decision on June 29, 2006. The Court reversed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, holding that President George W. Bush {{did not have}} authority {{to set up the}} war crimes tribunals and finding the special military commissions illegal under both military justice law and the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) was {{established}} by UN Security Council Resolution 827, which was passed on 25 May 1993. The court has power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law, breaches of the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions,</b> violating the laws or customs of war, committing genocide, and crimes against humanity committed in {{the territory of the}} former SFR Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{indications}} that the other detainees being held at facilities throughout the world (e.g., Bagram Air Base and black sites), might use the Supreme Court's ruling to challenge their treatment. Their reasoning may be that since the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> afforded protection to Hamdan, its other protections might be effective for them as well. Commentators expressed mixed opinions about {{the strength of this}} argument.|$|E

5000|$|The Second <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> [...] "for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea" [...] {{replaced}} the Hague Convention (X) of 1907. It {{was the first}} <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> on {{the protection of the}} victims of maritime warfare and mimicked the structure and provisions of the First <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{international}} institutions have their seats in Switzerland, {{in part because of}} its policy of neutrality. Geneva is the birthplace of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> and, since 2006, hosts the United Nations Human Rights Council. Even though Switzerland {{is one of the most}} recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the Palace of Nations in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|On September 4, 1980, {{the newly}} proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iran {{replaced}} the Red Lion and Sun with the Red Crescent, consistent with most other Muslim nations. Though the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran {{has in the}} past reserved the right to take it up again at any time; the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by Protocol III in 2005 even as it added the Red Crystal.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004, Hamdan {{was charged}} with {{conspiracy}} to commit terrorism, and the Bush administration made arrangements to try him before a military commission, established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21, 2002. He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> {{relative}} to the Treatment of Prisoners of War was adopted in 1929. It was significantly revised and replaced by the Third <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1949.|$|R

5000|$|It appears ... {{that the}} {{procedures}} of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals do not qualify as status determination under the Third <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention.</b> <......> The fact that no status determination had taken place according to the Third <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> was sufficient reason for a judge from the District Court of Columbia dealing with a habeas petition, to stay proceedings before a military commission. Judge Robertson in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld held that the Third <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention,</b> which he considered selfexecuting, had not been complied with since a Combatant Status Review Tribunal could {{not be considered a}} ‘competent tribunal’ pursuant to article 5 of the Third <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Politically, {{the prisoners}} of war in Germany were given {{virtually}} more freedom than civilians in occupied France. In accordance with the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions,</b> French prisoners elected hommes de confiance (Men of trust) from among their number to represent their interests. The Germans attempted to encourage prisoners to adopt Nazi or collaborationist ideologies, even supporting {{the creation of a}} pro-German newspaper, Le Trait d'Union, for prisoners and pro-Vichy Cercles Pétain groups existed in many separate camps. Although Pétain was generally supported by the prisoners, Pierre Laval who was Petain's de facto Prime Minister was extremely unpopular. Laval's re-promotion in 1942 following his dismissal in December 1940, together with the failure of his Relève system, widely undermined support for Vichy among prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The 8,000Australians {{captured}} by Germany and Italy were generally treated {{in accordance with}} the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions.</b> The majority of these men were taken during the fighting in Greece and Crete in 1941, with the next largest group being 1,400airmen shot down over Europe. Like other western Allied POWs, the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany. As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies. These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths. Four Australians were also executed following a mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. While the Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in World WarI, it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea {{was adopted}} in 1906. It was {{significantly}} revised {{and replaced by}} the Second <b>Geneva</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1949.|$|R

5|$|After {{his return}} to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was {{originally}} only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions,</b> and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, 2004, a victim's rights group, the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed {{a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S. {{companies}} for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed {{that the use of}} Agent Orange violated the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions.</b> Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law {{at the time of its}} use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. Weinstein used the British example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 29,000Australians {{were taken}} {{prisoner}} by the Axis during the war, {{the bulk of}} them members of the Australian Army. During the fighting in the Middle East and Greece, 7,116 Australian soldiers were taken prisoner by German and Italian forces. Of these men, 3,109 were captured at Crete and 2,065 on the mainland of Greece. Most of the other POWs {{were members of the}} 9th Division captured during the retreat from Cyrenaica in early 1941, the siege of Tobruk or the fighting near El Alamein in mid-1942. Like other western Allied POWs, the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany and were generally treated in accordance with the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions.</b> As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies. These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths. As the war drew to a close, a unit designated the AIF Reception Group (United Kingdom) was established near Eastbourne in England to provide accommodation and support for the POWs once they were released. By August 1945 all the former Australian POWs in Europe had embarked on ships bound for Australia. While Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in World WarI, it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment.|$|E

In 1993, the UN Security Council adopted a binding Chapter VII resolution establishing an International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The resolution approved a Statute which said {{that the problem of}} adherence of some but not all States to the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Conventions</b> does not arise, since beyond any doubt the Convention is declarative of customary international law.
