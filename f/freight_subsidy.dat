40|$|The {{objectives}} of Australia’s National Drought Policy (NDP), {{agreed to by}} Commonwealth (national), state, and territory ministers in 1992, are to: • encourage primary producers and other sections of rural Australia to adopt self-reliant approaches to managing the risks stemming from climatic variability; • maintain and protect Australia’s agricultural and environmental resource base during periods of extreme climate stress; and • ensure early recovery of agricultural and rural industries consistent with long-term sustainable levels. Under the NDP, Australian farmers are expected to assume greater responsibility for managing the risks arising from climatic variability. This requires integrating financial and business management with production and resource management {{to ensure that the}} financial and physical resources of farm businesses are used efficiently. Details of the NDP and its implementation are described in previous issues of Drought Network News (White, 1992 and 1993; White et al., 1993 a). Since the signing of the National Drought Policy Statement in 1992, the states and territories have moved to implement the range of measures spelled out in the NDP (White, 1993) by: • implementing the National Property Management Planning Campaign, with emphasis on education in effective risk management, sustainable agriculture, and drought preparedness; • phasing out transaction-based <b>subsidies,</b> particularly <b>freight</b> <b>subsidies</b> for the transport of fodder, water, and livestock provided by state and territory governments; • providing financial assistance through the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) to farmers exposed to exceptional drought circumstances; and • undertaking drought-related research and development, with emphasis on drought prediction, monitoring, and management...|$|R
40|$|The Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSTA) and the {{subsequent}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have contributed to increasing concentration of agricultural trade between the United States and Canada. This has heightened bilateral trade tensions and trade conflicts for numbers of Canadian farm products. These conflicts, {{and the need to}} accommodate domestic marketing policies to the obligations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), have encouraged changes in Canadian agricultural marketing policies. Pressures to reduce government expenditures have also provided a compelling reinforcing impetus to changes in numbers of Canada's agricultural marketing programs. However, despite some changes in the ways that the programs for the Canadian supply-managed farm products are organized and administered, there has been no reduction in the levels of policy-induced support provided to this group of producers. Indeed, adjustments in marketing and trade policy for dairy, poultry and eggs have increased the levels of protection for these sectors. High levels of protection for supply-managed farm products reflect the strong influences of regional political pressures in Canada; this is an influence that is expected to continue in the future. In contrast to the supply-managed dairy and poultry sectors, major changes have been made in marketing programs for the export-oriented Canadian grains and red meats sectors in response to trade and budgetary pressures. These have involved the removal of longstanding rail <b>freight</b> <b>subsidies</b> for grains and the phasing down or termination of several stabilization and safety net programs.

40|$|The Productivity Commission’s {{inquiry report}} into ‘Tasmanian <b>Freight</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Arrangements’ was tabled in Parliament in May 2007. The Commission {{was asked to}} report on {{arrangements}} for subsidising containerised and bulk shipping between the mainland and Tasmania and to recommend an appropriate future approach and/or arrangements. The Commission found that the current arrangements do not operate as intended. Different ways of claiming rebates for the same freight task can result in different TFES (Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme) payments. This can lead to overestimated freight costs and result in higher than appropriate rebates. The Commission recommended that rebates be based on original invoices from carriers that include a specific wharf-towharf charge. The Commission also recommended that wheat no longer be eligible for assistance under the TFES. The TWFS (the freight equalisation scheme for wheat) would pay {{the same level of}} assistance per tonne to wheat shipped in containers and in bulk, with assistance based on the disadvantage of the least cost method of shipping (plus intermodal costs, less a rail freight equivalent cost). bulk shipping, container shipping, Freight costs, Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, Tasmanian Wheat Freight Scheme...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} the issues affecting {{the competitiveness of}} Tasmanian business {{as they relate to}} shipping, port, road, and rail infrastructure and services. It also focuses on the effectiveness of the freight and passenger subsidy schemes and assesses the alignment of their objectives and outcomes. Key points: 	Tasmania, like mainland Australia, is an island economy. It is serviced by high quality but relatively high cost containerised domestic shipping services. The viability of direct international shipping services is affected by the cost of coastal shipping. Given its reliance on sea transport, Tasmania is particularly affected by inefficiencies embedded in coastal shipping regulation. This regulation should be reviewed and reformed as a matter of priority. 	Tasmania uniquely receives (Federally) subsidised freight services via longstanding arrangements in recognition of the relative cost 2 ̆ 7 disadvantage 2 ̆ 7 of Bass Strait transit. The Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES), Tasmanian Wheat Freight Scheme (TWFS), and Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme (BSPVES) were designed to partially offset these costs. The term equalisation misleadingly implies 2 ̆ 7 full 2 ̆ 7 compensation for the cost disadvantage but that is not inherent in the design and operation of the schemes. Further, securing 2 ̆ 7 true 2 ̆ 7 equalisation is inevitably a policy chimera. 	The Australian Government has outlaid more than 2 billion since the inception of the schemes, and without change a further 2 billion can be expected over the next 15 years. In 2011 12 total outlays for the schemes were 128 million. 	There is no coherent economic rationale for the TFES and it falls well short of what is needed to improve the lagging competitiveness of the Tasmanian economy — which the Commission considers should be the policy imperative. It has a high fiscal cost, eligibility is arbitrary; and the direct recipients are concentrated notwithstanding the unclear incidence of the subsidy. Further, the TFES is inherently complex and leads to unintended consequences. 	There is no clearly articulated objective for the BSPVES. At least some of the subsidy is being captured by the Tasmanian Government-owned and sole provider of Bass Strait passenger and vehicle shipping services — TT Line. 	The Australian Government has stated its current intention to retain the TFES and the BSPVES. The recommendations related to the schemes in this report are made on that basis. 	A flat rate of subsidy per container (adjusted for King Island and the Furneaux Group of islands) would offer significant advantages over the current parameter based regime — increasing incentives to minimise transport costs, improving transparency and simplifying administration. 	The Tasmanian Government has initiated a process to secure the return of a commercially viable direct international container service, albeit involving some transitional assistance. This raises an intractable sequencing obstacle for considering the relative merit of moving now to extend the scope of the TFES to all eligible northbound commodities transhipped through the Port of Melbourne. 	Several efficiency issues relating to Tasmania 2 ̆ 7 s shipping and freight are the responsibility of the Tasmanian Government. These include: rationalising infrastructure assets such as ports and rail; private operation and ownership of freight infrastructure assets where this would improve their efficiency; and developing a sustainable integrated freight strategy. 	Tasmania faces broader economic and social challenges and the Australian Government should put less emphasis on <b>freight</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes in favour of reforms that have national and Tasmanian benefits (such as coastal shipping reform) and those that directly enhance the competitiveness and productivity of the Tasmanian economy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} {{strategies for}} Chile have been oriented toward a greater commercial openness. Chile and the United States signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has triggered controversies between producers {{directed to the}} internal market due to the production and export subsidies that this country carries out. This study analyzed the effect of subsidies granted by the United States to wheat (Tritricum aestivum) and corn (Zea mays) growers (Farm Bill 2002). For the study, Technical Standard sheet were drawn up, from which were determined the direct production costs and the gross margins. The variables used (market prices, <b>subsidies,</b> <b>freight</b> costs and tariffs) and determining the average variable costs allowed us to do a sensitivity analysis, thus establishing the minimum level of produc-tion that national farmers must achieve {{in order to maintain}} competitive-ness while a free trade is in force.

40|$|The United States and Canada {{share the}} longest common border and largest {{bilateral}} trading {{relationship in the}} world. Recent trading agreements [...] CUSTA, NAFTA and WTO [...] have enhanced trade by encouraging elimination of many remaining trade barriers. However, one cause for concern {{about the effectiveness of}} these trade agreements has been the frequency of Canadian-U. S. trade disputes over bilateral wheat and barley trade arrangements and trade flows. To some extent, these disputes have arisen because of differences in and lack of harmonization between the domestic and trade policies implemented by the two countries, although other political factors have also clearly been important causes of these disagreements. Since 1986, many dimensions of the agricultural policies of both countries have undergone radical changes, perhaps especially with respect to small grains and oilseeds. Here we provide assessments of whether important aspects of the two countries' domestic and trade grains and oilseeds have converged toward harmonization since implementation of the Canada-U. S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989. It {{should also be noted that}} many of the changes in each countries' agricultural policies cannot be attributed to free trade agreements. Rather, they reflect government responses to budgetary pressures, commitments under international trade agreements, changes in the relative political importance of rural and urban voters, and other factors. Changes in General Levels of Support Producer Subsidy Equivalents are indicators of the proportion of total revenues from sales of a crop resulting from government subsidies and other income support policies such as tariffs. U. S. producer subsidy equivalents for wheat and other grains have declined substantially from their 1993 - 1995 average levels as a result of the decoupling of income support payments under the 1996 FAIR Act. Similarly, the average wheat, other grains and oilseeds producer subsidy equivalents reported for Canada over the same period overstate current producer subsidy equivalents because of the elimination of Canadian grain transportation subsidies in 1995. Thus, generally, levels of government support for wheat and small grains have fallen quite considerably both in the U. S. and in Canada, indicating some movement in the direction of policy harmonization for these commodities. Farm Income Supports Over the past twenty years, farm income support in Canada has been delivered throughseveral different programs. Increasing budgetary pressures and a greater focus on market orientation led to the elimination of the Gross Revenue Insurance Program and the western grain transportation subsidies by 1996. The only current direct income support program is the Net Income Stabilization Account (NISA), which provides modest subsidies on interest rates paid to farmers on moneys they themselves pay into an income stabilization account. In the United States during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, changes were made to the deficiency payment/loan rate farm income support programs for wheat and small grains that tended to reduce the size of government payments to wheat and barley producers. Then, in 1996, the FAIR Act changed the entire farm income support mechanism, largely decoupling direct government payments to producers of those crops from current production decisions. In summary, the distortionary effects of Canadian and U. S. income support programs for wheat and other grains have been substantially curtailed, especially over the past three years. Similarly, the distortionary effects of Canadian income support programs for oilseeds have also been reduced toward the relatively modest levels associated with the U. S. oilseeds program, which has changed relatively little over the past ten years. There has been convergence in this area of farm policy. Grain Marketing and Export Subsidy Programs To the extent that U. S. export subsidy programs have become subject to GATT disciplines and funding for the U. S. export enhancement program has been reduced, the U. S. has moved toward a less distortionary set of trade policies for grains and oilseeds. The removal of <b>freight</b> <b>subsidies</b> has also moved Canada's grains trade policy in a less distortionary direction. However, Canada's export marketing board policy for wheat and barley (operated through the Canadian Wheat Board) has not changed in recent years. With respect to export credit guarantees, both countries operate roughly comparable programs, although under the GSM- 103 program, the U. S. is able to offer somewhat longer term (3 - 7 year) lines of credit. These programs have been subject only to relatively modest changes over the past ten years. On balance, there has probably been less harmonization of U. S. and Canadian export policies than of the two countries' income support programs. Thus, export policies, particularly the existence of the U. S. export enhancement program and the marketing powers of the CWB, will continue to be part of bilateral trade issues. agricultural policy, harmonization and convergence, grains, oilseeds, International Relations/Trade, Q 1,...|$|R
