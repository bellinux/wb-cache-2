40|$|The most {{important}} characteristic of major chemical accidents, from a societal perspective, is {{their tendency to}} produce off-site effects. The extent and severity of the accident may significantly affect the population and {{the environment of the}} adjacent areas. Following an accident event, effort should be made to limit such effects. Management decisions should be based on rational and quantitative information based on the site specific circumstances and the possible consequences. To produce such information we have developed an <b>operational</b> <b>centre</b> for managing large-scale industrial accidents. Its architecture involves an integrated framework of geographical information system (GIS) and RDBMS technology systems equipped with interactive communication capabilities. The <b>operational</b> <b>centre</b> was developed for Windows 98 platforms, for the region of Thriasion Pedion of West Attica, where the concentration of industrial activity and storage of toxic chemical is immense within areas of high population density. An appropriate case study is given in order to illuminate the use and necessity of the <b>operational</b> <b>centre.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Good {{agreement}} is found between IASI and the NWP fields from almost all centres. The differences in IASI fit {{can be explained}} by variations in model resolution, data selection, cloud detection methodology and radiative transfer models. The NRL model shows greater deviation from IASI than the others: this is attributable to a low model top and the fact that IASI processing at NRL is not as far advanced as at the other centres so for this study only crude quality control and cloud detection have been applied. This type of intercomparison is a useful tool for <b>operational</b> <b>centres</b> to find problems with their data processing and to compare the performance of radiative transfer models. It can also help to diagnose model biases. Comparison of IASI radiances with NWP models from seven <b>operational</b> <b>centre...</b>|$|R
