5|$|The FIPS {{county code}} is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely {{identifies}} counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number {{is unique to}} each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Addison County, Vermont is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Addison County, Vermont, one must use the state code of 50 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Addison County, Vermont is 50001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau <b>Info</b> page for that county.|$|E
