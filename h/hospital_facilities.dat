5|$|Biko's banning {{order in}} 1973 {{prevented}} him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped {{to set up a}} new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, David Russell. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing black people with a sense of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black people who would not otherwise have access to <b>hospital</b> <b>facilities.</b> He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E

The skyscraper-ish hospital buildings were designed mainly for housing short-term patients; therefore it has inadequate space for residents to move around freely. Moreover, the hospital management team forbids the patients from bringing with them personal belongings, from cooking, and from coming over to the front building, which policy is nothing less than discriminative.|$|E
25|$|On November 8, 1918 {{the entire}} ship's {{complement}} was stricken with influenza {{while working in}} Palawan. The ship had not heard of the worldwide epidemic and thus the sudden occurrence alarmed the ship's company greatly. Eight of the Filipino crew died and others did not recover for a month. Romblon, herself stricken by a milder epidemic, was sent with an additional medical officer but Pathfinder was forced to Manila for <b>hospital</b> <b>facilities.</b> So many of the crew were in no condition to return to sea that many sought discharges and the ship returned to work December 8 with an almost new crew.|$|E

25|$|A new sutler's store, {{with high}} prices, was {{established}} at the camp around April 1, 1864. Construction of a very advanced additional 180–bed hospital, including a mess room, kitchen, hot water, adjoining laundry and flush toilets, was completed on April 10, 1864. Yet, the <b>hospital</b> <b>facilities</b> were still too small for all {{the needs of the}} prisoners and guards. Despite the need, the camp added only 70 more beds in two old buildings. The separate smallpox hospital remained in a converted cavalry stable until it was moved to a site called Adele Grove, one–half mile south of the camp {{on the south side of}} the University of Chicago, facing Cottage Grove. The expanded facility began to operate on April 15, 1864.|$|E

Business, finance, administration, and sales and service rank high among types of occupations. Approximately ten percent of Ottawa's GDP is derived from finance, insurance and real estate whereas employment in goods-producing industries is only half the national average. The City of Ottawa is the second largest employer with over 15,000 employees.|$|E
25|$|Pertinent up-to-date, {{confidential}} {{patient information}} {{is converted to}} a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT). This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a hospital or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. <b>Hospital</b> <b>facilities</b> often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|E
