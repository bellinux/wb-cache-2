40|$|This degree project {{illustrates}} newsprint and waterless offset. A new news {{press was}} introduced at Drupa- 00, Cortina from KBA, {{which is the}} first news press dedicated the waterless technique. With actual statistics from the company in question an investigation was made whether their production fits this press. It came out in the investigation that the production of the company, from statistics, fits this press very good. A table was made where different timeschedules were accounted for the new press, with semi- and <b>full</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>plate</b> changing for present and to be added papers. The waterless technology is compared to conventional offset with the difference that the plate is based on a sort of laminatetechnology. Like conventional plates this plate has a base made of aluminium. Lightsensitive photopolymer isunited as a layer or coat on top of the aluminium and a 2 µm thin oleophobic siliconlayer is applied on top of the photopolymer. Considering the print, the waterless method has a higher qualitygrade than conventional offset. No water is emulsifiedin the ink, and therefore the printed dot gets a higher density. The loss of dampening solution and higher tack of the ink gives sharper dots. This makes the colourspace bigger why a greater range of colours can be printed. The loss of dampening solution gives a more stable dotgain, which contributes to that a higher screen can be used. The disadvantage is that the plate can't do as many rotations as the conventional plate. A waterless plate makes around 100 000 - 500 000 rotations before it needs to be removed owing to type- and manufacturer of the plate. The plate is also slightly more sensitive and expensive than conventional plates, around 1, 4 - 1, 7 × aluminium printing plates. A waterless system can be installed in a conventional printing press by degrees and when large editions are being printed a cooler needs to be installed in the oscillationrollers of the press, since an increase in temperature can make the oleophobic parts of the plate oleophilic. The Cortina is however equipped with a temperature controlsystem at the beginning. To avoid picking, caused by the tacky ink, a blanket with a high “quick release” should be used...|$|R

Under E gear, the car will {{automatically}} change the gear depending on speed and gradient information.

A constant throttle can also be maintained on the accelerator, and gear change can still occur, although the car will feel noticeably more jerky during gear change than in a <b>full</b> <b>automatic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Collection of tolls on open toll roads {{is usually}} {{conducted}} through either {{the use of}} transponders or <b>automatic</b> <b>plate</b> recognition, {{the vast majority of}} which utilizes an overhead gantry system above the road. While rarely used as the primary vehicle identification method, <b>automatic</b> number <b>plate</b> recognition is used on a number of different highway systems.
