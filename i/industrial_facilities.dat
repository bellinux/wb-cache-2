5|$|Early in the Second World War, Crewe Hall {{was used}} as a {{military}} training camp, repatriation camp for Dunkirk troops and a US army camp, becoming the gun operations headquarters for the north-west region in 1942. It housed a prisoner-of-war camp for German officers from 1943. The hall was leased as offices in 1946, becoming the headquarters of Calmic Limited, who eventually employed nearly 800 people at Crewe Hall. Calmic produced hygiene and medical products on the site including tablets, creams, analgesics and antibiotic aerosols; they constructed <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> adjacent to the hall including a drying and filtration plant and pharmaceutical packaging unit. After Wellcome's acquisition of Calmic in 1965, the hall served as the UK and Ireland headquarters of the Wellcome Foundation until the merger with Glaxo in 1995. Wellcome produced liquids, tablets, creams and antibiotic aerosols at the site; the hall itself was used for administration, but the stables block was rebuilt internally for use as laboratories and the <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> were expanded.|$|E
5|$|Hansell's successor, Major General Curtis LeMay, assumed {{command in}} January 1945 and {{initially}} {{continued to use}} the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The attacks initially targeted key <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes.|$|E
5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities,</b> extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence.|$|E

5|$|Portishead has a {{long history}} as a fishing port. As a Royal Manor it {{expanded}} rapidly during the early 19thcentury around the docks, with supporting transport infrastructure. A power station and chemical works were added in the 20th century, but the dock and <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> have since closed and been redeveloped into a marina and residential areas. Portishead was also the telephone control centre used by British Telecom (BT) for non-direct dialled calls to maritime vessels, a service known as Portishead Radio.|$|E
5|$|The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee {{scientists}} and studied German physics journals. It compiled lists of German scientists {{of interest and}} possible locations of nuclear research and <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities,</b> and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores. Little thorium was available in Germany or German-occupied Europe, and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Sudetenland (the German-annexed part of Czechoslovakia). Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically, and production was measured by assessing {{the size of the}} piles of tailings.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment is {{underway}} {{for some of}} the abandoned <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities,</b> with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings being the most recent example of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> in Davydovo is a Michelin tire factory.|$|R

5|$|The USAAF {{assessed}} {{that the}} firebombing campaign had been highly successful, {{and noted that}} American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint Target Group (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing strategies for the air campaign against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone would be sufficient to force the country's surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{around the}} bay features {{a mix of}} swamps, beaches, <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities,</b> tourist attractions, and historic sites. The area's developing population is ethnically diverse with a growing international community. The communities host cultural events ranging from ballet and musical theater to fairs and rodeos. The bay itself supports a commercial fishing industry and features {{one of the highest}} concentrations of marinas in the nation. On land the area holds numerous historic sites such as the San Jacinto Monument, and many parks and nature preserves such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center.|$|E
5|$|The main tower's spire {{was removed}} during the Battle of Moscow {{to prevent the}} Luftwaffe from {{using it as a}} landmark. Shortly after the war ended in 1945, {{sections}} of the gardens were annexed for the building of an apartment block. A fire in 1956 caused the collapse of the lantern over the principal tower's dome. Existing tenants were slowly rehoused, and members of the Mosspetspromproyekt (Russian: Мосспецпромпроект) research institute took possession of the former church. The research institute dealt primarily with project drawings for <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities,</b> but also designed the Olympic cauldron used at Lenin Stadium for the 1980 Summer Games.|$|E
50|$|The Richmond Underwear Company Building is a {{historic}} <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> at 65 Millet Road in Richmond, Vermont. Built in 1900, it was the town's first major <b>industrial</b> <b>facility,</b> bringing an economic boom to the town. The factory {{was used for the}} manufacture of underwear until 1946, and has seen a variety of industrial and commercial uses since then. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1945, {{cities and}} <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Japanese home islands were under {{sustained}} attack from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers {{based in the}} Mariana Islands. Attacks by Allied submarines and surface ships had also cut most of the country's trade routes, and US Navy aircraft carrier task groups had raided locations in the home islands on several occasions. Shortages of fuel had confined most of the Imperial Japanese Navy's surviving ships to port and forced them and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service to hold its air units in reserve against the Allied invasion that {{was expected to be}} launched late in the year. Prior to the war, the Japanese military had assessed that coastal artillery was no longer suited to the country's circumstances. As a result, only a few strategic ports were protected by artillery capable of engaging enemy warships, and most of these guns were of relatively small calibers.|$|E
5|$|From autumn 1943 the Japanese {{government}} took further steps {{to prepare the}} country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move to the countryside from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E

5|$|MD151 {{enters the}} city of Baltimore just west of its {{intersection}} with Rolling Mill Road and Kane Street. The state highway passes under I-95, a Norfolk Southern Railway railyard, and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. At North Point Road, MD151's name changes to Erdman Avenue and the highway veers west to pass under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The state highway veers northwest at its crossing of I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) just before the highway's cloverleaf interchange with US40 (Pulaski Highway), which also includes a ramp from southbound MD151 to southbound I-895. Connections between eastbound US40 and northbound MD151 are made via Mapleton Avenue just east of I-895. MD151 continues northwest concurrent with US40Truck as a six-lane boulevard between the Armistead Gardens neighborhood {{to the east and}} <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> on the west. The state highway passes by Archbishop Curley High School and through the Belair-Edison neighborhood before reaching its northern terminus at US1 (Belair Road), onto which US40Truck turns west. Erdman Avenue continues northwest as a two-lane street along the eastern edge of Clifton Park to MD147 (Harford Road).|$|E
5|$|MD7 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US40 (Pulaski Highway) in Rosedale {{just east of}} the Baltimore city line. The highway heads north then immediately turns east at a three-way intersection; the west leg of the intersection is Old Philadelphia Road, which is unsigned MD7BA. MD7 heads northeast as a two-lane street through a residential neighborhood with scattered businesses and industrial properties as well as a crossing of Redhouse Creek. The route intersects MD588 (Golden Ring Road) and expands to a five-lane road with center turn lane before meeting Interstate695 (I-695) (Baltimore Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. MD7 continues east past The Centre at Golden Ring shopping center, crossing Stemmers Run before its intersection with Rossville Boulevard in Rossville. The state highway reduces to two lanes and continues northeast through residential subdivisions on the westbound side and <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> on the eastbound side of the highway.|$|E
5|$|Now {{fully in}} the town of Lockport, NY31 and NY93 proceed {{northeast}} through an open area of the town as a four-lane divided highway. The two routes continue to {{the western edge of the}} city of Lockport, where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the Lockport Bypass. The overlap ends here as NY93 turns southeastward onto the two-lane bypass. Along the bypass, NY93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> and intersects with Hinman Road (CR903) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal. Past the waterway, the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of Lockport to a junction with Robinson Road (CR123) on the Lockport–Pendleton town line. The Lockport Bypass ends here, leaving NY93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road.|$|E
50|$|The largest <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> in Vermont is GlobalFoundries' {{semiconductor}} {{plant in}} Essex Junction. In 2007, the then-IBM plant {{had the largest}} assessment in the town, $104 million.|$|R
50|$|The Dennis Johnson Lumber Company Mill is a {{historic}} <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> on Maine State Route 5 in Waterboro, Maine. For nearly a century beginning in 1869, a lumber mill, powered first by water and then steam, was operated at this location. The property, much of whose equipment is still in situ following its closure in 1963, is a rare surviving 19th-century <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> in the rural community. Now owned by the local historical society (which hopes to transform it into a museum property), it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The Ward Baking Company {{building}} at 800 Pacific Street, Brooklyn, New York, built in 1911, was a historic building {{and was a}} significant example of a period <b>industrial</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|R
5|$|Serving as a {{link between}} Steubenville, Ohio and Weirton, West Virginia, the Fort Steuben Bridge opened as a toll bridge in November 1928. The bridge was the main carrier of U.S. Route 22 over the Ohio River, its traffic {{included}} trucks and heavy duty vehicles associated with the <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> in Weirton-Steubenville area and along the Ohio River. The Fort Steuben Bridge provided a more direct route for the flow of traffic which previously {{had to use the}} Market Street Bridge. As of 1940 the toll for the bridge was 5 cents (US$ with inflation) for pedestrians and 25 cents (US$ with inflation) for automobiles. The toll was removed in 1947, when ownership of the bridge was transferred to the State of Ohio. Improvements to the bridge were made in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The 19th Air Brigade's {{primary mission}} was to defend the <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> in {{northern}} Kyūshū, and particularly the iron works at Yawata. The brigade's plans {{for the defense of}} the Western District called for its interceptor aircraft to be concentrated over Yawata and not move far from the area. While this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by the 19th Air Brigade, it was deemed necessary as few aircraft were available, the only searchlight units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near Yawata and northern Kyūshū was regarded by the Army as being the most important region in the Western District. Prior to the raid on Yawata the 19th Air Brigade undertook joint planning with anti-aircraft units and implemented a training program which included practice in responding to alerts and night flying.|$|E
5|$|The bombardments also {{affected}} Japanese morale. Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks {{to be more}} terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration. Several of the <b>industrial</b> <b>facilities</b> that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity. This {{was not the case}} for all facilities that were attacked though, and the morale among workers in two of the bombarded factories was reported to have increased. The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost. However, such attitudes did not contribute to bringing the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government's decision to surrender.|$|E
50|$|Fish, coil, {{and timber}} are {{extracted}} in the town. The largest <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> in the town, a paper factory, went bankrupt in the mid-1990s; its collapse provoked a large emigration.|$|R
