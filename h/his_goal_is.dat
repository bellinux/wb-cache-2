5|$|In 2011, in Week 17 {{against the}} Minnesota Vikings, Urlacher sprained his MCL when {{teammate}} Major Wright and Vikings receiver Percy Harvin landed {{on him with}} 5:15 left in the game. Luckily for him, there was no ACL damage, according to his MRI. Urlacher was eventually named to the Pro Bowl, but didn't play due to the injury against Minnesota. Though he participated in the team's first four training camp practices, he hadn't participated in any other practices since July 31. On August 14, 2012, Urlacher had an arthroscopic debridement procedure on his left knee, and has stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> {{to play in the}} 2012 season opener. He eventually practiced on September 3, and played against the Colts in the season opener, though he sat out the second half.|$|E
5|$|In Tokyo, after Kaoru learns about Yukishiro Enishi's {{plans to}} kill {{everyone}} connected to Kenshin she teaches Yahiko the ougi of the Kamiya Kasshin. Enishi says that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> {{not to kill}} Kenshin, but to make him suffer by killing the person most important to him: Kaoru. He kidnaps her, leaving a replica of her dead body. Convinced that he again failed to save {{the one who was}} most important to him, Kenshin flees to the Fallen Village and falls into a catatonic depression. When he learns that Kaoru is alive, he and the group rescue her from Enishi. They marry and have a son, Himura Kenji.|$|E
5|$|Simon Legree is a cruel slave owner—a Northerner by birth—whose {{name has}} {{become synonymous with}} greed. He is arguably the novel's main antagonist. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to demoralize Tom and break him of his {{religious}} faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.|$|E

5|$|Don Vito {{brought the}} {{organization}} to its highest perfection without undue recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island {{in order to achieve}} <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. … His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go {{out of his way to}} redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, as if he were a king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Indy recovers {{the cross}} {{off the coast}} of Portugal and donates it to Marcus Brody's museum. Later, Indy is {{introduced}} to Walter Donovan, who informs him that Indy's father, Henry Jones Sr., has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription as his guide. Indy then receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from Venice. Realizing that he would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's Austrian colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover the tomb of a First Crusade knight, which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, this one revealing the location of the Grail. They flee, however, when the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a secret society that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, Kazim, and Indy tells him that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> only to find his father and that he has no interest in finding the Grail. Kazim tells him that Henry is being held in Castle Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. Marcus later reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the pages containing the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping and sends Marcus to İskenderun, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah, and he and Elsa head to Castle Brunwald.|$|E

25|$|The game {{follows the}} adventures of the player {{character}} Sneaky, a thief. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to escape from prison, avoid enemies and steal rubies in the process. The player is generally encouraged to avoid the guards, but various weapons can be unlocked for Sneaky's use. The iOS version of Sneaky Sneaky received generally positive feedback from critics. It was praised for its battle system. The PC version, on the other hand, received more mixed reviews.|$|E

500|$|A nonbinding {{referendum}} in 2008 resulted in 72.5 {{percent of voters}} supporting NATO accession. In May 2013, Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili stated that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to get a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for his country from NATO in 2014. In June 2014, diplomats from NATO suggested that while a MAP was unlikely, a package of [...] "reinforced cooperation" [...] agreements was a possible compromise. Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed that this could include the building of military capabilities and armed forces training.|$|E

500|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} a youth named Benjamin {{in his quest}} to save the world. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine {{the state of the}} world's four elemental powers. The gameplay takes a departure from the main series in a variety of ways. Many series staples are eliminated, such as random battles, save points, manual equipment, and the party system. The game received [...] middling reviews and sales in North America and Japan, citing its simplified gameplay and lack of depth in the game's story. Over time, the game has kept the reputation for being a [...] "beginner's Final Fantasy" [...] and has been praised for its music.|$|E
500|$|The book's early {{chapters}} {{ground the}} reader in principles involving cyberspace and the law. The author provides enough background that a layperson {{can understand the}} relevant legal history, including explaining libel {{and the extent to}} which copyrighted text may be quoted and used under the fair use principle. Godwin explains <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> [...] "to show that striking a balance in favor of individual rights has always been the right decision for us and that it remains so even when technology gives us new ways to exercise those rights. Individual liberty has never weakened us; freedom of speech, enhanced by the Net, will only make us stronger". He instructs the reader on how to become proficient in dealing with mainstream news media, writing, [...] "Learn how to hack all the media. Then put that knowledge to good use".|$|E
500|$|... is {{the first}} member to join. Originally from Kirigakure, <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the {{organization}} in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, {{who was a member}} himself. Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza's sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin's nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so. Suigetsu is voiced by Takashi Kondo in Japanese and by Grant George in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E

500|$|Spinoza, {{with his}} determinism, {{believes}} that {{man and nature}} must be unified under a consistent set of laws; God and nature are one, {{and there is no}} free will. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, intentionality, ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events. <b>His</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a naturalistic framework, and his notion of conatus is central to this project. For example, an action is [...] "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and conatus of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are determined in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free {{in the sense that it}} is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.|$|E
500|$|With {{extensive}} knowledge {{regarding the}} intricacies of the defense, Ryan has been criticized for not devoting similar time and effort into coaching the offense. Ryan refuted this, stating <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to implement a proficient running game, citing a desire to [...] "get after" [...] the opponent through running the ball. Ryan has also stated that passing the ball is important but should not be used incessantly as there should be a balance between both aspects of the offense. In 2009 and 2010, the Jets were ranked first and fourth overall in the league in rushing which coincided with their two playoff appearances. In 2011, the Jets attempted to convert to a more pass-oriented offense, which have become more widely used in the NFL, however, the team struggled with this adjustment and reverted to their former run-oriented offense {{by the middle of the}} season. His defensive strategy, in contrast, tends to be more elaborate taking into consideration his experience in the field. There are six different defensive formations utilized in football, but the two commonly used formations are the 3–4 formation, with three defensive lineman and four linebackers, and the 4–3 formation, with four defensive lineman and three linebackers. The Jets utilized the former of the two popular formations; however, Ryan tended to employ all six formations in varying forms. Furthermore, he often calls audibles [...] that have the defense line up in one formation and switch to another so as to cloak their intentions and confuse and pressure the opponent.|$|E
2500|$|Cohen {{has also}} {{examined}} {{the question of}} whether memory for certain types of relations is more heavily dependent on the activity of the hippocampus, and whether there are types of memories that do not depend on the hippocampus.

2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure that the game was balanced, the {{designers}} had to play through maps several times to ensure that they were not unbalanced. However, Shimojo commented that once he became more astute at the game, it became hard for him to judge {{what it would be like}} for a novice to play, though he comments that <b>his</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to ensure that the difficulty level is right enough to allow the largest number of people to play it. Afterward, his comments are sent off to other staff members so he can be sure that he got it right. From then on, the game is sent to Nintendo's debugging team, who will then provide insight on the balance to the development team, who makes adjustments accordingly.|$|E
