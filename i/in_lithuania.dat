5|$|After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish {{revolt against}} the Lithuanian {{authorities}} {{in one of the}} disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified its investigation of the Polish minority and sympathizers <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> and uncovered the planned coup. The Lithuanians, not knowing the membership of the PMO, arrested numerous Polish activists and destabilized the PMO network enough to prevent the coup attempt. Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> was dissolved. The coup further strained Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E
5|$|The {{genocide}} <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> {{is seen by}} {{some historians}} {{as one of the}} earliest large-scale implementations of the Final Solution, leading some scholars to express an opinion that the Holocaust began <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> in the summer of 1941. Other scholars say the Holocaust started in September 1939 with the onset of the Second World War, or even earlier, on Kristallnacht in 1938, or, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> (male average lifespan <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.|$|E

5|$|After Vytautas' {{death in}} 1430, Lithuania became embroiled in {{internal}} wars and conflicts with Poland.

5|$|Cracks in the {{cooperation}} between Poland and Lithuania {{after the death}} of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as grand duke of Lithuania, but when Švitrigaila, {{with the support of the}} Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as grand duke, leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław's death.|$|E
5|$|Deputational or Judicial (Polish: deputackie) sejmiks met on {{a yearly}} basis and elected deputies (deputaci) to tribunals (Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal) from the times of King Stefan Batory onwards (starting in 1578 in Poland, and from 1581 <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania).</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1389, Władysław's rule <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> faced a revived {{challenge}} from Vytautas, who resented the power given to Skirgaila <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> {{at the expense}} of his own patrimony. Vytautas started a civil war <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> aiming to become the Grand Duke. On 4 September 1390, the joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Grand Master, Konrad von Wallenrode, laid siege to Vilnius, which was held by Władysław's regent Skirgaila with combined Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops. Although the Knights lifted the siege of the castle after a month, they reduced much of the outer city to ruins. This bloody conflict was eventually brought to a temporary halt in 1392 with the Treaty of Ostrów, by which Władysław handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace: Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as the Grand Duke (magnus dux) until his death, under the overlordship of the Supreme Duke (dux supremus) in the person of the Polish monarch. Skirgaila was moved from the Duchy of Trakai to become prince of Kiev. Vytautas initially accepted his status but soon began to pursue Lithuania's independence from Poland.|$|E

5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{assessments}} of the Home Army's activities <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> have been controversial.

5|$|The {{uprising}} did {{not solve}} the larger border conflict between Poland and Lithuania over the ethnically mixed Suwałki Region. Both sides complained about each other's repressive measures. The conflict intensified in 1920, causing military skirmishes of the Polish–Lithuanian War. Sejny changed hands frequently until the Suwałki Agreement of October 1920, which left Sejny on the Polish side. The uprising undermined the plans of Polish leader Józef Piłsudski, who was planning a coup d'état <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> to replace the Lithuanian government with a pro-Polish cabinet, that would agree to a union with Poland (the proposed Międzymorze federation). Because the Sejny Uprising had prompted the Lithuanian intelligence to intensify its investigations of Polish activities <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> they discovered plans for the coup and prevented it, arresting Polish sympathizers. These hostilities in Sejny further strained the Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E
5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|Because the Lithuanians did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch <b>in</b> <b>Lithuania</b> ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|E
