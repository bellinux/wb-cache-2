40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess teacher {{attitude}} toward the implementation and use of <b>integrated</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> technology in rural and urban schools and to compare the perceptions which the two groups held with regard to its effective use in delivering daily instruction. A review of selected literature was made to determine the appropriate tasks and responsibilities of teachers as viewed by authorities in the field of educational technology. In the review of selected literature, an effort was made to examine certain policies and procedures required as minimum expectations by the developers of the <b>integrated</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system.</b> One hundred fifty teachers were selected from ten rural schools and ten urban schools in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and New York. One hundred percent of the teachers responded, but not to all items on the survey. In presenting the findings of this study, the data received involved certified teachers at ten urban and ten rural elementary schools. Analysis of variance was used to test the hypotheses. The probability level of. 05 was used to test each hypothesis for acceptance or rejection. This study examined the effect of implementing an <b>integrated</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> into the regular teaching curriculum on the basis of teacher experience, the model of delivery, teacher training, student grouping, and grade level in rural and urban schools. The survey produced quantitative data which support significant differences between urban and rural teacher attitudes about delivery model, student grouping, and grade level.

40|$|A {{learning}} system may need several methods that follow different learning strategies {{in order to}} learn how to perform complex tasks. For example, a learning method may be used to generalize from user demonstrations, another to learn by practice and exploration, and another to test hypotheses with experiments. In such an <b>integrated</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system,</b> {{there is a need for}} systematically coordinating the activities of the participating learning agents especially to ensure that the system creates appropriate procedural knowledge. In this paper, we describe an approach for developing a meta-level problem solver that coordinates different agents in an <b>integrated</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> based on their capabilities and status of learning. The system is called Maven. Maven is cast on a BDI-style framework with explicit representation of learning goals, a set of plans for achieving learning goals, and high-level learning strategies that prioritize learning goals. By supporting both top-down and bottom-up control strategies, Maven supports flexible interaction among learners. The status of desired learning goals and goal achievement history enables assessment of learning progress over time. Maven is being used for coordinating learning agents to acquire complex process knowledge...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to effectively extract and generalize planning knowledge based on expert demonstration. In this paper we consider a complementary approach to learning in which experiments are designed to test hypothesized planning knowledge. In particular, we describe an algorithm that automatically generates experiments to test assertions about plan-step ordering. Experimenting with plan-step ordering can identify asserted ordering constraints that are in fact not necessary, as well as uncover necessary ordering constraints previously not represented. The algorithm consists of three parts: identifying the space of step-ordering hypotheses, efficiently generating ordering tests, and planning experiments that use the tests to identify order constraints that are not currently represented. This method is implemented in the CMAX experiment design module and is part of the POIROT <b>integrated</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system.</b> We discuss the role of experimentation in planning knowledge refinement and some future directions for CMAX’s development...|$|E

In one south Georgia county, almost one-fourth of the eighth grade students scored below standards on the 2004 Middle Grades Writing Assessment (MGWA) and Criterion Referenced Competency Test (CRCT). Many of these low-achieving students met the criteria for placement into a reading class that implemented an <b>integrated</b> <b>learning</b> <b>system</b> (ILS) in conjunction with traditional teaching strategies. This study focused on the relationship between student participation in the reading class and achievement and attitudes toward reading, as well as teacher attitudes toward ILS implementation.

Data were obtained from students and teachers through pre-posttests, surveys and interviews. Results indicated that 7 of the 8 students involved increased their reading scores.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a computer-based <b>Integrated</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILS) model used with adult high school students engaging mathematics activities. This study examined achievement, attitudinal and behavior differences between students completing ILS activities in a traditional, individualized format compared to cooperative <b>learning</b> groups. <b>Integrated</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILS) are advanced computer-based instructional systems consisting of a set of computerized courseware covering several grade levels, content areas, and complex classroom management and reporting features. There are two alternative delivery strategies in ILS: individual (ID) and cooperative (CD). In ID delivery, the system provides on-demand help for immediate feedback – correctives allowing each learner to proceed at his or her own pace (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995). The CD delivery system provides for grouping students into pairs who use the same system cooperatively. In adult high schools these ILS are utilized in computer labs. Either a computer lab assistant or teachers bring their classes into the computer lab, and students work individually on computer-based instructional lessons for an allotted time period. In this implementation model, students do not work cooperatively and are discouraged from sharing information and assisting peers. However, using ILS in this manner has fit the traditional design and pedagogical theory of teaching adult learners. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the effects of cooperative delivery and individual delivery of ILS instruction on mathematics achievement, attitude and behaviors in adult (16 - 21 yrs.) high school students (grades 9 - 12) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} area {{of learning in}} autonomous agents {{is the ability to}} learn domain-specific models of actions to be used by planning systems. In this paper, we present methods by which an agent learns action models from its own experience and from its observation of a domain expert. These methods differ from previous work in the area in two ways: the use of an action model formalism which is better suited to the needs of a reactive agent, and successful implementation of noise-handling mechanisms. Training instances are generated from experience and observation, and a variant of GOLEM is used to learn action models from these instances.
