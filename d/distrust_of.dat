5|$|Despite the unopposed {{re-election}} of Tung in July 2002, <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> China remained throughout Tung's {{first term}} as Chief Executive. In 2003, Hong Kong was gravely {{affected by the}} outbreak of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS). The World Health Organization reported 1,755 infected and 299 deaths in Hong Kong. Economic activities slowed down and schools were closed for weeks at the height of SARS epidemic. An estimated 380 million Hong Kong dollars (US$48.9 million) in contracts were lost {{as a result of the}} epidemic.|$|E
5|$|George's <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> the Tories aided {{the passing}} of power to the Whigs. Whig {{dominance}} would grow to be so great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E

5|$|He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November {{in hopes}} of obtaining {{financial}} aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, primarily because of Saudi <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies {{as part of a}} broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance.|$|E
5|$|Lucas is {{an admirer}} of English poet and painter William Blake; Elizabeta reveals that Lucas' admiration of Blake is based on their common <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> systems.

Though no longer married to Elizabeta, he maintains strong feelings towards her throughout {{the first half of}} series seven.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} investigations levelled accusations at Silverio Nungo (who {{was later}} executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado. The latter {{had made no}} secret of his <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> Mondlane, seeing him as too conservative a leader, and the Tanzanian police also accused him of working with PIDE (Portugal's secret police) to assassinate Mondlane. Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.|$|E

5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having all of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> the crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E
5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|Lewis MacKenzie, in 1992, {{served in}} the Sarajevo {{division}} of United Nations Protection Force which was mandated {{to keep the peace}} in Croatia. Off describes MacKenzie as being indifferent as hostilities began in Sarajevo because his mandate did not include intervention in Bosnian affairs. MacKenzie's <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> all participants in the hostilities grew following a botched prisoner exchange, the Breadline Massacre, and broken ceasefire arrangements. MacKenzie helped negotiate UN control of the Sarajevo International Airport which allowed humanitarian shipments. MacKenzie gave many media interviews but Off criticizes him for portraying both the Serbs and the Bosnians as aggressors and recommending against intervention.|$|E

U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{at the same time}} Cheney was Secretary of Defense, and then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an in-depth interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post-9/11 detainees because of their mutual <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> CIA.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} of the South caused the Southern economy to collapse during the war. Shortages {{of food and}} supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, and foraging by Union and Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending blockade running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|The opening story arc of Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which premiered in September 2011, is set {{prior to}} Ultimate Fallout #4, and details how Miles {{received}} his superhuman abilities. After Oscorp scientist Dr. Conrad Markus uses Parker's blood {{to recreate the}} formula that created Spider-Man, the Prowler (Aaron Davis) steals the formula, and in the process, one of the spiders created by Markus crawls into the Prowler's duffel bag. Days later, the Prowler's nephew, grade-schooler Miles Morales, is bitten by the spider {{during a visit to}} Aaron's apartment. Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter Parker has, but does not tell his parents, Jefferson and Rio, due to his father's <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> superheroes, confiding only in his best friend, Ganke Lee.|$|E
5|$|This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who {{had worked in the}} Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. It was but {{the first of a series}} of spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> British security arrangements. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.|$|E
5|$|Adams wrote {{numerous}} {{letters and}} essays {{in opposition to}} the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the military occupation, an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, never to return.|$|E

However both the Liberals and Conservatives were wiped out of the legislature in the 1921 general election by the United Farmers of Alberta.

5|$|Although the reaction, which {{included}} punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer Vietnamese serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, {{military and civilian}} authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening {{in the wake of}} the mutiny. A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. This demonstrated French <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E
5|$|<b>Distrust</b> <b>of</b> Charles's {{religious}} policies {{increased with}} {{his support of}} a controversial anti-Calvinist ecclesiastic, Richard Montagu, who was in disrepute among the Puritans. In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as Arminians – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines {{had been one of}} the few sources of support for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled Appello Caesarem, in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E
40|$|Considering that {{distrust}} is a core {{element of}} human interaction, {{it has received}} surprisingly little scientific attention. This research contributes to filling this gap by investigating distrust’s influence on creativity. Intuitively {{as well as in}} light <b>of</b> prior research, <b>distrust</b> and creativity appear incompatible. The social consequences <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> include reluctance to share information, a quality detrimental to creativity in social settings. At the same time, the cognitive concomitants <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> bear resemblance to creative cognition: Distrust seems to foster thinking about non-obvious alternatives to potentially deceptive appearances. This tendency resembles cognitive flexibility, which is conducive to creativity. These cognitive underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> hold the provocative implication that distrust may foster creativity. Mirroring these contradictory findings, I suggest that the social vs. cognitive consequences <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> have diverging implications for creativity. I address this question in Study 1 by introducing private/public as a moderating variable for effects <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> on creativity. Consistent with distrust’s social consequences, subliminal distrust (vs. trust) priming had detrimental effects on creative generation presumed to be public. Consistent with distrust’s cognitive consequences, though, the opposite emerged in private. Study 2 replicated a beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> on private creative generation with a different priming method. Studies 3 and 4 showed increased category inclusiveness vs. increased remote semantic spread after distrust priming. The latter findings are consistent with enhanced cognitive flexibility as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>distrust.</b> Taken together, these results provide evidence for the creativity-enhancing potential <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> and suggest cognitive flexibility as the process in question...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> and paranoia among parents and carers of autistic {{children in their}} interactions with public officials charged with such children’s diagnosis, education and care. The suspicion and <b>distrust</b> framework <b>of</b> Fein and Hilton (1994), and Kramer’s typology of organisational paranoia (1998, 2001) are used to show how distrust impacts on client experiences. Antecedents <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> are identified, and the ‘normalcy’ of paranoia {{in this context is}} demonstrated. These findings should permit public sector staff dealing with parents and carers of autistic children to address such perceptions and build trust where little seems to exist...|$|R
