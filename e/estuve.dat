50|$|Zorrilla {{was born}} in Montevideo, in 1919, one of five daughters of the {{sculptor}} José Luis Zorrilla de San Martín and Guma Muñoz del Campo. She always drew and painted, as well as exhibited her watercolors, drawings and pastels at the Amigos del Arte as a teenager. Zorrilla's long career in Montevideo was supplemented by time spent in Buenos Aires, especially providing services for theatrical and cinematographic works of her sister, the actress and director China Zorrilla. Her work appeared at the Comedia Nacional and in the Solís Theatre. She is remembered for creating works in the productions for Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, Thornton Wilder's Our Town, Alfred de Musset's Lorenzaccio, Medea of Euripides, The honour is not thing of women, (with Norma Aleandro). She worked with various directors and actors of Uruguay and Argentina, including Omar Grasso, Antonio Larreta, Estela Medina, Dahd Sfeir, Carlos Perciavalle and others. She had a visible ease with suits, integrating them in a scene's visual frame. She took special delight in Belle Époque costumes of the 19th century. Some examples include Ávila-Martínez Mieres in The parisienne and nuptial Mulch. She also had opportunity to provide her services at the City Theatre of Montevideo in The Seagull, La pulga en la oreja, Un enredo y un marqués and La Dorotea. Zorrilla was the changing rooms manager for the films Besos en la frente (1996) and Nunca <b>estuve</b> en Viena (1986).|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers {{issues of}} gender and representation through an analysis of twentieth-century female revolutionary figures from Ireland, Spain, Cuba, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. These transgressive and highly symbolic women raise important questions about the intersection of history and literature and about the place of gender {{in the construction of}} national histories. Since revolutions occasion social transformation under often chaotic conditions, they create space for the potential transformation of gender relations. The study takes as its point of departure the personal narrative, which engages the problematic nature of representation with its tensions between fact and fiction, historical and literary artifact, the embodiment and displacement of the self. These women 2 ̆ 7 s lifewritings illustrate gender relations in flux, expose the political symbolism of the strong woman at moments of nation formation and transformation, and display the multiple ways that gender enters into literary, historical, and visual narratives. ^ Chapter One examines three female revolutionary figures from the period of Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s War of Independence and Civil War, Maud Gonne, Constance Markievicz, and Kathleen Clarke, whose personal narratives demonstrate an awareness of the processes of self-construction and a great degree of visual and discursive performativity. Chapter Two explores the lifewriting of Dolores Ibárruri, “La Pasionaria,” arguably the most important figure (male or female) from the Spanish Civil War. Her autobiography functions as a double narrative of self and national history, drawing on epic and tragic plots. Chapter Three analyzes the figure of Haydée Santamaría, “heroine of the Cuban Revolution” and long-time president of the Cuban cultural powerhouse Casa de las Américas. Her lifewriting reveals how the construction of revolutionary history is mediated by individual memory. Chapter Four centers on one of the major women participants in the Sandinista National Liberation Front during its revolutionary and post-revolutionary periods—Doris Tijerino, whose testimonial narratives raise questions about generic hybridity and national conflict. Chapter Five examines two women 2 ̆ 7 s prison memoirs from the Salvadoran Civil War—Ana Guadalupe Martinez 2 ̆ 7 s Las cárceles clandestinas de El Salvador and Nidia Díaz 2 ̆ 7 s Nunca <b>estuve</b> sola, in which the cell is both a trench of resistance and a stage for writing the female revolutionary self. ...|$|E
