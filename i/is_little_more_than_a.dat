5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E

The {{tomb of the}} first king of the dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due {{to the death of}} the king and <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.|$|E
5|$|Since then, thermal {{anomalies}} (hot spots) and {{gas emissions}} (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred {{especially on the}} summit plateau and indicate that Adams is dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams {{tend to have a}} low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens {{and some of the other}} Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and {{protected by the}} parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E

5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens {{to be at the}} strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance.

His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.|$|E
25|$|The Principle of {{computational}} equivalence {{has been}} criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions. It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property. Moreover, critics such as Ray Kurzweil have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent. Others suggest it <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> rechristening of the Church–Turing thesis.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route241 (NY241) is a north–south {{state highway}} in Cattaraugus County, New York, in the United States. The {{southern}} terminus {{of the route}} is at an intersection with NY394 in the hamlet of Randolph and its northern terminus is at a junction with U.S. Route62 (US62) {{in the town of}} Conewango. Today, NY241 <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> connector between the two highways; however, when it was first assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it extended north to then-NY18 in Dayton. The portion of NY241 north of Conewango was incorporated into an extension of US62 , and NY241 was truncated in the late 1940s to eliminate the overlap with US62.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Law 7.663 {{was enacted}} {{calling for the}} {{creation}} of the Alto-Tietê Basin Committee. However this committee was only formally established in November 1994, a result of a deliberate effort by the state técnicos (technical staff) to mobilize the municipal government and, especially, civil society. Its functions include setting guidelines and approving river basin plans; proposing pricing criteria and values for bulk water pricing and a program for allocating proceeds derived from such water charges; integrating the decision-making and programs of water-related institutions working in the basin; and other responsibilities. The 48 seats of the committee's assembly are divided equally among representatives of three sectors: municipal government, state government agencies (including public water users), and organized civil society groups (including those representing private water users). Local issues are decided in the five sub-committees created after 1997. Although the Alto-Tietê Committee created its basin agency in 2001, it <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> symbolic organization, while the state water management agency remains the committee’s executive arm in charge of technical and administrative support.|$|E
