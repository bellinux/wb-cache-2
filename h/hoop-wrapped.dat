40|$|Pit defects due to {{corrosion}} {{may occur}} in the inner surfaces of metal liners of fiber wrapped composite cylinders during working process, which may affect their anti-fatigue performance. Finite element method was {{used to analyze the}} stress of <b>hoop-wrapped</b> composite cylinders with pit defects of different sizes based on element birth and death method to take the pre-stress resulted from autofrettage process into consideration. Numeral results show that stress concentration appears in the pit defects, but the portion of the liner far away from pit defects keeps the same stress level with the defect-free composite cylinder. Pit defects on liner reduce the fatigue performance of the composite cylinder. Goodman equation was utilized to calculate the equivalent alternating stress amplitude to evaluate the variation of the fatigue performance with the dimensional change of the pit defects in the inner surfaces of metal liners of <b>hoop-wrapped</b> composite cylinders...|$|E

40|$|This {{program was}} {{established}} to develop and commercialize new high-strength steel-lined, composite <b>hoop-wrapped</b> compressed natural gas (CNG) cylinders for vehicular applications. As much as 70 % {{of the cost of}} natural gas vehicles can be related to on-board natural gas storage costs. The cost and weight targets for this program represent significant savings in each characteristic when compared to comparable containers available at the initiation of the program. The program objectives were to optimize specific weight and cost goals, yielding CNG cylinders with dimensions that should, allowing for minor modifications, satisfy several vehicle market segments. The optimization process encompassed material, design, and process improvement. In optimizing the CNG cylinder design, due consideration was given to safety aspects relative to national, international, and vehicle manufacturer cylinder standards and requirements. The report details the design and development effort, encompassing plant modifications, material selection, design issues, tooling development, prototype development, and prototype testing. Extenuating circumstances prevented the immediate commercialization of the cylinder designs, though significant progress was made towards improving the cost and performance of CNG cylinders. A new low-cost fiber was successfully employed while the weight target was met and the cost target was missed by less than seven percent...|$|E
