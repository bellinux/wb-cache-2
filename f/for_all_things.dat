Often accompanying the Duke inspecting {{the troops in}} the royal parks, {{it was not long}} before the boy had set his heart on becoming a soldier himself. On 14 September 1667 (O.S.), he obtained a commission as Ensign in the King's Own Company in the 1st Guards, later to become the Grenadier Guards.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III, {{who had a}} great admiration <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> Roman, {{visited the}} Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close {{interest}} in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisné to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855–58, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed {{at one end and}} the conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Romanticism {{initiated}} a surge of enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> Greek, including Greek mythology. In Britain, new translations of Greek tragedies and Homer inspired contemporary poets (such as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Keats, Byron and Shelley) and painters (such as Lord Leighton and Lawrence Alma-Tadema). Christoph Gluck, Richard Strauss, Jacques Offenbach and many others set Greek mythological themes to music. American authors of the 19th century, such as Thomas Bulfinch and Nathaniel Hawthorne, held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature. In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by dramatists Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, and Jean Giraudoux in France, Eugene O'Neill in America, and T. S. Eliot in Britain and by novelists such as James Joyce and André Gide.|$|E

25|$|The taste <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> Greek in {{furniture}} and interior design, sometimes called Neo-Grec, {{was at its}} peak {{by the beginning of}} the 19th century, when the designs of Thomas Hope had influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical, Empire, Russian Empire, and Regency architecture in Britain. Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries, lasting until the Civil War in America (1860s) and even later in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} in the ancient sources does not make clear how {{the relation between the}} two principles should be understood. They do, however, consistently accord the One a higher status than the Indefinite Dyad and consider only the One as absolutely transcendent. This implies a monistic interpretation of the two principles and fits with assertions in the dialogues that suggest a monistic philosophy. Plato's Meno says that everything in nature is related, and the Republic states that there is an origin (archḗ) <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> which can be grasped by reason.|$|E
25|$|Since nature {{works for}} a {{determinate}} end {{under the direction of}} a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause.

25|$|Portuguese portolan chart were {{in great}} demand in Europe, for their greater {{knowledge}} and accuracy. Although protected {{as a state}} secret, the cartographic knowledge would eventually be passed clandestinely by some {{of those involved in}} the operation.

25|$|Francis of Assisi {{was born}} in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several {{children}} of Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and his wife Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except {{that she was a}} noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on business when Francis {{was born in}} Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco ("the Frenchman"), possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> French.

25|$|Some {{writers have}} {{questioned}} whether the Roman pyramids were modelled on the much less steeply pointed Egyptian pyramids exemplified by the famous pyramids of Giza. However, the relatively shallow Giza-type pyramids were not exclusively used by the Egyptians; steeper pyramids of the Nubian type were favoured by the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt that {{had been brought to}} an end in the Roman conquest of 30 BC. The pyramid was, in any case, built during a period when Rome was going through a fad <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> Egyptian. The Circus Maximus was adorned by Augustus with an Egyptian obelisk, and pyramids were built elsewhere in the Roman Empire around this time; the Falicon pyramid near Nice in France was suspected by some to have been constructed by Roman legionaries who followed an Egyptian cult, but more recent research has indicated that it was actually built between 1803 and 1812.|$|E

25|$|Catherine {{was also}} {{responsible}} for introducing the lasting affection <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> French to the Russian court. While she personally disliked France, her distaste did not extend to its culture and manners. French became {{the language of the}} court; Russian was relegated for use only when speaking to servants and inferiors. The Russian aristocracy was encouraged to embrace the philosophies of Molière, Racine and Corneille. The Winter Palace was to {{serve as a model for}} numerous Russian palaces belonging to Catherine's aristocracy, all of them, like the Winter Palace itself, built by the slave labour of Russian serfs. The sophistication and manners observed inside the Winter Palace were greatly at odds with the grim reality of life outside its externally gilded walls. In 1767, as the Winter Palace grew in richness and splendour, the Empress published an edict extending Russian serfdom. During her reign she further enslaved over a million peasants. Work continued on the Winter Palace right up until the time of the Empress' death in 1796.|$|E
25|$|St Kilda has {{a vibrant}} local music scene that has {{produced}} many Australian live music acts. One of the more famous of these is legendary rock band Hunters & Collectors and its front-man Mark Seymour. Members of The Birthday Party lived here in the late 1970s, when they were known under their previous name of The Boys Next Door. Paul Kelly, Tex Perkins, Fred Negro, Rowland S. Howard {{and dozens of other}} independent musicians have also called St Kilda home at some point. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> related to the seedier and funnier sides of St Kilda music scene see Fred Negro's 'Pub Strip'. Prominent local music venues include the Palais Theatre for larger concerts, the Esplanade Hotel, the Prince of Wales Hotel for larger gigs and DJ's (and backpackers), The George Public Bar on Saturday afternoons, the St Kilda Bowls Club, and The Greyhound – which picked up the local crowd, local bands, local bar staff and sticky carpet when The Esplanade Hotel (The Espy) kicked them out after 'suburbification' in the early noughties. The Greyhound has been undergoing a multimillion-dollar redevelopment since 2008 which has seen live music make way for a predominantly Gay & Lesbian clientele, building upon the successful Saturday night drag shows that have been running at the venue for over 15 years. Men At Work started in St Kilda as an unnamed group.|$|E
