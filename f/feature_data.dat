50|$|A spatial {{database}} is {{a database}} that is optimized for storing and query data that represents objects defined in a geometric space. Most spatial databases allow representing simple geometric {{objects such as}} points, lines and polygons. Some spatial databases handle more complex structures such as 3D objects, topological coverages, linear networks, and TINs. While typical databases have developed to manage various numeric and character types of data, such databases require additional functionality to process spatial data types efficiently, and developers have often added geometry or <b>feature</b> <b>data</b> types. The Open Geospatial Consortium developed the Simple Features specification (first released in 1997)and sets standards for adding spatial functionality to database systems. The SQL/MM Spatial ISO/EIC standard is a part the SQL/MM multimedia standard and extends the Simple Features standard with data types that support circular interpolations.|$|E
