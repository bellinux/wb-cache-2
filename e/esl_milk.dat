Since 2007, {{it is no}} longer a legal requirement in European countries (for example in Germany) to declare <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> as ultra-heated; consequently, it is now often labeled as [...] "fresh milk" [...] and just advertised as having an [...] "extended shelf life", making it increasingly difficult to distinguish <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> from traditionally pasteurized fresh milk.|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophage lytic enzymes have {{recently}} attracted considerable interest as novel antimicrobials against Gram-positive bacteria. In this work, antimicrobial activity in milk of HydH 5 [a virion-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase (VAPGH) encoded by the Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA 88], and three different fusion proteins created between HydH 5 and lysostaphin has been assessed. The lytic {{activity of the}} five proteins (HydH 5, HydH 5 Lyso, HydH 5 SH 3 b, CHAPSH 3 b and lysostaphin) was confirmed using commercial whole extended shelf-life <b>milk</b> (<b>ESL)</b> in challenge assays with 10 (4) CFU/mL of the strain S. aureus Sa 9. HydH 5, HydH 5 Lyso and HydH 5 SH 3 b (3. 5 µM) kept the staphylococcal viable counts below the control cultures for 6 h at 37 °C. The effect is apparent just 15 minutes after {{the addition of the}} lytic enzyme. Of note, lysostaphin and CHAPSH 3 b showed the highest staphylolytic protection as they were able to eradicate the initial staphylococcal challenge immediately or 15 min after addition, respectively, at lower concentration (1 µM) at 37 °C. CHAPSH 3 b showed the same antistaphyloccal effect at room temperature (1. 65 µM). No re-growth was observed {{for the remainder of the}} experiment (up to 6 h). CHAPSH 3 b activity (1. 65 µM) was also assayed in raw (whole and skim) and pasteurized (whole and skim) milk. Pasteurization of milk clearly enhanced CHAPSH 3 b staphylolytic activity in both whole and skim milk at both temperatures. This effect was most dramatic at room temperature as this protein was able to reduce S. aureus viable counts to undetectable levels immediately after addition with no re-growth detected for the duration of the experiment (360 min). Furthermore, CHAPSH 3 b protein is known to be heat tolerant and retained some lytic activity after pasteurization treatment and after storage at 4 °C for 3 days. These results might facilitate the use of the peptidoglycan hydrolase HydH 5 and its derivative fusions, particularly CHAPSH 3 b, as biocontrol agents for controlling undesirable bacteria in dairy products...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for post-contamination of extended shelf life (<b>ESL)</b> <b>milk</b> could be attachment and formation of biofilms on stainless steel pipe surfaces. In South Africa, <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> processors are still facing challenges extending the shelf life beyond 14 days. It is hypothesized that post-contamination along the milk processing line is responsible of reducing the shelf life of <b>ESL</b> <b>milk.</b> This assumption was investigated by assessing the microorganisms associated with the nozzles of aseptic filling machines post CIP process and {{this study was designed}} and divided into two phases. Phase one involved isolation and characterisation of the bacteria associated with the nozzles of aseptic filling machines after CIP process with the aim of determining the diversity of microorganisms attached to the nozzles of aseptic filling machines. Swab samples were collected from a plant processing <b>ESL</b> <b>milk.</b> Twenty swabs were taken from ten different nozzles of aseptic filling machines during 4 visits (n= 80). The swab samples were plated on the day of sampling. A total bacterial count ranging from 1. 75 - 1. 95 log CFU/cm 3 with an average of 1. 81 log CFU/cm 3 (n= 80). MALDI-TOF revealed a high percentage of Gram-positive rods (69 %), followed by Gram-positive cocci (20 %) and then Gram-negative rods (7 %). The Gram-positive rods belonging to genus Bacillus were identified as Bacillus cereus, followed by B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spp. The Gram-positive cocci included S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Anaerococcus spp. The Gram-negative rods were identified as Acinetobacter junii. The prevalence of Bacillus spp. noted in the nozzles of ESL aseptic filling machines is attributed to their ability to resist heat treatment during CIP process and their ability to attach to stainless steel surfaces. There was a degree of similarity in terms of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for the strains of B. cereus, Staphylococcus spp. and Paenibacillus spp. originating from the nozzles of aseptic filling machines and the packaged <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> product. Furthermore, these isolates show close relatedness. These bacteria are likely to originate from the nozzles, dispensed into the final <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> during filling process. Phase two aimed at determining cell surface hydrophobicity of the isolates originating from the nozzles of aseptic filling machines. Co-currently the study further determined the ability of B. cereus, S. epidermidis, M. luteus and Paenibacillus spp. to attach and form biofilms on stainless surfaces. The bacterial strains were isolated from the nozzles of aseptic filling machines. The degree of hydrophobicity of the spore formers ranged from 8 - 91 % while non-spore formers ranged from 6 - 67 %. Hydrophobicity of S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Acinetobacter junii and Arthrobacter castelli differed significantly (p? 0. 05). Hydrophobicity of B. pumilus, Paenibacillus spp. and B. cereus (p? 0. 05) differed significantly. Spore formers showed the highest hydrophobicity to solvents, this can be contributed to their hydrophobic nature and their ability to attach to stainless surfaces. A continuous flow reactor system was used to grow biofilm of the isolates in skim milk. The skim milk was inoculated with spore suspension of B. cereus, Paenibacillus spp. and bacterial suspension of M. luteus and S. epidermidis. The bacterial suspensions were run separately over a period of 20 h at 37 °C. Stainless steel strips were submitted to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after 22 h. The results suggested that spores of B. cereus and Paenibacillus spp. can only attach whilst M. luteus and S. epidermidis can attach and form biofilms on stainless steel. The ability of these isolates to form biofilms on stainless steel strips could be the main cause of contamination of <b>ESL</b> <b>milk.</b> Strains of Bacillus spp. can form biofilm on stainless steel and limit the shelf life of milk and milk products. However, toxins produced by some of these strains of B. cereus might be contagious to humans. The results confirmed {{that one of the reasons}} of contamination of <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> could be the ability of B. cereus to attach to stainless surfaces and M. luteus to form biofilms. Over and above the fact that the spores of B. cereus can lead to spoilage of milk and milk products, a concern is that the toxins produced by some of the strains of B. cereus are detrimental to human health.

40|$|The {{shelf life}} of ESL milks and pasteurized creams {{is limited by}} {{bacterial}} spoilage. The current state of knowledge {{with respect to the}} diversity and activities of the spoilage microflora in these products is still limited. To date, studies on this subject are yet to be carried out in Finland. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the spoilage microorganisms found in ESL milks and pasteurised creams mainly produced in Finland. 10 ESL milks and 8 pasteurised cream packages were obtained from the Finnish retail market and were stored at 8 ?C, 15 ?C, room temperature and 30 ?C, respectively, until expiration. Total bacterial counts were evaluated and 31 bacterial isolates were selected. An attempt was made to characterize the bacterial isolates using rpoB and 16 S rRNA partial gene sequence analyses. Psychrotrophic, spore-forming and spoilage features were also determined. Strain diversity was determined by rep-PCR profiling. Five selected isolates were subjected to metabolic profiling using the API 50 CHB test. When growth was detected, total bacterial counts ranged from 2. 67 to 3. 74 and 2. 54 to 8. 98 log units in cream and <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> samples, respectively. Both ESL milks and cream samples were dominated by heat-resistant, spore-forming species of the Bacillus genera: the isolates were related to B. licheniformis. B. weihenstephanensis, B. safensis, B. kochii, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and B. anthracis. Intraspecies and intrasample strain diversity was very high. Isolates mainly displayed proteolytic and lipolytic activity. Psychrotrophic activity was high in the cream samples while most <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> isolates were mostly mesophilic. Tested isolates were non-lactose fermenters and had varying metabolic profiles. The study revealed that Finnish ESL milks and pasteurized creams are prone to spoilage by species of the Bacillus genera that have potential for lipolytic and proteolytic spoilage and some of which are considered toxigenic. There is wide intraspecies strain diversity responsible for the wide variability in metabolic, psychrotrophic and spoilage features. Phenotypic tests based on API 50 CHB cannot be relied upon to make conclusions on taxonomy. Combining various methods is important for the comprehensive characterization of the bacterial isolates. Strategies to eliminate bacterial species of the Bacillus genera are important to prolong shelf life. However, intervention should be strain-specific to be effective. Large scale studies are required to confirm findings from this study...|$|E
40|$|Extended {{shelf-life}} (ESL) or ultra-pasteurized milk {{is produced}} by thermal processing using conditions between those used for traditional high-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurization and those used for ultra-high-temperature (UHT) sterilization. It should have a refrigerated shelf-life of more than 30 days. To achieve this, the thermal processing has to be quite intense. The challenge is to produce a product that has high bacteriological quality and safety but also very good organoleptic characteristics. Hence the two major aims in producing <b>ESL</b> <b>milk</b> are to inactivate all vegetative bacteria and spores of psychrotrophic bacteria, and to cause minimal chemical change that can result in cooked flavor development. The first aim is focused on inactivation of spores of psychrotrophic bacteria, especially Bacillus cereus because some strains of this organism are pathogenic, some can grow at ≤ 7 °C and cause spoilage of milk, and the spores of some strains are very heat-resistant. The second aim is minimizing denaturation of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) as the extent of denaturation is strongly correlated with the production of volatile sulfur compounds that cause cooked flavor. It is proposed that the heating should have a bactericidal effect, B* (inactivation of thermophilic spores), of > 0. 3 and cause ≤ 50 % denaturation of β-Lg. This can be best achieved by heating at high temperature for a short holding time using direct heating, and aseptically packaging the product...|$|E
40|$|The initial aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} processing conditions for extended shelf life (<b>ESL)</b> <b>milk</b> to have a shelf life at refrigeration temperature of 60 d. Milk was processed on a pilot-scale ultra-high-temperature processing plant and evaluated for microbial and sensory quality over 60 d at 7 °C storage. Results of {{this study showed that}} lower process temperatures were preferable to minimize cooked flavors and that the minimum safe processing temperature was 134 °C for 4 s as determined by the destruction of bacterial spores in the processed milk. Consumer preference panel results indicated that consumers preferred milk processed at 134 °C for 4 s (those recommended in this study for ESL processing) to commercial UHT milk although there was a slight preference for pasteurized milk. The critical sensory characteristic of the processed milk was a cooked flavor, which decreased with lower processing temperature and shorter storage time; however, a significant increase in flavors that could be associated with lipolytic activity was also noted. This study highlighted deficiencies in existing methods for determining heat-stable bacterial products in thermal-processed foods. No rapid, sensitive assay for detection of heat-stable spores or lipases in milk exists. If such assays were available, it would allow processors to determine Lipase activity and bacterial spore counts before processing and direct raw milk with low spore counts and low lipolytic activity into long-shelf-life products. To this end, assays to rapidly quantitate spores and lipolytic activity in milk were developed. The lipase assay relies on the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl caprylate liberating a yellow color that is detected using reflectance colorimetry. The assay is sensitive to 5 mUnits/ml and is linearly correlated to spectrophotometry (r 2 = 0. 93) and release of titratable free fatty acids (r 2 = 0. 92 to 0. 97). An immunocapture, enzyme-linked immunoassay coupled with a fluorescent detection system was developed for and resulted in a prototype spore assay using Bacillus stearothermophilus spores. This organism was selected because it is extremely heat resistant, is commonly found in milk, and is associated with spoilage of milk and milk products. The assay was able to quantitate spores down to 103 cfu/ml in milk and other products in about 1. 5 h. Other detection limits could be set if needed...|$|E
