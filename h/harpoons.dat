The United States government indicated its approval of the order with notification to the United States Congress of the potential sale.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the <b>harpoon</b> heads excavated from the Moyoro Shell Mound, a famous archaeological {{site of the}} Okhotsk culture in Abashiri City, Hokkaido Prefecture. The site {{is located on the}} left bank of the Abashiri River, which flows into the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1). Archaeological finds from the Moyoro Shell Mound, which were excavated from the Pit-dwelling No. 10 in 1948 (Komai ed. 1964), are preserved by the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Letters, the University of Tokyo. In this paper, <b>harpoon</b> heads made of bone and antlers in this collection will be described and discussed. In addition, some <b>harpoon</b> heads {{in the collection of the}} Hakodate City Museum will also be discussed; these specimens were unearthed from the Moyoro Shell Mound in 1941 and 1942. From the Pit-dwelling No. 10, 23 <b>harpoon</b> heads were excavated (Fig. 2 - 5, PL. 1 - 4). They are classified by the way they are hafted and connected to the line. While only one male <b>harpoon</b> head was found from the floor of the dwelling, 22 female <b>harpoon</b> heads were unearthed from the floor and upper layers, including five unfinished specimens. The female-toggle <b>harpoon</b> heads are subdivided into four types. Type I is an open socket <b>harpoon</b> head, with a line groove also used for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type II is an open socket <b>harpoon</b> head with two line holes to hold the <b>harpoon</b> head and a groove for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft. Type III is a closed socket <b>harpoon</b> head with a thin body. Type IV is an open socket <b>harpoon</b> head with two line holes, which belongs to the Ainu period. The number of <b>harpoon</b> heads of each type found from each layer is shown in Table 2. Type I <b>harpoon</b> heads constitute a large proportion of the unearthed <b>harpoon</b> heads, while only one specimen for each of Type II, Type III, and Type IV was found from the topsoil. Some of the Type I <b>harpoon</b> heads show the traces of reprocessing (Fig. 6). The reduction process of this type of <b>harpoon</b> heads was reconstructed based on these materials (Fig. 7). The Type II <b>harpoon</b> heads in eastern Hokkaido, distributed from Tokoro to Nemuro, are typologically different from the Type II <b>harpoon</b> heads in Southern Kuriles (Fig. 8). Some of the Type III <b>harpoon</b> heads are made of the ribs of sea mammals; this technique is characteristic of this site (Fig. 9) ...|$|R
25|$|When {{whales are}} spotted the whale {{catchers}} will engage in pursuit. A <b>harpoon</b> cannon with a grenade tipped <b>harpoon</b> is {{fired at the}} target whale. A rope is trailed from the <b>harpoon</b> {{in order to prevent}} the whale from being lost. If the whale is struck and not killed instantly by the explosive tipped <b>harpoon,</b> a second <b>harpoon</b> may be used or the whale may be shot with a rifle until dead. A past method of using a second <b>harpoon</b> to electrocute whales is now forbidden by the IWC. Environmental groups have reported whales being dragged backward and drowned.|$|R
5|$|Quint, Brody, and Hooper {{set out on}} Quint's boat, the Orca, to {{hunt the}} shark. While Brody lays down a chum line, Quint waits for an {{opportunity}} to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint examines the shark and <b>harpoons</b> a barrel into it, but it drags the barrel underwater and disappears.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, humpback, minkes, {{sperm and}} many other smaller Odontoceti, {{including}} critically endangered species such as North Pacific right, western gray and northern fin, have been targets of illegal captures. The hunts use <b>harpoons</b> for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets, reporting them as cases of entanglement. Humpback meat {{can be found in}} markets. In one case, humpbacks of unknown quantities were illegally hunted in the Exclusive Economic Zones of anti-whaling nations such as off Mexico and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|A {{council is}} held in the church. The Horseman {{seemingly}} kills Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, and heads off to the church to get Baltus. Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter the church due to it being holy ground. A fight breaks out between the village elders in the church resulting {{in the deaths of}} Reverend Steenwyck and Doctor Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman <b>harpoons</b> Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. The next day, Crane believes Katrina {{to be the one who}} controls the Headless Horsemen.|$|E

5|$|At nightfall, as {{the three}} swap stories, the great white returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull and killing the power. The men work through the night, {{repairing}} the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint <b>harpoons</b> another barrel into the shark. The line {{is tied to the}} stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backwards, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment before breaking the cleats off. He then heads toward shore, intending to lure the shark to shallower waters and suffocate it, but the overtaxed engine fails.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with <b>harpoons</b> specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like <b>harpoons</b> and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E
50|$|The {{toggling}} <b>harpoon</b> is {{an ancient}} weapon and tool used in whaling to impale a whale when thrown. Unlike earlier <b>harpoon</b> versions which had only one point, a toggling <b>harpoon</b> has a two-part point. One half of the point is firmly attached to the thrusting base, while {{the other half of}} the point is fitted over this first point like a cap and attached to the rest of the point with sinew or another string-like material. When the <b>harpoon</b> is thrust into an animal, the top half of the point detaches and twists horizontally into the animal under the skin, making it virtually impossible to pull the rest of the attached <b>harpoon</b> out of the animal while pulling it back to ship or shore. This <b>harpoon</b> technology lodges the toggling head of the <b>harpoon</b> underneath both the animal's skin and blubber, and instead lodges the point in the muscle, which also prevents the <b>harpoon</b> slipping out.|$|R

The gun fired a blank cartridge to propel the <b>harpoon.</b> A special barrel and stock were fitted to accommodate the <b>harpoon</b> and to lower weight. A Greener <b>harpoon</b> gun is used by Quint in the 1975 movie Jaws.|$|R
5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using <b>harpoons</b> and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} relatively safe, because it could easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and <b>harpoons</b> that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|Mala and the Eskimos go {{bowhead whale}} hunting in wooden boats and with <b>harpoons</b> {{provided}} by the white men, and an actual whale hunt and carcass slaughtering is depicted on film. After the successful hunt, two drunken white men kidnap Aba (and prevent Mala from rescuing her) and force her to get drunk. The ship captain rapes Aba, who escapes at dawn. The Captain's Mate, hunting seals with a rifle, mistakes Aba (passed out on the ice) for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with a harpoon (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his village with his children.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the one flue <b>harpoon</b> was {{replaced}} by the toggling <b>harpoon,</b> which was an iron version of the ancient design used in the Arctic by the native whale hunters there. The toggling iron <b>harpoon</b> was even more successful and rapidly phased out the use of the [...] "common harpoon" [...] (a term which refers to either the one or two flue <b>harpoon).</b>|$|R

On 23 March 2015, the crew of Diamond were reunited with their ship following a refit, which included the installation of <b>Harpoon.</b> HMS Daring is currently undergoing maintenance to receive <b>Harpoon</b> missiles.|$|R
5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding <b>harpoons.</b> Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding <b>harpoons</b> indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
5|$|Senior officer Mark (Robin Clarke) radios Sandy – his romantic {{interest}} – {{from the}} Operations Room to stall for time as Kate and operations chief Gary (Steven Grives) depart to requisition chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy <b>harpoons</b> Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she mauls his flesh. Preparing {{for a final}} confrontation, Mark stumbles across Sandy's newborn, mutant twins. He entrusts them to Sharon as the mother blasts through the Operations Room door and destroys all the equipment inside, although {{it is evident that}} she no longer possesses unnatural strength. Crippled by an explosive charge, Kate is gored to death. In a last stand, Mark strangles and kills Sandy with a ripped-out cable. He returns to Sharon to discover one of the twins biting at her slit neck, before its sibling launches itself at him.|$|E

50|$|Foyn was {{the first}} to hit the whale with grenade <b>harpoon.</b> Svend Foyn {{patented}} his grenade <b>harpoon</b> gun in 1870. He modified existing designs and utilized ideas developed by Erik Eriksen. It consisted of a cannon that fired a barbed explosive head <b>harpoon.</b> Aimed and fired, the <b>harpoon</b> barb would hook into the whale. A moment later an explosive charge in the head of the <b>harpoon</b> would inflict a mortal wound. Then the whale was retrieved by a winch.

5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and <b>harpoons.</b> Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and <b>harpoons.</b> Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by <b>harpoons,</b> small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E
5000|$|The one flue <b>harpoon</b> or one flue iron (sometimes [...] "single" [...] {{instead of}} [...] "one" [...] is used) {{is a type}} of <b>harpoon</b> used in whaling after its {{introduction}} in the early 19th century when it replaced the two flue <b>harpoon.</b> Due to the asymmetric design of the head for which it is named, the one flue <b>harpoon</b> was less likely to cut its way out of the whale meat and blubber, and was therefore more successful in whaling.|$|R
