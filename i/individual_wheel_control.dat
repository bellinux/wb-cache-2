40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} benefits that can be gained {{from the use of}} <b>Individual</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control</b> on a large off-road vehicle. The vehicle concerned is a theoretical, six-wheel drive, off-road Hybrid-Electric Vehicle based on an existing conventional six-wheel-drive Combat Support Vehicle developed by QinetiQ (formerly DERA). The proposed vehicle utilises <b>Individual</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control</b> through the use of six, in-wheel, Hub Mounted Electric Drives. A novel intelligent mobility control system is developed to fully exploit the capability that this configuration offers. Initially, simplified vehicle models are developed to design and test the mobility control components. The control systems developed are Traction Control, Anti-lock Braking and Direct Yaw-moment Control. These controllers are developed individually, with the aim of improving vehicle stability and handling behaviour. Once tested, they are combined into a single system on a basic non-linear handling model, where the controller co-ordination scheme is demonstrated. Preliminary testing shows the full controller to reduce driver workload by offering predictable vehicle handling and improved vehicle stability. An eighteen-degree of freedom vehicle model is then developed, incorporating the vehicle suspension and load transfer characteristics, based on the conventional vehicle. Field test data taken from the existing vehicle trials is used to partially validate the on-road handling behaviour of the vehicle model. On this model, the full mobility controller is tuned to offer optimal performance for a large range of driving conditions and an extension of the controller to limit side-slip at high lateral accelerations is introduced. The controller is then tested on and off-road against a fixed torque distribution system and also the conventional vehicle equipped with various differentials. By exploiting the high torque capability and controllability of the electric drive, the potential of <b>Individual</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control</b> is demonstrated, along with the benefits offered by the hybridelectric drivetrain with respect to mobility. Through the simulation work conducted, the major benefits of <b>Individual</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Control</b> are shown to be: improved stability and manoeuvrability; more predictable vehicle behaviour leading to reduced driver workload; accurate yaw rate tracking and increased safety at handling limits.

40|$|Direct drive, in-wheel motors {{are ideal}} for {{electric}} and hybrid vehicles because the packaging of the drivetrain is so simple, because drivetrain losses are eliminated, and because <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> improves handling and safety. In applications where cost is not a constraint, e. g. solar car racing, direct drive, in-wheel motors are the norm. In-wheel motors are also regularly demonstrated in concept vehicles. However, in-wheel motors are not used for production vehicles because of their high cost and high-unsprung mass. This paper describes a project that addresses these issues {{through the use of}} a novel, multiple-airgap, axial-flux, switched-reluctance motor with optimized packaging and low cost electronics. The emphasis of the paper is on how to design the system as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) has increased rapidly over recent years from both industrial and academic viewpoints due to increasing concerns about environmental pollution and global oil usage. In the automotive sector, huge {{efforts have been}} invested in vehicle technology to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions with, for example, {{electric vehicles}}. Nowadays, the safety and handling of electric vehicles present new tasks for vehicle dynamics engineers due to the changes in weight distribution and vehicle architecture. This thesis focuses on one design area of the electric vehicle – torque vectoring control – {{with the aim of}} investigating the potential benefits of improved vehicle dynamics and handling for EVs. A full electric racing car kit developed by Westfield Sportcars based on an in-line motors design has been modelled in ADAMS with typical subsystems, and then simulated with computer-based kinematic and dynamic analyses. Thus, the characteristics of the suspensions and the natural frequencies of the sprung and unsprung masses were found, so that the model was validated for further simulation and investigation. Different architectures of the EVs, namely the in-line motors and the in-wheel motors, are compared using objective measurements. The objective measurements predicted with kinematics, dynamics and handling analyses confirm that the architecture of the in-line motors provides a superior dynamics performance for ride and driveability. An Optimal Driveline Control Strategy (ODCS) based on the concept of <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>control</b> is designed and its performance is compared with the more common driveline used successfully in the past. The research challenge is to investigate the optimisation of the driving torque outputs to control the vehicle and provide the desired vehicle dynamics. The simulation results confirm that active yaw control is indeed achievable. The original aspects of this work include defining the characteristics and linearity of the project vehicle using a novel consideration of yaw rate gain; the design and development the Optimal Driveline Control Strategy (ODCS); the analysis and modelling the ODCS in the vehicle and the comparison of the results with conventional drivelines. The work has demonstrated that valuable performance benefits result from using optimal torque vectoring control for electric vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control,</b> or torque vectoring, {{in terms of}} vehicle dynamics behaviour have been well documented in the literature. However, few studies analyse <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control</b> integrated with electric vehicle efficiency considerations. The possibilities and {{benefits of}} energy efficient torque vectoring control for electric vehicles with multiple drivetrains are discussed. In particular, energy consumption reductions can be obtained through specific design of the <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control</b> allocation algorithm and the reference yaw rate characteristics.

40|$|Tire {{forces are}} at the heart of the dynamic qualities of vehicles. With the advent of {{electric}} vehicles the precise and accurate control of the traction and braking forces at the <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> becomes a possibility and a reality outside test labs and virtual proving grounds. Benefits of <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control,</b> or torque-vectoring, in terms of vehicle dynamics behavior have been well documented in the literature. However, very few studies exist which analyze the <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control</b> integrated with vehicle efficiency considerations.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} Model Predictive Control (MPC) to vehicle motion <b>control</b> using <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> braking. The <b>control</b> system comprises a three level hierarchical design, with MPC operating in the middle level. Above this is a model-based reference system for motion control integration, and at the lowest level are individual wheel-slip controllers. Performance advantages are shown to derive from linearization of the predictive model about the general (non-equilibrium) operating point at each controller time step, due to strong nonlinearity in the tire force generation. Performance is evaluated using a "sine with dwell" handling test. Â© 2008 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combined control and estimation framework for energy recuperation in fully electric vehicles. We consider a fully electric powertrain, with a driven front axle operating on low friction road surfaces. Our {{objective is to}} find the blending of regenerative and friction braking that maximizes the amount of recovered energy (i. e., the regenerative braking), while (i) delivering the total braking force requested by the driver, (ii) preserving the yaw stability as well as driveability of the vehicle. The proposed framework, which consists of a predictive braking control algorithm and a vehicle state and parameters estimator, is appealing because it requires minimal re-design efforts in order to cope with different powertrain layouts (e. g., <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> motors) and/or <b>control</b> objective and design and physical constraints. We present simulation results, obtained in three sets of manoeuvres, showing promising results in terms of energy recuperation, vehicle stability and driveability...|$|R
40|$|In {{vehicles}} with electric transmission and independent wheel stations, there is apossibility to control propulsion, {{steering and suspension}} individually for eachwheel. This {{makes it possible to}} improve mobility in terrain as well as performanceand driving safety on road. This contribution concerns how a six wheeledelectric transmission vehicle should be modelled to enable evaluation of thedynamic behaviour both in terrain and on road. This is made by combiningmodelling of vehicle, transmission and tyre/terrain behaviour. A tyre/terrain model is needed to simulate driving on soft ground. Heretyre/terrain models for simulating driving with both rigid and pneumatic wheelson soft ground have been developed. A method to measure terrain parametersand drawbar pull for a six-wheeled vehicle on sand is proposed, tested andevaluated. To simulate a six wheeled vehicle at the handling limit on road, a vehicle modelwith a brush tyre model is used in order to get physically reasonable simulationresults during high combined slip conditions. Different vehicle configurationsare considered, where front wheel steering is combined with eithersecond axle steering, rear <b>wheel</b> steering or <b>individual</b> <b>wheel</b> torque <b>control.</b> By applying different vehicle slip angles and thereby limiting the DOF of thevehicle model, the vehicle configurations are evaluated during different drivingconditions. The results show that by applying individual torque <b>control</b> to thefront <b>wheel</b> steered vehicle, the performance is improved for all evaluated manoeuvres,and the achievable aligning torque during a rear wheel skid increasessignificantly if the vehicle slip angle is larger than the maximum front wheelsteering angle. To conclude, models of a six-wheeled vehicle with electric transmission andtyre models both for soft and rigid ground have been developed. These modelsform a simulation platform, which makes it possible to evaluate controlstrategies for the electric transmission with the purpose to improve mobility interrain as well as performance and driving safety on road. Some examples ofapplications of the models are included, e. g. improving at-the-limit handlingand pivot turning performance. QC 2010102...|$|R
