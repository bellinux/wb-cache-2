The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} band <b>gap</b> <b>grading,</b> through the use of (Zn, Cd) Te, have also been investigated in these structures. Grading at the front interface between a CdS window layer and a CdTe absorber layer, can arise due to interdiffusion between the materials during growth or due to the intentional variation of the material composition. This grading has been shown to improve certain performance metrics, such as the open-circuit voltage, while degrading others, such as the fill factor, depending on the amount and distance of the grading. The presence of a Schottky barrier as the back contact has also been shown to degrade the photovoltaic performance of the device, resulting in a characteristic IV curve.

Although it has been demonstrated that a-SiGe:H thin films and devices with good quality can be produced successfully, some issues regarding growth chemistry have remained yet unexplored, such as the hydrogen and inert gas dilution, bombardment effect, and chemical annealing, to name a few.

40|$|The {{research}} reported herein {{deals with}} evaluation of rutting susceptibility of different asphalt binders thorough various parameters and correlating them with parameters resulted from tests {{carried out on}} their corresponding mixtures. Several factors influence the occurrence of rutting in asphalt mixtures including aggregate properties, composition (aggregate gradation and binder content), and volumetric. However Asphalt binders {{play a major role}} in affecting rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures used in road pavements. In the first phase of research four different types of asphalt binders were analyzed by subjecting them to a new protocol combining Single Creep-Recovery (SCR) tests with Multiple Stress Creep (MSC) tests on DSR. Low shear viscosity (LSV) and Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) tests were also performed for comparison purposes. LSV and MSCR tests are currently known as standard procedure for the evaluation of rutting susceptibility of binders. However, recent studies have shown the existence of significant drawbacks for LSV and MSCR method when applied to highly modified polymers products. Three shear stress levels (20, 100 and 500 kPa) were applied in case of MSC tests. In case of SCR test 100 kPa shear stress was applied. Two neat binders having same penetration grade 50 / 70 but different sources were tested at four temperatures (46 °C, 52 °C, 58 °C and 64 °C). Asphalt rubber and SBS modified binder were tested at 58 °C, 64 °C, 70 °C and 76 °C. The higher range of temperature was used because the aim of testing protocol was to reach steady state flow during creep phase at all temperatures. In case of MSCR tests on AR and PMB tests were started at 64 °C and for NA and NB same temperature range selected for SCR and MSC was also applied. In case of SCR-MSC creep compliance rate from creep phase and permanent compliance from recovery phase were calculated in order to rank binders for their rutting susceptibility. In case of LSV and MSCR tests EVT (Equi-viscous temperature) and non-recoverable compliances were calculated respectively. Single creep-recovery tests combined with multiple stress creep were found to be more accurate in ranking binders for their rutting susceptibility. In the 2 nd phase of research the rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures containing above mentioned binders was evaluated. In particular three dense -graded and three gap-graded rubberized mixtures were investigated. Two rubberized <b>gap</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures were prepared in laboratory, one with 2 % filler and the second one with 5 % filler. The third <b>gap</b> <b>graded</b> rubberized mixture was supplied by a plant located in the center of Italy. Amount of binders in all <b>gap</b> <b>graded</b> asphalt mixture was 8 %. The first Dense-graded asphalt mixture was prepared in laboratory with neat binder NA. The second one was collected from local plant which employed neat binder NB, having same penetration grade as the first one but different source and slightly lower maximum design temperature. The third mixture was also prepared in laboratory with SBS polymer modified binder. The binder contents in dense graded asphalt mixtures were 5. 5 %. All the three mixtures were analyzed by subjecting cylindrical specimen to Flow number tests on APMT. Flow number has been recognized as newly anti-rutting indicator of asphalt mixtures. Flow numbers for all the mixtures were measured at 3 different temperatures (46 °C, 52 °C and 58 °C). These testing temperatures were selected keeping in mind diversity of pavement temperature across the country. The 2 nd purpose of selecting different testing temperature was to study how Flow number varies with change in temperature. The results obtained from mixtures were compared with those obtained from binders. Considering three binders NA, NB and SBS and their corresponding mixtures, it was observed that strong correlation exists between binder parameters and Flow number, so parameters from binder testing can be used to predict rutting susceptibility of their corresponding mixtures.

However, the less efficient cells show a longer transition range with donor-acceptor pair recombination still apparent at room temperature. We find further that the part of the room temperature spectrum that is due to band to band transitions in the respective cells is relatively broader than expected from a direct semiconductor with a homogeneous band gap. We analyze this spectral broadening by a model that accounts for band gap fluctuations of the absorber material. The experimental results show that the dominant part of this spectral broadening results from the intentional band <b>gap</b> <b>grading</b> and not from stochastic band gap fluctuations. We show further that the spectral EL emission is linked to the photovoltaic external quantum efficiency by electro-optical reciprocity. In a similar way, the external EL quantum efficiency is related to the open circuit voltage of the device. We verify experimentally that the difference between radiative and measured open circuit voltage determines the EL external quantum efficiency of the solar cell. The best Cu(In,Ga) Se- 2 solar cell reaches an external light emitting diode quantum efficiency of around 0. 1 %. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this work}} was a {{detailed}} investigation of the optoelectronic properties of pin thin film devices based on amorphous and microcrystalline silicon for photovoltaic and sensor application. The influence of the spatial distribution {{as well as the}} charge state of the defect states within the i-layer on the device performance is demonstrated and explained by means of the temperature and illumination level dependence of the solar cell behavior. Thereby numerical simulations are compared with experimental results and show a good agreement. The gained knowledge is transferred on the investigation of new absorber materials like amorphous silicon-germanium alloys (a-SiGe:H) and microcrystalline silicon (#mu#c-Si:H). The application of a-SiGe:H as a material for the absorption layer offers the possibility for a variation of the band gap as a function of depth. Besides the optical properties also the electronic behavior differs significantly with varying band <b>gap</b> <b>grading.</b> A comparison of the experimentally observed current-voltage (I/V) behavior with simulated data reveals crucial differences in the spatial distribution of the defect states {{as a function of the}} band gap design. Therefore, the transport and recombination behavior varies significantly. The device modeling enabled the development of a band gap design that shows a better extraction of photo generated carriers and a lower sensitivity with regard to light induced degradation. The theoretical prediction was confirmed in the experiment. Due to its electronic properties a-SiGe:H is also suitable for sensor application 140 refs.

40|$|Abstract — Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) is a <b>gap</b> <b>graded</b> mix, {{characterized}} by high coarse aggregates, high asphalt contents and polymer or fiber additives as stabilizers. In comparison to dense graded mixtures SMA has {{higher proportion of}} coarse aggregate, lower proportion of middle size aggregate and higher proportion of mineral filler. It resists permanent deformation and {{has the potential for}} long term performance and durability. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the resilient properties of mixtures of stone matrix asphalt made with two types of conventional binders namely bitumen 80 / 100 and 60 / 70, with 0. 3 % by weight of a non – conventional natural fiber, namely coconut fiber. The mixes are subjected to both static and repeated load indirect tensile strength tests. It is observed that the natural fibres have propounding effect on the resilient properties of the mixes.

40|$|Photoluminescence (PL) is {{commonly}} used for investigations of Cu 2 ZnSnS(e) 4 [CZTS(e) ] and Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells. The influence of interference effects on these measurements is, however, largely overlooked in the community. Here, it is demonstrated that PL spectra of typical CZTS absorbers on Mo/glass substrates can be heavily distorted by interference effects. One reason for the pronounced interference in CZTS is the low reabsorption of the PL emission that typically occurs below the band gap. A similar situation occurs in band <b>gap</b> <b>graded</b> CIGS where the PL emission originates predominantly from the band gap minimum located at the notch region. Based on an optical model for interference effects of PL emitted from a thin film, several approaches to reduce the fringing are identified and tested experimentally. These approaches {{include the use of}} measured reflectance data, a calculated interference function, use of high angles of incidence during PL measurements as well as the measurement of polarized light near the Brewster angle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{uniaxial}} and triaxial steady-state deformation behaviour of a <b>gap</b> <b>graded</b> and a continuously graded asphaltic mixture {{have been}} studied. Uniaxial creep and constant strain rate tests {{have been conducted}} over a range of stress levels, strain rates and temperatures, and triaxial creep tests have been conducted over a range of deviatoric stress levels and confining pressures. The steady-state deformation behaviour of both mixtures {{is found to be}} well captured by the Modified Cross Model which predicts linear viscous behaviour at low stress levels and non-linear viscous behaviour at high stress levels. The temperature dependency of the steady-state deformation behaviour is found to be well captured by the WLF equation. It is found that confinement has a stiffening effect on the steady-state deformation behaviour which is found to be higher for the continuously graded mixture. The volumetric strain is found to increase linearly with the shear strain with a gradient that is independent of stress level and confining pressure...|$|R
