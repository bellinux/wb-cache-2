40|$|Stripline {{circulator}} {{theory and}} applications from the world's foremost authority. The stripline junction circulator {{is a unique}} three-port non-reciprocal microwave junction used to connect a single antenna to both a transmitter and a receiver. Its operation relies on the interaction between an electron spin in a suitably magnetized insulator with an alternating radio frequency magnetic field. In its simplest form, it consists of a microwave planar <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonator</b> symmetrically coupled by three transmission lines. This book explores the magnetic interaction involved in the stripline circ...|$|E
40|$|The {{waveguide}} re-entrant or inverted re-entrant turnstile circulator relies for {{its operation}} on either a quarter wave long cylindrical or prism resonator mounted on either a circular or an equilateral platform with its open face {{separated from the}} top waveguide wall by a suitable gap. The adjustment of the prism geometry, the main endeavour of this paper, is characterized by two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom is {{the orientation of the}} prism inside the junction with respect to a typical waveguide feed. The others are the aspect ratio of the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonator</b> and the choice of platform or piston. The agreement between some calculations based on a Finite Element (FE) engine and experiment is excellent. The work undertaken here indicates that the preferred geometry is that for which the platform has the crosshairs section of the resonator.

40|$|Device-oriented {{researches}} {{under way}} in author's laboratory are outline which are devoted to the applications of the narrow-linewidth polycrystalline CaVG's as a class of replacements of the familiar single crystalline garnets, to (1) extremely low-loss circulators, (2) <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonators,</b> (3) MS-mode phase correctors, and (4) the infrared magneto-optical modulator. Emphasis is placed upon the suppression {{and control of the}} unwanted MS-modes and a highly efficient electronically adjustable transversely biased phase corrector as to the items (2) and (3), respectively. Concerning the item (4) an outgrowth from the microwave-ferrite-oriented studies, some of the CaVG's are demonstrated to be comparable with the single crystalline garnets in the infrared magneto-optical performances...|$|R
