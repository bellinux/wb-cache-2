50|$|<b>Empenthrin</b> (also called vaporthrin) is a {{synthetic}} pyrethroid used in insecticides. It is active against {{broad spectrum of}} flying insects including moths and other pests damaging textile. It has low acute mammalian toxicity (its oral LD50 is above 5000 mg/kg in male rats, above 3500 mg/kg in female rats and greater than 3500 mg/kg in mice). It is however very toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms (96-hour LC50 in Oncorhynchus mykiss is 1.7 μg/L, 48-hour EC50 in Daphnia magna is 20 μg/L).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mode of}} entry of pyrethroids into the insect body using adult housefly, Musca domestica L., as an insect model. The wings of adult female houseflies were removed, and <b>empenthrin</b> was applied topically to three different sites: the mesothoracic spiracle, the ventral mesothorax, and the dorsal mesothorax. Among these treatments, {{the application of the}} compound to the mesothoracic spiracle led to the quickest knockdown of the flies. To determine the importance of the spiracle as a primary entry site for the pyrethroid, knockdown times were compared between houseflies with blocked and non-blocked spiracles, using two bioassays: a vapor action test using technical grade <b>empenthrin,</b> and a mosquito coil test using empenthrin-impregnated coils. In both tests, the times required for 50 % knockdown of spiracle-blocked houseflies were significantly higher than those required for the non-blocked flies. However, the mortality rates of the two groups were nearly identical, suggesting that spiracles {{play an important role in}} the knockdown of houseflies. These results also suggest that the rate of pyrethroid uptake through the spiracles was decreased due to the blocking of the mesothoracic spiracle. Therefore, the spiracle may be considered the main entry site for vaporized pyrethroids. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 915 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 2 月 1 日Author: Yusuke Sumita, Hitoshi Kawada, Noboru MinakawaCitation: Applied Entomology and Zoology, 51 (4), pp. 653 - 659; 201...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA high-sensitivity proton {{transfer}} reaction {{mass spectrometer}} (HS-PTR-MS) {{has been used}} to study the temporal evolution of pesticide concentrations in indoor environments. Because of the high time variability of the indoor air concentrations during household pesticide applications, the use of this online high time resolution instrument is found relevant. Four pyrethroid pesticides of the latest generation that are commonly found in electric vaporizer refills, namely, transfluthrin, <b>empenthrin,</b> tetramethrin, and prallethrin, were considered. A controlled pesticide generation system was settled and coupled to a HS-PTR-MS analyzer, and a calibration procedure based on the fragmentation patterns of the protonated molecules was performed. To illustrate the functionality of the method, measurements of the concentration-time profiles of transfluthrin contained in an electric vaporizer were carried out in a full-scale environmental room under air exchange rate-controlled conditions. This study demonstrates that the HS-PTR-MS technique can provide online and high time-resolved measurements of semi-volatile organic compounds such as pyrethroid insecticides...|$|E
