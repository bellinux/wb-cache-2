5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are}} the only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} <b>form</b> <b>a</b> {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> human barrier.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{announced}} on 10 May 2010 {{that he would}} stand down as Labour Leader, {{with a view to}} a successor being chosen before the next Labour Party Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals <b>form</b> <b>a</b> set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals <b>form</b> <b>a</b> set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E

50|$|Four regiments usually <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> brigade, {{although}} as {{the number}} of men in many regiments became greatly reduced, especially later in the war, more than four were often assigned to a brigade. Occasionally, regiments would be transferred between brigades. Two to four brigades usually <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> division. Two to four divisions usually <b>formed</b> <b>a</b> corps. Two to four corps usually <b>formed</b> <b>an</b> army. Occasionally, a single corps might operate independently {{as if it were a}} small army.|$|R
5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to <b>form</b> <b>a</b> single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
5|$|Corals are marine {{invertebrates}} {{in the class}} Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps.

5|$|Durio {{sensu lato}} has 30 {{recognised}} species. Durio sensu stricto comprises 24 of these species. The 6 species included in Durio s.l. are now {{considered by some}} to comprise their own genus, Boschia. Durio s.s. and Boschia have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial {{difference between the two}} is that anther locules open by apical pores in Boschia and by longitudinal slits in Durio s.s. These two genera <b>form</b> <b>a</b> clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae, Cullenia. These three genera together <b>form</b> <b>a</b> clade that is characterized by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.|$|E

The more electronegative oxygen atom pulls electrons {{away from the}} carbon <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> greater electron density around the oxygen, giving the oxygen a partial negative charge and <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> polar bond. When nitric acid is presented, it ionizes. A hydrogen cation contributed by the acid is attracted to the oxygen and <b>forms</b> <b>a</b> covalent bond H+. The electronegative NO3− ion then is attracted to the positive hydrogen ion. This <b>forms</b> <b>an</b> ionic bond and hence the compound urea nitrate.|$|R
