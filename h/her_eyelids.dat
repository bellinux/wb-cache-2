5|$|The groom Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash). Brahma, the priest, is squatting {{on the floor to}} the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
25|$|Trap-jaw ants do {{not have}} similar {{stingers}} as bees. Instead, their stings are retractable and not barbed {{in order to be}} used again. The sting is located {{at the end of the}} abdomen and is completely covered by a sheath, a protective covering. Besides the momentary sting from the bite, O. bauri contains a mixture of formic acid and protein, which may have a high toxic activity, and is discharged after the ant bite. Within humans, there have been records of immediate burning at the site of the sting but that usually dissipates after an hour. However, there was one case in which a young girl had an intense allergic reaction to the bite. There were patches of red, itchy, swollen areas on her hands, arms, thorax and foot. Additionally, <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> were swollen. This lasted about a week and has been discovered in about 16% of ant bites.|$|E
25|$|The {{red-headed}} krait is {{an extremely}} venomous snake, although bites are reported rarely. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their own. When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles {{are the first to}} suffer: the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may have a real struggle to keep his or <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> open. This medical condition is known as bilateral ptosis and it is a classic, tell-tale sign of severe envenomation. Other common symptoms include diplopia, dysphagia, vomiting, headache, and hypersalivation. Sometime later the symptoms of paralysis tend to worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing. Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed Îº-flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of antivenin or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the chemical messenger carrying signals from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular synapse.|$|E
60|$|She {{kissed his}} forehead, and then drew back suddenly, lest the warm tear which was quivering on <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> should fall back upon his face.|$|R
6000|$|She put {{a finger}} {{significantly}} on a cheek whose glow was above suspicion, and smiled and looked very arch and pretty and inviting. [...] "And here," [...] and she indicated <b>her</b> <b>eyelid.</b>|$|R
6000|$|If, with high-bounding pride,[i] [...] He {{return to}} his bride! [...] Renouncing the gore-crimson'd spear; [...] All his toils are repaid [...] When, {{embracing}} the maid, [...] From <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> he kisses the Tear.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyelids,</b> {{weighted}} with trouble, continued drooping as before.|$|E
60|$|She had lowered <b>her</b> <b>eyelids.</b> Razumov {{looked at}} her curiously.|$|E
60|$|She fled. When {{she reached}} the hall she found <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> wet.|$|E
60|$|Linda {{could say}} nothing further, for an unbidden tear {{moistened}} <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> as {{she heard her}} mother speak so harshly of her lover. Gertrude, however, took up the cudgels for him, and so did Captain Cuttwater.|$|R
6000|$|When {{with high}} {{bounding}} pride, [...] He {{returns to his}} bride, [...] Renouncing the gore crimson'd spear; [...] All his toils are repaid, [...] When embracing the maid, [...] From <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> he kisses the tear.|$|R
50|$|A {{young woman}} is murdered in her Oslo flat. One finger has been severed from her left hand, and behind <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> is {{secreted}} a tiny diamond {{in the shape}} of a five-pointed star - a pentagram, the devil's star.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyelids</b> drooped {{over her}} half closed eyes. For {{a moment she}} was silent.|$|E
60|$|Miss {{looked at}} him, and looked away. <b>Her</b> <b>eyelids</b> fluttered distractingly. She fetched a sigh.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> drooped, {{and in a}} {{few minutes}} her regular {{breathing}} showed that she was asleep.|$|E
60|$|Hugh again dashed {{water in}} the woman's face, and Rupert {{distinctly}} saw a quiver in <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> as he did so. Then forcing open her teeth, he poured a little spirit into her mouth, and was in a minute rewarded by a gasping sigh.|$|R
6000|$|What cheek is redder? sure roses fed her! [...] Her hair is maregolds, and her eye of blew Beneath <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> is {{like the}} vi'let, [...] That darkly glistens with gentle jew? The lily's nature is not surely whiter [...] Than Nora's neck is,--and her arrums too.|$|R
50|$|In Tear, Antoni {{created a}} {{wrecking}} ball in lead and then {{used it to}} demolish a building synchronised with the blinking of <b>her</b> <b>eyelid.</b> Each impact damaged {{the surface of the}} ball, thus telling its history. The work is currently installed at the Luhring Augustine Gallery, New York.|$|R
60|$|She lowered <b>her</b> <b>eyelids,</b> and Heyst {{was startled}} by {{something}} like an expression of horror on her face.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{looked at}} him quickly from below <b>her</b> <b>eyelids.</b> It was hard, however, to gather {{anything}} from his face.|$|E
60|$|She {{attempted}} to lift Carmina from the sofa--and drew back, breathlessly watching her. Her rigid face faintly relaxed; <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> closed, and quivered.|$|E
6000|$|What cheek is redder? sure roses fed her! [...] Her hair is maregolds, and her eye of blew. [...] Beneath <b>her</b> <b>eyelid,</b> is {{like the}} vi'let, [...] That darkly glistens with gentle jew! [...] The lily's nature is not surely whiter [...] Than Nora's neck is,--and her arrums too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't call names; {{but what}} shall I do when I see {{everything}} in confusion, and she won't let me clear up?" [...] asked Molly, looking round at Scamp, who promptly put the little paw on <b>her</b> <b>eyelid,</b> {{as if the}} roll of the blue ball underneath amused him.|$|R
5|$|Stone's tears first {{roll down}} her face in micro-gravity, and are later seen {{floating}} off her face. After being pushed from her eye by <b>her</b> <b>eyelid,</b> the surface tension is not sufficient for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline. However, the movie correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{was sitting}} still and upright; she hardly raised <b>her</b> <b>eyelids,</b> as she tranquilly said, 'Nothing shall induce {{me to go}} till he is better.' ...|$|E
60|$|The colour {{had faded}} out of Noel's face, and, {{with her head}} thrown back and <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> half-closed, {{she looked like a}} scornful young ghost.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Falstaffian issue," [...] {{rejoined the}} Tabby, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> and composing her {{head for a}} quiet sleep, [...] "the above is a toy mouse." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Kingdom {{gazed at}} him mournfully, and, putting her hand behind her, began a wriggling search in her pocket for a handkerchief, {{with the idea of}} paying a {{wholesome}} tribute of tears. She was a past-master in the art of grief, and, pending its extraction, a docile tear hung on <b>her</b> <b>eyelid</b> and waited. The captain eyed her preparations with silent anger.|$|R
6000|$|And slowly was {{my mother}} brought [...] To yield consent to my desire: [...] She wish'd me happy, but she thought [...] I might have look'd a little higher; [...] And I was young--too young to wed: [...] "Yet must I love her for your sake; [...] Go fetch your Alice here," [...] she said: [...] <b>Her</b> <b>eyelid</b> quiver'd as she spake.|$|R
60|$|Joan saw {{the stars}} through <b>her</b> shut <b>eyelids.</b> All the night seemed to press down and softly darken.|$|R
6000|$|Mirah {{had sunk}} {{on the music}} stool again, with <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> down and her hands tightly clasped; and Mrs. Meyrick, giving up the paper to Mab, said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, she {{was married}} out of a boarding-school, came here the meekest, shyest, little {{shrinking}} creature, always keeping <b>her</b> <b>eyelids</b> cast down, and colouring at a word.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] she persisted, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>eyelids.</b> [...] "Of course I know," [...] {{and nothing}} could have convinced me more completely {{that she did not}} know.|$|E
60|$|Kennicott {{had always}} seemed out of place there but Erik {{surprisingly}} harmonized {{with the spirit of}} the room as he stroked the books, glanced at the prints. He held out his hands. He came toward her. She was weak, betrayed to a warm softness. Her head was tilted back. Her eyes were closed. Her thoughts were formless but many-colored. She felt his kiss, diffident and reverent, on <b>her</b> <b>eyelid.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{glanced at}} him covertly from under <b>her</b> sleepy <b>eyelids.</b> Peter's face was like {{the face of a}} child.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted up}} his head, and breathed his whole soul upon her lips; his tears fell on <b>her</b> closed <b>eyelids.</b>|$|R
