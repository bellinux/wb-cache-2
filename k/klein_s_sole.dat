50|$|<b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> {{started to}} build new {{suburban}} stores in the 1960s but in an unusual way. Instead of being an anchor store in the regional malls being built at the time, <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> would often build as an outparcel near, but not connected to the mall itself. Most stores were located in New York and New Jersey in the greater New York City area. <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> operated stores {{as far south as}} Alexandria, Virginia and at Beltway Plaza in Greenbelt, Maryland.|$|R
5000|$|<b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> On The Square, or simply, <b>S.</b> <b>Klein,</b> was {{a popular}} priced {{department}} store chain based in New York City that is now defunct. The flagship stores (a main building and a women's fashion building) were located along Union Square in Manhattan; this location would combine with the 1920s idiomatic catch phrase [...] "on the square" [...] (meaning [...] "honest and straight-up") to provide the subtitle. <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> positioned itself as a step above regional discount stores of its time (Two Guys, Great Eastern Mills), more fashion aware than E. J. Korvette, and a more affordable option compared to traditional department stores like Macy's, or Abraham & Straus. <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> stores were full-line department stores, including furniture departments, fur salons, and full service pet departments.|$|R

40|$|Standard {{treatments}} of U. S. agriculture assert that, before the 1930 s, productivity growth was almost exclusively {{the result of}} mechanization rather than biological innovations. This article shows that U. S. wheat production witnessed wholesale changes in varieties and cultural practices during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. Without these changes, vast expanses of the wheat belt could not have sustained commercial production and yields everywhere would have plummeted due to the increasing severity of insects, diseases, and weeds. Revised estimates of Parker and <b>Klein</b> <b>s</b> productivity calculations indicate that biological innovations contributed roughly half of labor-productivity growth between 1839 and 1909. ...|$|R

5000|$|While {{there is}} little trace of <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> today, a {{significant}} part of the signage was still in place at its former location in downtown Newark, New Jersey until its demolition. This location had been vacant since the store was closed in 1976, and the neon sign (in 2008 photo) that proclaims, [...] "S Klein, On The Square" [...] complete with their neon carpenter's square logo was still intact as of 2012. In late 2012 the Newark planning board approved a proposal by the Prudential Insurance Company to build a new 20 story office building on the site of the <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> building, and several other long abandoned buildings. The <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> building was demolished in late July 2013.|$|R

5000|$|Due {{in part to}} its {{reputation}} for bargains, <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> {{was known as the}} store to pick through racks and bins searching for the ultimate find. In the 1950s sitcom I Love Lucy, Ethel Mertz often mentioned [...] "pawing through racks" [...] at either <b>S.</b> <b>Klein,</b> or the bargain basement at Gimbels. In the 1970s sitcom All In The Family, <b>S.</b> <b>Klein</b> was mentioned as Edith Bunker's favorite store. In the song [...] "Marry The Man" [...] from the musical Guys and Dolls, the lyrics mention three department stores: [...] "At Wanamaker's and Saks and Klein's". On an episode of Mad Men Roger Sterling compliments Jane (before she was his wife) on top and she says she got it at Kleins on Union Square. He makes a comment wondering if his daughter shops there and Jane more or less says she doubts it (Insinuating she would shop there due to her father- Rogers- wealth).|$|R
