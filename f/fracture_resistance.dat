However, they have been noted {{to be an important}} potential source of enamel fractures that arise after extended use or overloading. It appears that, although enamel easily starts to form the fracture defects of enamel tufts, they then enable enamel to resist the further progress of these fractures, ultimately preventing mechanical failure. This <b>fracture</b> <b>resistance</b> is why tooth enamel is three times stronger than its constituent hydroxyapatite crystallites that make up its enamel rods.|$|E
25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases <b>fracture</b> <b>resistance</b> decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

30|$|A {{crack in}} a {{material}} can propagate either by opening (mode-I), shearing {{between the two}} crack faces (mode-II), or {{by a combination of}} both (mixed-mode). In different modes of fracture, different stress-displacement fields will develop {{in the vicinity of the}} crack, so the fracture energy depends on which fracture mode occurs (Achintha and Burgoyne 2013). Although in the case of brittle, isotropic and homogeneous solids, cracks propagate by maintaining pure mode-I condition at the crack tip, the stress field that triggers debonding at an interface can be very complex (Hutchinson and Suo 1992). Various forms of stress concentrations develop due to different fracture energies of two joining materials and also due to the number of geometric constraints present in the vicinity. Thus, it would be expected that interface cracks are governed by mixed-mode effects. An interface crack under mixed-mode loading can experience either kinking or straight-ahead propagation, depending on the relative <b>fracture</b> <b>resistances</b> associated with the competing possible directions of advance (Hutchinson and Suo 1992). In straight-ahead propagation case, the interface is relatively weaker than the bordering materials, meaning that the interface crack propagates along the least resistance path, interface. In the crack kinking case, the interface is relatively tougher than at least one of two adjoining materials (Li et al. 1995).|$|R

The K c (a, T) relationships obtained, where K c is the stress intensity factor at fracture, are shown to follow those given by the Williams/Marshall relaxation crack growth model and the toughness-biased rate theory. Crack propagation in both materials is shown {{to be controlled by}} a β -relaxation molecular process associated with crazing. Crack instabilities observed in plain polystyrene are analysed successfully in terms of isothermal-adiabatic transitions at the crack tip. Fracture initiation experiments are also conducted in which the effects of organic liquids on the <b>fracture</b> <b>resistances</b> of both plain/glass-filled polystyrene have been determined. Good correlations between K i 2 (K i being the crack initiation stress intensity factor) and δ s, solvent solubility parameter, of various liquid environments have been obtained, which give a minimum K i 2 value at δ s ≈ δ p, where δ p is the solubility parameter of the polymer.

The utility {{of this approach}} to difference {{is set in the}} urban context to illuminate the role of diversity as a strategic asset in the local consolidation of global economic processes. The qualitative research reported here is a study of the City of Toronto's recently developed diversity initiative as expressed in the recommendations of the Task Force on Community Access and Equity.

Their general role in facilitating inclusion and their specific impact on the planning function is considered. Assessment of the Plan finds it consistent with the dominant treatment of difference as "diversity" reflective of the competitive, corporatized city in which it has been developed, offering minimal opportunity to open political space for marginalized groups.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanical behavior of a dental system built up with fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) endodontic posts with different types of fibers and two cements (the first one used with a primer, the second one without it). Six FRC posts were used. Each system was characterized in terms of structural efficiency under external applied loads similar to masticatory forces. An oblique force was applied and stiffness and maximum load data were obtained. The same test was used for the dentine. The systems were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to investigate the surface of the post and inner surface of root canal after failure. The mechanical tests showed that load values in dental systems depend on the post material and used cement. The highest load (281 ± 59 N) was observed for the conical glass fiber posts in the cement without primer. There was a 50 and 85 % increase in the maximum load for two of the conical posts with glass fibers and a 229 % increase for the carbon fiber posts in the cement without primer as compared with the cement with primer. Moreover, almost all the studied systems showed <b>fracture</b> <b>resistances</b> higher than the typical masticatory loads. The microscopic analysis underlined the good adhesion of the second cement at the interfaces between dentine and post.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of polycrystalline thin films {{is essential to}} assuring safe performance of micro/nano-electromechanical systems. Usually, they are of through-thickness grain structures and are brittle at working temperatures, and therefore their fracture properties are dominated by the resistances offered by grain boundaries to cleavage cracking [1, 2]. As a cleavage crack front propagates across a high-angle grain boundary, it would first penetrate across a number of break-through points [3], and the persistent grain boundary areas would then be separated through shear fracture or ligament bending [4, 5]. It is, therefore, envisioned that as the film thickness is smaller than the characteristic distance between the break-through points, which is often {{in the range of}} 0. 5 - 5 microns, the crack front transmission can be significantly confined by the film surfaces, leading to an either beneficial or detrimental size effect. That is, the fracture toughness of the polycrystalline thin film is not a material constant; rather, it highly depends on the film thickness. Since this important phenomenon has not received the necessary attention, we propose to carry out a systematic study on <b>fracture</b> <b>resistances</b> of bicrystal silicon films. The film thickness will range from 1 to 1000 microns, and the crystallographic orientations across the grain boundaries will be controlled precisely so that the size effect and the geometrical factors can be analyzed separately. The study will starts with thick films. Once the crack front transmission process is relatively well understood, it will be extended to thin films. This project will shed light on crack-boundary interactions in confining microenvironments, which has both great scientific interest and immense technological importance to the development of fine-structured devices...|$|R
