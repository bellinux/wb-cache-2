In the chapter, she encounters Mickey Mouse, who attempts to help her escape, but she ultimately sacrifices herself once again to protect Riku from the Heartless just after Sora's climactic battle with Ansem, and so remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> of Darkness.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí {{was also}} an {{innovator}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces ("trencadís") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented a new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of primary colours, and sometimes a neutral one, varying {{the thickness of the}} glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.|$|E

Sora, having learned of their fates from King Mickey's letter, undertakes another quest to save them.|$|E
5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. From the political one, showing willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was too costly.|$|E

5|$|Now King Henry VII, he neutralised the {{remaining}} Yorkist forces, partly by marrying Elizabeth of York, a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm,</b> and the {{conflicts with the}} nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end. The reign of the second Tudor king, Henry VIII, was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the Pope led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the Church of England (the Anglican Church).|$|E
5|$|Sometime I {{have thought}} that {{impossible}} it had been, so to have removed my affection {{from the realm of}} Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of {{structural}} engineering and technical Chinese architecture, {{there were also}} government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang Lü (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712–756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Italy {{a number}} of banks in Florence {{collapsed}} due to internal problems in Florence, contributed by King Edward III of England defaulting on some of his loans. Most notably, the Bardi family went bankrupt in this year. Italy also suffered a famine, {{making it difficult for}} the Papacy to recruit troops for the attack on Smyrna. The Venetians, however, organized an alliance uniting several European parties (Sancta Unio), composed notably of the Knights Hospitaller, which carried out five consecutive attacks on İzmir and the Western Anatolian coastline controlled by Turkish states. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of technology, papermaking reached Holland, and firearms made their way to Northern Germany in this year. The earliest records in the area place them in the city of Aachen.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of the dead, only {{to come back and}} report their experiences.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of heredity grew rapidly {{in the wake of}} Darwin's Origin of Species with the work of Francis Galton and the biometricians. The origin of genetics is usually traced to the 1866 work of the monk Gregor Mendel, who would later be credited with the laws of inheritance. However, his work was not recognized as significant until 35 years afterward. In the meantime, a variety of theories of inheritance (based on pangenesis, orthogenesis, or other mechanisms) were debated and investigated vigorously. Embryology and ecology also became central biological fields, especially as linked to evolution and popularized in the work of Ernst Haeckel. Most of the 19th century work on heredity, however, was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of natural history, but that of experimental physiology.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{position}} {{after the}} accession of Edward IV {{was stronger than}} ever. He had now succeeded to his father's possessions, and in 1462 he also inherited his mother's lands and the Salisbury title. Altogether he had an annual income from his lands of over £7,000 far {{more than any other}} man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> but the king. Edward confirmed Warwick's position as Captain of Calais, and made him High Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices. His brothers also benefited: John Neville, Lord Montagu, was made Warden of the East March in 1463, and the next year created Earl of Northumberland. George Neville, Bishop of Exeter, was confirmed in his post as chancellor by King Edward, and in 1465 promoted to the archbishopric of York.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E

5|$|Burnell was {{the chief}} and most {{influential}} of Edward I's advisers {{during the first half}} of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He heard many requests and petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king's major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell's tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell's death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in 1275, 1285, and 1290. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the usurpation of royal rights. Keeping the peace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was dealt with in the statutes from 1285, along with a number of other issues. The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.|$|E
5|$|Early {{during the}} game's development, Nomura already had various scenes in mind such as Terra's and Riku's {{conversation}} {{in order to}} explain the latter's ability in the original games. Various parts from the plot had to be modified to make the game more light-hearted such as Eraqus' death {{at the hands of}} Xehanort after being defeated by Terra, how Aqua's scenario was supposed to end with her already trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> of Darkness, and the relationship between Ventus and Sora. Two of the newly introduced protagonists, Ventus and Terra, were based on other characters from the franchise while Aqua's design did not have a base. Nevertheless, the three wear outfits meant to expand the student-and-teacher bond shown in the game. The Disney worlds were chosen to expand the characters of the Princesess of Light as well as Maleficient's who are connected with the events of the first Kingdom Hearts game, while the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space were chosen to add variety to the game, and Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
5|$|In Kingdom Hearts II, Sora {{and friends}} awaken from their sleep and resume {{their search for}} Riku and King Mickey, {{learning}} of the Nobodies and becoming re-familiarized with Organization XIII. Sora once again travels to many Disney-themed worlds and resolves issues caused by the Heartless and Nobodies, and Maleficent's servant Pete. They reunite with King Mickey and encounter Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII and Nobody of Xehanort, revealed to be the human form of the Heartless Ansem. The Organization's plan is also revealed: they seek to regain their lost hearts by creating {{their own version of}} Kingdom Hearts from the sum of all the hearts released from the Heartless slain by Sora's Keyblade. The three arrive at the headquarters of Organization XIII and team up with their friends. Ansem the Wise uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but it self-destructs, engulfing Ansem. At the top of the Castle that Never Was, Sora and his friends battle Xemnas. After Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas, they get trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> of darkness, but a letter from Kairi summons a gateway for them, and the two are reunited with their friends at their home.|$|E
