5|$|Calbovista is a fungal genus {{containing}} the single species Calbovista subsculpta, {{commonly known as}} the sculptured puffball, sculptured giant puffball, and warted giant puffball. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> puffball of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of western North America. The puffball is more or less round with a diameter of up to , white becoming brownish in age, and covered with shallow pyramid-shaped plates or scales. It fruits singly or in groups along roads and in open woods at high elevations, from summer to autumn.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> means of spreading antibiotic resistance, virulence, and adaptive metabolic functions. Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt {{the orbits of}} the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik {{with the belief}} that the soul of the deceased will pray for them in Heaven.

5|$|Mycena californiensis is {{a species}} of fungus in the Mycenaceae family. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> and {{abundant}} species in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it grows saprobically, feeding on the fallen leaves and acorns of various oak species. First described in 1860 by Berkeley and Curtis, the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later Mycena researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym.|$|E
5|$|OCD also {{is found}} in animals, and is of {{particular}} concern in horses, as {{there may be a}} hereditary component in some horse breeds. Feeding for forced growth and selective breeding for increased size are also factors. OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the German Shepherd—where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> primary cause of elbow dysplasia in medium-large breeds.|$|E
5|$|Strength-stones {{are used}} in modern times for {{strength}} training, particularly in the martial arts where such practices are known as hojo undō. Special stones are manufactured for this purpose, usually with a wooden handle to aid their manipulation; such stones are also known as chi ishi. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> practice in karate, used in solo training to improve stances and upper body strength.|$|E

5|$|Stropharia caerulea is a {{saprophytic}} fungus that fruits singly or in groups. It {{grows in}} or on meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. In Europe {{it is often}} found in beech woods in alkaline soil. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> species found throughout Europe, where it fruits from July to November.

5|$|Stropharia caerulea, {{commonly}} known as the blue roundhead, is an inedible species of agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprophyte in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. S.caerulea was officially described to science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye (Pseudomugil signifer) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Pseudomugilidae native to eastern Australia. Described by Austrian naturalist Rudolf Kner in 1866, it {{comprises}} two subspecies that have been regarded as separate species {{in the past and}} may be once again with further study. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> fish of rivers and estuaries along the eastern seaboard from Cape York in north Queensland to southern New South Wales, the Burdekin Gap in central-north Queensland dividing the ranges of the two subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Diabolical rebaptism {{refers to}} the rebaptism of an {{individual}} {{in the name of}} the devil. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> accusation made against the accused at witch trials, but seems to have been essentially the invention of demonologists.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> slab hut <b>is</b> <b>a</b> kind of {{dwelling}} or shed {{made from}} slabs of split or sawn timber. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> form of construction used by settlers in Australia and New Zealand during their nations' Colonial periods.|$|R
50|$|Boiling down is {{the process}} of {{rendering}} fat from animal carcasses to produce tallow. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> small-farm activity for making soap and candles for domestic use, but was industrialised in the early 19th century, particularly in Australia.|$|R
5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> divisor, it must be {{less than or equal}} to the greatest common divisor g. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be {{less than or equal to}} r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E
5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E
5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E
50|$|A quarter section, often {{shortened}} to quarter, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> area of {{one-fourth of}} a square mile, or 160 acre. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> size of <b>a</b> tract under Homestead Acts in the United States and the Dominion Land Survey in Canada.|$|R
