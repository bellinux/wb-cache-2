40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} (PCs), {{consisting of}} a periodic pattern of variations in the material properties, {{are one of the}} platforms proposed as synthetic optical materials to meet the need for optical materials with desired properties. Recently, applications based on <b>dispersive</b> <b>properties</b> of the PCs have been proposed in which PCs are envisioned as optical materials with controllable <b>dispersive</b> <b>properties.</b> Unlike the conventional use of PCs to achieve localization, in these new applications propagation inside the photonic crystal is studied, and their <b>dispersive</b> <b>properties</b> are utilized. Among these applications, the possibility of demultiplexing light using the superprism effect is of particular interest. Possibility of integration and compactness are two main advantages of PC-based wavelength demultiplexers compared to other demultiplexing techniques, for applications including compact spectrometers (for sensing applications), demultiplexers (for communications), and spectral analysis (for information processing systems). I develop the necessary simulation tools to study the <b>dispersive</b> <b>properties</b> of photonic crystals. In particular, I will focus on superprism-based demultiplexing in PCs, and define a phenomenological model to describe different effects in these structures and to study important parameters and trends. A systematic method for the optimization and design of these structures is presented. Implementation of these structures is experimentally demonstrated using the devices fabricated in a planar SOI platform based on designed parameters. In the next step, different approaches to improve the performance of these devices (for better resolution and lower insertion loss) are studied, and extension of the concepts to other material platforms is discussed.

Using reductive perturbation technique, a relevant Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation is derived and then solved to obtain the expressions of amplitude and width of the solitons. The magnetic field is found to alter the <b>dispersive</b> <b>property</b> of the plasma, and hence, only {{the width of the}} solitons is reduced in the presence of higher magnetic field. Soliton amplitude is found to decrease/increase and the width to increase/decrease for the higher densities of negatively/positively charged dust grains. Moreover, the amplitude of such a soliton remains larger in the case of positively charged dust grains in comparison with the negatively charged dust grains. The effect of electron/positron drift velocities of the charged species is not pronounced on the properties of the compressive solitons. Under the limiting cases, our calculations reduce to the calculations by other investigators. This substantiates the generality of the present analysis.|$|R
