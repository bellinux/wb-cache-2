40|$|The {{basis for}} {{determining}} {{the size of the}} random sample of tubes to be inspected in replacement steam generators is revisited in this paper. A procedure to estimate the maximum number of defective tubes left in the steam generator after no defective tubes have been detected in the randomly selected <b>inspection</b> <b>sample</b> is proposed. A Bayesian estimation is used to obtain closed-form solutions for uniform, triangular and binomial prior densities describing the number of failed tubes in steam generators. It is shown that the particular way of selecting the random <b>inspection</b> <b>sample</b> (e. g., one sample from both SG, one sample from each SG, etc.) does not affect the results of the inspection and also the information obtained {{about the state of the}} uninspected tubing, as long as the inspected steam generators belong to the same population. Numerical examples further demonstrate two possible states of the knowledge existing before the inspection of the tubing. First, virtually no knowledge about the state of the steam generator tubing before the inspection is modeled using uniform and triangular prior densities. It is shown that the knowledge about the uninspected part of the tubing strongly depends on the size of the sample inspected. Further, even small <b>inspection</b> <b>samples</b> may significantly improve our knowledge about the uninspected part. On the other hand, rather strong belief on the state of the tubing prior to the inspection is modeled using binomial prior density. In this case, the knowledge about the uninspected part of the tubing is virtually independent on the size of the sample. Furthermore, it is shown qualitatively and quantitatively that such inspection brings no additional knowledge on the uninspected part of the tubing. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of an upward {{shift in the}} fraction defective of a repetitive process is considered using the geometric CUSUM.

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} {{is currently}} being implemented in {{a wide spectrum of}} research and industrial areas, such as material sciences, cosmo- and geochemistry, biology and medicine, to name just a few. Research and development in nuclear safeguards is closely related to the general field of “Peace Research”; representing a specific application area for analytical sciences in general and for mass spectrometry in particular. According to Albert Einstein “peace cannot be kept by force. It only can be achieved by understanding”. Understanding implies a realistic estimation of potential challenges and threats, which is based on the ability to obtain timely, reliable and independent information. A particular task of nuclear safeguards is reducing threats that are posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons. An important part of the safeguards system is the “analytical laboratory”, with mass spectrometric techniques, such as thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) belonging to the most powerful methods for the analysis of nuclear and environmental <b>inspection</b> <b>samples.</b> Some of the challenging applications of mass spectrometry include isotopic analysis of micro-samples, age determination of nuclear materials as well as identification and quantification of elemental and isotopic signatures of <b>inspection</b> <b>samples</b> in general.

40|$|In {{line with}} the {{continuous}} improvement theory, the learning phenomenon is often incorporated into models for predicting {{the evolution of the}} unitary quality costs. In this paper, the quality metric predicted is the rate of supplied non-conforming units through a learning process with autonomous and induced sources of experience. The former is simply learning by doing, i. e. supplying, whilst the latter is driven by the allocation of training hours to suppliers. A revised learning model with time-varying learning rates is proposed for embracing both these effects into a multistage assembly/production setting. A single-period prevention–appraisal–failure cost function is achieved, and the <b>sample</b> <b>inspection</b> rates adopted among suppliers are also considered in order to evaluate their effect. If these sample rates are given, the goal of allocating the training hours among suppliers is pursued by means of integer linear programming. Otherwise, a mixed-integer quadratic problem arises for the concurrent allocation of training hours and <b>inspection</b> <b>sample</b> rates among suppliers. A case study is finally carried out for demonstrating the applicability of the model, as well as for providing managerial insights...|$|R
40|$|Buyers have {{imperfect}} {{information about}} the food safety efforts exerted by suppliers. To gather information about safety, buyers often employ sampling <b>inspection.</b> <b>Sampling</b> inspection exhibits sampling error so some unsafe product passes inspection and some safe product does not.

I use the model to examine the sampling inspection policies in the 1996 Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point Act. I conclude that the regulation of sampling inspection procedures is an effective tool for policy makers who wish to improve food safety. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{inspection}} and workpiece localization, sampling point data {{is an important}} issue. Since the devices for sampling only sample discrete points, not the completely surface, sampling size and location of the points will be taken into consideration. In this paper a method is presented for determining the sampled points size and location for achieving efficient sampling. Firstly, uncertainty analysis of the localization parameters is investigated. A localization uncertainty model is developed to predict {{the uncertainty of the}} localization process. Using this model the minimum size of the sampled points is predicted. Secondly, based on the algebra theory an eigenvalue-optimal optimization is proposed. Then a freeform surface is used in the simulation. The proposed optimization is implemented. The simulation result shows its effectivity.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} advanced analytical techniques, for the characterization of actinide particles originating from the non-peaceful use of nuclear technology and from international inspections of the nuclear fuel cycle associated with non-proliferation agreements. The thesis is based on five papers, which will be referred to by Paper I-V in the text. Individual particle analysis has several advantages over bulk analysis as it can give detailed information on elemental surface and internal compositions, elemental distributions, and compositional information. This information is valuable in tracing {{the source of the}} material, and in modelling and predicting the transport of radionuclides in the environment, for instance, in a release scenario. In bulk sample analysis, these characteristics are largely masked. The specific objectives of this work, which was aimed at improving the techniques used in actinide particle analysis, were: 1) the analysis of microscopic materials from nuclear weapons tests and an accidental release involving nuclear weapons (Papers I and II) and materials from nuclear <b>inspection</b> <b>samples</b> (Paper III) in order to obtain elemental and isotopic fingerprints. Single-particle analysis were performed using techniques such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize the particles, regarding elemental, isotopic, size and morphology structures, and fundamental limitations were identified; 2) the optimization of SIMS analysis of uranium particles by tuning the instrument to obtain the highest obtainable efficiency (Paper III); 3) the investigation of large-geometry SIMS applied to <b>inspection</b> <b>samples</b> to allow isotopic analysis of particles that is not possible with conventional SIMS (Paper III); 4) the production and characterization of new particle materials suitable for calibration purposes (Papers IV and V); and 5) the application of the calibration material produced for the evaluation of SIMS and SEM (Papers III and V) ...|$|R
