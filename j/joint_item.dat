However inconsistent empirical evidence suggests that the speed-ability relation might be more complicated than what was believed. Adopting the <b>joint</b> <b>item</b> response-response time modeling approach developed by van der Linden and colleagues (2006, 2007, 2009), the current study investigates the psychometric properties of the general speed factor and its relation to g in a reasoning task. Personality trait effects are examined as well to account for the speed and ability variances. In line with the earlier findings, results in the current study suggest that the reasoning speed and ability correlation is minimal and explanations for the mixed research findings are discussed within the context of individual differences and test situations...|$|E

The model includes positive echelon holding costs, fixed costs for ordering and shipping each item, and a fixed <b>joint</b> <b>item</b> order cost at each retailer. Demand for each item at each retailer is assumed to occur at a constant and continuous rate. A mathematical model is developed based on these assumptions and the assumption that a stationary nested policy is followed.

40|$|We generalize the {{integrated}} system model of Smith and Ratcliff (2009) {{to obtain a}} new theory of attentional selection in brief, multielement visual displays. The theory proposes that attentional selection occurs via competitive interactions among detectors that signal the presence of task-relevant features at particular display locations. The outcome of the competition, together with attention, determines which stimuli are selected into visual short-term memory (VSTM). Decisions about the contents of VSTM are made by a diffusion-process decision stage. The selection process is modeled by coupled systems of shunting equations, which perform gated where-on-what pathway VSTM selection. The theory provides a computational account of key findings from attention tasks with near-threshold stimuli. These are (a) {{the success of the}} MAX model of visual search and spatial cuing, (b) the distractor homogeneity effect, (c) the double-target detection deficit, (d) redundancy costs in the post-stimulus probe task, (e) the <b>joint</b> <b>item</b> and information capacity limits of VSTM, and (f) the object-based nature of attentional selection. We argue that these phenomena are all manifestations of an underlying competitive VSTM selection process, which arise as a natural consequence of our theory...|$|E

Purpose – The present paper {{focuses on the}} case where – by design – one needs to impute {{cross-country}} cross-survey data (situation typical for example among multinational firms who are confronted {{with the need to}} carry out comparative marketing surveys with respondents located in several countries). Importantly, while some work demonstrates approaches for single-item direct measures, no prior research has examined the common situation in international marketing where the researcher needs to use multi-item scales of latent constructs. Our paper presents problem areas related to the choices international marketers have to make when doing cross-country / cross-survey research and provides guidance for future research. Design/methodology/approach – Multi-country sample of real data is used as an example of cross-sample imputation (292 New Zealand exporters and 302 Finnish ones) the international entrepreneurial orientation data. Three variations of the input data are tested: A) imputation based on all the data available for the measurement model, B) imputation based on the set of items based on the invariance structure of the <b>joint</b> <b>items</b> shared across the two groups, and C) imputation based both on examination of the invariance structures of the <b>joint</b> <b>items</b> and the performance of the measurement model in the group where the full data was originally available. Findings – Based on distribution comparisons imputation for New Zealand after completing the measurement model with Finnish data (Model C) gave the most promising results. Consequently, using knowledge on between country measurement qualities may improve the imputation results, but this benefit comes with a downside since it simultaneously reduces the amount of data used for imputation. None of the imputation models leads to the same statistical inferences about covariances between latent constructs than as the original full data, however. Research limitations / Implications - The present exploratory study suggests that there are several concerns and issues that should be taken into account when planning cross-country cross-surveys. These concerns arising from current study lead us to question the appropriateness of the cross-country cross-survey approach in general although in general advantages exist. Further research is needed to find the best methods. Originality / value – The combination of cross-country and cross-survey approaches is novel to international marketing, and it is not known how the different procedures utilized in imputation affect the results and their validity and reliability. We demonstrate the consequences of the various imputation strategy choices taken by using a real example of a two-country sample.

40|$|The Australian Medical Assessment Collaboration (AMAC) project, {{funded by}} the Office of Learning and Teaching, seeks to provide an {{infrastructure}} and a road map to support collaboration between Australian medical schools in matters of assessment. This may not seem very new perhaps, because there are already several collaborations taking place in Australia, and, typically, they relate to <b>joint</b> <b>item</b> banks, (such as the IDEAL consortium), or joint test administration, (such as the International Foundation of Medicine tests). The AMAC project seeks to build on these existing collaborations in two ways: first, by tying these initiatives together and thus bundling the combined expertise and experiences in road maps, draft agreements and suggestions for governance structures; and, second, by combining joint examination item production and test administration into one. This should enable continuous meaningful quality comparisons between medical schools, with a view on continuous quality improvement. One contentious issue in similar collaborations concerns differences in perceptions {{of the quality of}} test material. Often there are diverse views on what makes a test item high quality or not. This disagreement in views is a serious breakdown risk for collaborations when it cannot be reconciled (Schuwirth, Bosman, Henning, Rinkel 2 ̆ 6 Wenink, 2010). Unfortunately, the determination of ‘quality’ is an inexact science, and the medical education literature does not provide clear-cut answers to questions concerning quality.

This tendency inevitably lead to greater interaction between {{men and women in the}} work situation. Organizations however spend little time and money on programmes addressing the unique career and support needs of the respective genders. Studies of successful women in managerial and professional jobs indicated that "good" mentors were perceived as a valuable asset in their upward mobility. The studies, however, also indicated that specific problems were being experienced in cross-gender mentor relationships. Hence the purpose ofthe study was to deduce the mentorship needs and problems experienced by women from a literature study with the aim to develop suitable instruments by means of which the extent of such needs and problems could be assessed. On the basis of the literature survey, two questionnaires were compiled which on face value respectively addressed the mentorship needs and cross-gender problems experienced in mentor relationships. The questionnaires were administered to 122 female Eskom employees in their early career phase. In the statistical analysis of the data obtained, the NP 50 -programme was mainly used. Both factor analysis as well as item analysis were conducted. The main results of the analysis are as follows: • Both scales (questionnaires) showed reliability coefficients higher than 0, 9 for <b>joint</b> <b>item</b> analysis. • Three factors were identified for the mentorship needs questionnaire (scale 1) being the need for opportunities, the need for protection and the need for sponsorship and support.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Any {{knowledge}} {{that can help}} us influence more people to use condoms saves lives and {{plays a key role}} in arresting the HIV pandemic. My motivation for writing this thesis was to determine whether a change in attitude towards the use of condoms among youths in Zambia had occurred between 1995 and 2003. Evidence from surveys suggests that there has been a positive change in sexual behavior. During the eight year period, data from the same population show a marked increase in the use of condoms, particularly among urban women and in individuals in the population with an above average educational attainment. Unfortunately the changes have not been as great as expected. Therefore knowledge of the change in attitude regarding the use of condoms might give us vital information and have an impact on policy interventions. It was necessary as part of this assessment to explore how well selected aspects of attitude explain the use of condoms, and whether these relationships have changed during the eight year period. METHOD: By analyzing selected attitude-items from three population-based surveys conducted in 1995 (n= 1720), 1999 (n= 1946) and 2003 (n= 2637), I predicted changes in attitude among Zambian youth classified by residence, gender and educational attainment. Analyses of a single item attitude and a <b>joint</b> <b>item</b> attitude were conducted by creating an attitude-index. Further logistic regression was used to examine variables associated with the use of condoms when assessing the association between attitude and behavior. RESULTS: The most important finding in the single attitude-item analysis revealed was that young people have become more skeptical regarding the safety of the condom during this time period. The attitude-index analysis showed that despite a significant increase in the reported use of condoms in the population, the observations indicated no substantial changes in attitudes. The attitudes did not change over time with respect to educational attainment. However, there was a small but significant change among rural women. In addition, regression models indicated that the attitude index towards condom usage was strongly associated with the actual use of condoms. The findings also reveal that the association between attitude and behavior was substantially stronger among young women and in the age group 25 - 49 in the data from the initial survey in 1995 than in the observations eight years later. CONCLUSION: It is alarming that young people have become more skeptical towards the safety of the condom. My recommendation is that the National AIDS council in Zambia organizes all stakeholders to communicate a joint message that is in line with what is the scientific basis, i. e. condoms are safe. The attitude-behavior relationship is far more complicated than most prevention campaigns assume. Both evidence accumulated in this thesis and prevailing theories on attitude-behavior association illustrates this. The existing theories and models, however, are not sufficient to explain the findings in this thesis. We need to develop an interdisciplinary model/theory that can better explain how attitudes influence sexual behavior (and vice versa) on different levels of society. The evidence accumulated in this thesis indicates the importance of monitoring attitude change towards the use of condoms as well as actual behavior change. When monitoring attitudes towards the use of condoms, it is also crucial to include other determinants for the use of condoms on the micro, meso and macro levels. A further recommendation is to generate an “attitude-towards-condom-use scale” that is customized for Zambian youth. That will help us to obtain a broad knowledge of attitude changes among Zambian youth, from which functional guidelines for policy intervention might be constructed. These measures would play a key role in helping to reduce the HIV epidemic...|$|E

We investigated the relationship between joint impairments and upper and lower limb function. Methods: Twenty-one children with systemic JIA with an average age of 9. 2 years and a mean disease duration of 4. 8 years participated in this study. Joint impairments were assessed by the following variables: joint counts on swollen (JCS) and tender (JCT) joints and the loss of joint motion as determined by the Joint Alignment and Motion scale (JAM). Functional performance and functional ability were determined by the Juvenile Arthritis Functional assessment Scale (JAFAS) and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ), respectively. The relationship between impairments and functional disabilities was studied at the level of (1) the complete instruments, (2) upper and lower limb function separately, and (3) the individual <b>joints</b> and <b>items.</b> Results: Regarding complete instruments, the Spearman rank correlation between functional disabilities and loss of joint motion as moderate to good (JAN/CHAQ rs = 0. 66, JAM/JAFAS rs = 0. 77). A fair correlation was found between functional disabilities and the joint count on swollen joints (JCS/CHAQ rs = 0, 45, JCS/JAFAS rs - 0, 52), but no significant relationship was found with the number of tender joints (JCT/CHAQ rs - 0, 02, p> 0, 05, and JCT/JAFAS rs = 0, 14, p> 0, 05).

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{evaluate}} the reproducibility of commonly used radiographic measures in hip and knee OA and to overcome certain limits of existing knowledge on their reliability from previous studies. Design: Three readers evaluated 100 hip joints (50 pelvic X-rays) and 100 antero-posterior and lateral knee films of a hospital-based sample {{of patients with}} radiographic OA at two time points 3 months apart. They retrospectively estimated the presence and severity of joint specific individual radiographic features (osteophyte formation and joint space narrowing at different sites, cysts, subchondral sclerosis, bony deformity and chondrocalcinosis) and two different overall scores. Within and between observer reproducibility was calculated by intra-class correlation coefficient. Results: At the hip joint excellent intra- as well as inter-observer reliability for superior joint space narrowing (JSN) and femoral head deformity could be demonstrated, while the assessment of medial JSN, osteophytes and acetabular sclerosis depends {{on the level of}} the investigator’s experience. At the knee joint, femorotibial and patellofemoral osteophytes showed a high intra- and inter-observer reliability. Grading of JSN is highly reader dependent; rating of subchondral sclerosis and chondrocalcinosis {{does not seem to be}} reproducible enough. The overall scores showed an excellent reproducibility both at hip and knee joints.

40|$|Understanding {{the issues}} {{surrounding}} decision making about medication treatments {{has important implications}} for public health, including improving the quality of care for patients with chronic conditions. This dissertation examines medication decisions in one chronic condition, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chapter one introduces the context of decision making about medications in RA. Guidelines recommend treating RA to the target (T 2 T) of low disease activity (LDAS) with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). T 2 T requires regularly monitoring for moderate/high disease activity (MHDAS), and adjusting DMARDs at least every 3 months until the patient reaches LDAS. The chapter provides background on the challenges of implementing T 2 T, and summarizes chapters two through four. Chapter two addresses delays in DMARD adjustment for patients with MHDAS. Survival analysis is used to examine the extent of delays in DMARD adjustments and whether delayed DMARD adjustment leads to delayed LDAS. Forty percent of RA patients with persistent MHDAS wait longer than 3 months to receive DMARD adjustment, and timely DMARD adjustment is associated with reaching LDAS sooner. There may be a need to reduce delays in DMARD therapy adjustment for many patients. Chapter three examines patients’ perspectives on medication decisions, exploring how feelings in response to events and information motivate decisions to accept or resist medications. Patients’ feelings towards the benefits and dangers of medications, their identity as an ill person, the act of taking medication, and the decision process itself affect willingness to accept medications. Awareness of feelings motivating resistance to taking medications may allow physicians to better support patients confronting threatening information and difficult treatment decisions. Chapter four compares patient joint assessments with physician joint assessments to examine their suitability for disease activity monitoring between visits. Although agreement on <b>joint</b> assessment <b>items</b> is modest, agreement on detection of MHDAS is better. Patient joint assessments may be useful for disease monitoring between visits, potentially reducing delays to DMARD adjustment. This dissertation provides a multi-level view of treatment guideline implementation in RA.

Results: Information from the debriefing interview, factor analysis and item response theory analysis resulted in the removal of one item (QLQ-ELD 15 →QLQ-ELD 14) and revision of the proposed scale structure to five scales (mobility, worries about others, future worries, maintaining purpose and illness burden) and two single <b>items</b> (<b>joint</b> stiffness and family support). Convergent validity was good. In known-group comparisons, the QLQ-ELD 14 differentiated between patients with different disease stage, treatment intention, number of comorbidities, performance status and geriatric screening scores. Test–retest and RCA analyses were equivocal. Conclusion: The QLQ-ELD 14 is a validated HRQOL questionnaire for cancer patients aged ⩾ 70 years. Changes in elderly patients’ self-reported HRQOL may be related to both cancer evolution and non-clinical events...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} significance of serial measurements of serum matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP- 3) levels {{in relation to}} markers of disease activity and radiological progression in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. In a 3 year prospective study of 33 patients with early RA (symptoms < 1 year at entry) monthly measurements of serum MMP- 3 were transformed into time integrated values for 6 month periods for comparison with other markers of disease activity like swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), Ritchie articular index (RAI), the disease activity score (DAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and radiological progression, scored according to Sharp's method, in which erosions and joint space narrowing are scored separately and combined to a total Sharp score. Results. Significant correlations were found between serum MMP- 3 and SJC, ESR, and CRP during all periods and between 6 and 30 months with the DAS. There were no correlations between serum MMP- 3 and TJC or the RAI. During the first 12 months serum MMP- 3 was correlated only with the <b>item</b> <b>joint</b> space narrowing of the Sharp score. After 12 months of followup it was also correlated with the total Sharp score and after 18 months it was correlated with all 3 items of the Sharp score. There was a wide interindividual variation in the relation between serum MMP- 3 and radiological progression but intraindividually this relation seemed to be rather constant. Conclusion. Time integrated values of serum MMP- 3 are correlated with time integrated values of other markers of disease activity such as joint swelling, ESR, CRP, and the DAS. Of the radiological scores, as outcome measures, especially joint space narrowing correlated closely with cumulative serum MMP- 3...|$|R
40|$|Published online 18 July 2013 Background: Older people {{represent}} {{the majority of}} cancer patients but their specific needs are often ignored {{in the development of}} health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-ELD 15 was developed to supplement the EORTC’s core questionnaire, the QLQ-C 30, for measuring HRQOL in patients aged 470 years in oncology studies. Methods: Patients (n¼ 518) from 10 countries completed the QLQ-C 30, QLQ-ELD 15 and a debriefing interview. Eighty two clinically stable patients repeated the questionnaires 1 week later (test–retest analysis) and 107 others, with an expected change in clinical status, repeated the questionnaires 3 months later (response to change analysis, RCA). Results: Information from the debriefing interview, factor analysis and item response theory analysis resulted in the removal of one item (QLQ-ELD 15 -QLQ-ELD 14) and revision of the proposed scale structure to five scales (mobility, worries about others, future worries, maintaining purpose and illness burden) and two single <b>items</b> (<b>joint</b> stiffness and family support). Convergent validity was good. In known-group comparisons, the QLQ-ELD 14 differentiated between patients with different disease stage, treatment intention, number of comorbidities, performance status and geriatric screening scores. Test–retest and RCA analyses were equivocal. Conclusion: The QLQ-ELD 14 is a validated HRQOL questionnaire for cancer patients aged X 70 years.

30|$|Following expectancy-value theory, {{we assumed}} that test-takers would make {{disengaged}} responses depending on their (perceived) cognitive skill and (perceived) item difficulty, which together determine the expected task success. The obtained findings support this hypothesis of informed disengagement. Specifically, the negative interaction between cognitive skill and item difficulty suggests that relative item difficulty helps determine disengagement. That is, poor test-takers encountering more difficult items {{are more likely to}} become disengaged than strong test-takers. Interpreting the results in this way requires test-takers to be able to evaluate the difficulty of an item relatively quickly, that is, below the response time threshold. This {{raises the question of whether}} the interpretation of informed disengagement is compatible with defining disengaged responses as relatively quick (non-)responses. For sure, empirically there may be a portion of test-takers who simply rush through the test without any strategic reflection about their probability of success. However, we define the threshold as the shortest response time where the conditional probability of success first exceeds chance level. This means that it may take (almost) as much time to try to solve an item before finally judging it to be too difficult as it does to complete it correctly. Further research is needed to justify the interpretation of informed disengagement. For instance, future studies could conduct cognitive interviews after administering a test on a (sub)sample of test-takers to learn more about the decision processes resulting in disengagement. From a test-taker’s perspective, informed disengagement can be regarded as an efficient test-taking strategy as long as the test-taker’s perceptions of his or her ability and item difficulty are correct. Modelling approaches for intentional omissions (Mislevy and Wu 1996), that is, models of the <b>joint</b> distribution of <b>item</b> response and disengagement, can be applied to investigate the relations between the model-predicted correctness of an item response and disengaged responding. If the relationship is strong, disengaged responses carry information about the to be estimated competence level.|$|R
