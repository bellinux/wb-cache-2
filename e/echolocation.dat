5|$|<b>Echolocation</b> {{probably}} first derived in bats from communicative calls. The Eocene bats Icaronycteris and Palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptations suggesting {{an ability}} to detect ultrasound, implying they used <b>echolocation.</b> This {{may have been used}} at first mainly for communicative purposes or for mapping out their surroundings during their gliding phase, only being used for hunting insects while foraging on the ground or among vegetation. After the adaptation of flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey. Bats may have evolved <b>echolocation</b> through a shared common ancestor, in which case it was then lost in the Old World fruit bats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, <b>echolocation</b> evolved independently in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera lineages.|$|E
5|$|It has {{recently}} been determined that the <b>echolocation</b> vocalizations {{do not agree with}} evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison. This suggests that as in bats, <b>echolocation</b> sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and independently to the particular species' acoustic environment.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Microchiroptera and uses <b>echolocation.</b> <b>Echolocation</b> is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. <b>Echolocation</b> allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With <b>echolocation,</b> bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark. The greater noctule bat has keen hearing and sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|As a sensory adaptation, <b>echolocation</b> {{has evolved}} {{separately}} in cetaceans (dolphins and whales) and bats, {{but from the}} same genetic mutations.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{have also}} taken flight, {{and along with}} {{cetaceans}} have developed <b>echolocation</b> or sonar.|$|E
5|$|Sweden: The {{species was}} {{recorded}} at five {{sites in the}} south of the country, starting in 2008, on the basis of <b>echolocation</b> calls.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that brown rats use ultrasound for <b>echolocation.</b> The frequencies heard by rodents differ between species. The table below shows the hearing ranges of several species.|$|E
5|$|Ripred: A gnawer (rat) {{with deadly}} {{fighting}} skills and intelligence; Vikus asks {{him to help}} the quest group into the rats' domain. Ripred in the later books teaches Gregor {{to learn how to}} use <b>echolocation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use <b>echolocation</b> primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses <b>echolocation</b> while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E
5|$|What distinguishes Aerodramus swiftlets {{from other}} swifts, and indeed almost all other birds, is {{their ability to}} use a simple but {{effective}} form of <b>echolocation.</b> This enables them to navigate within the breeding and roosting caves.|$|E
5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use <b>echolocation,</b> but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on <b>echolocation</b> for navigation and finding prey.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid <b>echolocation.</b> Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|Atop the whale's skull is {{positioned}} a large complex of organs {{filled with a}} liquid mixture of fats and waxes called spermaceti. The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds, which the sperm whale uses for <b>echolocation</b> and communication.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{appear to}} {{communicate}} vocally, through grunts and bellows, {{and they may}} practice <b>echolocation,</b> but {{the purpose of these}} vocalizations is currently unknown. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond above and under water. Hippos will also express threat and alarm with exhalations.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated <b>echolocation</b> abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are intelligent, {{with some}} {{possessing}} large brains, self-awareness and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and <b>echolocation.</b> Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies, but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.|$|E
5|$|The <b>echolocation</b> {{call of the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{contrasts}} with all other Australian molossid bats in that it displays a strongly frequency modulated search phase pulse. The bristle-faced free-tailed bat also has the highest mean characteristic frequency (36 kHz) of any Australian Mormopterus.|$|E
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} is a {{prominent}} user of <b>echolocation</b> and communication, with vocalization {{as loud as}} 230 decibels (re 1 µPa at 1 m) underwater. It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live for more than 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>echolocation</b> {{was once}} used to {{separate}} Aerodramus {{from the other}} non-echolocating cave swiftlet genera Collocalia and Hydrochous (virtually nothing is known about Schoutedenapus). However, recently, the pygmy swiftlet, Collocalia troglodytes, was discovered making similar clicking noises {{both inside and outside}} its roosting cave.|$|E
5|$|This is a taxonomically {{difficult}} {{group of}} very similar species. <b>Echolocation,</b> DNA sequencing and parasitic lice {{have all been}} used to establish relationships, but some problems, such as {{the placement of the}} Papuan swiftlet are not fully resolved. These swiftlets can pose major identification problems where several species occur.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape. Other examples {{include the use of}} <b>echolocation</b> for hunting in low light conditions— which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in pelicans, that enable engulfment feeding.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as <b>echolocation</b> is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat <b>echolocation.</b> Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|In low-duty cycle <b>echolocation,</b> bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in <b>echolocation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many arctiid moths make clicks when hunted by echolocating bats; {{they also}} often contain {{unpalatable}} chemicals. Some such as dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera) have ears and conspicuous coloration, {{and start to}} make clicks when echolocating bats approach. An experiment by Canadian zoologists John M. Ratcliffe and James H. Fullard, using dogbane tiger moths and northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis), suggests the signals in fact both disrupt <b>echolocation</b> and warn of chemical defence. The behaviour of these insects is thus both deimatic and aposematic.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat <b>echolocation.</b> These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their <b>echolocation,</b> {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the vestibular organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which movements were commanded, and optic flow, where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as <b>echolocation</b> and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The hippocampus is {{the part of the brain}} that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} animal can {{integrate}} cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the earth's magnetic field or from the sky) to identify {{where they are and}} so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including olfaction and <b>echolocation</b> may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2001 {{discovery}} of a single individual in Myanmar, at least nine separate sites {{have been identified in}} the limestone outcrops of the Dawna and Karen Hills outside the Thanlwin, Ataran, and Gyaing Rivers of Kayin and Mon States. The Thai and Myanmar populations are morphologically identical, but their <b>echolocation</b> calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.|$|E
5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat (Mormopterus eleryi), {{previously}} {{known as}} the hairy-rostrum or hairy-nosed freetail bat, is a small insectivorous bat {{that is the only}} member of the molossid sub-genus Setirostris. The bristle-faced free-tailed bat differs from all other bats in the Family Molossidae by possessing unique dentition, a distinctive <b>echolocation</b> call, diagnostic genital and glans penis morphology and small body size. It is readily distinguished from other Mormopterus species by the presence of characteristic stout bristles on the muzzle and face.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids {{may be explained by}} the {{difference in}} their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use <b>echolocation</b> to find prey.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on <b>echolocation</b> that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, <b>echolocation</b> also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes {{appeared before the}} first radiation in the late Oligocene. Eomysticetus {{and others like it}} showed no evidence in the skull of <b>echolocation</b> abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had blowholes located halfway up the dorsal side of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they are thought to have had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E
5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using <b>echolocation</b> signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
