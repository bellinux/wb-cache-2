Seventeen case-patients were compared with 3 groups of controls: members of case-patient households(household controls), members of neighboring households(near controls), and members of randomly selected households ≥ 24 km away (far controls). Investigators trapped more small rodents at case households than at near (P =. 03) or far control households(P =. 02). After the number of small rodents was controlled for,case-patients {{were more likely than}} household controls to <b>hand</b> <b>plow</b> (odds ratio [OR], 12. 3; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 1 - 143. 0) or to clean feed storage areas (OR, 33. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 7 - 666. 0). Case-patients were more likely than near controls to plant(OR, 6. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 34. 0) and more likely than far controls to clean animal sheds(OR, 11. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 4 - 103. 0).

50|$|Centerfield is an 1860s {{offshoot}} of Gunnison that evolved two miles south on US 89. Gunnison Field or Gunnison South {{was a natural}} site for farmers who worked small “squatters rights” plots of about five acres with oxen and <b>hand</b> <b>plows.</b> After the Indian troubles subsided, log and adobe houses began to appear. A late 1876 petition to ‘build a school convenient to our location’ was an early sign of independence from the mother colony. In 1882 a log cabin was built to serve as school, church and social hall. The 1886-87 church was built of stone and a front tower was added in 1897. Community spirit was strong by that time, and Canute Peterson chose a committee of four who named the place for its location in the fields between Gunnison and Axtell.|$|R

Utilizing the [...] "best improvements in farm machinery" [...] owned by Colonel Dent, field <b>hands</b> <b>plowed,</b> sowed and reaped the wheat, oats, Irish potatoes, and Indian corn grown on the estate. Slaves also cared for the orchards and gardens, harvesting the fruits and vegetables for consumption by all {{who lived on the}} property. During Grant's management of the farm he worked side by side with Dan, one of the slaves given to Julia at birth. Grant, along with Dan and other slaves, felled trees and took firewood by wagon to sell to acquaintances in St. Louis. More than 75 horses, cattle, and pigs required daily attention, while grounds maintenance and numerous remodeling projects on the main house and outbuildings utilized the skills of those in servitude.|$|R

40|$|Northern Utah rangelands {{have become}} infested with dyers woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) and control is needed. Mechanical and {{chemical}} control on rangelands produce undesirable effects. A possible alternative is biological control, but {{information is not}} available on plant response to this control method. This autecological study and simulation of control methods examined dyers woad phenology, seed endurance and response to simulated grazing, <b>hand</b> rogueing and <b>plowing.</b> The phenology study documented dyers woad growth patterns from May 1982 to November 1983. During the first year, 65 percent of the seedlings died while the remaining 35 percent grew rosette leaves. During the following growing season, 50 percent of the remaining population flowered and died. The other 50 percent continued to grow rosette leaves. The seed endurance study showed seed viability remaining high and relatively stable, but germination decreased during the ten month study period. Methods used indicate future germination and viability studies should more closely simulate field conditions. The simulation of control methods involved clipping dyers woad once at three different heights to simulate grazing, <b>hand</b> rogueing and <b>plowing</b> on three different dates that correspond with the phenological stages of initial rosette growth, pre-bolting, and post-bolting. Simulated grazing stimulated plant survival and growth. Simulated <b>plowing</b> and <b>hand</b> rogueing reduced plant survival. Treatment at all three levels after initial rosette growth depressed flowering for one year. Treatment to simulate <b>plowing</b> and <b>hand</b> rogueing during initial rosette growth depressed flowering compared to the untreated controls. Treatment early in the growing season did not significantly affect plants receiving simulated grazing. Seed production was depressed by simulated plowing but was promoted by simulated hand rogueing when compared to untreated controls. The ability of plants to survive and/or flower after treatment could not be predicted from this study because a one time clipping of dyers woad did not produce significant population decreases. A more severe treatment {{in the form of}} more clippings per season is suggested for future study...|$|R
