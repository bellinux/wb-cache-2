For these cycles {{to have been}} created, the {{environment}} {{at the site of}} deposition must have changed radically from marine to deltaic, then lagoonal and then continental environments. One cause of sea level change is the advance or retreat of continental glaciers caused by climate change. Tectonic movements can affect the environment of deposition by changing water depth. Allocyclic cycles can extend over great distances and are not limited to a single depositional basin. Metric sedimentary carbonate cycles could be related to an astronomical (Milankovitch) precession influence (through thermic dilatation of oceans ?) on an estimated 20.000 years scale, according to numerous authors interpretations.

Post-glacial fracture {{systems of the}} Thingvellir rift segment of the West Volcanic Zone (WVZ) and interaction with holocene lava flow overlapping are analysed in detail in this paper. We mapped 5390 fractures at metric to <b>kilometric</b> <b>scales</b> in order to realise a precise structural map, a representative fault length distribution analysis and some statistical calculations in terms of fault length/number growth rates from Holocene to recent time. Mapping and 3 -D geometrical analysis of faults and fissures are based on use of photogrammetric techniques, GPS positioning at ground control points and validation from geological field work. This approach allowed us to measure the vertical throw distribution along 52 faults with a precision around 0. 5 - 1 m. Most of these faults have symmetric serrated fault-displacement profiles; however {{some of them have}} profiles offset to the north or south. Fault vertical offset {{as a function of the}} age of the hosting lava flows are presented too. Finally, from the study of 70 transverse topographic profiles and the fault offset analysis, we propose a propagation model for Holocene fissure development, partly controlled by Pleistocene tectonic inheritance. Our model takes into special account alternating volcanic events and faulting. Simple fissure zones with small hangingwall monocline or more complex scarp zones with graben and larger hangingwall monocline developed. Because of lava flow accumulation during the rift extension, estimating the amount of extension based on the present-day morphology would have led to severe under-evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Resulting {{from the}} interplay between {{tectonics}} and eustatism, reef terraces are powerful markers of vertical movements at a scale of 1000 to 100, 000 years. In the Lesser Antilles, they grow around every island of the archipelago and record both local and subduction-related tectonics. The recent acquisition and interpretation of very high-resolution bathymetry of Les Saintes submarine plateau, French West Indies, together with seismic reflection profiles, are {{a unique opportunity to}} study one of these submarine structures, at metric to <b>kilometric</b> <b>scales,</b> addressing the questions of its nature, age and growth environment but also of the control of active tectonics on its formation. The 20 km wide Les Saintes reef plateau lies at about 45 mbsl. It is crosscut by NW-SE striking, north-dipping normal faults that belong to Les Saintes fault system and graben, which produced a Mw 63 earthquake in 2004. The plateau is composed of four 20 m thick reef units, piled up in "layer cake" morphology down to 110 mbsl. The upper unit has a fresh morphology and presents typical reef features, like barrier and lagoon, spurs and grooves, pinnacles, etc. From its morphology we propose that it grew during the Holocene last transgression. Below, the three other units likely formed during Pleistocene sea level highstands and were eroded during the low stands, as evidenced in seismic reflection profiles. This scenario would imply that Les Saintes plateau formed in a context of subsidence with a rate we evaluate to be of the order of tenths of mm/yr. Probably linked to local tectonics, we believe that this deformation is also related to plate-scale subduction processes, similarly to deformations occurring on the other islands of the Guadeloupe archipelago...|$|R

40|$|The variational {{formulation}} of Bayes' theorem allows inferring CO 2 {{sources and sinks}} from atmospheric concentrations at much higher space-time resolution than the ensemble approach or the analytical one. However, it usually exhibits limited scalable parallelism. This limitation hinders global atmospheric inversions operated on decadal time scales and regional ones with <b>kilometric</b> spatial <b>scales,</b> because of the computational cost of the underlying transport model {{that has to be}} run at each iteration of the variational minimization. Here, we introduce a Physical Parallelisation (PP) of variational atmospheric inversions. In the PP, the inversion still manages a single physically and statistically consistent window, but the transport model is run in parallel overlapping sub-segments in order to massively reduce the computation wall clock time of the inversion. For global inversions, a simplification of transport modelling is described to connect the output of all segments. We demonstrate the performance of the approach on a global inversion for CO 2 with a 32 -yr inversion window (1979 – 2010) with atmospheric measurements from 81 sites of the NOAA global cooperative air sampling network. In this case, we show that the duration of the inversion is reduced by a seven-fold factor (from months to days) while still processing the three decades consistently and with improved numerical stability...|$|R
40|$|International audience—The spatial {{resolution}} of thermal infrared (TIR) instruments {{is often not}} sufficient for many applications, but this low resolution is counterbalanced by the high temporal resolution (for example the SEVIRI instrument onboard the European Meteosat 8 and 9 presents a {{spatial resolution}} of 3 km × 3 km at nadir and a temporal resolution of 15 mn). At <b>kilometric</b> <b>scales,</b> the observed pixel is generally heterogeneous in terms of land cover, and the temperatures of the different components may present large discrepancies. This paper presents a methodology to infer the temperatures of the various land cover/use classes composing a mixed pixel, from a whole pixel measurement. To infer intra-pixel temperature, information on the mixture within each low resolution pixel, e. g., the proportions of the land cover types derived from high spatial resolution imaging, account for a first constraint. However, {{in the absence of}} supplementary constraints, the number of unknown variables is greater than the number of measurements, and there is not uniqueness of the solution. Thus, we propose {{to take advantage of a}} priori knowledge provided by a land surface model (LSM), and of the temporal and spatial correlation features of the surface temperature. We propose a new down-scaling method for estimating sub pixel signal. It applies to TIR data and: the inversion procedure provides as a result, the land surface temperature (LST) temporal series of each land cover/use class (called endmember) constituting the coarse resolution pixel. Three kinds of a priori information have been introduced, namely 1) a first guess subpixel temperature derived from the SEtHyS LSM; 2) a Markov Random Chain model of the surface temperature temporal dependencies from times t to t + 1; 3) a Markov Random Field model of the spatial dependencies between end-member temperatures. Then, the " Maximum A Posteriori " esti-mator provides the most likely endmember temperatures, given 1) the observed coarse resolution temperatures, 2) the composition of the pixels in terms of " land cover/land use, " and 3) the LSM first guess subpixel temperature values, 4) the a priori spatial and temporal Markov models. The performance of this new method has been first evaluated on simulated data (random Gaussian variables with means equal to endmember temperatures simulated using LSM). The method accuracy versus the observation errors and the number of endmembers was analyzed. The algorithm was).

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{studying}} {{the quality of}} the sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieved from soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) data in coastal areas. These areas are characterized by strong and variable SSS gradients [several practical salinity units (psu) ] on relatively small scales: the extent of river plumes is highly variable, typically at <b>kilometric</b> and daily <b>scales.</b> Monitoring this variability from SMOS measurements is particularly challenging because of their resolution (typically 30 - 100 km) and because of the contamination by the nearby land. A set of academic tests was conducted with a linear coastline and constant geophysical parameters, and more realistic tests were conducted over the Bay of Biscay. The bias of the retrieved SSS has been analyzed, as well as the root mean square (rms) of the bias, and the retrieved SSS compared to a numerical hydrodynamic model in the semirealistic case. The academic study showed that the Blackman apodization window provides the best compromise in terms of magnitude and fluctuations of the bias of the retrieved SSS. Whatever the type of vegetation cover, a strong negative bias, greater than 1 psu, was found when nearer than 36 km from the coast. Between 44 and 80 km, the type of vegetation cover has an impact of less than a factor 2 on the bias, and no influence further than 80 km from the coast. The semirealistic study conducted in the Bay of Biscay showed a bias over ten days lower than 0. 2 psu for distances greater than 47 km, due to an averaging over various geometries (coastline orientation, swath orientation, etc.). The bias showed a weak dependence on the location of the grid point within the swath. Despite the noise on the retrieved SSS, contrasts due to the plume of the Loire River and the Gironde estuary remained detectable on ten-day averaged maps with an rms of 0. 57 psu. Finally, imposing thresholds on the major axis of the measurements brought little improvement to the bias, whereas it increased the rms and- could lead to strong swath restriction: a 49 -km threshold on the major axis resulted in an effective swath of 800 - 900 km instead of 1200 km...|$|R

This paper presents the new structural mapping results of the Matomb-Makak area (western part of the Pan-African Yaoundé series), based on the combined field survey and satellite image processing methods. The study area is characterized by dense forest vegetation with difficult access, scarcity and discontinuity of the available outcrops. As a consequence, geological mapping {{in this type of}} environment is difficult, time-consuming, expensive, and even dangerous and not accurate. During the field work, 280 outcrops have been investigated in which five main lithological units have been distinguished. In order to identify the foliation trajectories and the fractures network of <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale,</b> the techniques of remote sensing were used. The processing of SRTM data led to the detection of linear anomalies. These anomalies have been verified and validated to structural map on the basis of field data. The analysis of the structural map indicates: (1) two directions of S 2 foliation (NE-SW major direction, locally folded and NW-SE secondary direction), (2) one family of faults trending NW-SE which locally displace the foliation, (3) a ductile shear zone with NNE-SSW trends which deflects the S 2 foliation. The two directions of foliation observed in the Matomb-Makak area as well as the NW-SE direction of fault are similar to those observed in the Yaoundé series by other authors.

Within one century on Spitsbergen, valley glaciers have retreated up to one kilometre from their original terminus as of 1918, affecting several hundred hectares of two types of landscape processes: plant colonization and paraglacial morphogenesis. Since these processes are limited to the chronological position of the old ice-front it is possible to know the rate of plant colonization by both qualitative and quantitative means, as well as speculate on the processes involved, such as the effects of runoff. The present study is limited to the Midtre Lovénbreen forefield (latitude 79 °N, longitude 12 °E), where geomorphologic and floristic samples were collected in 2003. On stable deposits in this area, the settlement and the evolution of floristic groups have been documented. During this time period of colonization, the plain areas are reworked by runoff at a <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale,</b> and are characterized as similar to their surrounding biogeographic landscapes. Thus, a relationship can be observed between the paraglacial process occurring in the proglacial forelands and surrounding stable surfaces on till deposits. These features that occur as spatial discontinuities across the landscape are perceptible through either plant colonization or disturbance to vegetation caused by hydrological processes. Ultimately, however, runoff dynamics maintain pioneer vegetation groups which are superimposed on plant colonization that are driven by temporal periods of deglaciation. Differences in the rates and the nature of plant colonization are biomarkers of paraglacial dynamics...|$|E

During the fi rst tectonic phase east verging F 1 folds with axial plane foliation developed under very low grade metamorphic conditions, as highlighted by illite and chlorite cristallinity data. The main stacking of the nappe pile occurred during the fi rst tectonic phase. The further tectonic evolution is characterized by the development of thrusts, associated with East verging shear zones, that led to the emplacement of three tectonic complexes, each one made by the superposition of three different tectonic units that from top to bottom are “Collelungo Unit”, “Vacchereccia Unit” and “Monti dell’Uccellina Unit”.

Optical distortions, film deformation, scanning errors, or errors in viewing parameters can yield metric bias at wavelength larger than 1 km. Offset field at shorter wavelength is more reliable and mainly affected by temporal decorrelation of the images induced by changes in radiometry with time. Temporal decorrelation and resulting uncertainty on offsets are estimated locally from the correlation degree between the images. Relative surface displacements are measured independently every about 15 m and with uncertainty typically below 10 cm (RMS). The offset field reveals most of the surface ruptures mapped in the field. The fault slip is accurate to about 7 cm (RMS) and measured independently every 200 m from stacked profiles. Slip distribution compares well with field measurements at the <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale</b> but reveals local discrepancies suggesting that deformation is generally, although not systematically, localized on the major fault zone located in the field. This type of data can provide useful insight into the fault zone's mechanical properties. Our measurements indicate that elastic coseismic strain near the fault zone can be as large as 0. 5 × 10 ^(− 3), while anelastic yielding was attained for strain in excess of about 1 – 2 × 10 ^(− 3) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of human populations and natural systems {{and their ability}} to adapt to extreme events and climate change vary with geographic regions and populations. Regional climate models (RCM), composed by an atmospheric component coupled to a land surface scheme and driven over ocean areas by prescribed sea surface temperature, have been developed to produce fine scale regional climate change information useful for impact assessment and adaptation studies. Although RCM can be sufficient for many applications, the Earth system is composed of the physical, chemical, biological, and social components, processes, and interactions that together determine the state and dynamics of Earth, including its biota and human occupants. Developing regional Earth system models has thus two primary motivations: (1) with respect to climate science, to improve modeling capabilities and better understand coupled processes at regional scales and (2) to support stakeholders who aim to use climate information for regionally-specific impact assessment and adaptation planning. IPSL in collaboration with ENSTA-ParisTech, LOPB, and CERFACS developed the MORCE (Model of the Regional Coupled Earth system) platform for process and climate studies of the regional Earth system. The original aspects of the MORCE platform are (1) the integration {{of a large number of}} coupled compartments and processes (physical and biogeochemical processes in the ocean, atmosphere and continent), (2) the transferability of the numerical platform to different locations in the world, (3) the use of a non-hydrostatic model for the atmospheric module which allows an accurate representation of <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale</b> processes. The present article describes the MORCE platform, detailing its various modules and their coupling and illustrating its potential with results obtained in the Mediterranean region and over the Indian Ocean...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 13 Several analogue modeling {{studies have}} been conducted during the past fifteen years with the 14 aim to discuss the effects of sedimentation and erosion on Foreland Fold and Thrust Belt, 15 among which a few have analyzed these processes at <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale</b> (Nalpas et al., 1999; 16 Barrier et al., 2002; Pichot and Nalpas, 2009). The influence of syn-deformation 17 sedimentation and erosion on the structural evolution of FFTB has been clearly demonstrated. 18 Here, we propose to go further in this approach by the study of a more complex system with a 19 double decollement level. The natural study case is the Bolivian sub-Andean thrust and fold 20 belt, which present all the required criteria, such as the double decollment level. A set of 21 analogue models performed under a CT-scan have been used to test the influence of several 22 parameters on a fold an thrust belt system, among which: (i) the spatial variation of the 23 sediment input, (ii) the spatial variation of the erosion rate, (iii) the relative distribution of 24 2 sedimentation between foreland and hinterland. These experiments led to the following 25 observations: 26 1. The upper decollement level acts as a decoupling level in case of increased 27 sedimentation rate: it results in the verticalization of the shallower part (above the 28 upper decollement level), while the deeper parts are not impacted; 29 2. Similarly, the increase of the erosion rate involves the uplift of the deeper part (below 30 the upper decollement level), whereas the shallower parts are not impacted; 31 3. A high sedimentation rate in the foreland involves an inversion of the vergence 32 followed by a back-thrusting of the shallower part. 33 4. A high sedimentation rate in the hinterland favors thrust development toward the 34 foreland in the shallower parts. 35 3...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA major use of Discrete Fracture Network models (DFN) is to {{evaluate}} permeability and flow structure in hardrock aquifers from geological observations of fracture networks. Although extensively studied, {{there has been}} little interest in the spatial structure of DFN models, generally assumed to be Poissonian, i. e. spatially random. In this paper, we compare the results of Poissonian DFN to new DFN models where fractures result from a growth process defined by simplified rules for nucleation, growth and fracture arrest. This ‘mechanical’ model is characterized by a large proportion of T-intersections, and a distribution of the number of intersections per fracture models from Poissonian DFN. Flow distributions and permeability were calculated for 3 D networks with up to 1, 200 fractures and power-law fracture length distributions. For the same statistical properties in orientation and density, the permeability is significantly smaller in mechanical models than in their Poissonian equivalent, with ratios between 3 and > 10. We estimate flow channeling by calculating the participation ratio of the distribution of flow per fracture (Pf), which gives the number of fractures that carry {{a significant part of the}} flow. Pf is much larger for Poissonian model than for mechanical ones. Moreover we find that permeability scales linearly with Pf, illustrating the close relationship between the geological structure, flow structure, and permeability. In most of hardrock aquifers (illustrated with examples from Sweden), the density of fracture is about a few fractures per meter, while the flow localizes in a few channels at the <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale.</b> There are several reasons why channeling is so extreme, including a large distribution of fracture transmissivities, but this observation also questions the use of Poissonian models in describing the actual fracture network structure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{multiscale}} {{model was}} developed to simulate the rate of landing of a winged insect, the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae F. At a large scale (<b>kilometric</b> <b>scale),</b> it is convenient to use a deterministic model of their dispersion, based upon diffusion-advection-reaction partial derivative equations. At a small scale (hectometric scale), the process of site selection ('landing') is only partially understood, but is known to include the perception of field colour and landscape characteristics. Several hypotheses on aphids' behaviour were tested to simulate the rate of landing: the simulation was done by a cellular automata submodel under five different hypotheses on the precise organisation of the landing behaviour. We found a strong interaction between {{the effect of the}} proportion of wheat crops in the landscape and their spatial organisation. The spatial correlation between the places occupied by wheat crops appears crucial to determine the global rate of landing of the aerial insect stock. The shape of the response surface of landing rate against the proportion of surface occupied by wheat, and the spatial autocorrelation of wheat plots, appears very regular and relatively simple to model by ad hoc mathematical functions. Large scale simulations using the results of the small scale model in a diffusion-reaction equation solved numerically, showed that, on a real landscape extracted from a GIS on the whole Brittany region (western France), the spatial pattern of the aphid landing is sensitive to the hypothesis tested on their landing behaviour. This hierarchical modelling combining two different approaches at two different scales (mathematical deterministic equations on a large multi-kilometric scale, and partly stochastic cellular automata on a small hectometric scale), requires methods to validate its results in the field, in the framework of a decision support system. Such amultiscalemodel has a wide field of application including not only plant protection but also management and conservancy of animal species dispersing by flight...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSaint-Laurent-du-Maroni is {{a border}} town in north-west French Guiana, {{located on the}} Maroni River with a high {{population}} growth(average + 5, 1 % per year). The population is spread in areas far from the city center, with no access to drinking water distributionnetwork. They have water wells equipped with human motorized pump, which often not sufficient {{to comply with the}} population needsand uses. The Sparouine village, with around 800 people, was chosen by the municipality to implement a proper drinking watersupply. According to water consumption, the production should aim minimum 200 m 3 per day. The region is essentially composed of metamorphic staurotide micashist rocks. Dolerite dykes with <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale</b> and quartz veinsintrude also the area. A geophysical prospection with tomography was conducted to implement four prospection cored boreholes. This work has revealed an important structure which cuts three electrical panels,first considered as a dolerite dyke and with noinformation on its draining properties. A cored drilling borehole was then completed to study the geology and aquifer potential of this structure. Finally, the results revealedan important weathering profile at this place, probably due to a deep corridor faults. More than 40 m of clay was first crossed and then 30 m of altered schist, before targeting the fissured hard rock. The cores obtained allowed to see a big density of cracks, veryweathered, showing an important water circulation. Furthermore, no trace of oxidation was found and the presence of calco-pyriteproved that such weathering can appear in reducing environment. Whereas most of the water wells in the West of French Guiana have a production flow around 4 m 3 /h, {{it is likely that the}} future well ofSparouine could reveal a flow rate over 10 m 3 /h, which could enable to reach the production target with one well only.

40|$|The {{geometry}} and kinematic {{development of a}} major syn-metamorphic slide zone, the Central Donegal slide, is described from the Dalradian Succession of Central Donegal, Ireland. The earliest manifestation of this structure is a large scale reversal {{in the direction of}} younging and stratigraphy across the slide plane, a feature that probably developed at the lower greenschist facies of metamorphism. Kinematic indicators associated with this early deformation have been destroyed by later higher metamorphic grade overprinting, but by correlation with other early structures in Donegal, and with reference to sub-basin development in South and Central Donegal it was probably a Grampian thrust with North West directed transport. This tectonic package was then redeformed at lower amphibolite facies by a <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale</b> shear zone associated with slides and large scale sheath folds. Kinematic indicators show that the sheath folds 'intrude' downwards to the south east although originally they are regarded as having faced upwards to the south east. Following this phase of deformation the Dalradian stratigraphy of Central and South Donegal was largely uninverted and probably lay on the upper normal limb (and represents a deeper level) of the upward facing Glenelly Anticline, a major fold to the east in the Sperrin Mountains which is equated with the Tay Nappe. The zone was then reworked during another (mid-amphibolite facies) event during which large scale south facing and verging folds were formed: the Ballybofey Antiformal complex. Earlier formed sheath folds were refolded, slides reactivated and new slides formed. This phase of deformation is associated with major oblique dextral overthrusting, which with increasing metamorphic grade eventually carries the entire Dalradian cover sequence over Moine - like Proterozoic basement 30 km to the south along the Lough Derg slide. This second amphibolite facies metamorphism can be directly associated with the large scale South East directed overthrusting of the entire Dalradian stratigraphy, and related to crustal thickening and loading via the development of a nappe pile towards the south...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExhumation of {{metamorphic}} core complexes {{is accompanied}} by progressive strain localization within large-scale shear zones, which may evolve into long-lived bounding detachments affected by ductile to brittle deformation. Despite the well-studied P-T-t patterns of individual nappes, their relative timing, mode and kinematics of exhumation are debated. In this study, {{in the frame of}} the Mediterranean syn- and post-orogenic deformation, examples of shear zone hierarchization and strain localization from Sifnos and Syros islands (Cyclades, Greece) are documented in detail in order to explain 3 D-geometries and regional kinematics and are here tentatively related to the Ar/Ar ages available in literature. During the Eocene syn-orogenic uplift, the degree of strain localization increases progressively from blue- to green-schists deformation. Some of these shear zones where then reworked during the Oligo-Miocene post-orogenic deformation in different, usually warmer P-T conditions and a new episode of strain localisation, and an evolution toward brittle faulting, either along the main detachments or along newly created faults (as in Sifnos). Such shear zones demonstrate long-lived efficiency, especially where fluid circulation enhance retrograde metamorphic reactions. During Neogene, the final shape and exhumation of domes is the result of crustal thinning and brittle-ductile deformation in the whole Cycladic region. Although stretching directions along individual <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale</b> shear zones may be complex in the details, a simple general picture is shown for the Oligo-Miocene episode, less so for the Eocene one. Most Cycladic islands show a top-to-the-North sense of ductile shear from the syn-orogenic to the post-orogenic stage, this is the case of Sifnos for instance. The syn-orogenic stretching is however often more E-W trending, as exemplified by Syros and Tinos. The top-North or Top-East sense of shear is attributed to the NCDS for the post-orogenic stage and to a syn-orogenic detachment (Vari D.) for the syn-orogenic stage. However the southwestern Cyclades show clear top-South post-orogenic kinematic indicators related to the WCDS, with a complete ductile to brittle evolution. As for the NCDS the WCDS leads to intense ductile deformation in its footwall. To the east of Serifos this ductile top-South sense of shear is lost. Only top-South brittle faults are found in Folegandros and Sifnos where they cut across the older foliation. The complexity of the distribution of shear sense on Syros and Sifnos, both in the ductile and brittle regimes, during the post- and syn-orogenic stages, is discussed in the framework of the transition in time from syn-orogenic exhumation faults to post-orogenic detachments and of the interactions between different sets of detachments, such as the NCDS and the WCDS...|$|E
40|$|The Paleoproterozoic Trans-North China Belt (TNCB) is {{a nearly}} north-south {{trending}} zone, of 1200 km long and 300 km wide, which resulted from collision {{between the two}} Archean eastern and western blocks, marking the amalgamation of the North China Craton. Previous models which account {{for the evolution of}} the belt are mainly based on geochronology, petrology and geochemistry but lack of structural constraints. Field trips in the best-exposed crustal segment of the TNCB – the Lüliang, Hengshan, Wutai and Fuping Complexes - allow us to recognize several tectono-metamorphic units and to define the bulk geometry and kinematics of the belt. We decomposed the TNCB in two main lithological units, called the “Upper Wutai Unit” and the “Lower Wutai Unit”. The first one represents an ancient oceanic crust metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions. The second unit consists of magmatic arc rocks which experienced an amphibolite facies metamorphism. Both units are interpreted as synmetamorphic nappes The Upper Wutai-Lüliang nappe overthrusted to the SE upon the Lower Wutai Unit which one is thrust south-eastward upon the Fuping complex via the <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale</b> Longquanguang Thrust. Deformation related to the Longquanguang Thrust reworked and cross cut the typical dome like structure of the Fuping complex. We think it represents a huge intracontinental ductile flat lying shear zone. Therefore, Hengshan, Wutaishan and Fuping complexes all belong to the same terrane named the Fuping Block. The Lower Wutai Unit and Upper Wutai Unit Nappes are rooted in a suture zone recognized in the western Lüliang massif, which resulted from closure of an oceanic domain (herein called Lüliang ocean) between the Western Block and the Fuping Block. Precise U-Th-Pb chemical EPMA dating on monazite reported on a P-T-t path from a Ky-metapelite allow us to evaluate the timing of peak of metamorphism around 1880 - 1890 Ma. The Lower Wutai Unit is extensively migmatized and crustal melting occurred at 1850 ± 5 Ma as indicated by LA-ICP-MS U/Pb zircon dating of a migmatitic leucosome. Moreover, the Fuping massif shows evidence for a ca. 2100 Ma tectono-metamorphic and magmatic event, which we interpret as resulting from the closure of an oceanic domain (herein called the Taihang ocean), by westward subduction below the Fuping complex Our model involves three Archean blocks, namely from West to East, the Ordos, Fuping and Eastern blocks separated by the Lüliang and Taihang oceans. Closure of the Taihang ocean is responsible for the 2100 Ma event whereas closure of the Lüliang ocean accounts for the 1880 Ma one. Both events are controlled by westward directed subductions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a new model}} for the structural and metamorphic evolution of the Eastern Elba Nappe Stack (EENS), in the innermost Northern Apennines, Central Italy, based on detailed field mapping and macro and microstructural analysis by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy-dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and the calculation of phase equilibria. The complex tectonic evolution of the orogenic wedge can be conceptualized by a sequence of distinct deformation episodes, referred to sequentially as D 1 through D 6. Although each event is distinct from the others, the dynamic nature of wedges is such that different episodes might be transiently active coevally at different structural levels of the wedge, even mutually overprinting as deeper portions of the system are progressively exhumed toward the surface and shallower domains. This results in complex geometric and overprinting relationships, which can {{make it difficult to}} read and unravel the details of these structural evolutions. D 1 represents an initial phase of underplating in the Eocene Oligocene. It led to a thick accretionary wedge and the development of only recently documented HP-LT blueschist facies metamorphism, scantily preserved on Elba Island. This initial phase was followed by prolonged exhumation during the Late Oligocene Early Miocene during D 2. For the first time, the prolific west-vergent D 2 structures of the EENS are documented and incorporated into a model, explaining the exhumation of the HP-LT assemblage through westward extension as part of a channel flow process during retrograde greenschist facies metamorphism. 	Exhumation was followed by a renewed phase of compression, D 3, from the Early to Middle Miocene, during which eastward out-of-sequence thrusts and pervasive east-vergent isoclinal folding deformed the EENS. The east-vergent folds have been documented at all sizes, ranging from the micro- to <b>kilometric</b> <b>scale,</b> including the previously undescribed Acquadolce Antiform, a kilometric-scale fold in the southern portion of the Acquadolce Unit. 	Gravitational instability led to eastward extension in the Middle Miocene during D 4. After which, a final compressional D 5 stage, characterized by compression lasting from the Late Miocene to the Pliocene occured. The Monte Capanne (8 Ma) and Porto Azzurro (5. 9 - 6. 2 Ma) plutons were emplaced during this phase, and syn-contact metamorphic structures developed. Major D 5 structures include a HT-LP mylonitic belt with east-vergent thrust kinematics causing the juxtaposition of low-grade or non-metamorphic rocks onto the higher-grade Acquadolce Unit along the Capo Norsi Thrust. This was followed during D 5 b by the formation of the world-famous top-to-the-east, low-angle Zuccale Fault (ZF), which until recently has been interpreted as a normal fault. Recent publications and this study indicate that the ZF is actually a thrust, formed during the final phase of compression. 	Finally, during a D 6 phase of Late Pliocene Pleistocene age, uplift and brittle normal faulting affected the EENS, through the formation of new faults and the reactivation of earlier thrust structures. 	The structural and metamorphic evolution of the EENS and innermost Northern Apennines, though complex, reflects the relatively simple processes controlling dynamic and cyclic wedge growth...|$|E
