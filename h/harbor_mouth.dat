500|$|Zähringen {{initially}} used as {{a training}} ship, and was converted into a target ship for torpedo training in 1917. In the mid-1920s, Zähringen was heavily reconstructed and equipped {{for use as a}} radio-controlled target ship. She served in this capacity until 1944, when she was sunk [...] in Gotenhafen by British bombers during World War II. The retreating Germans raised the ship and moved her to the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth</b> where they scuttled her to block the port. Zähringen was broken up in situ in 1949–50.|$|E
2500|$|Operating in the {{supposedly}} inviolable {{waters of the}} Sea of Japan, the wolf pack attacked shipping and made exploratory attempts to enter Japanese harbors. Late on 9 June, Tunny attacked a cargo vessel. One torpedo hit the enemy vessel with a thud but failed to explode, and Tunny discontinued the attack. In the harbor entering phase of the patrol, Tunny closed the breakwater of Etomo Ko to 8,000yards (7.3km) shortly before midnight on 12 June. Town and waterfront lights provided illumination, but no suitable target could be found, and the submarine cleared the harbor before midnight. A few minutes later, Tunny approached within [...] of the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth</b> at Uppuri Wan but discreetly withdrew when searchlights located and then brilliantly illuminated the intruder.|$|E

60|$|Late {{the next}} day he returned, bearing the great chest upon his shoulder, and at sunrise the little vessel worked through the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth</b> and took up her northward journey.|$|R
60|$|He {{jumped down}} as Dick changed his course, and {{they passed a}} spit of surf-washed sand, rounded the last clump of trees, and opened up the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth.</b> The {{sunshine}} fell upon a glaring white and yellow town, and oily water glittered between the wharf and the dark hulls of anchored vessels, but Dick suddenly set his lips. He knew the Danish boat, {{and she was not}} there.|$|E
60|$|A boat {{crossed the}} <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{swinging}} {{up on the}} smooth swell and vanishing when the undulations rolled by. A tug towed a row of barges to an anchored steamer, and the rattle of winches came down the wind. In the background, clouds of dust blew about the coaling wharfs, {{and a string of}} flags fluttered from the staff on the Isleta hill. Barbara beckoned a port-guard and inquired what the signal meant.|$|E
60|$|When {{the white}} turmoil on the reef was close ahead {{she saw a}} break in the rocks. The gap was dark and very narrow; {{spouting}} foam played about its mouth. Wyndham signed to the fisher lad at the mainsheet, blocks rattled, and Red Rose, swerving, listed over until her lee deck was in the foam. Showers of spray blew across her, she was sailing very fast, and Flora knew she would soon be broken on the rocks if Wyndham missed the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Early the {{following}} morning the four within the little cabin by the beach were awakened by the booming of a cannon. Clayton {{was the first to}} rush out, and there, beyond the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth,</b> he saw two vessels lying at anchor.|$|R
25|$|To {{protect the}} harbor of Fornells, the British built a tower {{on the rocky}} {{headland}} overlooking the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth,</b> and a small tower {{on the island of}} Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.|$|R
60|$|A {{light land}} breeze was blowing, {{and the ship}} had been worked through the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth</b> under scant sail, but now that they had cleared the point every {{available}} shred of canvas was being spread that she might stand out to sea as handily as possible.|$|R
60|$|They let {{the matter}} drop, and {{half an hour}} later a white light and a green light crept out of the dark to seawards, and a faint {{throbbing}} grew into the measured beat of a steamer's screw. Then a low, shadowy hull, outlined by a glimmer of phosphorescence, came on towards the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth,</b> and a rocket swept up in a fiery curve and burst, dropping colored lights. A harsh rattle of running chain broke out, the screw splashed noisily for a few moments and stopped, and a launch came swiftly down the harbor.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} few minutes he felt his nerves tingle, but the fort was dark and silent and only the soft splash along the beach broke the stillness. The shadowy {{building}} dropped astern and he turned his glasses upon the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth.</b> Two lights showed where the gunboat lay, and, some distance beyond them, a dim, pulsating radiance glimmered. This marked where the open water swell broke upon the shoals. Grahame hoped that it would cover the Enchantress's luminous wake; besides, the roar of the surf might drown the thud of engines, which carries far on a calm night.|$|E
60|$|The tugs {{looked very}} small; the half-loaded hull they towed to an {{anchorage}} floated high above her proper water-line. Rolling on the languid swell at the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth,</b> she looked huge. Her rusty side {{was like a}} warehouse wall. When she lifted her plates from the water one saw the wet weed shine; higher up it clung, parched and dry, to the red iron, although there were clean belts where the stuff was scraped away. Barbara pictured the exhausted men scraping feebly when the sea was calm and the sun did not touch the vessel's side.|$|E
60|$|It {{was early}} afternoon. Clayton had wandered {{to the point}} at the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth</b> to look for passing vessels. Here he kept a great mass of wood, high piled, ready to be ignited as a signal should a steamer or a sail top the far horizon.|$|R

60|$|Tarzan {{had seen}} the consternation {{depicted}} upon {{the faces of the}} little group as they witnessed the departure of the Arrow; so, as the ship was a wonderful novelty to him in addition, he determined to hasten out to the point of land at the north of the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth</b> and obtain a nearer view of the boat, as well as to learn, if possible, the direction of its flight.|$|R
60|$|She {{went into}} a shop and Dick {{turned back to the}} harbor where he boarded the launch. The boat was loaded deep with coal, the fireman was busy, and soon after the {{provisions}} Dick had bought arrived, steam was up. He took the helm, the engine began to throb, and they glided through the cool shadow along the mole. When they met the smooth swell at the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth</b> the sea blazed with reflected light, and Dick was glad to fix his eyes upon the little compass {{in the shade of the}} awning astern. The boat lurched away across the long undulations, with the foam curling up about her bow and rising aft in a white following wave.|$|E
60|$|The launch {{looked very}} small and dirty when they looked down on her from the wharf, and Jake noted how the surf broke upon {{the end of the}} {{sheltering}} point. Its deep throbbing roar warned him what they might expect when they reached open water, but he went down the steps and helped Dick to tighten some bearing brasses, after which a peon threw down their ropes and the screw began to rattle. With a few puffs of steam from her funnel the launch moved away and presently met the broken swell at the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth.</b> Then her easy motion changed to a drunken lurch and Jake gazed with misgivings at the white-topped seas ahead.|$|E
60|$|The {{need for}} speed was plain. The eastern sky was {{clearing}} and the mist began {{to roll back}} from the coast. Marston saw a belt of surf and shadowy rocks and woods. Ahead, a light marked the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth,</b> but it was some distance off and the gig was a heavy boat for two men to row. Yet they must reach port before day broke, and, gasping and straining, they labored on. After his hasty glance about, Marston saw nothing but Wyndham's back, swinging to and fro in front with a regularity that he must emulate. He felt the bow lift as he dragged the heavy oar through the water; {{then there was a}} faint gurgle, and his heart beat as he swung forward again. His hands blistered and the sweat ran into his eyes.|$|E

"Had the wind," [...] writes he, [...] "(unfortunately) not hauled ahead {{soon after}} leaving the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth,</b> I should {{positively}} have left them; and, indeed, I cannot but think it an unfortunate circumstance for you that it so happened, for the first loss in this instance would, in my opinion, have proved the best, as {{they seem to have}} no idea of the value of property, nor any apparent regard for your interest, although interwoven with their own." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{lands of}} Wellfleet wrap around Wellfleet Harbor, {{extending}} from the main portion of the Cape around the harbor to Jeremy Point. At one time, Wellfleet Harbor included an island known as Billingsgate Island, which sat at the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{to the south of}} the point. Once a flourishing small community with a lighthouse, the island was destroyed by coastal erosion and now exists as a shoal that is exposed at low tide. The Billingsgate shoals are split between Wellfleet and neighboring Eastham. Several other inlets extend inland from the <b>harbor,</b> at the <b>mouth</b> of the Herring River (also called [...] "The Gut"), Duck Creek, Blackfish Creek and Fresh Brook (commonly known as [...] "The Run") which leads to several brooks.|$|R
5000|$|Charlotte Harbor Estuary, {{the second}} largest bay in Florida, {{is located on the}} Gulf of Mexico coast of west Florida, mostly (2/3) in Charlotte County, Florida with the {{remaining}} 1/3 in Lee County.

Charlotte Harbor covers about 270 sq mi (700 km2) ...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy and {{his companions}} sat on the balcony formed by the flat roof of the veranda in front of Jaques’ store. It was a fine evening and a light breeze stirred the dust {{in the streets of}} the wooden town. Beyond the ugly, square-fronted {{buildings}} that straggled down to the wharf, the water lay shining in the evening light, and through a gap the sloop showed up distinctly, riding in the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth.</b> On the other hand, a blaze of crimson burned above the crest of a hill and the ragged pines stood out harshly sharp against the glow. Work was over for the day, and groups of men lounged in chairs on the sidewalks outside the hotels, while here and there a citizen and his family occupied the stoop of his dwelling.|$|E
60|$|An evening or two later, they {{boarded the}} launch {{at the town}} mole. The sea was smooth and glimmered with {{phosphorescence}} {{in the shadow of}} the land, for the moon had not risen far above the mountains. Outside the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth,</b> the liner's long, black hull cut against the dusky blue, the flowing curve of her sheer picked out by a row of lights. Over this rose three white tiers of passenger decks, pierced by innumerable bright points, with larger lights in constellations outside, while masts and funnels ran up, faintly indicated, into the gloom above. She scarcely moved to the lift of the languid swell, but as the undulations passed there was a pale-green shimmer about her waterline that magnified the height to her topmost deck. She looked unsubstantial, rather like a floating fairy palace than a ship, and as the noisy launch drew nearer Jake gave his imagination rein.|$|E
60|$|They {{pushed off}} the dinghy and boarded the steamer. The tide had flowed round her, {{but she would}} not float for an hour or two, and Walthew, sitting on the rail, glanced down the harbor. It was now very dark, but the water had a {{phosphorescent}} gleam. The Enchantress's cable was marked by lambent spangles, and there was a flicker of green fire along the tramp's dark side. Her riding-lights tossed as she swung with the languid swell, and away at the <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth</b> two bright specks pierced the dark. A small gunboat had anchored at dusk, and as the fort had fired a salute she was evidently a foreigner. Walthew felt curious about her nationality, and wondered why she lay where she commanded the entrance instead of mooring near the town. Grahame, however, did not seem disturbed, and they presently sat down to a game of chess in the saloon.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to Pacific ocean service, The Cocopa saw {{action in}} the Korean War {{during the summer of}} 1953. [...] During this period she served off both Korean coasts; in one operation, she towed the HMCS Huron, a Canadian {{destroyer}} that had run aground on the island of Pang Yang-Do, just off the North Korean coast well north of enemy-held Wonsan harbor. [...] At the time of the armistice, she went to Wonsan to aid in the removal of a Marine garrison occupying a small islet at the <b>harbor's</b> <b>mouth.</b> During the Korean War, the USS Cocopa received one battle star for her service.|$|R
50|$|Laid {{out on a}} grid pattern, Alexandria {{occupied}} a stretch of land between the sea {{to the north and}} Lake Mareotis to the south; a man-made causeway, over three-quarters of a mile long, extended north to the sheltering island of Pharos, thus forming a double harbor, east and west. On the east was the main harbor, called the Great Harbor; it faced the city's chief buildings, including the royal palace and the famous Library and Museum. At the Great <b>Harbor's</b> <b>mouth,</b> on an outcropping of Pharos, stood the lighthouse, built c. 280 BC. Now vanished, the lighthouse was reckoned as one of the Seven Wonders of the World for its unsurpassed height (perhaps 460 feet); it was a square, fenestrated tower, topped with a metal fire basket and a statue of Zeus the Savior.|$|R

60|$|I {{have put}} this plate {{last in the}} series, {{thinking}} that the reader {{will be glad to}} rest in its morning quietness, after so much tossing among the troubled foam. I said {{in the course of the}} introduction, that nothing is so perfectly calm as Turner's calmness; and I know very few better examples of this calmness than the plate before us, uniting, as it does, the glittering of the morning clouds, and trembling of the sea, with an infinitude of peace in both. There are one or two points of interest in the artifices by which the intense effect of calm is produced. Much is owing, in the first place, to the amount of absolute gloom obtained by the local blackness of the boats on the beach; like a piece of the midnight left unbroken by the dawn. But more is owing to the treatment of the distant <b>harbor</b> <b>mouth.</b> In general, throughout nature, Reflection and Repetition are peaceful things; that is to say, the image of any object, seen in calm water, gives us an impression of quietness, not merely because we know the water must be quiet in order to be reflective; but because the fact of the repetition of this form is lulling to us in its monotony, and associated more or less with an idea of quiet succession, or reproduction, in events or things throughout nature:--that one day should be like another day, one town the image of another town, or one history the repetition of another history, being more or less results of quietness, while dissimilarity and non-succession are also, more or less, results of interference and disquietude. And thus, though an echo actually increases the quantity of sound heard, its repetition of the notes or syllables of sound, gives an idea of calmness attainable in no other way; hence the feeling of calm given to a landscape by the notes of the cuckoo. Understanding this, observe the anxious doubling of every object by a visible echo or shadow throughout this picture. The grandest feature of it is the steep distant cliff; and therefore the dualism is more marked here than elsewhere; the two promontories or cliffs, and two piers below them, being arranged so that the one looks almost like the shadow of the other, cast irregularly on mist. In all probability, the more distant pier would in reality, unless it is very greatly higher than the near one, have been lowered by perspective so as not to continue in the same longitudinal line at the top,--but Turner will not have it so; he reduces them to exactly the same level, so that the one looks like the phantom of the other; and so of the cliffs above.|$|E
