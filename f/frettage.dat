50|$|Fretting {{decreases}} {{fatigue strength}} of materials operating under cycling stress. This can result in fretting fatigue, whereby fatigue cracks can initiate in the fretting zone. Afterwards, the crack propagates into the material. Lap joints, common on airframe surfaces, are a prime location for fretting corrosion. This {{is also known as}} <b>frettage</b> or fretting corrosion.|$|E

The compressors were monitored by orbit and spectrum analysis for changes from baseline readings. It is found that internal hysteresis {{was the major}} destabilizing force; however, the problem was further complicated by seal lockup at the suction end of the compressor. A coupling lockup problem and a coupling fit problem, which <b>frettage</b> of the shaft, are also considered as contributors to the self excited vibrations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a vibration instability phenomenon experienced in operating high pressure syn gas centrifugal compressors in two Ammonia plants at Qatar Fertiliser Company. The compressors were closely monitored using orbit and spectrum analysis {{to follow up}} changes from baseline readings. Tape recordings of run up and run down data presented {{a clue to the}} cause of the instability, which was later confirmed through physical examination of the rotor assembly. Internal hysteresis was the major destabilizing force. However, the problem was further complicated by seal lock-up at the suction end of the compressor. Also, a coupling lock-up problem and a coupling fit problem, which caused <b>frettage</b> of the shaft, should not be counted out as contributors to the self-excited vibrations...|$|E
