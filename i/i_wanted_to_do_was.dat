He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The last thing <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to defend those peckerwoods. But I just had no choice about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Leaf {{missed his}} second season due to a {{shoulder}} injury suffered 20 minutes into the Chargers' first training camp workout on July 23, 1999. Leaf had surgery to fix a labral tear in his throwing shoulder. During an August training camp, a fan heckled Leaf: [...] "Hey, Ryan, you're the worst draft choice in NFL history. You make Heath Shuler look like an All-Star." [...] Leaf, accompanied by a coach and security guards, walked towards the fan and asked a question. The fan began walking closer to Leaf, and two coaches restrained Leaf, with another Chargers employee saying [...] "No, don't do it, Ryan. Don't do it." [...] Leaf later explained the incident: [...] "...what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> say, 'Hey, look, I've grown up, I'm calm about it, I would like to understand why you would say that about me.'" ...|$|E

Several scenes in The Wind Rises were inspired by Tatsuo Hori's novel , in which Hori wrote about his life experiences with his fiancée before she died from tuberculosis. The female lead character's name, Naoko Satomi, was borrowed from Hori's novel [...] The Wind Rises continues to reflect Miyazaki's pacifist stance, continuing the themes of his earlier works, despite stating that condemning war was not {{the intention of the}} film. The film premiered on July 20, 2013, and received critical acclaim; it was named Animation of the Year at the 37th Japan Academy Prize, and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. It was also commercially successful, grossing ¥11.6 billion (US$110 million) at the Japanese box office, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2013.|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, the last thing <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E

Fasanella himself lamented the decline in the {{relevance}} of his work. [...] "It's over. What <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to paint great big canvases about the spirit we used to have in the movement and then go around the country showing them in union halls. When I started these paintings I had no idea that when they were all finished there wouldn't be any union halls in which to show them." ...|$|E
2500|$|As McMahon later stated, [...] "I {{realised}} what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{work with}} a good synth player [...] – a very good synth player. So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow then I remembered hearing Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush and when I heard he was now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanland."

In 1974, she invited {{him as a}} guest to the holiday home she had built on Mustique. It {{was the first of}} several visits. Margaret described their relationship as [...] "a loving friendship". Once, when Llewellyn left on an impulsive trip to Turkey, Margaret became emotionally distraught and took an overdose of sleeping tablets. [...] "I was so exhausted because of everything", she later said, [...] "that all <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> sleep." [...] As she recovered, her ladies-in-waiting kept Lord Snowdon away from her, afraid that seeing him would distress her further.|$|E

Oprah revealed that Thicke's initial appearance garnered a strong reaction, noting that people called the show {{to say that they}} didn't know he would be on. Oprah explained, [...] "So what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to accommodate {{all of the people who}} missed it the first time...

2500|$|Williams hired {{producer}} Keith Crouch and R group Somethin' for the People to {{work with}} Norwood, and within eight months the team crafted Brandy. A collection of street-oriented rhythm-and-blues with a hip hop edge, whose lyrical content embraced her youthful and innocent image in public, Norwood later summed up the songs on the album as young and vulnerable, stating, [...] "I didn’t really know a lot—all <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> basically sing. You can just tell that it’s a person singing from a genuine place, and also a place of basically no experience. I was singing about being attracted to the opposite sex, but I had no experience behind it." [...] Released in September 1994, the album peaked at number twenty on the U.S. Billboard 200. Critical reaction to Brandy was generally positive, with AllMusic writer Eddie Huffman declaring Brandy [...] "a lower-key Janet Jackson or a more stripped-down Mary J. Blige [...] with good songs and crisp production." [...] Anderson Jones of Entertainment Weekly asserted, [...] "Teen actress Norwood acts her age. A premature effort at best, that seems based on the philosophy 'If Aaliyah can do it, why can't I?'." ...|$|E

To be sure, the sea wasn't very deep here, but it had a bottom, all the same. I was not so good a swimmer as these darkeys, who ducked and dived as if they had been born in the water, but I could swim better than most fellows, and was particularly good at diving. So I determined, if I could get a chance, to go down after some of those things on the coral-reef.|$|E
