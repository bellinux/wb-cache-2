Smaller firms are found to spend higher proportion of their financial resources to compensate their board members. Additionally, firm size and family control play important roles in explaining the relationship between board compensation and firm performance. Further, this study investigates pay-performance sensitivity and reveals that changes in firm value are positively associated with changes in board compensation...|$|R

This reality does force the companies {{to pay more attention}} to social responsibilitiesâ€™ assuming and investment into green innovation, as well as to the field of informationâ€™s communication in a relevant way, which should gather financial, social and environment information.
