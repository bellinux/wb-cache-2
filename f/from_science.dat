5|$|Halos arsenal {{consists}} of weapons <b>from</b> <b>science</b> fiction. The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose, thus making each useful in different scenarios. For example, plasma weapons {{need time to}} cool if fired too rapidly, but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries, whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat, but require reloading and ammunition. In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games, Halo players may carry only two weapons at once, calling for strategy when managing firearms.|$|E

Actions that can be performed while on EVA include repairing landing legs, wheels, and solar panels. Kerbals can also collect material <b>from</b> <b>science</b> experiments, allowing them to bring back data without carrying unwieldy parts or risking destruction of the product during atmospheric entry.|$|E

To compensate for the limitations of the human body, the jet pack must accommodate for all factors of flight such as lift and stabilization.|$|E
