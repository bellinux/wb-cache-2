50|$|All {{versions}} of the engine consist of two sections {{that can be easily}} separated for maintenance: a gas generator supplies hot gas to a free power turbine. The starter has to accelerate only the gas generator, making the engine easy to start, particularly in cold weather. Air enters the gas-generator through an <b>inlet</b> <b>screen</b> into the low-pressure axial compressor. This has three stages on small and medium {{versions of}} the engine and four stages on large versions. The air then flows into a single-stage centrifugal compressor, through a folded annular combustion chamber, and finally through a single-stage turbine that powers the compressors at about 45,000 rpm. Hot gas from the gas generator flows into the power turbine, which turns at about 30,000 rpm. It has one stage on the small engines and two stages on the medium and large ones. For turboprop use, this powers a two-stage planetary output reduction gearbox, which turns the propeller at a speed of 1,900 to 2,200 rpm. The exhaust gas then escapes through two side-mounted ducts in the power turbine housing. The turbines are mounted inside the combustion chamber, reducing overall length.|$|E

A permissive path runs along the left bank, passing the grade II listed Tring pumping station, Heygates flour mill, and the site of Bushell's Boat Yard. This is {{the only part of the}} canal which was built on an embankment, rather than following the contours of the land. Gamnel Bridge dates from 1797, and is a narrow hump-backed bridge, constructed of brown bricks with a red brick arch and blue brick decoration and copings. To the left of the final section is Tring Sewage Treatment Works, built in the late nineteenth century by the Urban District Council, assisted by funding from Nathan and Emma Rothschild. Its outflow normally supplements the water in the canal. However, between July 2012 and April 2013, the <b>inlet</b> <b>screens</b> failed to operate correctly on several occasions, and the canal became polluted with sewage sludge and debris. The Environment Agency prosecuted the operators, Thames Water, who were fined £1 million, the largest fine ever imposed for such a prosecution. Thames Water subsequently replaced the <b>inlet</b> <b>screens</b> at a cost of £30,000. The Arm joins the main line of the Grand Union canal at a footbridge which carries the towpath, next to which is a toll house. To the north, the main line starts its descent through the Marsworth locks, while to the south it continues on the level to Bulbourne and beyond.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of axially segmented (phased) acoustic treatment liners in the inlet of a compressor was investigated. Topics discussed include: (1) the validation of a theoretical procedure to predict propagation and suppression characteristics of duct liners; (2) the in-duct measurement of spinning modes; (3) investigation of phased treatment designs; (4) high Mach inlet acoustic tests; and (5) an experimental investigation of inlet turbulence. The analytical prediction for the multi-segmented treatment {{was found to}} provide the correct order of magnitude of suppression and was generally within 50 % of that determined experimentally.

The screen was investigated in two configurations, both before and after rounding the leading edges of the vanes. Investigations were conducted through air flows up to about pounds per second. The results of the investigations indicate that maximum lift coefficients of 1. 36, 1. 71 and 2. 11 were measured on the model with flaps neutral and deflected 20 deg. and 55 deg, respectively, at a reynolds number of 8, 600, 000. When the duct inlet was replaced by a basic airfoil nose the flap neutral maximum lift coefficient was increased from 1. 36 to 1. 41. The results also showed that at maximum lift with flaps neutral or deflected 55 deg most of the area between the nacelles was stalled while only small areas on other portions of the model were stalled; when the duct inlet was replaced by the basic airfoil nose the stall was delayed to a slightly higher angle of attack but the nature of the stall was relatively unaffected...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the facing-the-wind sampling efficiency of three personal aerosol samplers as a function of particle phase (solid versus liquid). Samplers examined were the IOM, Button, and a prototype personal high-flow inhalable sampler head (PHISH). The prototype PHISH was designed to interface with the 37 -mm closed-face cassette and provide an inhalable sample at 10 l min(- 1) of flow. Increased flow rate increases the amount of mass collected during a typical work shift and helps to ensure that limits of detection are met, particularly for well-controlled but highly toxic species. Two PHISH prototypes were tested: one with a <b>screened</b> <b>inlet</b> and one with a single-pore open-face inlet. Personal aerosol samplers were tested on a bluff-body disc that was rotated along the facing-the-wind axis to reduce spatiotemporal variability associated with sampling supermicron aerosol in low-velocity wind tunnels. When compared to published data for facing-wind aspiration efficiency for a mouth-breathing mannequin, the IOM oversampled relative to mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency for all sizes and particle types (solid and liquid). The sampling efficiency of the Button sampler was closer to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency than the IOM for solid particles, but the <b>screened</b> <b>inlet</b> removed most liquid particles, resulting in a large underestimation compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. The open-face PHISH results showed overestimation for solid particles and underestimation for liquid particles when compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. Substantial (and statistically significant) differences in sampling efficiency were observed between liquid and solid particles, particularly for the Button and screened-PHISH, with a majority of aerosol mass depositing on the <b>screened</b> <b>inlets</b> of these samplers. Our results suggest that large droplets have low penetration efficiencies through <b>screened</b> <b>inlets</b> and that particle bounce, for solid particles, is an important determinant of aspiration and sampling efficiencies for samplers with <b>screened</b> <b>inlets.</b> R 21 OH 009114 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United StatesR 21 OH 009114 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 03 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 21965462 PMC 477665...|$|R

40|$|Over the years, {{the word}} stealth {{has been used}} more and more when {{discussing}} design and operational characteristics in military applications. New and more challenging techniques are constantly being applied to minimize signatures and thus hinder or delay detection and identification. The Visby Class Corvette is a multipurpose combat ship with 600 tons displacement. The hull is a sandwich construction of a PVC core with carbon fiber/vinyl laminate. The propulsion system consists of two identical CODOG machinery systems, each driving a KaMeWa 125 size Water Jet Unit. The Ship has special requirements for all signatures, i. e. Radar-, Hydro acoustics-, IR- and Magnetic Signature. The High Speed Machinery is twin Honeywell TF 50 A Gas Turbines, cantilever mounted {{side by side on}} the Main Reduction Gearbox housing. The Main Reduction Gearbox is a dual input high performance marine Gearbox designated MA - 107 SBS, designed and manufactured by Cincinnati Gear Co. The Low Speed Machinery is a MTU 16 V 2000 TE 90 Diesel Engine connected to the MRG by a power take in shaft. Combustion Air for the Gas Turbines is ducted from the shipside Air <b>Inlet</b> <b>Screen</b> (radar screen) via 3 -stage separating filters. The Exhausts from the twin Gas Turbines are combined into one Exhaust Pipe and ducted to the ship transom above the Water Jet stream. Very little can be changed in the Gas Turbine, but high quality such as well balanced rotating part contributes to reduce the signatures. However, the main work has to be accomplished by the building shipyard in cooperation with the Gas Turbine manufacturer. The Main Reduction Gearbox is more available for changes to reduce signatures, but even for the Gearbox the building shipyard has to take design and installation measures. The HSM installation consist mainly of the Gas Turbine Engine, the Main Reduction Gear, Water Jets Unit and surrounding equipment such as main shaft, bearings and so on.

40|$|The {{design of}} closed circuit wind tunnels has {{historically}} been performed using rule of thumb which have evolved over the years into a body of useful guidelines. The development of indraft wind tunnels, however, {{has not been as}} well documented. The design of indraft wind tunnels is therefore generally performed using a more intuitive approach, often resulting in a facility with disappointing flow quality. The primary problem is a lack of understanding of the flow in the inlet as it passes through the required antiturbulence treatment. For wind tunnels which employ large contraction ratio inlets, this lack of understanding is not serious since the relatively low velocity of the flow through the inlet treatment reduces the sensitivity to improper inlet design. When designing a small contraction ratio inlet, much more careful design is needed {{in order to reduce the}} flow distortions generated by the inlet treatment. As part of the National Full Scale Aerodynamics Complex Modification Project, 2 -D computational methods were developed which account for the effect of both <b>inlet</b> <b>screens</b> and guide vanes on the test section velocity distribution. Comparisons with experimental data are presented which indicate that the methods accurately compute the flow distortions generated by a screen in a nonuniform velocity field. The use of inlet guide vanes to eliminate the screen induced distortion is also demonstrated both computationally and experimentally. Extensions of the results to 3 -D is demonstrated and a successful wind tunnel design is presented...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to acquire}} {{autonomously}} cryogenic hydrocarbon liquid sample from remote planetary locations such as the lakes of Titan for instruments such as mass spectrometers. There are several problems that had to be solved relative to collecting the right amount of cryogenic liquid sample into a warmer spacecraft, such as not allowing the sample to boil off or fractionate too early; controlling the intermediate and final pressures within carefully designed volumes; designing for various particulates and viscosities; designing to thermal, mass, and power-limited spacecraft interfaces; and reducing risk. Prior art inlets for similar instruments in spaceflight were designed primarily for atmospheric gas sampling and are not useful for this front-end application. These cryogenic liquid sample acquisition system designs for remote space applications allow for remote, autonomous, controlled sample collections of a range of challenging cryogenic sample types. The design can control the size of the sample, prevent fractionation, control pressures at various stages, and allow for various liquid sample levels. It is capable of collecting repeated samples autonomously in difficult lowtemperature conditions often found in planetary missions. It is capable of collecting samples for use by instruments from difficult sample types such as cryogenic hydrocarbon (methane, ethane, and propane) mixtures with solid particulates such as found on Titan.

40|$|Membrane channel {{clogging}} in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) {{has been}} largely unexplored by the research community, despite it being widely recognised as the main impediment to sustainable MBR operation by practitioners, and reflects the difficulty of examining clogging with the same scientific rigour as membrane fouling. The incidence of clogging/“ragging” has been assessed across 10 – 12 full-scale flat sheet immersed MBRs, equipped with <b>inlet</b> <b>screens</b> of similar rating, and physical characteristics of the sludge examined. Measured sludge quality determinants included classical {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) concentration and filterability measurement, as well as a series of novel sludge characterisations based on determination of coarse suspended solids (CSS) concentration using sieves or nets of aperture sizes between 150 and 4000 μm. A further rudimentary test was conducted on the coarse filtered solids to assess the mechanical integrity of the agglomerated material. Results showed there to be a reasonable correlation between filterability and concentration of super- 4 mm particles, whereas no such correlation existed between filterability and MLSS. This indicated the nature of the solids, and particularly the highly coarse particulate content, to be critical in determining filtration resistance. Both filterability and CSS concentration also correlated with heuristically assessed clogging propensity, with those plants fitted with screenings maceration being more prone to clogging than those with more conventional screenings treatment where screenings were removed entirely. The coarse suspended solids were found to readily agglomerate to form characteristic “rags”, i. e. 10 – 15 cm-long braids of aggregated material, which were self-supporting when suspended in air. The mechanical integrity of these fibres was unaffected by chemical treatment either with detergent or hypochlorite, indicating a degree of robustness of the rags which were formed primarily of cellulosic matter.

40|$|A multiple-throat venturi {{system has}} been invented for {{measuring}} laminar flow of air or other gas at low speed (1 to 30 cm/s) in a duct while preserving the laminar nature of the flow and keeping the velocity profile across the duct as nearly flat as possible. While means for measuring flows at higher speeds are well established, heretofore, {{there have been no}} reliable means for making consistent, accurate measurements in this speed range. In the original application for which this system was invented, the duct leads into the test section of a low-speed wind tunnel wherein uniform, low-speed, laminar flow is required for scientific experiments. The system could also be used to monitor a slow flow of gas in an industrial process like chemical vapor deposition. In the original application, the multiple- throat venturi system is mounted at the inlet end of the duct having a rectangular cross section of 19 by 14 cm, just upstream of an assembly of <b>inlet</b> <b>screens</b> and flow straighteners that help to suppress undesired flow fluctuations (see Figure 1). The basic venturi measurement principle is well established: One measures the difference in pressure between (1) a point just outside the inlet, where the pressure is highest and the kinetic energy lowest; and (2) the narrowest part (the throat) of the venturi passage, where the kinetic energy is highest and the pressure is lowest. Then by use of Bernoulli s equation for the relationship between pressure and kinetic energy, the volumetric flow speed in the duct can be calculated from the pressure difference and the inlet and throat widths. The design of this system represents a compromise among length, pressure recovery, uniformity of flow, and complexity of assembly. Traditionally, venturis are used to measure faster flows in narrower cross sections, with longer upstream and downstream passages to maintain accuracy. The dimensions of the passages of the present venturi system are sized to provide a readily measurable pressure drop. Multiple throats are used to minimize the length needed to recover internal energy and enable the velocity profile to recover to near flatness...|$|R

The Wastewater Treatment Plant of Zalau, Salaj county, Romania was {{designed}} to treat approximately 18. 425 m wastewater per day, {{and in order to}} follow the discharge parameters for the chemical oxygen demand indicators (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspension solids (SS), the aeration basins have been conceived to function as a unit on nitrification and denitrification. The concentration of the dissolved oxygen is being maintained at the level of 1 mg/l, on the aeration basin, so as to prevent the growth of autotrophic bacteria and nitrification process. Existing Wastewater Treatment Plant has been designed for a population equivalent of 50. 500 people and the aim of the project is to enlarge treatment plant capacity to 90. 900 population equivalent and reach the maximum effluent quality.

Flow conditioning {{can be used to}} reduce turbulent fluctuations in these liquid sheets and thereby reduce surface ripple, or free-surface fluctuations, and delay jet breakup. Several flow conditioning configurations are studied experimentally for vertical turbulent sheets of water issuing downwards from nozzles of thickness (small dimension) δ = 1 cm into ambient air for Reynolds numbers Re = 5. 0 × 104 and 1. 2 × 105. In particular, the role of one or more fine screens in the flow conditioner was studied. As the flow conditioning element immediately upstream of the nozzle <b>inlet,</b> fine <b>screens</b> have been shown to have a major impact upon the sheet free-surface geometry. Planar laser-induced fluorescence was used to measure the free-surface geometry of the liquid sheet and its fluctuations in the near field at streamwise distances downstream of the nozzle exit x ≤ 25 δ. Laser-Doppler velocimetry was used to quantify the impact of different conditioning configurations on the cross-stream velocity component and its fluctuations just upstream of the nozzle exit. The results indicate that minor differences in velocity and velocity fluctuations near the nozzle exit can lead to major variations in free-surface geometry, and that free-surface fluctuations are strongly affected by changes in flow conditioner design, even in the near-field region of the flow.

A Rolls-Royce fan, similar to one that would be used for a supersonic business jet engine, was tested with several different inlet total pressure distortions. The distortions were designed to capture the effects of an inlet cone, struts associated with the cone, endwall boundary layers, and wind gusts. Following industry best practice procedures, the change in performance and inlet flow characteristics are described based on the Society of Automotive Engineer (SAE) documents: AIR- 1419 and ARP- 1420. The fan was found to be very sensitive to tip radial distortion, where alteration of the flow condition at the tip was seen to either enhance or deteriorate the fan stability, especially when the fan instability is rotating stall or surge. Circumferential distortion was found to have the most impact when the fan instability is flutter. Using correlation method recommended by SAE, radial distortion was successfully correlated to surge margin loss. ^ Additionally, lessons learned from wire-gauze screen design work done at the Purdue Compressor/Pre-Diffuser/Combustor (CPC) Research facility were documented.

The two proprietary devices utilized screening and filtering (using filter fabric and a coarser mesh). A conventional catchbasin inlet, having a sump, was also tested for comparison. These devices were monitored in Stafford Township, NJ, to evaluate their removal effectiveness for stormwater pollutants. Twelve paired samples collected at each device represented composite inflow and outflow stormwater. The samples were split into filtered and unfiltered components for extensive analyses of conventional and toxic pollutants. The experimental design was capable of identifying significant pollutant removals of at least 15 to 50 % at a 95 % confidence level, depending on the pollutant. The only significant pollutant removals were found during tests of a conventional catchbasin having a suitable sump. The median removal rates were about 30 % for suspended solids, about 40 % for turbidity, about 15 % for color, and about 20 % for total solids.

40|$|A {{productive}} {{method of}} farming tilapia {{has been widely}} adopted in the Masasi district in south west Tanzania. The fish can be eaten by the smallholders, sold, or used in exchange for other commodities or services. Each smallholder fish farmer gets advice and buys stock from a central fivepond demonstration site. This is the base for a Tanzanian fisheries office and a fisherman from Voluntary Service Overseas, who help with the planning, construction, stocking and management of each pond. The integration of the fish farm with current crops and livestock and water supply {{are the most important}} considerations. For a pond to be easy to manage it needs sloping grassed banks that reduce erosion and a <b>screened</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet to prevent wild tilapia from entering. Because nets are expensive, it is preferable to harvest by hand, so it is necessary to be able to drain the pond completely. Hired workers are paid in fish. The fish are fed daily on waste products from the smallholding or'shamba': maize or rice bran, chopped pawpaw, cassava and banana leaves. The maize bran floats and, when the fish surface to feed, their size can be assessed. Tilapia breed so rapidly that overcrowding can occur. There are three ways of feeding fish in ponds: with agricultural waste, with duck droppings or pig manure. These waste products encourage the growth of phytoplankton, on which the fish feed as they decompose. Cow manure is put in the water in a woven basket to promote algae and plankton blooms, on which the young fish feed. Fed in this way, it is possible to harvest the tilapia after three to four months. However, harvest is usually a little later than this as many of the fish ponds are run as a sideline for the farmers who have other livestock to attend to. News that a pond is ready for harvest spreads quickly and villagers will collect at the pondside. Those fish farmers who have no other livestock will pay for manure with fish. One aspect of tilapia farming which the project hopes to develop is the integration of duck and chicken production. They would be housed above the water, hat their manure would fall into the pond and feed the algae and plankton. Using tilapia hybrids that produce all male offspring and sex reversal with testosterone to prevent breeding could produce large, uniform fish for the western market. But at present the more appropriate basic tilapia husbandry makes enough demands on the smallholders'time The one hundred ponds constructed by villagers with the help of Maliasili and VSO/ODA staff produced well over a tonne of fish per year, and more ponds are planned.
