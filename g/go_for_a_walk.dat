Apart from Ada, Belgrade has total of 16 islands on the rivers, many still unused.

These areas, along with nearby Small War Island, are protected by the city's government as a nature preserve.|$|E

5|$|Yosemite Valley is open year-round and {{numerous}} activities {{are available through}} the National Park Service, Yosemite Conservancy, and Delaware North at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or take a tour bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see a spectacular view of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic Tioga Road to Tuolumne Meadows (May–October) and <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> or hike.|$|E

5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E

25|$|The novel then flashes back {{to before}} the explosion, taking the {{perspective}} of Winnie Verloc and her mother. At home, Mrs. Verloc's mother informs the family that she intends {{to move out of}} the house. Mrs. Verloc's mother and Stevie use a hansom which is driven by a man with a hook in the place of his hand. The journey greatly upsets Stevie, as the driver's tales of hardship, whipping of his horse, and menacing hook scare Stevie to the point where Mrs. Verloc must calm him down. On Verloc's return from a business trip to the continent, his wife tells him of the high regard that Stevie has for him and she implores her husband to spend more time with Stevie. Verloc eventually agrees to <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> with Stevie. After this walk, Mrs. Verloc notes that her husband's relationship with her brother has improved.

500|$|Darwin {{remained}} {{close friends}} with the vicar of Downe, John Brodie Innes, and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church, but from around 1849 would <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> on Sundays while his family attended church. He considered it [...] "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist" [...] and, though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that [...] "I have never been an atheist {{in the sense of}} denying the existence of a God.– I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind".|$|E

After moving back to England, Winslet {{purchased}} a property worth £3.25 million by the sea at West Wittering, where as of 2015, she lives with RocknRoll and her children.

Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) accidentally kill a woman in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to rewind time and rescues the girl; revealed to be her childhood friend Chloe Price (Ashly Burch). The two reunite and <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town. The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a viral video depicting her kissing several students at a party. It is implied that she was drugged, and Max suspects Nathan as the perpetrator.|$|E

For myself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation. As for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abbey's {{literary}} influences included Aldo Leopold, Henry David Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Peter Kropotkin, and A. B. Guthrie, Jr.. Although often {{compared to}} authors like Thoreau or Aldo Leopold, Abbey {{did not wish}} to be known as a nature writer, saying that he didn't understand [...] "why so many want to read about the world out-of-doors, when it's more interesting simply to <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> into the heart of it." [...] The theme that most interested Abbey was that of the struggle for personal liberty against the totalitarian techno-industrial state, with wilderness being the backdrop in which this struggle took place. Most of Abbey's writing criticizes the park services and American society for its reliance on motor vehicles and technology. He wanted to preserve the wilderness as a refuge for humans and believed that modernization was making us forget what was truly important in life.|$|E

2500|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} is {{characterized}} as a fluent aphasia. Fluency is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient’s speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, rhythm, melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech. Transcortical sensory aphasia is a disorder {{in which there is}} a discrepancy between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic processing, which is impaired. Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke’s area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient would like to <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk,</b> he or she would respond [...] "go for walk." [...] Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, transcortical sensory aphasia is further characterized based on deficits in naming and paraphasia.|$|E
