Skripsi S 1 Fakultas Ilmu Budaya Universitas Diponegoro Semarang. Study of “Repetisi sebagai Pemadu Antarparagraf dalam Kumpulan Kolom Jungkir Balik Jagat Jawa Karya Trianto Triwikromo” {{is aimed}} to {{describe}} the marker types {{and the role of}} <b>interparagraph</b> linker repetition marker in the columns. The datas which used by the writer is based on the theme of myth, love, and anigma. Myth takes 5 columns, love takes 3 columns, and enigma takes 5 columns. Then, datas are studied by read and record technique that the writer read and recorded all datas in the repetition marker. This study used 185 paragraphs chosen by the writer as the object. Datas then analyzed by discourse analysis approach using qualitative descriptive method for types and role of <b>interparagraph</b> linker repetition marker in Jungkir Balik Jagat Jawa columns. Overall, titles in Jungkir Balik Jagat Jawa columns drove that used in this reasearch has been united by the repetition linker in each paragraph. There are 9 epizeuksis repetition, 2 anafora repetition, 3 mesodiplosis repetition, 2 epistrofa repetition, and 3 anadiplosis repetition marker types used in this collumn. Besides, 36 repetition in another types, 20 full repetition, and 6 replacement repetition. The roles of the repetition markers are the primary role and secondary role. The primary role is to associate the ideas and the theme wholeness as the titles, in the other hand, the secondary role is becase there isn’t any other linker that is dia, ia, saya, kita, and mereka. Keyword : Repetition, <b>interparagraph</b> linker, discourse analysis, columns. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method {{to predict the}} <b>interparagraph</b> {{discourse}} structure of text, i. e. to infer which paragraphs are {{related to each other}} and form larger segments on a higher level. Our method combines a clustering algorithm with a model of segment “relatedness ” acquired in a machine learning step. The model integrates information from a variety of sources, such as word co-occurrence, lexical chains, cue phrases, punctuation, and tense. Our method outperforms an approach that relies on word co-occurrence alone. ...|$|E

The underlying structure of tile entire text, depicting <b>interparagraph</b> relationships and emphases, must also be determined for suceessfill generation. Fortunately, RST [Mann-Thoml) son 1987] is capable of representing interl) aragraph structure ms well ms intraparagraph structure, tlowever, RST does not specify how to build large structures representing multiparagraph text. This paper presents an algorithm to construct such nmltiparagraph structures representing a critique of a student's performance in troubleshooting the HAWK radar, as determined by MACH-III. This critique is based on the functional hierarchy tree (FH tree), which is the heaxt of the expert system component of MACH-III [Kurland et al 1989]. Each student action is judged based on the structure of the FH tree, and where the student is currently located in that tree. The generated critique thus needs to describe each action and how that action helps or hinders proper navigation through the FH tree. Functional hierarchy is a new paradigm for organizing expert system knowledge bases, based on the procedural abstraction principles of Liskov and Gutag [Liskov-Gutag 1986]. Functional hierarchy differs greatly from production rules (the customary basis for an expert system) in that functiona...|$|E
