According to <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> tufa in Lake Cahuilla, a wet period ended 9,000 years before present, and between 6,200 and 3,000-2,000 years before present extended droughts occurred.|$|E
5|$|<b>Data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the {{composition}} of soil samples collected on Apollo 15 show that most (about 90%) of the samples from the Apennine Front are brown-glass breccias, and approximately 60–70% obtained from the mare surface are basalt. Although the basalts seem to vary in their texture, their ages appear to be approximately the same. Most of the samples obtained on the Apennine Front are KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, anorthosites, recrystallized norite, or recrystallized breccia.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious {{content to be}} added to their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of Martian sandstones, using <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> orbital spectrometry, {{suggests}} that the waters that previously existed {{on the surface of}} Mars would have had too high a salinity to support most Earth-like life. Tosca et al. found that the Martian water in the locations they studied all had water activity, aw ≤ 0.78 to 0.86—a level fatal to most Terrestrial life. Haloarchaea, however, are able to live in hypersaline solutions, up to the saturation point.|$|E
25|$|The <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the {{evaporative}} {{process is}} however not without artefacts {{that form the}} physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union resulted in easing of border controls and gun laws, and it became an urgent need for the villagers to earn income in a destroyed economy with high inflation. Almost immediately tigers became similar to a profitable cash crop {{at a time when}} there was huge demand for tiger parts for Traditional Chinese medicine. <b>Data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> field examinations, skin confiscations and from radio-collared animals indicated that 58%-73% tiger deaths were related to poaching.

25|$|Mixed {{models are}} widely used to analyze linear {{regression}} relationships involving dependent data when the dependencies have a known structure. Common applications of mixed models include analysis of data involving repeated measurements, such as longitudinal data, or <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> cluster sampling. They are generally fit as parametric models, using maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In the case where the errors are modeled as normal random variables, there is a close connection between mixed models and generalized least squares. Fixed effects estimation is an alternative approach to analyzing this type of data.|$|E
25|$|The BMI is {{generally}} {{used as a}} means of correlation between groups related by general mass and can serve as a vague means of estimating adiposity. The duality of the BMI is that, while it is easy to use as a general calculation, it is limited as to how accurate and pertinent the <b>data</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> it can be. Generally, the index is suitable for recognizing trends within sedentary or overweight individuals because there is a smaller margin of error. The BMI has been used by the WHO as the standard for recording obesity statistics since the early 1980s.|$|E

Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, but not one that is clinically significant. In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.|$|E
