50|$|Zyskowicz {{is renowned}} {{for being the}} Finnish {{politician}} with the most difficult name <b>to</b> <b>spell.</b> In 2002, Ilta-Sanomat reported that only 16.6% of Finns knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> correctly <b>spell</b> his name.

500|$|Both Fishburne and Bassett also {{remarked that}} an {{important}} message of Akeelah and the Bee is to [...] "speak properly" [...] rather than strictly in vernacular, although Bassett {{emphasized the importance of}} the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees. Atchison added that beyond learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that Larabee [...] "looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand her history. She needs to know the importance of language – and competition." [...] In spite of knowing its importance, it [...] "deconstruct the 'competition' paradigm of learning", according to Ingman. Fishburne noted not only children but parents can learn from the film; in his opinion, the most important is that they should pay attention to their children's abilities. Villarreal also felt that, through Dylan's father, parents would be able to ponder if they are [...] "push their kids to follow their own dreams and not the children's dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|Having played Adventure (1976) on Oden {{and finding}} its cave {{exploration}} exciting, they {{wondered if they}} would be able to create a similar game in Swedish. As they worked on the game, they grew into different roles: Kimmo mostly came up with [...] "wacky ideas", Johansson was a driven visionary who [...] "made things happen", and Kann fixed things and made sure that everything worked. According to Kimmo and Johansson, they cared about the game's content, not just the technical aspects, and made a game that they found fun themselves. They created two reoccurring characters based on themselves, who appear throughout the game: Kimmo, based on the real Kimmo, and the [...] "cottage council chairman" [...] Thorvald, who represents Johansson. As Kann was interested in language, and had specific ideas of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> certain words, they used consistently correct grammar, while consistently using non-standard spelling for words such as [...] "sig" [...] ("oneself") and [...] "dem" [...] ("them"), rendering them as [...] "sej" [...] and [...] "dom".|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, specifying a given kanji, or {{spelling}} out a kanji word—whether the pronunciation is known or not—can be complicated, {{due to the}} fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to [...] "kanji #237"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji—indeed there are many homophonous words, not simply individual characters, particularly for kango (with on'yomi). Easiest is to write the word out—either on paper or tracing it in the air—or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving kun'yomi for characters—these are often unique—using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>spell</b> the word [...] via the words , , and —the first two use the kun'yomi, the third is a well-known compound—saying [...] "kaori, karai, ryō as in inryō." ...|$|E

At age three, Luna came across him and removed the spell...but even if it's been removed, the evil may have stayed in his body, and may continue to kill him overtime.|$|R
