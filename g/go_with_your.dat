500|$|Located at 625 Northwest 21st Avenue in the Nob Hill area of Portland's Northwest District neighborhood, Gypsy was a [...] "boisterous", [...] "disco-balled" [...] dive bar, {{recognizable}} by its bouncers, karaoke, and [...] "wobbling smokers". The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the {{kind of place where}} you can <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor. Or you can go on a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. And if you want to meet new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland." ...|$|E
500|$|Bilge Ebiri of the {{magazine}} New York said, [...] "You can't shake the feeling that in a just world, all these women– even Kate Upton– would have better material than this." [...] Connie Ogle of The Miami Herald gave the film {{three out of four}} stars and called the film a [...] "goofy, ridiculous, with more gross-out humor than is strictly necessary but still funny. It falls into the category of Girlfriend Films– as in, <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> girlfriends and leave your date/partner/spouse at home with the PlayStation or the NBA playoffs." [...] Colin Covert of Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "It's an escapist women's empowerment comedy like many others, but elevated by the simple virtue of being, for most of its length, very, very funny." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "A movie as generic and forgettable as the sofa-size art on its characters' walls." [...] Linda Holmes wrote for NPR, calling the film [...] "a conceptually odious, stupid-to-the-bone enterprise ..." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times advised guys to [...] "Step away from the vehicle, because The Other Woman is out of control and intent on running down a certain kind of male." ...|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E
