5|$|The Pahlavis {{adopted the}} lion and sun emblem from Qajars, but they {{replaced}} the Qajar Crown with the Pahlavi Crown. Pahlavis reintroduced the Persian symbolism to the motif. As <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> Persian traditions, the lion {{had been the}} symbol of kingship and symbol of Rustam's heroism in Shahnameh.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
30|$|Section 3 {{deals with}} the {{proposed}} game design philosophy. Game implementation details <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> section 4 and 5.

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} in following sections: MLPPs and related literature reviews {{are presented in}} introduction section. Formulation of ML-LFPP and related notations <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> next Sect. 2. Characterization of membership functions, solution approach based on FGP and formulation of FGP models <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> next section. Proposed MATLAB program and its functionality <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> Sect. 4. Numerical example on modified FGP technique and its comparison with solution technique suggested by Lachhwani and Poonia (2012) <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> numerical example Sect. 5. Concluding remarks are given in the last section. Coding of main function and recurresive simplex function are presented in appendices.|$|R
30|$|If {{we compare}} these {{findings}} with the subjects that <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> relation to technoscience, we can conclude that, in {{the foundation of}} modern science, we find essential elements of these subjects. These elements <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> the following sections.|$|R
5|$|In January 2016, Emma Watson {{started a}} feminist Goodreads book club: Our Shared Shelf. The {{goal of the}} club is to share feminist ideas and {{encourage}} discussion on the topic. One book is selected per month and <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> {{the last week of}} that month. The first book to be selected was My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem, whom Emma Watson would later interview on 24 February at the How to: Academy in London.|$|E
5|$|Poniatowski {{has been}} the subject of {{numerous}} biographies and many works of art. Voltaire, who saw Poniatowski as a model reformist, modeled King Teucer in his drama Les Lois de Minos (1772) after him. At least 58 contemporary poems were dedicated to him or praised him. Since then, he has been a major character in many works of Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, in the Rok 1794 trilogy by Władysław Stanisław Reymont, in the novels of Tadeusz Łopalewski, and in the dramas of Ignacy Grabowski, Tadeusz Miciński, Roman Bradstaetter and Bogdan Śmigielski. He <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> Luise Mühlbach's novel Joseph II and His Court, and appears in Jane Porter's Thaddeus of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Bhikshatana <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the iconographic work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. The iconography is {{quite similar to}} that of the Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, is associated with the legend of Shiva's atonement for severing Brahma's head. The chief difference is that Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E
30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this study is}} organized as follows. Popular distance metrics and the need for Hadoop <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> “Background”. Approaches recently developed to improve clustering results <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> “Related work”. The proposed KM-HMR and KM-I 2 C algorithms are described in “Proposed work”. An extensive set of experiments on the datasets along with a comparison of existing and proposed solutions is presented in “Experimental evaluation”. Finally, conclusions and future work <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> “Conclusions”.|$|R
30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follows: The EWT have <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> briefly <b>in</b> Sect. 2. The proposed feature extraction technique for mental task classification and Fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm have <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> Sect. 3. Multivariate feature selection methods are included in Sect. 4. Description of experimental setup and results <b>are</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 includes conclusions and future work.|$|R

5|$|There are {{situations}} in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> the propagation of light in a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.|$|E
5|$|Vaishnava {{followers}} including Dvaita scholars, such as Vijayendra Tirtha (1514–93) {{refute the}} portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as they consider the Shaivite Puranas as tamasic - and thus not authoritative - based on their reading of Sattvic Puranas and Shruti texts. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called Shaivasarvasvakhandanam.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing, that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. Each stage <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> terms of its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time-measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E

5|$|Zoology <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> Books VIII to XI. The {{encyclopedia}} mentions {{different sources}} of purple dye, particularly the murex snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as}} the value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.|$|E
5|$|The Western Baltic Kurgans culture, which {{resulted}} from the interaction between groups arriving from {{the east and the}} people living in the Masuria-Sambia region (middle first millennium BC) <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> the Bronze and Iron Age Poland article, within its time frame. The process of separation and differentiation of the eastern and western Baltic tribes deepened during the period of Roman influence, when the economy, culture and customs of the Western Balts became increasingly influenced by the more highly developed Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures people. From the beginning of the Common Era we can speak of the Western Balt culture, which included several distinct groups of the Western Baltic cultural circle and which definitely can be connected with the Baltic peoples.|$|E
