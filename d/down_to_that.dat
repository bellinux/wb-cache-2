25|$|The {{battle of}} Memphis was, {{aside from the}} later {{appearance}} of the ironclad CSS Arkansas, the final challenge to the federal thrust down the Mississippi River against Vicksburg. The river was now open <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> city, which was already besieged by Farragut's ships, but the federal army authorities did not grasp the strategic importance of the fact for nearly another six months. Not until November 1862 would the Union Army under Ulysses S. Grant attempt to complete {{the opening of the}} river.|$|E
25|$|In July 2004 {{the third}} search {{was carried out}} in the {{northern}} part of the Pig's Meadow, where Alexander Avdonin originally found the nine sets of remains. Ground-penetrating radar was used with hand tools and well as scraping the top 8cm of the soil with a machine in order to bring the soil level <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the 1918 era. In July 2007, the remains of two young people were found in the southern part of the Pig's Meadow, approximately 70 meters from the first grave site.|$|E
25|$|To {{meteorite}} researchers, {{the term}} presolar grains {{has come to}} mean presolar grains found in meteorites, which consist overwhelmingly of stardust. Many other types of cosmic dust have not been detected in meteorites. Presolar stardust grains comprise only about 0.1 {{percent of the total}} mass of particulate matter found in meteorites. Such grains are isotopically-distinct material found in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, such as primitive chondrites. Their isotopic differences from the encasing meteorite require that they predate the Solar System. The crystallinity of those clusters ranges from micrometer-sized silicon carbide crystals (up to 1013 atoms), <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of nanometer-sized diamond (about 1000 atoms), and unlayered graphene crystals of fewer than 100 atoms. The refractory grains achieved their mineral structures by condensing thermally within the slowly cooling expanding gases of supernovae and of red giant stars.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} or slush hydrogen may be used, {{as in the}} Space Shuttle. However {{liquid hydrogen}} requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (−252.882°C or −423.188°F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent boil off but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less energy density by volume than hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.|$|E
25|$|The Nineteenth Session of the Council {{took place}} on Monday 1 July 1409, with Pope Alexander presiding, and Cardinal de Thureyo singing the Solemn High Mass. Cardinal Antoine de Challant, the junior Cardinal-Deacon, ascended the pulpit, and, at the command of the Pope, read out and {{published}} the decree of election, which carried the signatures and seals {{of each of the}} cardinals. Pope Alexander then gave a sermon on the trinities of virtues appropriate to a pope, to a prelate, and to subjects. Then Cardinal Cossa ascended the pulpit and read out a decree of the Pope, in which he gave his approval to all acts conducted by the cardinals between 3 May 1408 {{and the beginning of the}} Council on 25 Marcy 1409, as well as to all acts of the Council itself <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> present moment, supplying whatever might have been lacking in any of those acts.|$|E
500|$|From {{the attack}} near the railway bridge {{it became clear}} that Dernancourt was in German hands, despite a {{previous}} assumption that it was still held by patrols of the 35th Division. After the heavy shelling of the village, reports were received that the Germans were withdrawing. About 12:30, the commander of the 106th Brigade requested that the artillery fire be lifted at 14:00 so he could send patrols into the village in an attempt to secure it. He was unable to mount a proper attack due to losses. He asked Gellibrand to extend the right flank of his line to include the railway bridge to free up his troops to go forward. Imlay was ordered to do this, and to follow up any success the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers achieved, but according to Deayton, this push into Dernancourt had a [...] "ridiculously optimistic" [...] objective, as the German strength in the village was obvious from the attacks that had been mounted from it. Imlay also directed the attached company of the 45th to move <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> sector from his support line as soon as the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers went forward. In the event, the pioneers launched a weak attack by the remnants of two companies, totalling about 100 men. But once they left the cover of the embankment, they came under heavy machine gun fire from the village, suffered significant casualties and withdrew to their start line. In the circumstances, the 47th did not follow up the pioneers in going forward towards Dernancourt.|$|E

500|$|As {{reported}} by The Korea Times, {{the thought of}} Gothel being a villain who is both a [...] "greedy, selfish woman and a mother figure to Rapunzel" [...] was initially [...] "perplexing" [...] for animator Jin Kim, and it wasn't until after Kim heard Gothel's [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] {{for the first time}} that he [...] "came up with the 1940s Hollywood screen siren motif" [...] for the character. The directors also strived to make it obvious that Mother Gothel and Rapunzel are not related. Greno told Animation World Network, [...] "When they're standing together, it is very clear that this is not a mother and daughter, just by the frames of their bodies, their hair, the pigments of their skin," [...] as opposed to when Rapunzel is in close proximity with her true parents, the King and Queen. Howard added that, in comparison to Rapunzel, [...] "Gothel is very tall and curvy, she’s very voluptuous, she’s got this very exotic look to her. Even <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> curly hair, we’re trying to say visually that this is not this girl’s mother." [...] The animators studied footage of Murphy in order to get [...] "ideas about facial expressions" [...] and [...] "gestures." [...] After much speculation, the directors finally admitted that, in addition to Murphy, Gothel's physical appearance was in fact influenced by American singer Cher. Howard explained that this was [...] "because Cher is very exotic and Gothic looking," [...] continuing that the singer [...] "definitely was one of the people we looked at visually, as far as what gives you a striking character." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} {{considerable}} division between the two communities, with local Brussels residents feeling excluded from the EU quarter (a [...] "white collar ghetto"). The communities often do not mix much, with expats having their own society. This is in part <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> many expat in Brussels stay for short periods only and do not always learn the local languages (supplanted by English/Globish), remaining in expat communities and sending their children to European Schools, rather than local Belgian ones.|$|E

One inquiry has suggested that it may have prompted the militants to kill the group of male hostages shot on the first day. The government disinformation also sparked incidents of violence by the local residents, aware of the real numbers, against the members of Russian and foreign media.|$|E
