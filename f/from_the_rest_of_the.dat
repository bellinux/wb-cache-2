5|$|From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's {{position}} {{at the mouth of}} the river was an undeniable asset.

5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can be separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent {{and could not be}} established with confidence.

5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it differed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Bloc {{because it was}} established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines.
