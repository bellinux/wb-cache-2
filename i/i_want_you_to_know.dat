25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

[...] After initially endorsing Percy Sutton in the 1977 mayoral election, he subsequently endorsed Ed Koch over Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary run-off. [...] He then attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive. [...] As Koch related, [...] "He has told some blacks angry with me: 'You say Ed Koch is nasty to you? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> he's nasty to everybody.'

500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed is all right, by the way. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that.

500|$|On January 9, 1961, Cooper {{attended}} a dinner given {{in his honor}} at the Friars Club hosted by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Attended by many of his industry friends, the dinner concluded with a brief speech by Cooper who said, [...] "The only achievement I'm proud of is the friends I've made in this community." [...] In mid-January, Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together. Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time. On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he was dying. He later told his family, [...] "We'll pray for a miracle; but if not, and that's God's will, that's all right too." [...] On April 17, Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier, accept on Cooper's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement—his third Oscar. Speaking to Cooper, an emotional Stewart said, [...] "Coop, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> I'll get it to you right away. With it goes all the friendship and affection and the admiration and deep respect of all of us. We're very, very proud of you, Coop." [...] The following day, newspapers around the world announced the news that Cooper was dying. In the coming days he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement, including telegrams from Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, and {{a telephone call from}} President John F. Kennedy.|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 1990s, Groth {{took issue}} with Sim's stance of self-publishing as the best option for creators, and began to {{disseminate}} the view that {{it was best to}} work for a publisher, mentioning Ivan Boesky's address to the University of California's commencement ceremony in May 1986, where Boesky informed his audience that [...] "greed is all right, by the way. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that.

2500|$|After {{considering}} his situation, believing {{that not only}} would he never walk again, but that he might never move a body part again, Reeve considered suicide.

But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I'll be with you for the long haul, no matter what. You're still you. And I love you."
