40|$|A {{wide range}} of welding {{parameters}} and deposition geometry sizes of Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process are predicted. Recent studies focus on optimizing a weld bead size by using mathematical models and using costly welding software. A lot of studies were focused on <b>downhand</b> <b>welding</b> position, some in horizontal position and few in vertical and overhead positions. They were also studies in butt joint design and few in T-fillet joint design. The scope of this research focused on the predicting welding parameters and welding deposition geometry on a T-fillet joint with GMAW process utilizing articulated robot. 1. 2 mm diameter of ER 70 S- 6 filler wire is used to produce fillet weld on 6 mm thickness of low carbon steel base metal and shielded by 100...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{proposes a}} new type of splice joint, named flange bolted-welded hybrid joint, which is {{designed}} to splice I-shape beam to facilitate the construction of industrialized buildings. The flange, welded with the bottom beam flange as well as the web close to bottom flange, are jointed by high strength bolts. Stiffening plate is welded at top of the flange while <b>downhand</b> <b>welding</b> and high strength friction grip bolts are used for the top beam flange and the beam web, respectively. The connection reduces the construction period and costs. In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates. The experimental studies enabled improvement of the design of the connection to be used in moment-resisting steel frame structures.
