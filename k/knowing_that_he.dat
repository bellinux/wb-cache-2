5|$|Banks {{played a}} key role in 1856 in {{bringing}} forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because of his success as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, and his name was put in nomination by supporters (<b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore.

Democrats, however, regained control of the House of Representatives, depriving him of the speakership.|$|E

Among the outcomes of the meeting in El Salvador was a planned new constitution, which would roll back most of the progressive reform brought by the revolution.|$|E

5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by Aristides, {{along with}} 600 Plataean exiles {{to join the}} Allied army. The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of Mount Cithaeron, {{arriving}} near Plataea, and above the Persian position on the Asopus. Under {{the guidance of the}} commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain. Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.|$|E
5|$|Though Sanford {{enjoyed his}} time as Duke's president, he still harbored {{political}} ambitions. As the 1972 presidential primary season began, he was approached by several people who felt that the field of Democratic candidates was weak. He was particularly keen to challenge Alabama governor George Wallace {{in an effort to}} show that Wallace's segregationist views did not represent majority Southern opinion. Announcing his candidacy on March 8, he faced long odds in a crowded field. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not win a majority of delegates in the primary, he hoped to secure enough to emerge as a compromise candidate in a deadlocked convention. Even in the North Carolina primary, however, Wallace beat Sanford by 100,000 votes, and Sanford managed only a fifth-place finish at the 1972 Democratic National Convention with 77.5 votes, behind George McGovern (1,864.95), Henry M. Jackson (525), Wallace (381.7), and Shirley Chisholm (151.95).|$|E

5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement.

5|$|In May 1809, {{the rebels}} {{captured}} Sjenica. They repulsed an Ottoman {{attack on the}} village of Suvodol in early June, and seized Novi Pazar later that month, but failed to take its fortress. Lacking numbers and adequate military training, they failed to establish a corridor to Montenegro and never came close to the Adriatic Sea. Karađorđe had described acquiring access to the sea {{as one of his}} key aims. The rebels experienced further setbacks in Niš, where 3,000 were surrounded at Čegar Hill in May–June 1809. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his men would be impaled if captured, rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion that killed him and everyone else in the vicinity. On the site of the battle, the Ottoman commander Hurshid Pasha built a stone tower with the skulls of Sinđelić and his fighters embedded in its walls as a warning to others who wished to rebel.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was known}} to create tower {{structures}} from the skulls of rebel fighters in order to elicit terror among its opponents. The First Serbian Uprising against Ottoman rule erupted in February 1804, with Đorđe Petrović (Karađorđe) as its leader. On 19 May 1809, 3,000 Serbian rebels {{under the command of}} Stevan Sinđelić were attacked by the Ottomans on Čegar Hill, in Niš. The rebels were plagued by lack of coordination, largely due to the rivalry between commanders Milivoje Petrovic and Petar Dobrnjac. As a result, Sinđelić's fighters failed to receive support from the other rebel detachments. The numerically superior Ottomans lost thousands of soldiers in a number of failed attacks against the rebels, but eventually overwhelmed the Serbian lines. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his men would be impaled if captured, Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion. The resulting blast killed him and everyone else in the vicinity.|$|E

5000|$|In some cases, C/R {{systems can}} be tricked into {{becoming}} spam relays. To be useful, {{some part of the}} message under challenge is generally included in the challenge message. A spammer, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> sending to a C/R using system, could design his message so that his [...] "spam payload" [...] is in the part of the message that the challenge message includes. In this case, the forged sender is the actual recipient of the spam, and the C/R system unwittingly is the relay.|$|R

Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave.

The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E
