40|$|BACKGROUND: Bar code {{technology}} has decreased tran-scription errors inmany healthcare applications. How-ever, {{we have found}} that linear bar code identification methods are not failsafe. In this study, we sought to identify the sources of bar code decoding errors <b>that</b> <b>generated</b> incorrect <b>patient</b> identifiers when bar codes were scanned for point-of-care glucose testing and to develop solutions to prevent their occurrence. METHODS: We identified misread wristband bar codes, removed them from service, and rescanned them by using 5 different scanner models. Bar codes were re-printed in pristine condition for use as controls. We determined error rates for each bar code–scanner pair and manually calculated internal bar code data integ-rity checks...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the value of body surface mapping and the {{standard}} 12 -lead ECG in localizing the site of origin of postinfarction ventricular tachycardia (VT) during endocardial pace mapping of the left ventricle. Methods and Results. Simultaneous recordings of 62 -lead body surface QRS integral maps and scalar 12 -lead ECG tracings were obtained in 16 patients with prior myocardial infarction during a total of 26 distinct VT configurations and during subsequent left ventricular catheter pace mapping at 9 to 24 different endocardial sites. Anatomic pacing site locations were computed by means of a biplane cineradiographic method and plotted on a polar projection of the left ventricle. The QRS integral map and the QRS complexes of the 12 standard leads of eachVT morphology obtained in a particular patient were compared independently with the different paced QRS integral maps and paced QRS complexes of the 12 -lead ECG <b>generated</b> in <b>that</b> same <b>patient.</b> The stimulus site locations of the best matching paced QRS integral map and paced QRS complexes of the 12 -lead ECG were indicated on the polar projection and subsequently compared with the endocardial location of the corresponding site ofVT origin identified during intraoperative (surgical ablation) or catheter activation sequence mapping (catheter ablation). The localization resolution of pace mapping was established separately for each electrocardiographi...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{hypertension}} {{is highly}} prevalent in stable coronary artery disease, a pervasive comorbidity complicating the diagnostic performance {{and interpretation of}} non-invasive provocative tests in chest pain patients because of the ischaemic signals generated, despite normal or near normal coronary arteries, by hearts structurally readapted by long-term exposure to raised systemic blood pressure. Additional and unresolved problems posed by arterial hypertension in patients with stable coronary artery disease regard the benefits of antihypertensive treatment due to reports of irrelevant, if not detrimental, effect of blood pressure (BP) lowering in averting coronary relapses {{as well as the}} lack of association between BP levels and incident coronary events in survivors from acute myocardial infarction. Uncertainties extend to BP-independent cardioprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs, although the efficacy of renin-angiotensin system blockers in the long-term prevention of cardiovascular events in stable coronary artery disease patients has been shown by several studies, particularly when combined with amlodipine, a dihydropiridine calcium channel blocker. In contrast, the long-term effect of beta-blockers, the antihypertensive class most used in that clinical category, is not supported by strong evidence except <b>that</b> <b>generated</b> in <b>patients</b> with systolic dysfunction and early postmyocardial infarction recovery periods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Small {{portable}} devices <b>that</b> <b>generate</b> a pro-thrombin time/INR from fingerstick capillary blood sim-plify warfarin management by allowing selected pa-tients {{to monitor and}} manage their own warfarin dose. Early studies established <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> can self-test at home, with results as accurate as those obtained by practitioners. Point-of-care testing of elderly patients resulted in tighter INR control and a lower incidence of major hemorrhage, especially at the initiation of anticoagulant therapy. Patients can also successfully self-manage warfarin therapy. Larger, prospective, ran-domized intervention studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>patient</b> self-management led to greater time spent within the therapeutic INR range. However, a shift toward patient self-testing will likely require centralized implementa-tion of patient education, training, and follow up that {{will need to be}} established in the clinic setting or by a third party...|$|R
30|$|All {{respondents}} agreed <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> had a {{legal right}} to see their radiology reports if they wished/requested, but the survey indicated that routine practice varies across Europe. Slightly under half of respondents indicated <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> routinely received reports and approximately one quarter <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> rarely received them. Nine per cent of respondents replied <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> never receive written reports. Free text comments indicated that practice may vary across individual healthcare systems, with differences between private and state run services, and inpatient or outpatient referrals. It is clear that although the legal right exists, in practice this may be expensive to implement routinely and difficult to achieve. There is also the perceived risk <b>that</b> <b>patients</b> could be unnecessarily alarmed by radiology reports {{that need to be}} explained in person and {{in the context of their}} illness.|$|R
