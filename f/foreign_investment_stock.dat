40|$|A year ago, India {{seemed to}} be firmly {{on the path of}} rapid and {{sustainable}} economic growth. Its real GDP growth averaged at 7. 2 per cent in 2000 – 08 and 9. 1 per cent in the sub-period 2005 – 08, which was the second highest after China among large emerging economies and significantly higher than the world GDP growth. The amazingly growing industrial production, service sector, corporate profitability and competitiveness, inflows of <b>foreign</b> <b>investment,</b> <b>stock</b> markets, foreign exchange reserve, overseas acquisitions and investments, exports, etc., marked India’s ascendancy to the status of a ‘miracle economy’ 2. However, even before the story of Indian miracle took its root, came the bursting of the asset bubble in the United States, collapse of western financial institutions and rising insolvency of the global corporate giants. The combination of these factors resulted in damaging consequences for financial and real sectors across countries. Capital markets and commodity prices witnessed sharp downward trends and liquidity in the economic system was badly hit. The negative impact of the global financial crisis is now appearing to be rapidly spilling over to the real sector of the world economy. Slowing industria...|$|E

According to the Central Bank of Belarus, Finnish firms have invested nearly $ 100 million in Belarus making Finland the sixteenth most active foreign investor in the country. Approximately 7, 000 companies with foreign capital were registered in Belarus by the beginning of 2013. Finnish companies founded three dozen of these foreign firms. A lack of scientific reports on the perception of foreign businesspeople in the Belarusian business environment necessitated an empirical study. This article studies the attitudes of the directors of Finnish firms operating in Belarus on the Belarusian business environment. In September-October 2013, the author conducted interviews with directors of 10 Finnish corporations. The PEST model was used to describe the perception of the Belarusian business milieu by Finnish businesspeople. The main empirical finding can be summarised by quoting a Finnish CEO, “Belarus is like any other market on the globe with the exception that foreign firms do not want to attract publicity about their activities in the country due to the poor public image of Belarus. ...|$|E

This has clearly contributed {{to the development of}} local securities markets in emerging market economies, which in turn, has been key in attracting investment inflows from overseas funds. A major concern, however, is that large foreign investors could significantly disrupt the stability of local capital markets {{in the event of a}} market shock, with systemic implications for the real economy. Our estimates suggest that while local investors remain the more important group in terms of market share, the influence of foreign funds cannot be discounted. Asset allocation decisions by mature market funds- both dedicated and crossover-in aggregate, could affect emerging markets.

While some researchers confirm regional disparity in China's <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment,</b> others attribute the widening regional income inequality to this regional disparity. This paper thus assesses the impacts of China's <b>stock</b> of <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> on its regional income inequality using simultaneous equation model and the Shapley value regression-based decomposition approach. Our results suggest that China's <b>stock</b> of <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> has accounted for merely 2 % of its regional income inequality. Furthermore, the contribution ratio of per capita <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> <b>stock</b> to China's regional income inequality has relatively been on a steady decline since 2002. The decomposition results also reveal that provincial per capita physical assets account for over 50 % of the nation's income inequality and 65 % of the increases in income inequality since 1990.

Furthermore, a number of obligations enshrined in BITs go beyond their potential counterparts under the GATS.

40|$|Liberals {{claim that}} {{countries}} avoid conflict {{in order not}} to disrupt economically beneficial exchange. The statement that economic integration reduces the likelihood of conflict is largely based on the effects of trade. A similar rationale can be applied to economic interdependence in the form of international capital exchange. A state is expected to avoid political risk, especially severe forms such as militarized disputes, {{in order not to}} deter investors. This study tests, on the dyadic and monadic levels of analyses, whether the liberal peace proposition holds when economic integration is operationalized as <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> (FDI) <b>stocks,</b> inflows, and outflows. The results for the years 1980 - 2000 indicate that inflows and <b>stock</b> of <b>foreign</b> <b>investment</b> reduce the risk of an outbreak of a fatal dispute, regardless of whether they are tested in a single equation or a simultaneous equation model. Thus, reverse causality does not bias the pacifying effect of <b>foreign</b> <b>investment</b> inflows and <b>stock.</b> The results also support the underlying notion of the commercial peace that militarized conflicts inhibit <b>foreign</b> <b>investment.</b> The onset of a fatal conflict reduces FDI inflows, and, if tested in a two-stage instrumental variable approach, FDI stock, the most complete measure of economic integration through <b>foreign</b> <b>investment.</b> Accounting for endogeneity seems particularly important when analyzing the link between the onset of fatal disputes and the outflow of FDI. causality, flows, <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment,</b> militarized interstate disputes, stocks...|$|R

We incorporate in our tests the Kuznets (1955) curve, measures of the character of political institutions, and various aspects of the economy and society that have been emphasized in recent research. Our results are easy to summarize. Globalization has little effect on income inequality within countries. The ratio of <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> <b>stock</b> to gross domestic product is unrelated to the distribution of income. Income inequality in developing and developed countries is unaffected by the presence of multinational corporations. Nor are alternative measures of economic openness - the trade-to-GDP ratio and Sachs and Warner's (1995) measure of free trade policy - associated with greater inequality.

Far less attention is given to the even more rapid proliferation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and their overlap with obligations assumed by World Trade Organization (WTO) Members under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). About 60 per cent of world <b>foreign</b> <b>investment</b> <b>stocks</b> are in services and, thus, covered by mode 3 (commercial presence) of the GATS.

We use data on the <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> <b>stocks</b> and the cross-border provision of financial services of German banks for the period 1997 - 2000 to describe the regional pattern of banks' international activities. We find that country- and bank-specific variables capturing size have a major impact on banks' foreign activities. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the realisation of economies of scale and the provision of trade-related finance shape globalisation patterns. Greater cultural and geographical distance, by contrast, potentially limit the international expansion of banks.
