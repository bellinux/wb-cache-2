50|$|Isser's {{research}} {{focused on}} modeling the non-linear airflow dynamics around rotor blades of helicopters in slow axial flight or during hovering. Isser added additional accuracy to well established models of unsteady rotor aerodynamics {{that had previously}} been developed by scientists at the Technion and at other research institutions. These basic models assumed linear distribution of air circulation along the blades and a linear wake geometry. In reality, however, small airflow velocity perturbations are caused by small vertical motions of the blades, resulting in variations in the <b>induced</b> <b>wake</b> field and airflow velocities. These airflow perturbations were not included in previous unsteady airflow models. In contrast, Isser's model added harmonic factors into the airflow model, taking into account the small periodic vertical motions of the blades during hovering or slow axial flight and treating the airflow differently in the near and far fields of the wake. To reduce the complexity of the model, Isser assumed mathematical simplifications. Then he conducted simulations of simple wake field profiles in order to test the accuracy of the model. Not only was the model validated {{with a high degree of}} accuracy for the case of constant circulation along the blades and radial trailing edges, but, thanks to Isser's updates, the model's accuracy and ability to predict rotor behavior during pitch and roll maneuvers was also significantly improved. The enhanced model predicted correctly the helicopter off‐axis response, a phenomenon that was beyond the capability of previous models. The improved model could also predict more accurate designs of rotor blade profiles to better match the wake-field non-linear geometry around rotary wing platforms, improving both the flight dynamics and hovering efficiency of rotary wing platforms.|$|E

Electron clouds cause instabilities and emittance growth in positron and proton beams {{as well as}} in heavy ion beams. Most of the hadron machines experience the build-up of EC due to the multipacting. In LHC and in positron machines production of electrons due to the synchrotron radiation becomes as important as the build-up due to the secondary emission.

In the 1960 s, two propellers were tested in vertical or near vertical descent, indicating a loss in thrust {{in the region of}} VRS. Thrust fluctuations of both single and tandem rotor configurations while operating in VRS were reported.

While these have been attributed to the formation of the ground <b>induced</b> <b>wake,</b> limited experimental investigations of the wake have been conducted. Difficulties in re-creating representative forward flight ground boundary conditions in wind tunnels have meant a lack of quantitative information on the ground effect wake. This research is based on experimentally investigating the ground effect wakes of rotors in forward flight, to detail the fluid mechanics associated with the ground effect wake and to identify the influence of rotor parameters and ground boundary conditions on the formation of the ground effect wake. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) tests were conducted on wide regions of the ground effect wake produced by a rotor model in a wind tunnel fitted with a moving ground. Results from this research showed the ground effect wake to consist of a flow separation boundary and a region of recirculation, formed by the rotor tip vortex system trailing along the ground plane. Unsteadiness of the wake was seen to result in a constantly evolving wake, and this was observed to affect the classification of the ground effect flow regimes. Flow visualisation experiments conducted on the brownout phenomenon showed the ground effect wake features to influence the dust pick-up and transport mechanisms involved in the dust cloud formation. Experimental testing showed rotor parameters such as collective angles, rotor trim settings, rotor ground distance and root cut-out ratios to cause insignificant changes to the fluid mechanics of the ground effect wake, affecting only the location of the wake features. Effects of ground boundary conditions on the ground effect wake fluid mechanics were observed to be most significant, affecting both the location and detailed structure of the wake features. Results from this research show that ground effect experimental testing can be conducted in the wind tunnel environment and highlight the importance of accurately representing the ground boundary conditions during ground effect experimental testing.

In this thesis, I compute the electron-cloud formation and <b>induced</b> <b>wake</b> with various magnetic fields via computer simulation, for parameters repre. senting the low-energy positron ring of KEKB and the ILC Dumping Ring in proposal. 　　　Chapter 1 introduces history of the study to transverse instabilities due to electron-cloud. The problem of transverse instability and beam loss due to electron-proton interactions has long persisted. It was first observed at the Budker institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) Proton Storage Ring (PSR). Shortly thereafter, electron cloud- and beam-induced multipacting was found at CERN Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) during the coasting beam operation, and was cured with clearing electrodes. More recently, an electron cloud caused transverse instability in a bunched proton beam in the Proton Storage ring at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL PSR). Similar instability, seemingly due to electron and proton interactions, occurred at the KEK Photo Factory (PF) and KEK B Factory. It was also reported in the Brookhaven National Laboratory Alternating Gradient Synchrotron booster, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center PEP-II, Beijing Electron Positron Collider, and the European Organization for Nuclear Research Proton Synchrotron (PS) and Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). Grobner suggested that beam-induced multipacting causes an electron cloud to accumulate inside the vacuum chamber. It then interacts with the proton or positron beam and hence destabilizes it. Single-bunch instability was first studied by K. Ohmi and F. Zimmermann applied to the KEK B Factory Low Energy Ring, where single-bunch instability is consudered to be very serious. K. Ohmi also studied coupled-bunch instability {{when it was first}} observed at the KEK Photon Factory Storage Ring in 1995. In LER, solenoids are installed around the ring since September 2000 in order to remove the electron cloud which causes the enlargement of the beamn size. The solenoids also work to suppress coupled-bunch instability due to the electron cloud. 　　　Chapter 2 introduces simulation program. ECS is a 3 -dimensional particle in cell simulation program developed to stady the electron cloud instabilities. It is featured in poisson equation solver based on Finite Element Method (FEM). The program includes a conformal triangular mesh generator, which is optimized for Poisson solver for big performance gain. Second-order generalized least -squares algorithm is proved to be a low-cost high-accuracy field interpolation method. Poisson solver is not only used to calculate space charge force by electron cloud, but also to calculate beam force along the boundaries as supplement to Bassetti-Erskine formula. Adaptive step size control for Runge-Kutta is carefully studied to get correct simulation result when strong magnetic field involves. 　　　Chapter 3 introduces studies to etectron cloud in magnetic field-free region, antechamber and drift space. Under the boundary conditions of antechamber, beam force can leak into slot part only a few millimeters. The motion or photoelectrons is dominated by their initial velocity and space charge rorce. 10 case of photoemission mainly occurs on illuminated region, potential of electron cloud itself can even stop electrons with small transverse initial velocity from drifting into beam chamber. This is the stopping effect of antechamber to electron cloud. Wake field and growth rate in drift space is calculated according to the model of electron cloud in KEKB low energy ring. 　　　Chapter 4 introduces simulation study to electron cloud under solenoid field. A sinusoidal solenoid field is assumed in this thesis. Single photoelectron tracking shows the trajectory of photoelectron in solenoid field is the combination of gyration movement and cyclotron movement. This method also predicted a bottleneck-shaped electron cloud distribution. 3 D PCT simulation program repeats such a result. Wake field, growth rate and unstable mode spectrum are calculated. 　　　Chapter 5 introduces electron cloud formation within quadrupole magnet and wiggler. Simulation shows electron 2 ̆ 7 s movement under strong magnetic field is tightly confined along magnetic flux. In both quadrupole magnet and wiggler, transverse diffusion of electrons on the X-Z plan is actually very weak. It implies that electron cloud generated with antechamber slot part is most likely blocked from diffusing into beam chamber. Therefore, the reflected photos could be the only cause of electron-cloud in beam chamber. Production rate of photoelectrons under such conditions should be a relatively small number. And uniform emission is also assumed. Calculation shows electron cloud density close to beam is always lower than threshold value in all 7 ILC damping ring model. No serious single-bunch instability can be predicted. Wake and its growth rate due to electron cloud in KEKB LER quadrupole magnets are also calculated...|$|E

However, the exact role of cholinergic BF (ch-BF) neurons in the sleep-wake cycle remains unclear [3,  4]. We demonstrated that photostimulation of ch-BF neurons genetically targeted with channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR 2) was sufficient to induce an immediate transition to waking or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep from slow-wave sleep (SWS). Light stimulation was most likely to induce behavioral arousal during SWS, but not during REM sleep, a result in contrast to the previously reported photostimulation of noradrenergic or hypocretin neurons that <b>induces</b> <b>wake</b> transitions from both SWS and REM sleep. Furthermore, the ratio of light-induced transitions from SWS to wakefulness or to REM sleep did not significantly differ from that of natural transitions, suggesting that activation of ch-BF neurons facilitates the transition from SWS but does not change the direction of the transition. Excitation of ch-BF neurons during wakefulness or REM sleep sustained the cortical activation. Stimulation of these neurons for 1  hr induced a delayed increase in the duration of wakefulness in the subsequent inactive period. Our results suggest that activation of ch-BF neurons alone is sufficient to suppress SWS and promote wakefulness and REM sleep...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to determine the}} time-dependent flowfield about an impulsively started circular cylinder. An outer potential flow model is interfaced with an inner viscous flow region. The wake is described {{by a set of}} elementary point vortices. The position at which the point vortices are shed from the cylinder is obtained from a solution to the unsteady incompressible laminar boundary-layer equations. A rear shear-layer is postulated to account for backflow <b>induced</b> vorticity. <b>Wake</b> development is detailed from the initial formation of the two symmetric vortices to subsequent asymmetry and eventual alternate shedding. Unsteady pressure distributions, lift and drag forces, and Strouhal number are calculated and compared with experiment...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} cloud <b>induces</b> a <b>wake</b> force on a charged particle beam which creates correlations between bunches—i. e., a small displacement {{of a bunch}} creates a perturbation of the {{electron cloud}}, which affects the motions of the following bunches, {{with the result that}} a coupled-bunch instability is caused. The coupling mode of the instability is determined by the motion of the electrons in the cloud—that is, it depends on which electrons, moving in a drift space, a weak solenoid field or a strong bending field, are dominant for the instability. We discuss the coupled-bunch instability focusing on the relation between the mode spectrum and the electron motion...|$|R
