50|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m, whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m. This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous. Since the 5.7×28mm SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullet,</b> the <b>cartridge</b> and pistol are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.|$|R
50|$|Soft-point bullets {{are similar}} to {{jacketed}} <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullets,</b> because both have a jacket open on the forward tip. The soft core is exposed forward of the jacket on soft-point bullets, while the jacket may extend forward of the core on <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullets</b> emphasizing aerodynamic improvement rather than expansion. Bullets with {{a large amount of}} core exposed forward of the jacket might have a hollow point within that core; and some <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullets</b> have no jackets.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{military}} use, <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullets</b> {{are one of the}} most common types of bullets used by civilians and police, which is due largely to the reduced risk of bystanders being hit by over-penetrating or ricocheted bullets, and the increased speed of incapacitation.|$|R

50|$|Expanding bullets, {{also known}} as dumdum bullets, are {{projectiles}} designed to expand on impact, increasing in diameter to limit penetration and/or produce a larger diameter wound for faster incapacitation. Therefore, they are used for hunting and by some police departments, but are generally prohibited for use in war. Two typical designs are the <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullet</b> and the soft-point bullet.|$|R
50|$|An {{argument}} {{can be made that}} Brawn's injuries were more damaging than at first glance. Whenever Brawn takes the shot to the shoulder, after he falls it is apparent that a larger area of Brawn's back is damaged leading to the possibility that the laser fired could have acted like <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullet</b> damaging more of Brawn then previously thought.|$|R
5000|$|These {{treaties}} apply even to [...]22 LR bullets used in pistols, {{rifles and}} machine guns.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} bullets {{specifically designed to}} expand on impact were those fired by express rifles, which were developed in the mid 19th century. Express rifles used larger powder charges and lighter bullets than typical for the time to achieve very high velocities for black powder cartridges. One method of lightening the bullets used {{was to provide a}} deep cavity in the nose of the bullet. These were the first <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullets,</b> and in addition to developing higher velocities, they also expanded significantly upon impact. These <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullets</b> worked well on thin-skinned game, but tended to come apart on bigger game, resulting in insufficient penetration. One solution to this was the [...] "cruciform expanding bullet", a solid bullet with a cross-shaped incision in the tip. This split section expanded only to the depth of the incision, making it an early form of controlled expansion bullet.|$|R

Some <b>hollow-point</b> boat-tail <b>bullets</b> with longer, more aerodynamic profiles are known as very-low-drag bullets.|$|R

5000|$|During the 19th {{century the}} area was home to the Dum Dum Arsenal, a British Royal Artillery armoury, where, in the early 1890s, Captain Neville Bertie-Clay {{developed}} a bullet with the jacket cut away at the tip to reveal its soft lead core (see <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullet),</b> known informally as a dum-dum, or more correctly as an expanding bullet.

50|$|When {{a firearm}} or a <b>bullet</b> or <b>cartridge</b> case are {{recovered}} from a crime scene, forensic examiners compare the ballistic fingerprint of the recovered <b>bullet</b> or <b>cartridge</b> case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second <b>bullet</b> or <b>cartridge</b> case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired <b>bullet</b> or <b>cartridge</b> case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered <b>bullet</b> or <b>cartridge</b> case, investigators know that the recovered <b>bullet</b> or <b>cartridge</b> case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a <b>bullet</b> or <b>cartridge</b> case {{recovered from a}} crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators {{may be able to}} connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.|$|R
50|$|They {{consist of}} a fairly normal <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullet</b> with the frontal cavity filled in by hard plastic, which is molded into a {{streamlined}} shape mimicking {{the shape of a}} spitzer bullet. Upon impact, the plastic drives into the hollow point, or fragments into small pieces and the bullet performs like a regular hollow-point, expanding ("mushrooming") to a larger diameter or fragmenting. The end result is a bullet with the streamlined characteristics of the spitzer bullet and the increased terminal mushrooming of Jacketed <b>Hollow-Points</b> (JHPs). These <b>bullets</b> possess the aerodynamics for longer, more accurate flights, and the in-target performance to ensure high lethality.|$|R

5000|$|The {{bottleneck}} {{shape of}} the [...]357 SIG cartridge makes feeding problems almost non-existent. This is because the bullet is channeled through the larger chamber before being seated entirely as the slide goes into full battery.

5000|$|The first <b>hollow-point</b> <b>bullets</b> were marketed in {{the late}} 19th century as express bullets, and were {{hollowed}} out to reduce the bullet's mass and provide higher velocities. In addition to providing increased velocities, the hollow also turned out to provide significant expansion, especially when the bullets were cast in a soft lead alloy. Originally intended for rifles, the popular [...]32-20, [...]38-40, and [...]44-40 calibers could also be fired in revolvers.|$|R
