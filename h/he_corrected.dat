Five years later, <b>he</b> <b>corrected</b> {{the name of}} the family to Acanthopholidae, which is now the correct spelling. In the same publication, he also changed the genera included. He assigned Hylaeosaurus, Stegoceras, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon inside it but moved Stegopelta and Ankylosaurus into the family Ankylosauridae. Nopcsa then downgraded the phylogenetic rank of Acanthopholidae to make it a subfamily inside Nodosauridae. The clade was defined to include Ankylosaurus and Acanthopholinae. Inside Acanthopholinae he placed Acanthopholis, Hylaeosaurus, Rhodanosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon. Now considered as an artificial grouping, it was defined to include dinosaur taxa now considered to be polacanthids, a pachycephalosaur and Acanthopholis, a genus that is widely considered to be dubious. Acanthopholidae and Acanthopholinae are now dubious groups since the validity of Acanthopholis has changed.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, ESPLA, {{the state}} {{publishing}} house, signed contracts with Vinea for his drawer novels, {{but did not}} deliver. Instead, it hired him on its team of translators and philologists. Vinea produced Romanian versions of Edgar Allan Poe's romantic stories, especially Berenice, Ligeia, and The Fall of the House of Usher, and was involved in ESPLA's Shakespeare translation project, applying his poetic skill to Henry V, Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, and The Winter's Tale. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>corrected</b> for print Costin's draft of Les Misérables, and completed other translations from Balzac, Romain Rolland, Washington Irving, and Halldór Laxness.

25|$|After the fight, Lewis {{decided he}} needed a new trainer to replace Pepe Correa, who had become {{increasingly}} difficult to work with. Correa denounced Lewis in public after being fired. Renowned trainer Emanuel Steward, who had been McCall's trainer during their fight, was Lewis' choice. Even before the fight with McCall, Steward had seen much potential in Lewis and immediately {{expressed a desire to}} work with him. <b>He</b> <b>corrected</b> several of Lewis' technical flaws, which included maintaining a more balanced stance, less reliance on his straight right hand, and a focus on using a strong, authoritative jab; the latter of which would become a hallmark of Lewis' style throughout the rest of his career.

On 14 January, during the breakthrough at Augustów, <b>he</b> <b>corrected</b> the battery's fire, enabling it to reportedly destroy seven German firing points and an infantry platoon. He was wounded, but remained on the battlefield. On 15 January, during the attack on Stromiec, the battery knocked out a tank and two self-propelled guns, enabling the advance of the infantry. On 16 January, during the battle for Białobrzegi, the battery reportedly destroyed two tanks and an armored personnel carrier, allowing the infantry to advance. On 24 March 1945 Mirzayev received the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin.|$|E

The Hurricane turned onto its back and Carey noticed blood seeping from his hands and arm. <b>He</b> <b>corrected</b> the attitude of the aircraft and succeeded in attacking a flight of Bf 109s from astern and hit one but was again attacked and hit by a Bf 110 which shot off his rudder and one elevator. The fight had taken him near to Cherbourg and he decided to extract himself and fly to Tangmere. The Hurricane, P3202, was later repaired. 43 Squadron's tormentors in the battle were probably from V./LG 1.|$|E

Returning to the United States in 1954, he studied for two years at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in Ohio, and in 1956 completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering. Cooper was then assigned to the USAF Experimental Flight Test School (Class 56D) at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and after graduation was posted to the Flight Test Engineering Division at Edwards, where {{he served as a}} test pilot and project manager testing the F-102A and F-106B. <b>He</b> <b>corrected</b> several deficiencies in the F-106, saving the U.S. Air Force a great deal of money.|$|E
25|$|The work of Lorentz was mathematically perfected by Henri Poincaré who {{formulated}} on {{many occasions}} the Principle of Relativity and tried to harmonize it with electrodynamics. He declared simultaneity only a convenient convention which depends on the speed of light, whereby the constancy {{of the speed of}} light would be a useful postulate for making the laws of nature as simple as possible. In 1900 and 1904 he physically interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of clock synchronization by light signals. And finally in June and July 1905 he declared the relativity principle a general law of nature, including gravitation. <b>He</b> <b>corrected</b> some mistakes of Lorentz and proved the Lorentz covariance of the electromagnetic equations. However, he used the notion of an aether as a perfectly undetectable medium and distinguished between apparent and real time, so most historians of science argue that he failed to invent special relativity.|$|E
25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} great sense of duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who tried to go to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and worked very hard, both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work <b>he</b> <b>corrected</b> with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, you never had the impression that you were learning something boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of McCairns missions were successful. Perhaps his most dangerous mission {{was on the}} night of 14/15 April 1943 when an operator choose a field near Amboise that did not have a clear flare path. As he came in for his landing approach he struck a twelve-foot-tall poplar tree. McCairns asked the operator what the damage was and he was told none, only the radio aerial had been torn away. Without climbing down to inspect the damage for himself, McCairns took aboard his passengers and took off. He soon realised he had a more serious problem. The stick was shaking in his hand and his oil temperature was rising. Eventually the engine froze up. He began gliding down and decided they would all have to bail out. However, checking in with his passengers he was informed he was carrying four. Only having two parachutes in the back, he realized he would have to try a forced landing on the unknown ground below. With 3,000 feet to go he discovered the reason for the engine failure. The hot carburetor warmer had been knocked out of position. Once <b>he</b> <b>corrected</b> this he was able to restart the engine, and they resumed their rough flight back to RAF Tangmere. After landing it was discovered the spinner was stove in, and the tailplane had been nearly torn loose, held in place by the single remaining screw of a single bracket.|$|E
25|$|Maricello {{was pushing}} hard but {{lost control of}} his car at the R Bend and {{collided}} heavily with the barriers. He retired from the race and this put pressure off Félix da Costa who made use of his situation {{to close the gap}} to Lynn. Sims was running strongly but backed off at about lap ten {{as a result of an}} engine temperature sensor problem which <b>he</b> <b>corrected</b> by short shifting and pulling out off Derani's slipstream. Félix da Costa reduced the deficit to Lynn to just over one second with four laps left in the event. He got this gap down to 1.3 seconds under yellow flag conditions for Wolf's stranded car at Lisboa corner, but was unable to get close to affect an pass on Lynn who maintained the lead for the remainder of the race to win. Lynn became the seventh driver to have won the Macau Grand Prix for Theodore Racing. The previous year's winner Félix da Costa finished second, 1.173 seconds in arrears, while Derani completed the podium in third place. Off the podium, Sims finished in fourth position. King led Carlin teammates Jaafar and Sainz in the next three places. Blomqvist came from the back of the field to finish eighth with Latifi ninth. Ocon recovered from his race start stall to complete the top ten. Outside the top ten, Sekiguchi was eleventh and led fellow countryman Nakayama in twelfth. The British pairing of Buller and Tincknell followed in 13th and 14th with Chiyo, Giovinazzi, Mason, Van der Laar, Jones, Wolf and Korjus the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
