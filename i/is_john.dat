5|$|The most {{commonly}} suggested candidate for authorship <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Massey of Cotton, Cheshire.

St. Erkenwald, however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.|$|E

5|$|It was Scots {{that emerged}} as the {{language}} of national literature in Scotland. The first surviving major text <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Barbour's Brus (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion {{until the end of}} the war of independence. The work was extremely popular among the Scots-speaking aristocracy and Barbour is referred to as the father of Scots poetry, holding a similar place to his contemporary Chaucer in England. In the early 15th century these were followed by Andrew of Wyntoun's verse Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland and Blind Harry's The Wallace, which blended historical romance with the verse chronicle. They were probably influenced by Scots versions of popular French romances that were also produced in the period, including The Buik of Alexander, Launcelot o the Laik and The Porteous of Noblenes by Gibert Hay.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the play are drawn from Fielding's own experiences. During Act II, the {{characters}} Marplay and Sparkish, two theatre managers, offer poor advice to Luckless {{on how to improve}} his play, which they then reject. This fictional event mirrors Fielding's own life when Colley Cibber and Robert Wilks of the Theatre Royal rejected The Temple Beau. Cibber was an inspiration for the character of Marplay and Wilks for Sparkish, but Sparkish does not appear in the revised version of 1734, after Wilks's death. In his place Fielding introduces a character who mocks Theophilus Cibber, Colley's son, and his role in the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Another biographical parallel involves the relationship between Luckless and Mrs Moneywood, which is similar to Fielding's own relationship with Jan Oson, his landlord during his stay in Leiden in early 1729. There Fielding incurred a debt of about £13 (equivalent to about £1,760 as of 2008), and a legal case was brought against him. Abandoning his personal property, Fielding fled to London; Oson's seizure of Fielding's possessions mirrors Mrs Moneywood's threats to seize those belonging to Luckless. Other characters are modelled on well-known personalities of whom Fielding was aware though they were not personal acquaintances:: Mrs Novel is Eliza Haywood, a writer, actress, and publisher; Signior Opera is Senesino, a famous Italian contralto castrato; Bookweight is similar to Edmund Curll, a bookseller and publisher known for unscrupulous publication and publicity; Orator <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Henley, a clergyman, entertainer, and well-known orator; Monsieur Pantomime <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Rich, a director and theatre manager; and Don Tragedio is Lewis Theobald, an editor and author. Sir Farcical Comick is another version of Colley Cibber, but only in his role as an entertainer.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{fourteen}} current first ministers, two (Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne) are women. Two (Bob McLeod and Peter Taptuna) are indigenous. The longest-serving first minister is Brad Wall of Saskatchewan, who {{has held the}} position since November 21, 2007; the newest first minister <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Horgan of British Columbia, who assumed office on July 18, 2017. The oldest first minister, Bob McLeod of the Northwest Territories, was born in 1952, while the youngest, Brian Gallant of New Brunswick, was born in 1982. Of the current first ministers, eight are from a Liberal Party, two are from a New Democratic Party, one is from a Progressive Conservative Party, one is from the Saskatchewan Party, and two are non-partisan. Provincial parties are not, however, necessarily affiliated with or politically analogous to their federal counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Since 2005, the Toronto Blue Jays are {{the only}} team in Major League Baseball based outside of the United States.

Bobby Cox, who managed the team from 1982 to 1985, is the only Blue Jays skipper to win the Manager of the Year Award, which he received in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name <b>is</b> <b>John</b> or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 63 {{governors}} of Ohio, serving 69 distinct terms.

The shortest terms were held by John William Brown and Nancy Hollister, who each served for only 11 days after the governors preceding them resigned in order to begin the terms to {{which they had been}} elected in the United States Senate; the shortest-serving elected governor was John M.

5|$|The first {{surviving}} major text in Early Scots literature <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Barbour's Brus (1375), composed {{under the}} patronage of Robert II {{and telling the}} story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion {{till the end of}} the war of independence. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court, which included James I (who wrote The Kingis Quair). Many of the makars had a university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c.1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk, now largely lost. Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas have been seen as leading a golden age in Scottish poetry. In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the Auchinleck Chronicle, the first complete surviving work includes John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490). There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including The Book of the Law of Armys and the Order of Knychthode and the treatise Secreta Secetorum, an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle's advice to Alexander the Great. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados, which was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden.|$|E
