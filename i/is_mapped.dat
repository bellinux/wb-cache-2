5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A <b>is</b> <b>mapped</b> to p, while a <b>is</b> <b>mapped</b> to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E
30|$|We first {{discuss the}} strong {{relationship}} between RDR and default theories. We also characterised default theories that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to RDR trees. We then discuss the relationship between default theories and NRDR. We discuss how the policies presented {{in the previous section}} translate to constraints on default theories that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to NRDR. We will show how default theories, that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to NRDR, <b>are</b> less constrained than theories which can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to RDR. That is, the set of default theories that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to NRDR <b>is</b> larger than the set of those that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to RDR.|$|R

However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{application}} of functional graphs {{is in the}} trains used to study Steiner triple systems. The train of a triple system is a functional graph having a vertex for each possible triple of symbols; each triple pqr <b>is</b> <b>mapped</b> by ƒ to stu, where pqs, prt, and qru are the triples that belong to the triple system and contain the pairs pq, pr, and qr respectively. Trains {{have been shown to}} be a powerful invariant of triple systems although somewhat cumbersome to compute.|$|E
5|$|The cortex <b>is</b> <b>mapped</b> by {{divisions}} into {{about fifty}} different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E

40|$|Mapping {{expressed}} sequence tags (ESTs) to {{hexaploid wheat}} is aimed {{to reveal the}} structure and function of the hexaploid wheat genome. Sixty eight ESTs representing 26 genes <b>were</b> <b>mapped</b> into all seven homologous chromosome groups of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) using a polymerase chain reaction technique. The majority of the ESTs <b>were</b> <b>mapped</b> to homologous chromosome group 2, and the least <b>were</b> <b>mapped</b> to homologous chromosome group 6. Comparative analysis between the EST map from this study and the EST map based on RFLPs showed 14 genes that have <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> by both approaches <b>were</b> <b>mapped</b> to the same arm of the same homologous chromosome, which indicated that using PCR-based ESTs was a reliable approach in mapping ESTs in hexaploid wheat...|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} of these {{equations}} the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends toward zero. In the second, the ratio tends toward A'n/B'n as z tends to infinity. This leads us to our first geometric interpretation. If the continued fraction converges, the successive convergents A'n/B'n are eventually arbitrarily close together. Since the linear fractional transformation Τn(z) is a continuous mapping, there must be a neighborhood of z = 0 that <b>is</b> <b>mapped</b> into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of Τn(0) = A'n/B'n. Similarly, there must be a neighborhood of the point at infinity which <b>is</b> <b>mapped</b> into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of Τn(∞) = A'n-1/B'n-1. So if the continued fraction converges the transformation Τn(z) maps both very small z and very large z into an arbitrarily small neighborhood of x, the value of the continued fraction, as n gets larger and larger.|$|E
