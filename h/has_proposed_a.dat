Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.|$|E
5|$|The orphanage is {{currently}} owned by businessman John Ferrara who <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> number of redevelopments on the site, including the building's restoration.

It has been heritage listed by the Goulburn Mulwaree Council.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> {{theory of}} {{discourse}} ethics that he claims is {{a descendant of}} Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, 8,000 people {{commuted}} between Sotra and Bergen, and {{the bridge}} {{had an average}} daily traffic of 22,000 vehicles. On National Road 555 between Straume, the municipal center of Fjell, and Storavatnet, where National Road 555 becomes a motorway, there are long queues during rush hour. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> four-lane motorway along National Road 555 from Stoavatnet to Straume. This will require a new crossing across Knarreviksundet. Such a motorway extension is estimated to cost between NOK3 and 4 billion, {{and the government has}} allocated NOK400 million in National Transport Plan 2010–2019 for the project. It is presumed that most of the project will be financed as a toll road.|$|E
5|$|PennDOT has {{recently}} begun the Route 1011-Pond Eddy Bridge Replacement Project. Route 1011 is the internal designation for Flagstone Road, {{one of the}} two side roads in Pennsylvania along with the bridge. The state <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> four-span bridge with three connecting bridge piers, with four side options: replacing the bridge upstream, buying out the 26 residences on the Pennsylvania side, rehabilitating the structure to handle weights of 16-18 tons or maintain the bridge in its current form. Depending on which project is chosen, the estimated start would be in 2013, when the structure reaches its 110th year in use. The entire project would cost $8.5-11 million. Opponents of demolishing the bridge hope that they can find a place to move the bridge, which would cost $500,000, and have the new owners maintain it.|$|E

5|$|Since then Kasahara <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> {{definition}} {{between these}} two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers {{actively engaged in}} combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian National Rail Administration <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{upgrades}} to the Bergen Line {{that would allow}} total travel time between the termini to reduce to {{four and a half}} hours. The Ringerike Line is seen as the hallmark of this attempt, that was first launched by the director of NSB in 1954; sixty years later travel time remains at six and a half hours. The project is estimated to cost NOK 7 billion, of which NOK 4 billion would be for the line.|$|E
5|$|Ferrara <b>has</b> <b>{{proposed}}</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} redevelopments for the orphanage itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, {{he proposed a}} plan to redevelop the lot and building into 63 residential units. The proposed redevelopment was known as Glebe Gardens. Ferrara planned the construction of gardens and pools on the vacant grounds, but {{the front of the}} complex would face no development. Although the development application was approved by the city council, the plans were dropped because the costs to redevelop the lot were too great. In 2009, work began to revamp the orphanage and convert it into a retirement village, with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall. Two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage. He also stated {{that he was going to}} the fix up the orphanage once the proposed townhouses were under construction.|$|E

Football {{is the most}} popular sport in Malaysia and the country is currently studying the possibility of bidding as a joint host for 2034 FIFA World Cup. Badminton matches attract thousands of spectators, and since 1948 Malaysia has been one of four countries to hold the Thomas Cup, the world team championship trophy of men's badminton. The Malaysian Lawn Bowls Federation was registered in 1997. Squash was brought to the country by members of the British army, with the first competition being held in 1939. The Squash Racquets Association Of Malaysia was created on 25 June 1972. Malaysia <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> Southeast Asian football league. The men's national field hockey team ranked 13th in the world as of December 2015. The 3rd Hockey World Cup was hosted at Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the 10th cup. The country also has its own Formula One track–the Sepang International Circuit. It runs for , and held its first Grand Prix in 1999. Traditional sports include Silat Melayu, the most common style of martial arts practised by ethnic Malays in Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore.|$|E
