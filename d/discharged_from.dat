5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (<b>discharged)</b> <b>from</b> hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the fluctuation of}} precipitation and air temperature from Dunde ice core data since 1606 comparing to meteorological data taken near the July 1 st glacier since 1930 s. Then, we calculated the <b>discharges</b> <b>from</b> glaciers and glacier-free areaFurthermore, we analyzed the sensitivity of those discharges to meteorological factor. The result revealed that calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area increased with precipitation. Meanwhile, calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glaciers decreased with precipitation. Since little precipitation cause expose the glacier ice surface, which can absorb almost solar radiation, then glacier melt accelerated. Then, relatively large <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier can be provided when the <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area is less. Therefore, <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier {{make up for the}} shortage of <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area due to less precipitation. Then, water supply for living people in the oasis and desert would have been maintained from ancient days...|$|R

The purpose of <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> debts is ensuring relative satisfaction of creditors, which is not liquidating for the debtor, and enabling him a new life without debts. It concerns debtors non- entrepreneurs, natural persons and legal entities. Only the debtor is entitled to apply for <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> debts. The court shall while deciding on the debt discharge permission consider especially whether it is likely that at least 30 % of the claims of creditors receivable from the debtor will be settled and it shall also assess the honest intentions of the debtor.
