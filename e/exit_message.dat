5000|$|One {{recreational}} activity on Phoenix was the playing of interactive fiction games. Because {{the games were}} large and demanded significant machine resources whilst running, they were generally played outside of prime time, when research palled. (The <b>exit</b> <b>message</b> of one game, Fyleet written by Jonathan Partington in 1985, was [...] "Well go and do some work then".) Other games were Advent (a.k.a. Colossal Cave), Zork (a.k.a. Dungeon), and Acheton.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} investigating Changeable Message Signs (CMS) were {{to determine whether or}} not CMS messages really work, whether or not they cause traffic slow downs, and whether or not they have an impact on traffic flow. The participants were 120 licensed drivers from three age groups- 18 - 24, 32 - 47, and 55 - 65 years old. Two experiments were conducted in a fully-interactive, PC-based STISIM driving simulator. Experiment One investigated the effectiveness of the following message, CRASH/AT WYOMING AVE/USE THOMPSON EXIT. In Experiment Two, the final CMS message was: AMBER ALERT/RED FORD TRUCK/MN LIC# SLM 509. Results. In Experiment Two, only 8. 3 % of the participants had Excellent AMBER Recall Scores, while 51. 7 % had Good scores. Gender significantly affected the AMBER Recall Scores-there were more females than males in the Excellent Category. A greater proportion of those who knew what AMBER Alert meant were in the Excellent and Good Categories. 21. 7 % of the participants slowed down by at least 2 mph. Whether or not traffic delays will result from drivers slowing to read AMBER Alerts in real life will depend on the extent of the slow downs and on current traffic density. In Experiment One, 55. 8 % of the participants took the Thompson Exit after seeing the Thompson <b>Exit</b> <b>Message.</b> Of the 53 participants who did not take the exit (1) 35. 9 % ignored the CMS message because they did not think that it applied to them; (2) 35. 9 % did not understand the CMS message; and (3) 22. 5 % did not notice the message. (It is not known why 5. 7 % of the 53 did not take the exit.) Changes to the wording of the messages are recommended. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E

5000|$|The {{style in}} which Graham left, in {{combination}} with his quick departures from other universities, led to criticism of Graham in both local and national media. [...] University of Pittsburgh players also openly criticized Graham for his quick departure. Defensive tackle Chas Alecxih said most players were [...] "shocked and appalled." [...] Wide receiver Devin Street's comments were a little more severe stating, [...] "It's been all a lie this whole time. Everything he told us has been a lie." [...] Another one of Graham's players at the time, senior offensive tackle Lucas Nix, stated that he felt Graham's <b>exiting</b> text <b>message</b> wasn't worthy of the trust the team had put into Graham and his program.

40|$|The VCM (Vessel Communication Manager) {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} consists of ARP (Azimuth based Routing Protocol) and NATF (Network Attack Traceback Facility). The ARP can transmit accident information from a source to a headquarter rapidly and accurately by using Azimuths. It designs the Ac-RREQ message that appends an azimuth, a cumulation S/N, and a standby packet count field to the <b>exiting</b> RREQ <b>message</b> and the Ac-RREP message that appends an azimuth and a cumulation S/N field to the existing RREP message. It adjusts the transmission scope of the Ac-RREQ message with azimuths and decides the optimal path by judging the priority of Ac-RREP with the standby packet count and the cumulation S/N. Therefore, its simulation shows that the transmission time of the Ac-RREQ message is reduced more largely than the existing RREQ by using azimuths. In collision, as it transmits data through optimal paths, not only unexpected accidents are prevented with an urgent action, but also the life of nodes is prolonged due to the energy-saving of nodes. And, the NATF can trace back network attacks happening inter-vessel by recording the routes of routers with marking and logging function and can reduce a traceback overhead because of not marking all the packets...|$|R
5000|$|From the {{earliest}} days MPI provided facilities for performance profiling via the PMPI [...] "profiling system". The use of the PMIPI- prefix allows for the observation of the entry and <b>exit</b> points for <b>messages.</b> However, given the high level nature of this profile, this type of information only provides a glimpse at the real behavior of the communication system. The need for more information resulted {{in the development of}} the MPI-Peruse system. Peruse provides a more detailed profile by enabling applications to gain access to state-changes within the MPI-library. This is achieved by registering callbacks with Peruse, and then invoking them as triggers as message events take place. Peruse can work with the PARAVER visualization system. PARAVER has two components, a trace component and a visual component for analyze the traces, the statistics related to specific events, etc. PARAVER may use trace formats from other systems, or perform its own tracing. It operates at the task level, thread level, and in a hybrid format. Traces often include so much information that they are often overwhelming. Thus PARAVER summarizes them to allow users to visualize and analyze them.|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to a previous work, in this paper, we present a DJSC code design approach {{for a pair of}} correlated binary sources, in which the degree profile of a systematic irregular LDPC (SI-LDPC) code is optimized for the joint distribution of the two sources and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the GMAC. Our motivations for using SI-LDPC codes are the following: (1) systematic codes can be used to exploit inter-source correlation in joint decoding of the two codes, (2) LDPC codes can be optimized by linear programming, in conjunction with the EXIT analysis of the belief propagation (BP)-based joint decoder, and (3) LDPC codes are known to be capacity achieving for a single-user case[13] and hence will exhibit very good performance in coding correlated sources as well. One of the key issues addressed here is the mutual information computation (as required for <b>EXIT</b> analysis) for <b>messages</b> passed from factor nodes in the joint factor graph of the two LDPC codes, referred to as source channel factor (SCF) nodes, which represent the joint probabilities of the two sources and the output conditional probability density function (pdf) of the GMAC. It is shown that the analytical computation of mutual information based on additive combining of incoming LLRs in variable nodes and parity check nodes of a factor graph as done in single LDPC codes does not apply to SCF nodes. In order to make the mutual information computation in EXIT analysis, tractable using a Gaussian approximation[14], we propose a simple numerical approach based on Monte-Carlo simulations to fit a Gaussian pdf to outgoing LLRs from the SCF nodes. Simulation results show that codes designed based on this method can not only outperform previously reported GMAC codes for both independent and correlated sources[9, 11], but can also achieve code rates higher than the theoretical upper-bound for independent sources over the same GMAC, when the sources are strongly dependent.|$|R
