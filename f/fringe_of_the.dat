5|$|NY458 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY11B in Hopkinton {{at the western}} <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawrence hamlet of Nicholville. The route heads southeast, loosely paralleling the St. Regis River as it proceeds through rural eastern St. Lawrence County. After , it passes into both the Franklin County town of Waverly and Adirondack Park.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, NY12 and NY28 were shifted westward onto a new bypass {{around the}} village of Remsen. NY28B was {{extended}} southward along NY12 and NY28's former alignment on Main Street and westward on Steuben Street to meet the new highway. The NY28B designation was eliminated in the mid-1960s and replaced with NY920V, an unsigned reference route. Around the same time, NY287 was realigned onto the bypass that now carries NY365 around the northern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village of Prospect, truncating NY920V to its current length.|$|E
5|$|NY33 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s, {{but only to}} the portion of its modern routing between Batavia and Rochester. It was extended on both ends—to Buffalo {{in the west and}} Marion in the east—as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, the eastern extension was eliminated in 1949. In Buffalo, NY33 was moved onto the Kensington Expressway in the mid-1960s, and its former surface routing along Genesee Street subsequently became the short-lived New York State Route33B. Smaller realignments in the years since have moved NY33's western terminus from the heart of downtown Buffalo to the northern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's center.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Castorland, {{the road}} runs across a half-mile (0.8km) stretch of undeveloped land prior to {{crossing}} the Black River, {{which serves as}} {{the boundary between the}} towns of Denmark and Croghan. On the opposite riverbank, NY410 continues across another open stretch to reach the small hamlet of Naumburg. Here, the route passes a handful of homes and intersects the north end of CR33 (Van Amber Road) before ending at an intersection with NY126 on the northeastern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hamlet. While NY410 terminates at this junction, its right-of-way continues past NY126 as Cross Road, a local highway connecting Naumburg to CR8 (Second Road).|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins to}} curve north, interchanging with Bridgeport Road. The highway crosses the Conestoga Creek as it {{interchanges}} with University Avenue, then gradually curves to the west. After an interchange with King Street, once the original routing of Highway85, the route curves {{back to the}} north and interchanges with Northfield Drive. As it approaches the rural–urban <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tri-city area, the freeway interchanges with King Street a second time. Highway85 ends {{at the north end of}} the ramps from King Street, as does the Conestoga Parkway. The divided freeway ends and the route become Waterloo Regional Road85, which continues north to St. Jacobs and Elmira.|$|E
5|$|There are Local Nature Reserves at Wellington Basins on {{the western}} <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. It {{includes}} a small pond and boardwalk {{with a variety of}} wildlife habitats. The grassland, hedges and woodland are home to a varied flora and fauna including birds such as the grey wagtail, dipper and reed bunting. Five separate bat species have been recorded at the site. Swains Pond in the south of Wellington is another Local Nature Reserve, which used to be the site of orchards. It now includes a pond which provides a home for amphibians including the great crested newt, palmate newt and toads.|$|E

5|$|A two-laned Ninth Line curves {{northeast}} after {{crossing and}} being crossed by two separate railway tracks (the Canadian Pacific (CP) Havelock Subdivision and the Canadian National Halton subdivision) and becomes Donald Cousens Parkway, expanding to four lanes and travelling {{along the eastern}} <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community of Box Grove, alongside which {{it was built in}} the mid-2000s. On the west side is a new residential subdivision, while on the east side beyond the CP Havelock subdivision, which the road parallels, is the completely undeveloped Bob Hunter Memorial Park. After passing Box Grove Bypass, where for some time the route ended, the road also becomes known as Box Grove Collector Road (BGCR). The route intersects 14th Avenue (York Regional Road71) and continues as before, eventually curving north and meeting Copper Creek Drive while departing from the railway tracks and park. It passes a supercenter before an interchange with Highway407, where it crosses over the toll route.|$|E
5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided {{bend in the}} road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes in from the west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Welland River, the original {{route of the}} Welland Canal, the freeway exits the forests and enters agricultural land surrounding the suburbs of Niagara Falls, which the highway enters north of the McLeod Road interchange. Within the city, Highway420 meets the QEW at a large stack interchange, which replaced the former Lundy's Lane / Highway20 interchange. Exiting the northern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, the freeway curves northwest and begins to descend through the Niagara Escarpment, a World Biosphere Reserve. Highway405, {{also known as the}} General Brock Parkway, merges with the QEW along the short rural stretch between Niagara Falls and St. Catharines. While there is no Toronto-bound access, Niagara-bound drivers can follow Highway405 to Lewiston, New York. The QEW continues west into St. Catharines.|$|E

5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town of Cairo. It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo, but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E
5|$|North of the Lewiston village limits, NY18F is {{the closest}} roadway to the Niagara River, a trait {{reflected}} in its name of Lower River Road. As it progresses northward along the eastern bank of the river, NY18F parallels both the Niagara Scenic State Parkway and NY18. At Stella Niagara, NY18F meets Pletcher Road, the first road north of Lewiston that provides a connection to all three roadways. NY18F continues on, passing through the western extent of Joseph Davis State Park south of the village of Youngstown {{in the town of}} Lewiston. In Youngstown, NY18F becomes Main Street and intersects the western terminus of NY93 in the village center. At the northern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, NY18F intersects the southern entrance to the Fort Niagara State Park. NY18F bypasses the park, turning east onto Jackson Street, then north onto Lake Road as it follows the perimeter of the park.|$|E
5|$|US 113 next {{comes to}} Dagsboro, which {{is named for}} French and Indian War and American Revolutionary War general and major Sussex County {{landowner}} John Dagworthy. The highway crosses Pepper Creek and intersects DE 26 (Clayton Street/Nine Foot Road), which heads east to Bethany Beach, while it passes through the western <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. North of Dagsboro, US 113 intersects DE20 (Dagsboro Road); the U.S. Highway and state highway run concurrently through the town of Millsboro, which was named for the cluster of mills around the head of navigation of the Indian River. The highways intersect DE24 and DE30 (Washington Street/Laurel Road) west of the town center. After crossing Betts Pond, DE20 splits to the northwest as Hardscrabble Road as US113 itself turns northwest toward the hamlet of Stockley. North of Stockley, US113 intersects DE24Alternate (Speedway Road) adjacent to Georgetown Speedway and passes west of the Sussex Correctional Institution.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1980s, NY21 entered Canandaigua on Bristol Street and {{followed}} it to South Main Street (then-US20 and NY5), where it joined its current alignment. When the Western Bypass around the southwestern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city {{was constructed in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s, US20 and NY5 were realigned to follow the highway around the city. NY21 was also realigned {{at this time to}} follow its modern routing on the bypass and South Main Street. The segment of Bristol Street vacated by NY21 between the Western Bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as unsigned NY943A until September1, 1996, when maintenance of the road was turned over to the town of Canandaigua. However, the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007.|$|E
5|$|West of {{the city}} of Watertown, NY3 intersects NY180 {{southwest}} of the Watertown International Airport before connecting to I-81 by way of an interchange at the city line. NY3 heads east into Watertown, intersecting with both US11 and NY12 at Massey Street. At this point, maintenance of NY3 shifts from the state to the city of Watertown. The route overlaps NY12 southbound and a short piece of US11 northbound through downtown to Public Square, where NY3 meets northbound NY12. US11 northbound leaves NY3 here while the overlap between NY3 and NY12 continues eastward through Watertown. The concurrency ends near the eastern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, where NY3 leaves NY12 and becomes state-maintained once more as it departs the city to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 2:45UTC on July 9, {{the hurricane}} made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, Cindy began re-curving northwestward along the fall line, and eventually weakened to a tropical depression. The depression abruptly {{turned toward the}} east-northeast over North Carolina during the afternoon hours of July 9. Cindy then began to accelerate as it curved slightly towards the northeast, and eventually regained tropical storm status late on July 10 as it emerged into the Atlantic. Cindy scraped the southern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delmarva Peninsula {{near the mouth of}} the Chesapeake Bay at approximately 00:00UTC on July 11, and rapidly traveled northeastward during the day. Cindy passed over Cape Cod near the mid-morning of July 11, during which a series of shortwave troughs passed near the storm, producing high-level outflow that helped Cindy maintain intensity. Later on July 11, Cindy moved ashore in New Brunswick and made landfall over Prince Edward Island the following day. The storm subsequently moved over Quebec and Labrador, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945, the Waffen Mountain (Karstjäger) Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the Julian Alps, and was then {{deployed}} to the coastal area around Trieste and the Marano-Grado Lagoon. In {{danger of being}} cut off by Allied forces, the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps, having to fight {{its way through the}} Tagliamento river valley between Osoppo and Gemona. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought British and New Zealand forces on the southern <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Julian Alps. The brigade replacement company, which had been sent to Cividale from its training centre at Pottenstein, Bavaria, managed to destroy a number of British tanks with panzerfausts and the assistance of a tank company. In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) commanded by SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS (Brigadier) Heinz Harmel, which was ordered to keep the Karawanks passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The Kampfgruppe succeeded in its final task, {{and was one of the}} last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon first {{affected}} the Northern Marianas Islands, where it left US$2.5million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114homes. The damage {{was enough to}} warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western <b>fringe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4million in damage. About 250,000people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left ¥4.08billion (US$36.9million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322mm (52.0in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29people and caused ¥94.9billion (US$854million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon {{affected the}} Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped {{the equivalent of the}} monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35people, and its effects were significant enough for the name to be retired.|$|E
