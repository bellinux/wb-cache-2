She left in 1934, after {{a dispute with}} the co-founder Col. Edwin Marshall Hadley, and it folded soon after {{due to lack of}} interest. With McCord's encouragement, her lectures were published in a local Wilmette newspaper in 1932, and then collected in a pamphlet entitled Red Revolution: <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> It Here?

500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do this? What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it to be about? What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Using two {{digital video}} (DV) cameras, Bartley and ÓBriain shot over 200 hours of {{material}} on 300 DV tapes. They intended that editing take ten weeks; instead, it took six months. Rod Stoneman, BSÉ's CEO at the time, described {{the amount of}} footage compared to the film's final length as [...] "exceptional". The 200:1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries, which usually have a ratio of 10:1 or 15:1. When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, El juego de Cuba, so they hired its editor, Ángel Hernández Zoido. Zoido approached the film {{as if it were}} entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored. He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the rushes with Bartley and ÓBriain, Zoido asked them, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to tell in this scene?" [...] He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.|$|E

500|$|Del Toro and Bickford hired screenwriter Benjamin A. van der Veen {{to write}} the screenplay's first drafts, and their {{extensive}} research took them to Cuba where they met with several of the remaining members of Guevara's team in Bolivia {{as well as the}} revolutionary's wife and children. [...] It was during this phase of development that the filmmakers discovered Terrence Malick had been in Bolivia as a journalist in 1966 working on a story about Che. [...] Malick came on as director and worked on the screenplay with van der Veen and Del Toro, but after a year-and-a-half, the financing had not come together entirely and Malick left to make The New World, a film about Jamestown, Virginia. Afraid that their multi-territory deals would fall apart, Bickford and Del Toro asked Steven Soderbergh, who was previously on board as producer, to direct. The filmmaker was drawn to the contrast of [...] "engagement versus disengagement. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to participate or observe? Once Che made the decision to engage, he engaged fully. Often people attribute that to a higher power, but as an atheist, he didn't have that. I found that very interesting". Furthermore, he remarked that Guevara was [...] "great movie material" [...] and [...] "had one of the most fascinating lives" [...] that he could [...] "imagine in the last century". Bickford and Del Toro realized that there was no context for what made Guevara decide to go to Bolivia. They began looking for someone to rewrite the screenplay; [...] Peter Buchman was recommended to them because he had a good reputation for writing about historical figures, based on a script he worked about Alexander the Great. He spent a year reading every available book on Guevara in preparation for writing the script. The project was put on hold when Bickford and Del Toro made Traffic with Soderbergh.|$|E

Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band. During an interview, Lee has said, [...] "I don't know, I just think it's exactly what I would've expected. He's more about kind of the pop influence sort of thing and also, you know, about being commercial and I mean selling albums: That's the part of him we often disagreed on. I wanted to do the more artistic weird thing and he'd wanna do the thing that people would want to hear..."

By the mid-December 2009, the band had finished with the recording of the album. Just before Christmas, they invited people from the European record company people to a listening session. After they listened to the whole album {{the next day the}} management told the band that the record company loved it and that it was the best record in years. The management proposed the idea of this album being the last studio album and announcing a final tour. Matthias Jabs explained [...] "We had never spent a second thinking about this.

We were taken back a bit, but after a couple days living with the thought we decided together – that would be the right thing to <b>do.</b> <b>We</b> <b>want</b> to go out on top while we are still healthy and can still do a high-energy show that’s two, sometimes three hours a night." ...|$|E
