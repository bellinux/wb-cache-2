5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 <b>guidance</b> <b>section.</b> The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{financial}} issues of the CAP reform {{at the edge of}} the EU enlargement, looking at the new distribution of resources programmed for the “second pillar” of the CAP. More in details, the papers focuses on three aspects: the distribution of resources coming from the implementation of modulation of direct payments, with regards to both the current and the new Member States; the future financial perspectives for Rural Development Regulation (RDR) in the framework of the cohesion policies, in the light of the proposal of a “single Fund ” that include both Guarantee and <b>Guidance</b> <b>sections</b> of the EAGGF; the new distribution of resources for Rural Development Plans (RDPs) as it comes out of the “Objective Criteria ” coming from the European Commission. Modulation of direct payments is the current only instruments that actively shifts resources from the first to the second pillar of the CAP. The proposal of a single fund would change the geography and the distribution of resources for the second pillar quite consistently. It would also affect the equity of the “objective criteria”, that would probably will be debated and eventually revised...|$|R
