25|$|An {{advantage}} of index-based <b>insurance</b> <b>is</b> {{that it can}} potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based <b>insurance</b> <b>is</b> the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second {{advantage of}} index-based <b>insurance</b> <b>is</b> that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index <b>insurance</b> <b>is</b> that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.|$|E

25|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>is</b> {{a method}} of {{shifting}} risk from one party to another.

While <b>insurance</b> <b>is</b> sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an insurable interest, the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{disagree}} {{on the effects of}} insurance on fertilizer application rates. The effect of increased fertilizer on the probability of low yields primarily determines whether fertilizer and <b>insurance</b> <b>are</b> substitutes or complements. We estimate conditional distributions of corn yields to determine if the technical relationship between yields and fertilizer supports the hypothesis that insurance increases optimal application rates. Our results indicate no support for this hypothesis. At all nitrogen fertilizer rates and reasonable levels of risk aversion, nitrogen fertilizer and <b>insurance</b> <b>are</b> substitutes, suggesting that those who purchase <b>insurance</b> <b>are</b> likely to decrease nitrogen fertilizer applications.
