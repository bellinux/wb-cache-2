50|$|The {{eruption}} {{entered a}} new stage on January 11, 2015, when the volcano began sending ash plumes as high as 9 km into the sky. An Air New Zealand flight on January 12 had to be diverted to Samoa, while {{a number of other}} flights between New Zealand and Tonga were cancelled. An ash plume reached 4.5 km on January 13, and the large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus released underwater caused an explosion in the growth of algae and causing a red tide. Officials identified two vents, one on Hunga Haapai and another about 100 m offshore and underwater. Large rocks and wet, <b>dense</b> <b>ash</b> were being ejected up to 400 m into the air. By January 16, a new island had been formed by the explosion. Tongan officials estimated the new island to be 1 km wide, 2 km long, and 100 m high, although geologists said the new island would probably exist only a few months until ocean waves wore it down. Ash and acid rain were falling in an area about 10 km from the new island, and Hunga Tonga and Hunga Haapai had both been denuded of vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Advancements in {{fertilizers}} and natural pesticides {{have all but}} eliminated the need to burn fields. Sugarcane fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. There has been less burning due to pressure from the public and health authorities, {{and as a result}} of the recent development of effective harvesting machines. In the mid 90s, it was very common to experience quite <b>dense</b> <b>ash</b> rains in cities within the sugarcane's fields during harvest seasons.A 2001 state law banned burning in sugarcane fields in São Paulo state by 2021, and machines will gradually replace human labor as the means of harvesting cane, except where the abrupt terrain does not allow for mechanical harvesting. However, 150 out of 170 of São Paulo's sugar cane processing plants signed in 2007 a voluntary agreement with the state government to comply by 2014. Independent growers signed in 2008 the voluntary agreement to comply, and the deadline was extended to 2017 for sugar cane fields located in more abrupt terrain. By the 2009/10 harvest season more than 50% of the cane was collected in São Paulo with harvesting machines. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, but also will create unemployment for these seasonal workers, many of them coming from the poorest regions of Brazil. Due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined as each harvester machine replaces about 100 cane cutters a day and creates 30 jobs including operators and maintenance teams.|$|E

It includes {{an evaluation of the}} previous work, a rigorous experimental investigation, a new and original model for determining pipeline pressure drop characteristics and a new method of characterising typically homogeneous fluid behaviour based on a particle size distribution, slope factor and a median particle size. The experimental investigation was undertaken to obtain data for modelling the flow of <b>dense</b> phase fly <b>ash</b> slurries. Tests were conducted using fly ashes from different power stations in a purposely built test facility. The test facility contained 50 mm and 80 mm bore internal pipeline viscometers in series. Slurry pump discharge pressure, differential pressure over 5 meters of a 80 mm pipe section, differential pressure over 5 meters of a 50 mm of pipe section, slurry temperature, slurry volumetric and mass flowrates were measured. Slurries settling were determined visually using an 80 mm glass pipe section. The particle size distribution and solids density of the fly ash were analysed and the solids concentration of the slurries were determined using the wet weight, drying and dry weight method. The experimental results were used to develop a new model to determine the pressure drop characteristics of <b>dense</b> phase fly <b>ash</b> slurry pumping systems and grout pumping plants, in order to develop a new description of what typical characteristics homogeneous fluid contain.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} twenty years Mount Etna has {{produced}} more than one hundred explosive events ranging from light ash emissions to violent sub-plinian eruptions. Significant hazards arise from tephra plumes which directly threaten air traffic, and generate fallout affecting surrounding towns and infrastructures. We describe the first radar system, named VOLDORAD 2 B, fully integrated into a volcano instrumental network dedicated to the continuous near-source monitoring of tephra emissions from Etna's summit craters. This 23. 5 cm wavelength pulsed Doppler radar is operated in collaboration between the Observatoire de Physique du Globe de Clermont-Ferrand (OPGC) and the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Osservatorio Etneo (INGV-OE) since 2009. Probed volumes inside the fixed, northward-pointing conical beam total about 1. 5 km in length, covering the summit craters which produced all recent tephra plumes. The backscattered power, related to the amount of particles crossing the beam, and particle along-beam velocities are recorded every 0. 23 s, providing a proxy for the tephra mass eruption rate. Radar raw data are transmitted in real-time to the volcano monitoring center of INGV-OE in Catania and are used to automatically release alerts at onset and end of eruptive events. Processed radar parameters are also made available from the VOLDORAD database online ([URL] In addition to eruptive crater discrimination by range gating, relative variations of eruption intensity can be tracked, including through overcast weather when other optical or infrared methods may fail to provide information. Short-lived <b>dense</b> <b>ash</b> emissions can be detected as illustrated for weak ash plumes from the Bocca Nuova and New South East craters in 2010. The comparison with thermal images suggests that the front mushroom of individual ash plumes holds the largest particles (coarse ash and small lapilli) and concentrations at least within the first hundred meters. For these short-lived ash plumes, the highest particle mass flux seems to occur typically within the first 10 s. We also analyze data from the first lava fountain generating an ash and lapilli plume on 12 January 2011 that initiated a series of 25 paroxysmal episodes of the New South East Crater until April 2012. We illustrate the pulsating behavior of the lava fountain and show that vertical velocities reached 250 m s− 1 (with brief peaks exceeding 300 m s− 1), leading to mean and maximum tephra fluxes (DRE) of 185 and 318 m 3 s− 1 (with peaks exceeding 380 m 3 s− 1) respectively, and a total volume of pyroclasts emitted during the lava fountain phase of 1. 3 × 106 m 3.

40|$|Understanding of {{the dynamic}} {{particulate}} flow structures within a <b>dense</b> gas-fly <b>ash</b> pneumatic conveyor must be improved {{in order to better}} aid its design guidance. The complex pulsatile movement of the gas-fly ash mixture dominates the flow performance within the pipeline, and historically, non-invasive measurement devices such as the electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) were often used to sufficiently capture the flow dynamics. However, inadequate studies have been conducted on the pulsatile flow phenomenon, which directly relate to the gas-fly ash two-phase flow performance. This paper aims to investigate the pulsatile flows using an ECT device. Initially, pulsatile flow patterns under various experimental conditions were obtained through ECT. Pulses within a flow were then characterised into pulse growth and decay segments, which represent the superficial fluidisation and deaeration processes during conveying. Subsequently, structural and statistical analyses were performed on the pulse growth and decay segments. Results suggested that the increasing air mass flow rate led to the decrease of the superficial fluidisation/deaeration magnitude, however, the increase of the superficial fluidisation/deaeration durations. Also, the air mass flow rate was indicated as the dominant factor in determining the pulsing statistical parameters.

The ash retention area underwent a tight scrutiny by Environment Protection Agency from early 2005 until May 2006 where approval was granted for placement of <b>dense</b> phased fly <b>ash</b> in HARA. During this phase, the permeability of 1. 0 metre thick clay liner placed {{on the floor of}} proposed ash retention area was required to be proven not higher than the EPA standard permeability of 1 x 10 E- 9 m/s for similar hazardous material placements in Victoria, Australia. The ash retention area was 240, 000 m 3 and laboratory permeability testing for samples obtained in a 50 metres grid of the clay liner was considered as expensive and time consuming. In addition, it was feared that the samples may be disturbed considerably during sampling for laboratory permeability testing. As a consequence resulting permeability for the liner would be higher than its natural permeability. Standard field tests conducted for determination of soil permeability such as constant head and falling head tests could not be conducted in a metre thick impermeable Clay liner due to the limitation of methodologies. A double ring permeability test method was then conducted {{on the floor of the}} ash retention area. The method resulted in serious errors due to leaking water from and among rings. This was mainly due to types and grading of the materials used in construction of the impermeable clay liner. Finally as an alternative method for testing permeability of the clay liner, a soil percolation test was proposed. Since permeability could not be directly measured from the soil percolation test,...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a series of}} models which illustrate the controls upon the evolution of an erupting mixture of ash and gas during an explosive volcanic eruption. For large eruption rates, material typically issues from a crater as a supersonic jet which may entrain and heat sufficient air to become buoyant and form a Plinian eruption column.
