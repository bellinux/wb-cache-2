30|$|Different from {{traditional}} wired scheduling problems, packet scheduling in BWA networks will encounter two major difficulties: the high variability of wireless channel {{conditions and the}} unknown model of packet arrival process. The capacity of wireless channel usually suffers either moderate or drastic fluctuations due to the signal attenuation, inter-user <b>interference,</b> <b>fading</b> and user mobility, and so forth. As a result, the channel conditions of users may vary with time and location asynchronously at random, leading to the so-called time-dependent error and location-dependent error [1]. In BWA networks, the process of packet arrivals is generally complicated and hard to accurately model in advance, since the packet arrivals are induced by the aggregation of multiple classes of traffic with different properties, such as constant and variable rates, and continuous and burst modes.|$|E

This paper considers binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation in a flat Rayleigh-fading environment {{when the number of}} in-terferences L is no less than the number of antenna elements N(L N). The approach of this paper and its main contribu-tion is to carry out the analysis in a multivariate framework. Using this approach and with the assumption of equal-power interferers, it is shown that the probability density function of the maximum signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the output of the optimum combiner has a Hotelling T 2 distribution. Closed form expressions using hypergeometric functions are derived for the outage probability and the average probability of bit error.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) are {{considered}} an attractive {{alternative to the}} traditional wired backbone networks for broadband Internet access. However, their capacity is limited {{due to the nature}} of the radio channel, which must be shared by the nodes forwarding the traffic from and to the gateway. Therefore, estimating the capacity of WMNs is an important question. The capacity analysis proposed for ad hoc networks can not be directly applied to WMN due to some fundamental differences, e. g. a different traffic pattern and node density. The main contribution of this work is the application of collision domains concept to the IEEE 802. 16 based WMNs. We consider a simple chain topology but the method can be extended to any arbitrary topology and the real world impairments (<b>interference,</b> <b>fading,</b> etc.) can be easily incorporated in the analysis.
