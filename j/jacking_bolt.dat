40|$|A failed <b>jack</b> {{attachment}} <b>bolt</b> {{belonging to}} an aircraft {{was sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the bolt has failed by reverse bending fatigue. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were found responsible for the fatigue crack initiation and fatigue appears to be stress related. It is recommended that the assembly in question be subjected to inspection for identification of the reverse bending load on the <b>jack</b> attachment <b>bolt</b> and corrective measures incorporated to prevent recurrence of similar failures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} a new pre-tensional structure(FROMO preload nut) applied in the large size of screw thread was introduced, the preload bolt is only beared with the pure tensile stress. The pre-tightening force for the preload bolt and pre-tightening torque for the <b>jack</b> <b>bolts</b> were calculated. The {{practice}} elongation value of the preload bolt was measured, and compared with its theoretical elongation value. The result shows that: the new pre-tensional structure has adequate strength, it can control the pre-tightening force accurately with manual acting spanner, it increases efficiency and ensures the safety of operating, and which has promised the good performance {{in the application of}} the projects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to apply the correct engineering principles to establish the relationship between tightening torque and bolt preload and to verify the loosening characteristics of bolted joint under transverse vibration condition by experimental setup under the application of wrenching torque. A simplified bolted joint including a holed plate with assembly of single <b>bolt</b> and Multiple <b>Jack</b> <b>Bolt</b> Nut was considered to carry out the experiments. The same experiment was carried out with the standard nut with spring washer assembly for comparison. Experiment was carried out on a test setup called as Junker’s Transverse Vibration Machine. The relation between the clamping force and number of cycles have been displayed in graphs...|$|R

John [...] "Jack" [...] Bolt, USMC (Ret). A former New Smyrna Beach resident, Lt. Col. Bolt was both an aerial ace and a recipient of the Navy Cross. [...] While flying the F4U Corsair with VMF-214, LtCol Bolt shot down six Japanese Zero fighters during World War II. During the Korean War, while on an exchange assignment with the U.S. Air Force's 39th Fighter Interceptor Squadron flying the F-86 Sabrejet, LtCol Bolt also shot down six North Korean MiG-15 jet fighters. A military aircraft propeller and a plaque commemorating LtCol Bolt's accomplishments was erected at the airport in 2006.|$|R

40|$|The MCO is {{designed}} to facilitate the removal, processing and storage of the spent nuclear fuel currently stored in the East and West K-Basins. The MCO is a stainless steel canister approximately 24 inches in diameter and 166 inches long with cover cap installed. The shell and the collar which is welded to the shell are fabricated from 304 / 304 L dual certified stainless steel for the shell and F 304 /F 304 L dual certified for the collar. The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with <b>jacking</b> <b>bolts</b> to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a process tube is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool. After being removed from the pool, the locking ring is installed and the <b>jacking</b> <b>bolts</b> are tightened to pre-load the metal main closure seal. The cask is then sealed and the MCO taken to the Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) facility for bulk water removal and vacuum drying through the process ports. Covers for the process ports may be installed or removed as needed per operating procedures. The MCO is then transferred to the Canister Storage Building (CSB), in the closed transfer cask. At the CSB, the MCO is then removed from the cask and becomes one of two MCOs stacked in a storage tube. MCOs will have a cover cap welded over the shield plug providing a complete welded closure. A number of MCOs may be stored with just the mechanical seal to allow monitoring of the MCO pressure, temperature, and gas composition...|$|R

5000|$|High {{pressure}} air (HPA) {{systems are}} {{a type of}} pneumatic airsoft weapon that use externally supplied high pressure air instead of internal gas canisters like the majority of gas-operated airsoft guns.

The engine is powered by a fire control unit that can adjust to the desired rates of fire as well as the dwell that determines how much air is released with each individual shot.

40|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) has recently expanded its range from lodgepole pine forest into the lodgepole × jack pine hybrid zone in central Alberta, within {{which it has}} attacked pure jack pine. This study tested the effects of water limitation on tree defense response of mature lodgepole and jack pine (Pinus contorta and Pinus banksiana) trees in the field. Tree defense response was initiated by inoculation of trees with the MPB-associated fungus Grosmannia clavigera and measured through monoterpene emission from tree boles and concentration of defensive compounds in phloem, needles, and necrotic tissues. Lodgepole pine generally emitted higher amounts of monoterpenes than jack pine; particularly from fungal-inoculated trees. Compared to non-inoculated trees, fungal inoculation increased monoterpene emission in both species, whereas water treatment {{had no effect on}} monoterpene emission. The phloem of both pine species contains (-) -α-pinene, the precursor of the beetle’s aggregation pheromone, however lodgepole pine contains two times as much as jack pine. The concentration of defensive compounds was 70 -fold greater in the lesion tissue in jack pine, but only 10 -fold in lodgepole pine compared to healthy phloem tissue in each species, respectively. Water-deficit treatment inhibited an increase of L-limonene as response to fungal inoculation in lodgepole pine phloem. The amount of myrcene in jack pine phloem was higher in water-deficit trees compared to ambient trees. Beetles reared in jack pine were not affected by either water or biological treatment, whereas beetles reared in lodgepole pine benefited from fungal inoculation by producing larger and heavier female offspring. Female beetles that emerged from <b>jack</b> pine <b>bolts</b> contained more fat than those that emerged from lodgepole pine, even though lodgepole pine phloem had a higher nitrogen content than jack pine phloem. These results suggest that jack pine chemistry is suitable for MPB pheromone production and aggregation on the host tree...|$|R
25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then <b>jacked</b> down and <b>bolted</b> to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|R
