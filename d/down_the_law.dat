5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E

The Supreme Court agreed, striking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> as unconstitutional. In 1893, Congress mandated a new system of highways within the District that conformed to the City of Washington's street plan but left existing streets in place. A separate act of Congress in 1895 required that the street names in Georgetown be changed to conform to the street naming system used in the City of Washington.

In response, the Kentucky General Assembly passed {{an act that}} granted debtors a grace period of two years in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept payment in the devalued notes of the Bank of the Commonwealth. The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> claiming it was {{in violation of the}} Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The angered legislature attempted to impeach the justices on the Court of Appeals, but lacked the necessary two-thirds majority. Instead, they abolished the Court of Appeals and replaced it with a new court, which was stocked with more sympathetic justices by pro-relief governor John Adair. Both courts claimed to be Kentucky's court of last resort.|$|E
500|$|The Kentucky Court of Appeals, {{then the}} state's court of last resort, struck <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> {{ordering}} a two-year stay of replevin because it impaired {{the obligation of}} contracts.

Biddle, holding that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky before Kentucky became a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict. [...] Adair denounced this decision in an 1823 message to the legislature, warning against federal and judicial interference in the will of the people, expressed through the legislature. [...] Emboldened by Adair's message, Relief partisans sought to remove the three justices of the state Court of Appeals, as well as James Clark, a lower court judge who had issued a similar ruling, from the bench. [...] The judges were spared when their opponents failed to obtain the two-thirds majority required for removal.|$|E
500|$|Reeves dislikes remakes, but was {{impressed}} by the script, which he deemed a reimagining. He enjoyed the original film as a child and became fonder of it as an adult when he understood how relevant it was, but prefers this version because it lacked the contradictory message of Klaatu [...] "laying <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> [...] almost as though the alien had the bigger stick." [...] Reeves acknowledged his Klaatu is [...] "inverted" [...] from the original, starting [...] "sinister and tough" [...] but becoming [...] "more human," [...] whereas the original was [...] "more human than human" [...] before revealing his [...] "big stick" [...] in his ending speech. He compared the remake's Klaatu to the wrathful God who floods the world in the Old Testament, but is gentle and forgiving {{by the time of the}} New Testament. He spent many weeks revising the script, trying to make Klaatu's transition from alien in human form to one who appreciates their emotions and beliefs subtle and nuanced. Derrickson, the director, said that although Reeves would not use actions [...] "that are highly unusual or highly quirky", he nevertheless [...] "keeps you aware of the fact that this being you're walking through this movie with is not a human being." [...] At Reeves' insistence, the classic line [...] "Klaatu barada nikto" [...] was added to the script after initially being omitted. The line was recorded many times, and it was decided to combine two recordings: one where Reeves said it normally, and a reversed version where he said the line backwards, creating an [...] "alien" [...] effect.|$|E
