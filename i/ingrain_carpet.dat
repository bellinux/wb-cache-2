6000|$|Elizabeth, to {{whom this}} speech was addressed, did not reply, but moved slowly up the hall by herself, fixing {{her eyes on}} the little figure of the English <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> that covered the floor; while, on the other hand, Richard gave a loud crack with his whip, as the {{stranger}} disappeared, and cried: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, my dear, {{choose your}} wall-papers and borderings, and, {{when they are}} up, choose an <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> to {{harmonize}} with them, and adapt your furniture to the same idea. The sixty dollars that you save on your carpet spend on engravings, chromo lithographs, or photographs of some good works of art, to adorn your walls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, papa, {{how could}} you know it? I only said to Marianne that to have Brussels in the parlor and that old mean-looking <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> in the hall did not seem exactly the thing; and in fact you know, mamma, Messrs. Ketchem & Co. showed us such a lovely pattern, {{designed}} to harmonize with our parlor carpet." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carpets</b> <b>Ingrain</b> <b>carpets</b> {{were made}} on the first ingrain loom in the state by an Englishman named Butterfield. [...] <b>Ingrain</b> <b>carpets</b> are a {{reversible}} flat weave carpet popular from the 18th century to the early 20th century. This form of carpeting has no pile and the pattern is shown in opposing colors on both faces, {{making it possible to}} turn the carpet over when one side was worn or soiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, as you pay double price," [...] said I, [...] "I don't see that. Besides, I would rather, in {{the course}} of twenty years, have two nice, fresh <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpets,</b> of just the color and pattern that suited my rooms, than labor along with one ill-chosen velvet that {{harmonized}} with nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|My wife quietly {{remarked that}} we had had great comfort in our own home,--had entertained {{unnumbered}} friends, and had only <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpets</b> on our chambers and a three-ply on our parlor, and she doubted if any guest had ever thought of it,--if the rooms had been a shade less pleasant; and as to durability, Aunt Easygo had renewed her carpets oftener than we. Such as ours were, they had worn longer than hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "The means {{used for}} getting up this effect {{were the most}} {{inexpensive}} possible,--simply the following out, in cheap material, a law of uniformity and harmony, which always will produce beauty. In the same manner, I have seen a room furnished, whose effect was really gorgeous in color, where the only materials used were Turkey-red cotton and a simple <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> of corresponding color.|$|E
6000|$|The {{floor of}} her room was the more bare in {{contrast}} to a two-foot-square splash of gritty <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> in front of the sway-backed bed. On the bed was a red comforter that was filthy beyond disguise. The yellow earthenware pitcher was cracked. The wall mirror was milky. Claire had been spoiled. She had found two excellent hotels since Yellowstone Park. She had forgotten how badly human beings can live. She protested: ...|$|E
60|$|My room at {{the hotel}} was as dreary as a stubble-field upon a November evening. The whole house was new, {{varnished}}, and hard. My bedroom was small. A piece of new <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> covered part of the hard varnished floor. Four hard walls and a ceiling, deadly white, surrounded me. The hard varnished bedstead (the mattress {{felt as if it}} were varnished) nearly filled the little room. Two stiff chairs, and a yellow window-shade which looked as if it were made of varnished wood, glittered in the feeble light of a glass lamp, while the ghastly grayish pallor of the ewer and basin on the wash-stand was thrown into bold relief by the intenser whiteness of the wall behind it.|$|E
5000|$|Thompsonville was {{established}} in the 19th century as a carpet-manufacturing community. Orrin Thompson, from whom the community takes its name, built a dam across Freshwater Brook in 1828 and opened the first carpet mill in 1829. Thompson's first mill, named [...] "White Mill", employed skilled weavers brought from Scotland. Initially its product was largely flat-woven <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpeting,</b> an inexpensive type of carpeting, but over time it added more expensive weaves, such as three-ply ingrain and loop brussels. The mill had 230 looms in operation as of 1846.|$|R
5000|$|In 1839 he {{contracted}} {{to produce a}} power-loom capable of weaving two-ply <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpets,</b> such as had been hitherto woven exclusively by the handloom, which only produced eight yards a day. With his first loom he succeeded in obtaining ten or twelve yards daily, which he increased by improvements until a product of twenty-five yards was regularly obtained. Afterward he invented a power loom for weaving [...] "Brussels" [...] (i.e. pictorial tapestry) and velvet tapestry carpets, his most important invention, which attracted much attention at the World's Fair in London in 1851. The town of Clinton, Massachusetts, owed its growth and manufacturing importance to him, as it contained the coach-lace works, the Lancaster Quilt Company, and the Bigelow Carpet Company, {{all of which were}} direct results of his inventive ability. The carpet loom made his name widely known.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{understand}} me," [...] said I; [...] "I am not traducing velvet or Brussels or Axminster. I {{admit that}} more beautiful {{effects can be}} found in those goods than in the humbler fabrics of the carpet rooms. Nothing would delight me more than to put an unlimited credit to Marianne's account, and let her work out the problems of harmonious color in velvet and damask. All I have to say is, that certain unities of color, certain general arrangements, will secure very nearly as good general effects in either material. A library with a neat, mossy green carpet on the floor, harmonizing with wall-paper and furniture, looks generally as well, whether the mossy green is made in Brussels or in <b>ingrain.</b> In the <b>carpet</b> stores, these two materials stand {{side by side in the}} very same pattern, and one is often as good for the purpose as the other. A lady of my acquaintance, some years since, employed an artist to decorate her parlors. The walls being frescoed and tinted to suit his ideal, he immediately issued his decree that her splendid velvet carpets must be sent to auction, and others bought of certain colors harmonizing with the walls. Unable to find exactly the color and pattern he wanted, he at last had the carpets woven in a neighboring factory, where, as yet, they had only the art of weaving ingrains. Thus was the material sacrificed at once to the harmony." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{could be}} more rigorously simple than the {{furniture}} of the parlor. On the floor was an <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet,</b> of excellent texture--a white ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor--just to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French paper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of Julien's exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a [...] "carnival piece," [...] spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head--a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "Depend upon it, my dear," [...] Aunt Sophia Easygo had said, [...] "it's {{always the}} best economy {{to get the best}} things. They cost more in the beginning, but see how they last! These velvet carpets on my floor have been in {{constant}} wear for ten years, and look how they wear! I never have an <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> in my house,--not even on the chambers. Velvet and Brussels cost more to begin with, but then they last. Then I cannot recommend the fashion that is creeping in of having plate instead of solid silver. Plate wears off, and has to be renewed, which comes to about the same thing in the end as if you bought all solid at first. If I were beginning as Marianne is, I should just set aside a thousand dollars for my silver, and be content with a few plain articles. She should buy all her furniture at Messrs. David & Saul's. People call them dear, but their work will prove cheapest in the end, and there is an air and style about their things that can be told anywhere. Of course, you won't go to any extravagant lengths,--simplicity is a grace of itself." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{more recent}} and {{transitory}} people expressed {{something of the}} prevailing English and American aestheticism in the decoration of their apartments, but the greater part accepted the Florentine drawing-room as their landlord had imagined it for them, with furniture and curtains in yellow satin, a cheap <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> thinly covering the stone floor, and a fire of little logs ineffectually blazing on the hearth, and flickering on the carved frames of {{the pictures on the}} wall and the nakedness of the frescoed allegories in the ceiling. Whether of longer or shorter stay, the sojourners were bound together by a common language and a common social tradition; they all had a Day, and on that day there was tea and bread and butter for every comer. They had one another to dine; there were evening parties, with dancing and without dancing. Colville even went to a fancy ball, where he was kept in countenance by several other Florentines of the period of Romola. At all these places he met nearly the same people, whose alien life {{in the midst of the}} native community struck him as one of the phases of modern civilisation worthy of note, if not particular study; for he fancied it destined to a wider future throughout Europe, as the conditions in England and America grow more tiresome and more onerous. They seemed to see very little of Italian society, and to be shut out from practical knowledge of the local life by the terms upon which they had themselves insisted. Our race finds its simplified and cheapened London or New York in all its Continental resorts now, but nowhere has its taste been so much studied as in Italy, and especially in Florence. It was not, perhaps, the real Englishman or American who had been considered, but a forestière conventionalised from the Florentine's observation of many Anglo-Saxons. But he had been so well conjectured that he was hemmed round with a very fair illusion of his national circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Much of this Martin {{had already}} {{reasoned}} out, {{and some of}} it he reasoned out later. In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation except when he went to see Ruth, and living like a Spartan. He paid two dollars and a half a month rent for the small room he got from his Portuguese landlady, Maria Silva, a virago and a widow, hard working and harsher tempered, rearing her large brood of children somehow, and drowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of the thin, sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon for fifteen cents. From detesting her and her foul tongue at first, Martin grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made. There were but four rooms in the little house--three, when Martin's was subtracted. One of these, the parlor, gay with an <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> and dolorous with a funeral card and a death-picture of one of her numerous departed babes, was kept strictly for company. The blinds were always down, and her barefooted tribe was never permitted to enter the sacred precinct save on state occasions. She cooked, and all ate, in the kitchen, where she likewise washed, starched, and ironed clothes on all days of the week except Sunday; for her income came largely from taking in washing from her more prosperous neighbors. Remained the bedroom, small as the one occupied by Martin, into which she and her seven little ones crowded and slept. It was an everlasting miracle to Martin how it was accomplished, and from her side of the thin partition he heard nightly every detail of the going to bed, the squalls and squabbles, the soft chattering, and the sleepy, twittering noises as of birds. Another source of income to Maria were her cows, two of them, which she milked night and morning and which gained a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew on either side the public side walks, attended always by one or more of her ragged boys, whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in keeping their eyes out for the poundmen.|$|E
6000|$|But {{for a few}} {{portraiture}} or descriptive bits. To-day in {{the upper}} story of a little wooden house of two stories near the Delaware river, east shore, sixty miles up from the sea, is a rather large 20-by-20 low ceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin. The floor, three quarters of it with an <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet,</b> is half cover'd by a deep litter of books, papers, magazines, thrown-down letters and circulars, rejected manuscripts, memoranda, bits of light or strong twine, a bundle to be [...] "express'd," [...] {{and two or three}} venerable scrap books. In the room stand two large tables (one of ancient St. Domingo mahogany with immense leaves) cover'd by a jumble of more papers, a varied and copious array of writing materials, several glass and china vessels or jars, some with cologne-water, others with real honey, granulated sugar, a large bunch of beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums, some letters and envelopt papers ready for the post office, many photographs, and a hundred indescribable things besides. There are all around many books, some quite handsome editions, some half cover'd by dust, some within reach, evidently used, (good-sized print, no type less than long primer,) some maps, the Bible, (the strong cheap edition of the English crown,) Homer, Shakspere, Walter Scott, Emerson, Ticknor's [...] "Spanish Literature," [...] John Carlyle's Dante, Felton's [...] "Greece," [...] George Sand's [...] "Consuelo," [...] avery choice little Epictetus, some novels, the latest foreign and American monthlies, quarterlies, and so on. There being quite a strew of printer's proofs and slips, and the daily papers, the place with its quaint old fashion'd calmness has also a smack of something alert and of current work. There are several trunks and depositaries back' d up at the walls; (one well-bound and big box came by express lately from Washington city, after storage there for nearly twenty years.) Indeed the whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past life. I have here various editions of my own writings, and sell them upon request; one is a big volume of complete poems and prose, 1000 pages, autograph, essays, speeches, portraits from life, &c. Another is a little [...] "Leaves of Grass," [...] latest date, six portraits, morocco bound, in pocket-book form.|$|E
5000|$|A large dining table, {{capable of}} seating at least 40, {{was placed in}} the room, {{surrounded}} by simple rush-bottomed chairs.A silver service and a blue-and-gold china service purchased from the Lowestoft Porcelain Factory in England were used for dining, and a simple surtout de table (or [...] "plateau") was used as the centerpiece. Other than the dining table, the largest piece of furniture in the room was a massive sideboard. The windows were uncurtained, and walls papered. Paintings of George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson were hung on the walls. The Washington image was a copy of the Lansdowne portrait, a full-length, life-size figure of the first President painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1796. The canvas flooring was removed, and an <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet</b> (an inexpensive, flatwoven textile) installed. Otherwise, the room remained only sparsely furnished.|$|E
5000|$|Stephens {{was born}} two miles north in {{a log cabin}} on his father's farm; he was {{orphaned}} {{at the age of}} fourteen. Stephens purchased the estate in 1845 from the estate of Williamson Byrd, a relative of his stepmother. The building was the former family home, but [...] "had been sold out from under the brothers when their father died." [...] In 1872-75, Stephens tore down the old house, except for two rear rooms, and erected the current structure, which is restored to its original appearance. The home is a simple two-story white frame house. It has a hip roof and a veranda extending across its front. The first floor includes Stephens' bedroom, including original walnut furniture, a round table at which Stephens wrote, Stephens' wheelchair, a repaired original flowered <b>ingrain</b> <b>carpet,</b> and wallpaper with blue and gold stripes. The dining room includes [...] "massive chairs" [...] replicated from a single remaining original chair. To the rear is the library, where Stephens wrote from 1868-70 his Constitutional View of the Late War between the States. Steps lead from the dining room to the second floor; {{at the top of the}} stairs is the [...] "Tramps' Room," [...] where many guests, including uninvited guests, often stayed. To the home's rear are restored outbuildings: slave quarters, a wine cellar, smokehouse, woodhouse, washhouse, and chickenhouse. At the time of emancipation in 1864, Stephens owned thirty-one slaves, most of whom remained with him after the war's end. It was at Liberty Hall that Stephens was captured by Union Army forces from a detachment of the 4th Iowa Cavalry, after which Stephens formally surrendered to General Emory Upton and was imprisoned before being released.|$|E
