25|$|When he {{returned}} to the United States, testing of the P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter was underway. He had made the first flight of the XP-80A in January, and the testing program continued through 1944 and into 1945. In October 1944, Milo Burcham was killed in the crash of a production P-80, and Tony LeVier filled his office as chief <b>engineering</b> <b>test</b> pilot in January 1945.|$|E
25|$|His {{test flying}} was {{instrumental}} in proving the Lockheed P-38 Lightning design. He and chief <b>engineering</b> <b>test</b> pilot Milo Burcham alternated flying dive tests to observe the design's performance at transonic speeds. To demonstrate {{the reliability of the}} design {{in the hands of a}} skilled pilot, he performed aerobatic shows for students at the Polaris Flight school at War Eagle Field in nearby Lancaster.|$|E
25|$|Mercury-Redstone 1A and Mercury-Redstone 2 both {{experienced}} overacceleration in flight, {{the former}} {{due to a}} problem with an accelerometer, the latter due to {{a problem with the}} LOX regulator which oversupplied the engine with oxidizer and caused thrust termination to occur 1.2 seconds early. The ASIS system activated and the escape tower yanked the capsule away, subjecting its chimpanzee passenger to high G loads. The third flight, Mercury-Redstone BD, was designed as an <b>engineering</b> <b>test</b> to correct these problems before the booster could be considered man-rated.|$|E

The photos show the descent stage of the landers from each mission on the Moon’s surface. The photo of the Apollo 14 landing site also shows tracks made by an astronaut between a science experiment (ALSEP) and the lander. Photos of the Apollo 12 landing site were released by NASA on September 3, 2009. The Intrepid lander descent stage, experiment package (ALSEP), Surveyor 3 spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths are all visible. While the LRO images have been enjoyed by the scientific community as a whole, they have not done anything to convince conspiracists that the landings happened.|$|E
25|$|Captain Miguel López Alegría - Astronaut, USN - USNA Class of 1980. Born 30 May 1958, in Madrid, Spain {{and raised}} in Mission Viejo, California. His {{academic}} background include a bachelor of science degree in systems engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1980; and a master of science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1988. Graduate of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. Speaks Spanish, French and Russian. López Alegría served as pilot and mission commander of EP-3E aircraft. {{he was assigned to}} NASA as an <b>engineering</b> <b>test</b> pilot and program manager at the Naval Air Test Center. López Alegría reported for training to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in August 1992. After one year of training he was designated as an astronaut. Between 20 October 1995 and 21 April 2007, López Alegría participated in four spaceflights, logged over 257 days in space, and performed 10 spacewalks accumulating a total of 67 hours and 40 minutes of Extra-vehicular Activity (EVA).|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate {{to land a}} man on the Moon {{before the end of the}} 1960s, Apollo 11 was an <b>engineering</b> <b>test</b> of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod [...] from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.|$|E
