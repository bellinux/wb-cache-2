5|$|The {{effects of}} Stowe's {{writings}} about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During {{a visit to}} his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff {{on the steps of the}} state capitol building—which was <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, helm, mantling, crest (or coronet or crown) and sword are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain {{permanently}} affixed {{to the back of the}} stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Ladies) since 1911. The entryway just outside the doors of the chapel has the names of the Order's Knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record of the members of the order.|$|E

Mary is reading a Bible, while Jesus holds a white lily, symbolizing her virginity and purity.|$|R
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E
5|$|The news of Selena's death deeply {{affected}} the Latino community; many people traveled {{thousands of miles}} to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America. A chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them {{on the door and}} doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.|$|E

The arch is decorated <b>with</b> <b>festoons</b> <b>with</b> flowers and fruit, a typical element of Mantegna's paintings in Padua, influenced by Francesco Squarcione. The basement has a cartouche with the date 1460 (according to others, 1468 or 1469).|$|R
60|$|Presently Robert {{made his}} {{appearance}} as {{the bearer of}} Mr. Prendergast's flowers, and setting his back against a shutter, in his favourite attitude, stood looking {{as if he wanted}} to help, but knew not how. Phoebe, at least, was vividly conscious of his presence, but she was supporting a long <b>festoon</b> <b>with</b> which Owen was adorning a pier-glass, and could hardly even turn her head to watch him.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{estimates}} the worst-case running time complexity for traversing and printing all successful paths of a normalized trim acyclic automaton. First, {{we show that}} the worst-case structure is a <b>festoon</b> <b>with</b> distribution of arcs on states as uniform as possible. Then, we prove that the complexity is maximum {{when we have a}} distribution of e (Napier constant) outgoing arcs per state on average, and that it can be exponential in the number of arcs. ...|$|R

5000|$|Between 1379 and 1440 the façade was reconstructed {{with the}} {{addition}} of three tiers of loggias and a portico. In 1504 Andrea della Robbia was commissioned to undertake the decoration of the archivolt (for which he created a <b>festoon</b> <b>with</b> plant themes and, in the middle, the crest of the Opera di San Jacopo), of the portico {{as well as of the}} lunette with bas-reliefs over the central portal, depicting the [...] "Madonna with Child and Angels". He finished the works in 1505.|$|R
60|$|When {{on board}} Lingard gave orders to his mate, and leading Willems on the poop, {{sat on the}} breech {{of one of the}} brass six-pounders with which his vessel was armed. The boat went off again to bring back the messenger. As soon as it was seen {{returning}} dark forms appeared on the brig's spars; then the sails fell in <b>festoons</b> <b>with</b> a swish of their heavy folds, and hung motionless under the yards in the dead calm of the clear and dewy night. From the forward end came the clink of the windlass, and soon afterwards the hail of the chief mate informing Lingard that the cable was hove short.|$|R

25|$|Continual {{rebuilding}} enabled Tlatoani {{and other}} dignitaries {{to celebrate their}} achievements by dedicating new sculptures, monuments and other renovations to the temples. For festivals, temple steps and tiers were also <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> flowers, banners and other decorations. Each pyramid had a flat top to accommodate dancers and priests performing rites. Close to the temple steps there was usually a sacrificial slab and braziers.|$|E
25|$|At Arromanches, {{the first}} Phoenix was sunk at dawn on 9 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk {{to create a}} five-mile-long arc between Tracy-sur-Mer {{in the west to}} Asnelles in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the {{superstructures}} of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons.|$|E
25|$|Tangerine Dream's {{earliest}} concerts were visually simple {{by modern}} standards, with three men sitting motionless for hours alongside massive electronic boxes <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> patch cords {{and a few}} flashing lights. Some concerts were even performed in complete darkness as happened during the performance at York Minster, 20 October 1975. As time went on and technology advanced, the concerts became much more elaborate, with visual effects, lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, and projected images. By 1977 their North American tour featured full-scale Laserium effects.|$|E

60|$|Nares, {{who could}} hear no sound, {{felt his heart}} beat, for the man's {{attitude}} was unpleasantly suggestive. It seemed that he was following something that moved behind the <b>festooned</b> creepers <b>with</b> eyes which could see more than those of a white man, and Nares felt the tension becoming unendurable as he watched him until the negro flung out a pointing hand. Then a voice rose sharply.|$|R
25|$|Local {{folklore}} {{tells of}} the southern slopes of the Bump being <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> grapevines, tended by the monks of the priory. The Bump can be climbed using the North Norfolk Coastal Path from either the east or west, and is well worth the climb. From the top, there are views of the surrounding land and sea. Each Easter, the combined churches in the area make a pilgrimage carrying a cross {{to the top of}} Beeston Bump, and an open-air service takes place.|$|E
25|$|The {{dedication}} {{ceremony was}} not elaborate, {{but it was}} symbolic. A temporary pole made of bamboo from the Philippines was erected next to the memorial, and palm branches from Cuba and Puerto Rico were bunched about its base. At {{the top of the}} pole was a laurel wreath <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> red, white, and blue ribbons. Around the foot of the monument, more palm branches were spread. An honor guard of 25 veterans from the Washington, D.C., chapter of the Spanish War Veterans stood around the memorial.|$|E
25|$|Spirit of Eden was {{released}} worldwide in 1988. It {{did not enjoy}} nearly as much commercial success as The Colour of Spring. The album spent five weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at #19. The album cover depicts a tree <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> seashells, snails, birds, and insects. It was illustrated by James Marsh, who did Talk Talk's artwork throughout its recording career. The booklet provides reproductions of Hollis' handwritten lyrics. The album was digitally remastered by Phill Brown and Denis Blackham in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|The temple is {{situated}} on the Baba Kharak Singh Road (old Irwin Road) about 250 m southwest of Connaught place in Central Delhi, which is the commercial hub of Delhi. Tuesday and Saturday are special days of worship when devotees congregate at the temple in large numbers. Hanuman Jayanti (birthday celebrations of lord Hanuman) is held every year with great fanfare on the full moon (Purnima) day {{in the month of}} Chaitra (March [...] - [...] April) as per established lunar Hindu Panchangam or Hindu calendar. Colourful processions <b>with</b> <b>festoons</b> and <b>with</b> devotees wearing Hanuman masks and tails and carrying large idols of Hanuman fill the streets. Commercial establishments within the temple complex sell religious offerings and bangles made of lac and plastic. It is also a popular place for women for Mehndi (temporary henna tattoos).|$|R
60|$|The others {{laid down}} the pig and ran up to him. The patch {{extended}} {{as far as they}} could see; the plants covered the ground and climbed the trees by means of the rattans, <b>festooning</b> them <b>with</b> their bright leaves and flowers and fruit of all degree of ripeness. On the ground they found no ripe fruit. There were evident signs that this was a favourite resort of the pigs, and that they devoured the fruit as fast as it ripened.|$|R
50|$|From 16 April 1932 to 11 November 1936, the Chief Instructor of {{the college}} was Warrant Officer Charles Eaton. A {{bungalow}} was built {{for him and his}} family {{on the banks of the}} Canal and still exists. When W.O. Eaton and his family left the students lined the route all the way to the railway station and <b>festooned</b> him <b>with</b> garlands, such was their esteem. In 1943, the school underwent and the college emerged as an institution of choice for potential officers of the army.|$|R
25|$|The {{monument}} {{was inaugurated}} as planned on National Day, {{despite the fact}} that Cañete had failed to meet the schedule and would not complete construction for several days. The pyramid was <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> the banners of various illustrious regiments who had formed the garrison of Buenos Aires, including the patricians, highlanders, mulattoes and blacks, gunners, hussars, and grenadiers. The Pyramid as well as the Cathedral were heavily illuminated. The Recova was illuminated with 1,141 tallow candles. The festivities lasted four days and included dancing, raffles, and the manumission of slaves.|$|E
25|$|The area {{towards the}} western end of Lockhart Road, {{including}} {{a small part of the}} parallel Jaffe Road, is one of Hong Kong island's two main bar districts (the other being the more upmarket Lan Kwai Fong in Central). Once considered primarily as a red light district, this area is now more diverse with bars, pubs, restaurants and discos. A number of the raunchier bars still remain, however, their doorways <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> women from Thailand and the Philippines. The famous novel and film The World of Suzie Wong sets many scenes in this area. The bar district has been popular with visiting sailors and navies, when Fenwick Pier, west of the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre (HKECE), was in use as a military pier.|$|E
25|$|Americans, by and large, {{are often}} fascinated by new {{technology}} and new gadgets. There are many within the United States that share the attitude that through technology, many of the evils in the society can be solved. Many of the new technological innovations {{in the modern world}} were either first invented in the United States and/or first widely adopted by Americans. Examples include: the lightbulb, the airplane, the transistor, nuclear power, the personal computer, video games and online shopping, as well as the development of the Internet. By comparison with Japan, however, {{only a small fraction of}} electronic devices make it to sale in the US, and household items such as toilets are rarely <b>festooned</b> <b>with</b> remotes and electronic buttons as they are in some parts of Asia.|$|E
50|$|In 1469 {{he got the}} {{commission}} of an ambitious new addition on the Arca di San Domenico: a spiral superstructure and several free-standing figures {{on top of the}} sarcophagus. This sarcophagus with the remains of Saint Dominic had been sculpted two centuries before by Nicola Pisano and his workshop (between 1265 and 1267). It had been completed by lapo, Arnolfo di Cambio and fra Guglielmo Agnelli. Niccolò dell’Arca added an elaborate spire with an impressive statue of “God the Father” on top of a candelabrum, held by two putti and four dolphins, all covered <b>with</b> <b>festoons</b> <b>with</b> fruit. On the cornice at its base is in the middle a small Pietà, flanked by two angels, while on the four corners stand the four Evangelists in oriental dress. The lower part of the superstructure is surrounded by free-standing figures: the Patron Saints of Bologna (Saint Francis of Assisi), San Petronio (began by Niccolò but finished by young Michelangelo in 1494), Saint Dominic and Saint Florian. On the back stand St Anne, St John the Baptist (sculpted by Girolamo Cortellini in 1539), San Procolo and San Vitale. Niccolò also added the Candlestick-holding Angel {{on the left side of}} the altar slab (the one on the right side is by Michelangelo).|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{setting was}} a little {{restaurant}} surrounded by trees <b>festooned</b> hauntingly <b>with</b> coats, designed by Power Boothe. A wistful blank-faced waiter, played by Ms. Porter, prepares the table then leaves, to be followed onstage by Ms. Porter as the diner. She looks at first like a beautiful, solitary young woman Jacques Tati might spot across the room in a seaside cafe. Her diner is pure Beatrice Lillie by the end, tipsy on pink wine but still tilting at the world. It is deft physical comedy of a high order, as poignant as it is funny.” ...|$|R
