40|$|Traditional image {{processing}} algorithms are sequential in nature. When these algorithms are implemented in a real-time system, the response {{time will be}} high. In an embedded platform, such algorithms consumes more power because of more number of clock cycles required to execute the algorithm. With the advent of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), massively parallel architectures can be developed to accelerate the execution speed of several {{image processing}} algorithms. In this work, such a parallel architecture is proposed to accelerate the SOBEL edge detection algorithm. To simulate this architecture, a model of video acquisition system is developed. This model will convert the incoming frames to digital composite video signals which can be processed by the edge detection architecture. An external software developed in Matlab will convert the frames in to hexadecimal format, and will feed the video acquisition model. The output of the edge detection processor will be a <b>digital</b> <b>composite</b> <b>signal.</b> A display module will convert the digital composite video signals in to hexadecimal format. Then {{with the help of}} an external Matlab program, the original image will be reconstructed. The result shown compares the sequential and parallel environments, and shows significant improvements in FPGA based implementations. The Modelsim simulation of SOBEL based edge detection algorithm for a 256 _ 256 frame, gave a result in 0. 019 seconds for a clock speed of 10 MHz, where as a Matlab based simulation took 0. 22 seconds to finish this operation, which is a significant acceleration.

40|$|The reflectarray antenna is a {{power-efficient}} antenna {{but with}} an inherent intersymbol interference (ISI) problem with <b>digital</b> modulations. The <b>composite</b> <b>signal</b> model of a reflectarray is established. The ISI {{is characterized by the}} signal components delays.

The effect of typical phase shifters' phase errors is analyzed and evaluated. Simulations are performed. The analytical and simulation results for an example reflectarray at f(sub c) = 26. 5 GHz and bit rate of 1. 325 Gbps show that the BER degradation due to ISI is proportional to the symbol rate and the loss ranges from less than 1 dB to around 2 dB in E(sub b) /N(sub o), depending on original E(sub b) /N(sub o), for BPSK, QPSK, 8 PSK and 16 QAM.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{presentation of}} several sound sources {{in a performance}} setting is fundamental to most music. Ensemble musical signals consist of superpositions of multiple distinct sonic events which mayor may not be synchronized in time, frequency, and/or amplitude. Once the distinct events are combined and recorded in a storage medium, e. g., a <b>digital</b> recording, the <b>composite</b> <b>signal</b> is often unsatisfactory in some way: the recording might suffer from poor ensemble balance, performance errors, or corruption from undesired background audience noises (sneezing, talking, etc.). Although it often might be helpful to process the constituent signals independently, separating the <b>composite</b> <b>signal</b> into its parts is a nontrivial task. The research reported here considers particular aspects of the separation problem: analysis, identification, tracking, and resynthesis of a specified voice from a digital recording of a musical duet setting. Analysis is accomplished out of real-time using a quasi-harmonic, sinusoidal representation of the constituent signals, based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) methods. The procedure is evaluated via resynthesis of a &quot;desired &quot; <b>signal</b> from the <b>composite</b> analysis and tracking data. Other applications include signal restoration, digital editing and splicing, musique concrete, noise reduction, and time-scale compression/expansion. iii This material is based upon work supported, in part, under a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this thesis, a new algorithm, timeâfrequency {{component}} analyzer (TFCA), is proposed to analyze <b>composite</b> <b>signals,</b> whose components have compact timeâfrequency supports. Examples {{of this type}} of signals include biological, acoustic, seismic, speech, radar and sonar signals. By conducting its timeâfrequency analysis in an adaptively chosen warped fractional domain the method provides timeâfrequency distributions which are as sharp as the Wigner distribution, while suppressing the undesirable interference terms present in the Wigner distribution. Being almost fully automated, TFCA does not require any a priori information on the analyzed signal. By making use of recently developed fast Wigner slice computation algorithm, directionally smoothed Wigner distribution algorithm and fractional domain incision algorithm in the warped fractional domain, the method provides an overall time-frequency representation of the <b>composite</b> <b>signals.</b> It also provides timeâfrequency representations corresponding to the individual signal components constituting the <b>composite</b> <b>signal.</b> Since, TFCA based analysis enables the extraction of the identified components from the <b>composite</b> <b>signals,</b> it allows detailed post processing of the extracted signal components and their corresponding timeâfrequency distributions, as well.
