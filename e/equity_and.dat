40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{monetary}} policy shocks exert a substantial {{effect on the}} size and composition of capital ‡ows and the trade balance for the United States, with a 100 basis point easing raising net capital in-‡ows and lowering the trade balance by 1 % of GDP, and explaining about 20 - 25 % of their time variation. Monetary policy easing causes a portfolio composition shift out of <b>equities</b> <b>and</b> into bonds, implying a negative conditional correlation between ‡ows in <b>equities</b> <b>and</b> bonds and also between returns to <b>equities</b> <b>and</b> to bonds. Moreover, such shocks induce a negative conditional correlation between <b>equity</b> ‡ows <b>and</b> <b>equity</b> returns, <b>and</b> between bond ‡ows and bond returns. The …ndings provide evidence {{for the presence of}} a portfolio rebalancing motive behind investors’decisions for both bonds <b>and</b> <b>equities,</b> <b>and</b> it sheds light on the puzzle of the strongly time-varying equity-bond return correlations found in the literature...|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} private <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> venture {{capital and the}} {{development}} of these asset classes has occurred through a series of boom and bust cycles since the middle of the 20th century.

This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
30|$|The {{difficulty}} in shareholder registration creates difficulty for <b>equity</b> transaction <b>and</b> transfer. The existing registration procedure complicates <b>equity</b> transaction <b>and</b> transfer, making it inconvenient for investors to trade <b>equities</b> <b>and</b> liquidate their investments, thereby hindering equity circulation. The lack of liquidity of equity {{is associated with}} high risk, which discourages investors from investing, and is detrimental to crowd fundraisers who want to successfully raise funds and obtain high valuations of their businesses (Lee and Wu 2003). If <b>equity</b> transaction <b>and</b> transfer become efficient, then investors can more easily transfer <b>equities</b> <b>and</b> liquidate their investments, the liquidity of <b>equity</b> increases, <b>and</b> market transactions are activated. This will have positive impacts on both investors and crowdfunders.|$|R

5|$|The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was {{the head}} of the Court of Common Pleas, also known as the Common Bench or Common Place, which was the second-highest common law court in the English legal system until 1875, when it, along with the other two common law courts and the <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> probate courts, became part of the High Court of Justice. As such, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was one of the highest {{judicial}} officials in England, behind only the Lord High Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice of England, who headed the Queen's Bench (King's when the monarch was male).|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its <b>equity,</b> <b>and</b> its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E
5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The bill was a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the common law and which with <b>equity,</b> <b>and</b> was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between the common law and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the bill was heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, the bill was eventually withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and <b>equity,</b> <b>and</b> instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go to the trouble of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of <b>Equity</b> <b>and</b> Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

5|$|The {{main focus}} of the Exchequer was the {{collection}} of royal revenue {{as part of the}} greater Exchequer, which was officially undertaken by the Lord High Treasurer. The Exchequer was unique in having jurisdiction in matters of both <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> the common law, the latter initially curtailed after the Magna Carta and reserved for the Court of King's Bench and Court of Common Pleas, although it later grew back. This process of common law and equity was reversed; during the 16th century the Exchequer was solely a common law body, with the equity jurisdiction only again becoming relevant {{near the end of the}} Tudor period. W. H. Bryson argues that this happened during the reign of Edward I. By 1590 the Exchequer's jurisdiction over equity cases was confirmed, and it was handling a significant number a year, including disputes over trusts, mortgages, tithes and copyholds; since taxation was ever-present, it was not difficult to show that the dispute prevented the payment of a debt to the monarch, allowing the Writ of Quominus.|$|E
