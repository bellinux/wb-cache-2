5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation <b>exchanger</b> such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E

5|$|Lower {{temperature}} LDRs (120–200°C) require pumping. They {{are common}} in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, {{such as in the}} Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a heat <b>exchanger</b> in a Rankine cycle binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a turbine. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new US plants. Binary plants have no emissions.|$|E
5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat <b>exchanger,</b> which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat <b>exchanger</b> (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
40|$|Industrial cooling with seawater, {{particularly}} at elevated temperature and salinity, shortens the useful lives of conventional metallic heat <b>exchangers.</b> Cost effective, corrosion-resistant heat <b>exchangers</b> {{are required to}} fully utilize available saline water resources. Polymer composites, which use carbon fibers for thermal and mechanical reinforcement, are a promising material for such heat <b>exchangers.</b> The present thesis provides a characterization and thermomechanical analysis of heat <b>exchangers</b> fabricated using thermally conductive polymers. The change in mechanical properties resulting from exposure to saltwater at elevated temperature is characterized for raw and reinforced polymers.

5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat <b>exchanger</b> to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. The first known {{building in the}} world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, whose construction was completed in 1907. A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat <b>exchanger</b> in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas <b>exchanger</b> between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E

50|$|Typical ion <b>{{exchange}}rs</b> are {{ion exchange}} resins (functionalized porous or gel polymer), zeolites, montmorillonite, clay, and soil humus. Ion <b>exchangers</b> are either cation <b>exchangers</b> that exchange positively charged ions (cations) or anion <b>exchangers</b> that exchange negatively charged ions (anions). There are also amphoteric <b>exchangers</b> {{that are able to}} exchange both cations and anions simultaneously. However, the simultaneous exchange of cations and anions can be more efficiently performed in mixed beds that contain a mixture of anion and cat{{ion exchange resins}}, or passing the treated solution through several different ion exchange materials.|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{noticeable}} {{advantages of}} plate heat <b>exchangers</b> compared with tube heat <b>exchangers,</b> {{it has been}} widely applied and researched.

25|$|There {{are three}} primary classifications of heat {{exchangers}} {{according to their}} flow arrangement. In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the <b>exchanger</b> at the same end, and travel in {{parallel to one another}} to the other side. In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the <b>exchanger</b> from opposite ends. The counter current design is the most efficient, in that it can transfer the most heat from the heat (transfer) medium per unit mass {{due to the fact that}} the average temperature difference along any unit length is higher. See countercurrent exchange. In a cross-flow heat <b>exchanger,</b> the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the <b>exchanger.</b>|$|E

25|$|Choosing {{the right}} heat <b>exchanger</b> (HX) {{requires}} {{some knowledge of}} the different heat <b>exchanger</b> types, {{as well as the}} environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product.

50|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of CuproBraze is generally better than soft soldered heat <b>exchangers.</b> This {{is because the}} materials in CuproBraze heat <b>exchangers</b> are of equal nobility, so galvanic differences are minimized.

5000|$|Similar {{effectiveness}} relationships can {{be derived}} for concentric tube heat <b>exchangers</b> and shell and tube heat <b>exchangers.</b> These relationships are differentiated from one another {{depending on the type}} of the flow (counter-current, concurrent, or cross flow), the number of passes (in shell and tube <b>exchangers)</b> and whether a flow stream is mixed or unmixed.|$|R
25|$|A fourth type of heat <b>exchanger</b> uses an {{intermediate}} fluid or solid store to hold heat, {{which is then}} moved {{to the other side}} of the heat <b>exchanger</b> to be released.
