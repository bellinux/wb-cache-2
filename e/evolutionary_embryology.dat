This led to a second synthesis, at last including embryology as well as molecular genetics, phylogeny, and evolutionary biology to form evo-devo. In 1978, Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes that regulate embryonic development in Drosophila fruit flies, which like all insects are arthropods, one of the major phyla of invertebrate animals. Bill McGinnis quickly discovered homeotic gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later also found in fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.In 1980, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus described gap genes which help to create the segmentation pattern in fruit fly embryos; they and Lewis won a Nobel Prize for their work in 1995.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Evolution {{has been}} {{integrated}} with embryology during two great pe-riods: {{the latter half}} of the 19 th C as evolutionary morphology/embryology, and the latter third of the 20 th C as evolutionary developmental biology. My mandate was to use the contributions of three embryologists/morphologists: Francis (Frank) Balfour (1851 – 1882), Walter Garstang (1868 – 1949) and Gavin de Beer (1899 – 1972) to discuss the foundations of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>embryology</b> in the UK from 1870 (when ‘‘every aspiring zoologist was an embryologist, and the one topic of professional conversation was evolution,’ ’ Bateson, 1922, p. 56), through the 1920 s (‘‘ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny, it creates it,’ ’ Garstang, 1922, p. 81) to the 1970 s (‘‘homology of phenotypes does not imply similarity in genotypes,’ ’ de Beer, 1971, p. 15). <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>embryology</b> was driven by a comparative embryological ap-proach that sought homology of adult structures in germ layers and ancestry in embryos, and sought to differentiate larval adaptations from retained ancestral characters. An initial emphasis on a phylogenetic mechanism (recapitulation) slow-ly gave way to more mechanistic approaches that included heterochrony and the integration of embryology with physiological genetics. Germ layers, homology, lar-val evolution, larval origins of the vertebrates, paedomorphosis and heterochrony underpinned the origins of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>embryology,</b> and so I discuss each of these topics...|$|E

50|$|In {{his early}} education, {{he had been}} taught the ideas of {{evolution}} and was half-hearted in his acceptance of the principles. Although his early works on ornithology seemed to accept ideas of adaptation and selection, he later became a creationist and published {{a number of books}} and debates attacking evolution, and was the founding secretary-treasurer in the Evolution Protest Movement in 1932 along with Bernard Acworth and Lewis Merson Davies, jointly known as the Acworth Circle. He leaned towards the idea of old earth creationism but questioned radiometric dating. His book, The Transformist Illusion published posthumously in 1957 attempted to show the failure of evolution using examples such as the infinitesimal probability of proteins arising out of random mixing, the fossil record, bird anatomy, blood group incompatibilities, and queried <b>evolutionary</b> claims in <b>embryology</b> and vestigial organs.

50|$|Developmental {{robotics}} emerged at {{the crossroads}} of several research communities including embodied artificial intelligence, enactive and dynamical systems cognitive science, connectionism. Starting from the essential idea that learning and development happen as the self-organized result of the dynamical interactions among brains, bodies and their physical and social environment, and trying to understand how this self- organization can be harnessed to provide task-independent lifelong learning of skills of increasing complexity, developmental robotics strongly interacts with fields such as developmental psychology, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, developmental biology (<b>embryology),</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology, and cognitive linguistics. As many of the theories coming from these sciences are verbal and/or descriptive, this implies a crucial formalization and computational modeling activity in developmental robotics. These computational models are then not only used as ways to explore how to build more versatile and adaptive machines, but also as a way to evaluate their coherence and possibly explore alternative explanations for understanding biological development.|$|R

Together, these three fields are forming a more inclusive evolutionary developmental biology that is revitalizing and providing answers to old and important questions involving the formation of biodiversity on Earth. The phenotype of Evo-Devo is limited by internal constraints on what could be known given the methods and equipment of the time and it has been framed by external factors that include both academic and global politics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] This essay recapitulates major paths {{followed}} by the Russian tradition of what we refer to today as evolutionary developmental biology (“evo-devo”). The article addresses several questions regarding the conceptual history of evolutionary embryological thought in its particularly Russian perspective: (1) the assertion by the St. Petersburg academician Wolff regarding the possible connections between environmental modifications during morphogenesis and the “transformation” of species, (2) the discovery of shared “principles” underlying animal development by von Baer, (3) the experimental expression of Baer's principles by Kowalevsky and Mechnikoff, (4) Severtsov's theory of phylembryogenesis, (5) Filatov's approach {{to the study of}} evolution using comparative “developmental mechanics”, and (6) Shmalgausen's concept of “stabilizing” selection as an attempt to elucidate the evolution of developmental mechanisms. The focus on comparative <b>evolutionary</b> <b>embryology,</b> which was established by Kowalevsky and Mechnikoff, still continues to be popular in present-day “evo-devo” research in Russia...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in <b>evolutionary</b> biology, comparative <b>embryology,</b> and systems biology suggest {{the necessity of}} a conceptual shift in {{the way we think about}} organisms. It is becoming increasingly evident that molecular and genetic processes are subject to extremely refined regulation and control by the cell and the organism, so that it becomes hard to define single molecular functions or certain genes as primary causes of specific processes. Rather, the molecular level is integrated into highly regulated networks within the respective systems. This has consequences for medical research in general, especially for the basic concept of personalized medicine or precision medicine. Here an integrative systems concept is proposed that describes the organism as a multilevel, highly flexible, adaptable, and, in this sense, autonomous basis for a human individual. The hypothesis is developed that these properties of the organism, gained from scientific observation, will gradually make it necessary to rethink the conceptual framework of physiology and pathophysiology in medicine...|$|R

40|$|Ascidians {{are members}} of the {{tunicate}} branch of the chordate tree and have been popular models in <b>embryology,</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology (Satoh, 1994) and for the study of development. They are invertebrates and located basal to the vertebrates in chordate phylogeny. The compound ascidian Diplosoma listerianum shows both sexual and asexual reproduction by budding, giving the opportunity to compare gene expression in the two developmental programmes. In the present thesis the expression pattern of the Parahox gene caudal was analysed in budding zooids of Diplosoma listehanum by performing RT-PCR, Northern blotting and in situ hibridization. Some ascidians are capable of full neural regeneration. Budding as such is a kind of regeneration, as it involves the reconstruction of adult organisation from parental zooid. During asexual reproduction of D. listerianum a complete new neural complex has to be formed in the developing thoracic bud. To understand this remarkable ability the morphology and formation of the new neural complex was analysed. To examine which tissues form the new neural complex and whether stem cells are involved, cell proliferation and cell death were investigated in budding zooids using BrdU as a mitotic marker and the TUNEL assay for detecting apoptotic cells. Furthermore immunocytochemistry was performed using antibodies against Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone and acetylated tubulin in whole mounts of budding zooidsMarine Biological Association of the UK Plymout...|$|R
