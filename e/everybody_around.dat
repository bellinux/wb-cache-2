500|$|When {{talking about}} the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, [...] "It's about everybody. You'll have songs with {{different}} emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What everybody goes through." [...] On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, [...] "I'm very content right now. I take everything a day at a time. Every time I hear good news, I'm shouting out, 'Praise God.' <b>Everybody</b> <b>around</b> me is so excited, I still haven't got it. I haven't really felt it like they're feeling it for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my personal experiences {{to make my}} music." [...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from <b>everybody</b> <b>around</b> me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Kostova {{finished}} the novel in January 2004 {{and sent it}} to a potential literary agent in March. Two months later and within two days of sending out her manuscript to publishers, Kostova was offered a deal– she refused it. The rights to the book were auctioned off and Little, Brown and Company bought them for [...] (US$30,000 is typical for a first novel from an unknown author). Publishers Weekly explained the high price {{as a result of a}} bidding war between firms' believing that they might have the next Da Vinci Code within their grasp. One vice-president and associate publisher said, [...] "Given the success of The Da Vinci Code, <b>everybody</b> <b>around</b> town knows how popular the combination of thriller and history can be and what a phenomenon it can become." [...] Little, Brown and Company subsequently sold the rights in 28 countries. The book was published in the United States on 14 June 2005.|$|E

500|$|Arranger Nelson Riddle found Sinatra to be a [...] "perfectionist {{who drove}} himself and <b>everybody</b> <b>around</b> him relentlessly", {{and stated that}} his {{collaborators}} approached him {{with a sense of}} uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. [...] Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. [...] After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for Anchor's Away, [...] "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it were a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it were a [...] "rhythm" [...] number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter {{at the end of each}} number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as [...] "Isn't that a pretty ballad" [...] or [...] "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with [...] "childlike delight". She states that after each show, Sinatra would be [...] "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, {{while working}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fermi had a casual {{conversation}} while walking to lunch with colleagues Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller and Herbert York. The men discussed a recent spate of UFO reports and an Alan Dunn cartoon facetiously blaming the disappearance of municipal trashcans on marauding aliens. [...] The conversation shifted to other subjects, until during lunch Fermi suddenly exclaimed, [...] "Where are they?" [...] (alternatively, [...] "Where is everybody?"). [...] Teller remembers, [...] "The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact {{that in spite of}} Fermi's question coming from the clear blue, <b>everybody</b> <b>around</b> the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life." [...] Herbert York recalls that Fermi followed up on his comment with a series of calculations on the probability of Earth-like planets, the probability of life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, etc., and concluded that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So do I believe that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You definitely want to put something out that's like that. I felt at the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed <b>everybody</b> <b>around</b> me to be in that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1994 season, the Expos, seeking to replace {{departed}} ace Dennis Martínez in the starting rotation, acquired a young reliever in Pedro Martínez, who the Los Angeles Dodgers had cast doubt over his potential as starter and pitched him out of the bullpen. [...] One amusing moment (...) materialized on April 24 while playing the Dodgers in Los Angeles and Martínez starting. [...] With one out in the third inning, Walker caught a Mike Piazza fly ball and innocently handed it to a young fan, six year-old Sebastian Napier, thinking it was the third out of the inning. [...] He then quickly noticed that José Offerman, already on base, was running at full speed. [...] Walker managed to retrieve the ball from Napier and held Offerman to third base. [...] Embarrassed, Walker admitted that he “told the little kid that maybe next time I’ll give him a ball when there are three outs instead of two. <b>Everybody</b> <b>around</b> him was laughing.” [...] Where Offerman was stationed made little difference as Tim Wallach homered on the next pitch from Martínez for two runs. [...] True to his word, when the Expos assumed the field in {{the bottom half of the}} fourth inning, Walker gave Napier a signed ball, inducing a standing ovation.|$|E
