5|$|Unfortunately, {{having been}} {{preoccupied with the}} nerd situation, Homer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for his final exam. The nerds say {{the only way to}} pass is to cram for the final exam, which they help him do. However, despite Homer's best attempts, he gets an F. To Homer's delight, the nerds hack into the school's student records and change his grade to an A+, but unfortunately, Marge finds out and forces Homer to take the course again in order to set a good example for Bart and Lisa. Homer's next college {{experience}} is shown during the end credits, with college clichés such as hazing by a fraternity, phonebooth stuffing, a food fight, and finally his graduation ceremony where Homer flashes the audience.|$|E
25|$|Peugeot still {{plans on}} {{developing}} new models {{to compete in}} segments where it currently does not compete. Collin claimed that the French automaker competed in 72% of market segments in 2007, {{but he wanted to}} get that figure up to 90%. Despite Peugeot's sportscar racing program, the company <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to build a pure sportscar any more hardcore than the RC Z sports-coupe. It is also pursuing government funding to develop a diesel-hybrid drivetrain, which might be key to its expansion.|$|E
25|$|Like adult facilities, youth {{detention}} centers {{in some countries}} are experiencing overcrowding due to large increases in incarceration rates of young offenders. Crowding can create extremely dangerous environments in juvenile {{detention centers}} and juvenile correctional facilities. Overcrowding may also lead to the decrease in availability to provide the youth with much needed and promised programs and services while {{they are in the}} facility. Many times the administration <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to handle the large number of residents and therefore the facilities can become unstable and create instability in simple logistics.|$|E

25|$|However, {{while it}} has flavor/texture {{components}} {{of each of the}} above, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> from a meat emulsion. Thus, it has the grainy consistency of cooked salami or kielbasa rather than that of bologna or hot dogs. In fact, smoked kielbasa might be the closest nationwide comparison. But, pork roll is a bit sweeter, and that extra sugar becomes caramelized when it is fried or grilled, which adds to the final flavor. Also, the tangy variety includes lactic acid starter culture in its preparation, which adds a sour flavor component like some dry cured salami's or pepperoni.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E
25|$|Unless a {{question}} is urgent and relates to {{a matter of}} public importance or to the arrangement of public business and the Speaker's permission has been obtained to ask it, to pose {{a question}} an MP must give not later than seven clear days' written notice before the sitting day on which the answer is required. An MP may ask up to five questions at any one time, not more than three of which may be for oral answer. Detailed rules govern the contents of questions. For instance, questions must not contain statements which the MP <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to substantiate; or arguments, inferences, opinions, imputations, epithets or tendentious, ironical or offensive expressions; and a question must not be asked to obtain an expression of opinion, the solution of an abstract legal case or the answer to a hypothetical proposition.|$|E

The King <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to take any step such as you suggest in regard to the marks of distinction which you have received in recognition of public services and philanthropic munificence."

500|$|Chandler {{used the}} savings {{realized}} from his reorganization {{of government to}} eliminate the state's budget deficit and pay off most of the state's debt. This brought about further savings by eliminating debt service costs; these were applied to improvements in the state's infrastructure and educational institutions. Chandler allocated funds for free textbooks for the state's school children, created a teacher's pension fund, and provided extensive funding for the state's colleges and universities. Because segregation prevented blacks from attending graduate school in the state, Chandler secured an allocation of $5,000 annually to help blacks attend out-of-state graduate schools. He stopped short of desegregating the state's universities, however, telling {{a group of black}} and white educators that [...] "it is not wise to educate the white and colored in the same school in the South. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for it yet." ...|$|E

He's holding on to these massive pieces of information that he feels he can't share with anyone – not even Kate." [...] When Kate sees Declan lying to his mother, she believes that he is not the boy she fell for and does not know if she can trust him. Mullally said that Declan <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for the moment Kate breaks up with him and he is confused. Declan goes to Ringo Brown's (Sam Clark) bucks night where he meets Kate's rival, Candace Carey (Sheona Urquhart), who makes it clear that she is attracted to him. Declan and Candace later share a kiss, which Kate sees. Mullally said [...] "Candace gets talking to Declan and is there for him, he wants comfort and makes that split-second decision to kiss her. He doesn't think about the consequences". Declan does not know Kate saw them together and Mullally added that he hoped they could move on as they [...] "really do work as a couple".|$|E
