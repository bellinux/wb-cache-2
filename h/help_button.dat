2500|$|... 3 June 2013 – 'New Out Of Box Software or NOOBS is introduced. This {{makes the}} Raspberry Pi {{easier to use}} by {{simplifying}} the installation of an operating system. Instead of using specific software to prepare an SD card, a file is unzipped and the contents copied over to a FAT formatted (4GB or bigger) SD card. That card can then be booted on the Raspberry Pi and a choice of six operating systems is presented for installation on the card. The system also contains a recovery partition that allows for the quick restoration of the installed OS, tools to modify the config.txt and an online <b>help</b> <b>button</b> and web browser which directs to the Raspberry Pi Forums.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth race of {{the season}} was at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona. The return to Europe allowed most of the teams to update their cars, {{including}} modifications to Button's car, the Brawn BGP 001, which {{had not yet been}} altered since the season began. Button took pole position with the final lap of the qualifying session, describing the updates as [...] "good step forward". Both Button and Barrichello initially planned to stop three times during the race; however, after he fell behind Barrichello at the first corner, Button was switched to a two-stop strategy, and this meant he ended up finishing comfortably ahead. An unhappy Barrichello felt immediately after the race that the team might have sacrificed him to <b>help</b> <b>Button,</b> saying: [...] "If I get the slightest sniff that they are favouring Jenson I'll hang up my helmet tomorrow".|$|E

50|$|Also {{available}} are rounded bevel buttons, {{designed to}} hold an icon; standard square buttons; glass square buttons and round buttons. In addition, circular, purple online <b>help</b> <b>buttons</b> are available which display help relative to the current task when clicked. Disclosure triangles, although technically buttons, allow views of controls to be shown and hidden to preserve space.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{currently}} not staffed and passengers {{are advised to}} buy tickets on board the train. The station does have two <b>help</b> point <b>buttons</b> located one each on Platforms 1 and 2. A footbridge connects the two platforms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sylvie dear, do <b>help</b> me to <b>button</b> this glove!" [...] Lady Muriel whispered, hastily stooping down, {{and failing}} to hear the question.|$|R
50|$|Context {{sensitive}} help {{is a common}} implementation of context sensitivity, a single <b>help</b> <b>button</b> is actioned and the help page or menu will open a specific page or related topic.|$|E
50|$|A <b>help</b> <b>button</b> may {{be pressed}} {{to engage the}} autopilot. It {{automatically}} places the airplane back on its flight path if players are in difficulty. This can salvage a landing that {{is about to go}} awry, but it can only be used a limited number of times.|$|E
50|$|Kicker (also {{referred}} to as KDE Panel) is the main panel used in K Desktop Environment 3 and earlier. Together with KDesktop, it forms the graphical shell. It can be customized by the user. By default, it has the K Menu, a Desktop Access button, a Home button, a Konqueror button, a Kontact button, and a <b>Help</b> <b>button.</b> It also has the Desktop Preview & Pager, the Taskbar, the System Tray, and the Clock.|$|E
6000|$|The {{cabin on}} this rented farm {{was a mere}} shanty, a shell of pine boards, which needed re-enforcing to make it {{habitable}} and one day my father said, [...] "Well, Hamlin, I guess you'll have to run the plow-team this fall. I must <b>help</b> neighbor <b>Button</b> wall up the house and I can't afford to hire another man." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{specific}} collar stay discreetly adds {{a button}} hook on one end, to <b>help</b> fasten tiny <b>buttons</b> on dress shirts; e.g. placket, cuffs or button down collars.|$|R
5000|$|Buttons for {{collecting}} information and making annotations. These <b>buttons</b> <b>help</b> one save or remove a webpage, make annotations on a webpage, and highlight and collect text snippets.|$|R
50|$|Life Alert Emergency Response, Inc. is a {{nationwide}} American company, with headquarters in Encino, California, which provides services {{that help the}} elderly contact emergency services. Founded in 1987 by Zohar Loshitzer, Arik Amir and Isaac Shepher, the company's system consists of a main unit and a small wireless <b>help</b> <b>button</b> that is worn on the user at all times. Former Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop appeared in commercials for Life Alert starting in 1992, stating that he wore one. He remained {{a spokesman for the}} company until his death in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{buttons on}} the game system and {{controllers}} are large to accommodate small children's less developed manual dexterity. The default controller consists of an analog stick, four colored buttons, a large enter button, a button (dubbed the [...] "Learning Zone" [...] button) that immediately takes the player to a minigame section of the software, an Exit button (that either brings up an option to end the game or to keep playing, or to exit out of any menu that the player is in) and a <b>Help</b> <b>button</b> (which repeats the spoken instructions or hint provided by the game to the player).|$|E
50|$|Facetune is a photo editing {{application}} (“app”) used to edit, enhance, and retouch {{photos on}} a user’s iPhone, iPad, Android or Windows Phone device. The app {{is often used}} for (yet not limited to) portrait and selfie editing9. Features allow users to whiten teeth, remove blemishes, smooth skin, reshape, defocus and blur. Facetune users can also choose {{from a variety of}} filters, lighting, textures, contrast, and frame options. Demo photos are downloaded with the app for practicing purposes, and a <b>help</b> <b>button</b> is found within each feature. Facetune enables users to share their pictures on a variety of social networking services, including Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr and Instagram.|$|E
50|$|Bus {{departure}} {{information is}} displayed at each station, with fixed LED signs suspended above each platform. These signs present four lines of scheduled bus departure times, with {{data provided by}} Brisbane City Council's RAPID system. Busway stations contain full disabled accessibility, passenger seating, 24-hour CCTV cameras and emergency <b>help</b> point <b>buttons.</b> Bicycle access and storage is provided at most stations, as are go card fare machines. Public art {{may be found in}} some busway stations, tunnels and walls.|$|R
60|$|Finally the {{day came}} when the ground rang like iron under {{the feet of the}} horses, and a bitter wind, raw and gusty, swept out of the northwest, bearing gray veils of sleet. Winter had come! Work in the furrow had ended. The plow was brought in, cleaned and greased to prevent its rusting, and while the horses munched their hay in well-earned holiday, father and I <b>helped</b> farmer <b>Button</b> husk the last of his corn.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} cited reasons for users not using the Internet for their activities is the lack of trust (Lee and Turban 2001). Researchers found that people rely on their general disposition to trust when in a novel situation (Li et al. 2008). Trust is the significant factor that leads to the use of online stores, and it has a direct relation to online shopping behavior (Gefen et al. 2003; Pavlou 2003). From previous research, trust is also the most significant factor for online transactions because trust is part of the belief and expectation of website users that they will definitely get useful content from those websites (Kim et al. 2009). Regarding health websites, there is research in the medical profession about trust and technology acceptance. The roles of the doctor and nurse are replaced by <b>help</b> <b>buttons</b> and search features, thus removing the basis of doctor–patient trust (Lohse and Spiller 1998). Thus, trust in online health treatment has a positive effect on perceived usefulness. Hallegatte and Nantel (2006) confirmed that the non-technologically related construct of trust of a website affects the intention to visit a commercial website again. Consequently, it is hypothesized that trust in the online health environment positively affects perceived usefulness.|$|R

5000|$|Theo escapes {{both the}} burning {{wreckage}} from the dragon attack and the irrha, {{which is still}} pursuing him, with a fairy servant from Daffodil House, Cumber Sedge, but believes Applecore to {{have died in the}} attack. They make their way to a refugee camp where they meet a highly educated goblin named Mud Bug Button who is attempting to start a revolution with the unhappy common fairy populace against the unfair rule of the Flower families. At the camp, Theo meets Caradenus Primrose, now head of Primrose House after his father's death in the attack, and learns of the wrongs that his [...] "great-uncle" [...] Dowd (actually the great-uncle of the child Theo was switched with) inflicted on Caradenus' sister Erephine during Dowd's visit to their world. He also again meets with Poppaea [...] "Poppy" [...] Thornapple, the daughter of a Chokeweed but also one who is responsible for previously saving his life, and is no longer able to deny his feelings for her. Theo and Cumber agree to <b>help</b> <b>Button</b> with a task but refuse to outright join his revolution. While completing the task, Theo learns that Applecore is alive and is being held prisoner by Lord Nidrus Hellebore, the leader of the Chokeweeds and the mastermind of the attack on the Creepers. Theo realized that he {{has no choice but to}} try to rescue Applecore, or die in the attempt. On Button's advice, he decides to go ask the Remover of Inconvenient Obstacles, an ancient and powerful but highly selfish fairy, for help. Unbeknownst to Theo, the Remover has been employed by the Creepers to help capture Theo and is responsible for the summoning the irrha, which is now pursuing him.|$|E

5000|$|Dalton Stevens' hobby of sewing buttons onto {{things began}} as a {{reaction}} to suffering from chronic insomnia for years. [...] "I have insomnia and I would go sometimes four to five days and nights without sleeping," [...] he explains. In 1983, his inability to sleep after television broadcasting ended at 2 am led him to discover that sewing <b>buttons</b> <b>helped</b> him pass the time while his wife Sue slept.|$|R
30|$|Students {{are allowed}} to solve a given problem without {{assistance}} or they can click on the <b>help</b> <b>button,</b> which presents an expert’s decomposition of the problem into a sequence of steps. The problem-solving interface allows free navigation through the steps, i.e., the students {{are not required to}} strictly follow the steps. They can choose to skip the current step or revisit previous steps as they find it necessary to help them solve the problem. We consider this as a form of scaffolding achieved through intuitive user interface design. Furthermore, students are not forced to work through every element of every step. Rather, they are allowed free exploration of the problem’s solution to the extent allowed by the pre-designed steps. Feedback is provided for every problem-solving action, and help in the form of hints is available upon request. The learning task concludes when the student inputs the correct answer on the problem statement.|$|E
40|$|Unlike S-PLUS, R {{does not}} {{incorporate}} a statistical {{graphical user interface}} (GUI), but it does include tools for building GUIs. Based on the tcltk package (which furnishes an interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI builder) the Rcmdr package provides a basic-statistics graphical user interface to R called the R Commander. The design objectives of the R Commander were as follows: to support, through an easy-to-use, extensible, cross-platform GUI, the statistical functionality required for a basic-statistics course (though its current functionality has grown to include support for linear and generalized-linear models, and other more advanced features); to make it relatively di ¢ cult to do unrea-sonable things; and to render visible the relationship between choices made in the GUI and the R commands that they generate. The R Commander uses a simple and familiar menu/dialog-box interface. Top-level menus include File, Edit, Data, Statistics, Graphs, Models, Distributions, Tools, and Help, with the complete menu tree given in the paper. Each dialog box includes a <b>Help</b> <b>button,</b> {{which leads to a}} relevant help page. Menu and dialog-box selections generate R commands, which are recorded in a script window an...|$|E
40|$|This {{appendix}} {{provides an}} overview of the language syntax of Scriptor and MathScriptor. Because all of the features of Scriptor are present in MathScriptor, we will make reference to Scriptor in most of this discussion. When a feature is present only in MathScriptor, we will indicate that in the discussion or by using the symbol � next to the keyword. The help screen is a shorter version of this appendix, and can be consulted within the program by pressing the <b>Help</b> <b>button.</b> Scriptor is intended primarily as a learning platform while MathScriptor is intended primarily for scientific and engineering programming. Both Scriptor and MathScriptor reside within the same program and the user can switch between the two environments at will by using the Compiler Menu. You must be a registered user to access MathScriptor, which provides additional math functions (expanded integration, wavelet transforms, additional matrix operations), access to external objects, web access under program control and compilation. The Scriptor environment can run programs compiled by MathScriptor, however. The advantage of working in Scriptor during the learning process is that MathScriptor is that the additional features and complexity can create problems tha...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Unlike S-PLUS, R {{does not}} {{incorporate}} a statistical {{graphical user interface}} (GUI), but it does include tools for building GUIs. Based on the tcltk package (which furnishes an interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI builder) the Rcmdr package provides a basic-statistics graphical user interface to R called the “R Commander. ” The design objectives of the R Commander were as follows: to support, through an easy-to-use, extensible, cross-platform GUI, the statistical functionality required for a basic-statistics course (though its current functionality has grown to include support for linear and generalized-linear models); to make it relatively difficult to do unreasonable things; and to render visible the relationship between choices made in the GUI and the R commands that they generate. The R Commander uses a simple and familiar menu/dialog-box interface.

40|$|In recent years, the Internet has {{generated}} a tremendous level of excitement. The promise of electronic commerce and online shopping will depend {{to a great}} extent upon the interface of how people interact with the computer. Electronic access to a global marketplace can bring more powerful and efficient purchasing, greater choice, more personalised service, and new kinds of products and services together with new ways to purchase. The purchase environment is of great importance in this new way of handling businesses. The familiar layout of the physical store becomes, on the Website, a labyrinth of demolish menus, product indices and search features. A <b>help</b> <b>button</b> on the home page of the Web shopping site replaces the sales clerk’s friendly advice and service. The aim with this thesis is to investigate the purchase environment on the Internet by looking more closely at how the layout and design of Websites can be described and how customer service is handled online. The result shows {{that it is important to}} take advantage of the creative ways of presenting information that comes with the Internet, especially the opportunities to expose products in a different way than in traditional stores. Aspects such as entertainment and customer support are two important issues when operating on the Internet. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

50|$|A nurse {{call button}} is a button found around a {{hospital}} bed that allows patients in health care settings to alert a nurse or other health care staff member remotely of their need for <b>help.</b> When the <b>button</b> is pressed, a signal alerts staff at the nurse's station, and usually, a nurse or nurse assistant responds to such a call. Some systems also allow the patient to speak directly to the staffer; others simply beep or buzz at the station, requiring a staffer to actually visit the patient's room to determine the patient's needs.|$|R
50|$|Telepass users {{must use}} lanes {{designated}} with the Telepass logo and travel no faster than 30 km/h {{when in the}} Telepass lane. Once the OBU has been identified and verified, the OBU emits a single high beep, and the barrier blocking the lane is lifted. When the user exits the toll lane, the OBU emits a second single high beep. A series of three high beeps indicates the OBU's battery is nearing exhaustion and the OBU or its battery should be replaced. A low beep indicates the OBU {{has not been able}} to communicate with the toll station, was identified as blocked, or, in case of Telepass Ricaricabile, does not have sufficient funds left to pay for the toll incurred. In all these cases, the barrier remains closed, and the user must signal the toll station supervisor by pressing the red <b>Help</b> (Assistenza) <b>button.</b> The number plate is then photographed, and the vehicle allowed to continue. The vehicle is subsequently identified by its number plate, and the owner is sent a bill for the toll which could not be collected automatically.|$|R
5000|$|As noted above, the Slim Phatty is {{essentially}} a stripped down version of Moog's Little Phatty. Moog removed the keyboard, {{as well as the}} pitch and modulator wheels, and compacted the entire setup into a unit that is only seventeen inches wide. For these reasons, many may find the control panel a little cluttered, although the use of smaller knobs and <b>buttons</b> <b>helps</b> alleviate this issue. Like its counterpart, the Slim Phatty possesses an [...] "Overload" [...] control, which acts a filter drive that [...] "supercharges" [...] the filter and sound. It also shares firmware versions with the Little Phatty, which gives it more flexibility - such as integration with the Little Phatty in polyphonic mode. Its lightweight and small size also give it an edge in regards to portability.|$|R
