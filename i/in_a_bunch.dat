5|$|In the race's sixth stage, Roberto Visentini won the leg after {{attacking a}} few {{kilometers}} from the finish. Saronni regained the race lead after finishing second {{on the stage and}} earning a fifteen-second time bonus. The next two stages both resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint, with Guido Bontempi winning stage 7 and Franco Chioccioli, stage 8. The ninth stage contained the climbs of Monte Terminillo and La Forca and was considered one of the tougher stages in the race. Malvor-Bottecchia-Vaporella rider Acácio da Silva won the stage as the top of the general classification rankings remained unchanged from the previous days.|$|E
5|$|Race leader Hinault and his team, , {{allowed a}} {{breakaway}} to get almost a twenty-minute {{advantage over the}} peloton during the race's seventeenth stage, before other general classification contenders' teams stepped in {{to help with the}} chase. The attack group reached the finish line around ten minutes faster than the peloton. Swiss rider Daniel Gisiger won the stage ahead of Giovanni Mantovani. Paolo Rosola won his second stage of the event as the eighteenth stage resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint. The following day's race route was altered the night before by Torriani, which removed six kilometers off the climb of Great St Bernard Pass, while it still contained the full climb of the Cima Coppi, the Simplon Pass. The stage saw a large group of fifty-three riders cross the finish line together, with Moser at the head, taking his second stage victory of the event. Former race leader Visentini, after losing a significant amount of time during the stage 16 individual time trial, abandoned the race during the nineteenth stage.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{announced}} that he would not ride the Tour de France, concentrating on the world road championships instead. Before, he won the Isle of Man International in treacherous conditions where only sixteen out of seventy riders finished. At the road world championships in Ronse, Belgium, the Belgians controlled the race until Simpson broke free, catching two riders ahead: Henry Anglade (France) and Seamus Elliott (Ireland). Anglade was dropped, and Elliott refused to work with Simpson. They were caught; the race finished <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint, with Simpson crossing the line in 29th. Simpson's season ended with six-day races across Europe and an invitation only race on the Pacific island of New Caledonia, along with other European riders. He skipped his usual winter training schedule for his first skiing holiday at Saint-Gervais-les-Bains in the Alps, taking Helen and his two young daughters, Jane and Joanne.|$|E

5|$|The ninth day {{of racing}} {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint that was won by Sørensen. The {{next stage of}} the race was a forty-two kilometer individual time trial. Race leader Rominger won the leg by one minute and twenty-four seconds and increased his overall lead to three minutes over Casagrande, who was in second place overall. Enrico Zaina and Nelson Rodríguez Serna were the first two riders to reach the stage's final climb of Il Cioccio and the two stayed out in front until the finish which saw Zaina win the race to the line. With four kilometers left in the stage, Ugrumov and Berzin attempted to crack Rominger by attacking him repeatedly. After several attacks where the riders moves were marked, the riders agreed to ride to the finish together. The twelfth stage of the race saw the peloton arrive at the finish together ready for a bunch sprint. Cipollini originally won the stage but was relegated to last place on the stage after having {{been found to have}} leaned on Mario Manzoni during the dash to the line. Ján Svorada, who had come in second, was then made the stage winner.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, Sagan sprinted to his 100th career {{victory at}} 2017 Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec. On 24 September, Sagan won the World Championship {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} year at the World Road Race Championships in Bergen, Norway. He began the final climb in 80th position and finished <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint ahead of Norway's Alexander Kristoff and Australia's Michael Matthews.|$|E

25|$|The tenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, {{and the first}} real test for the favourites. It was won by Stephen Roche, with Mottet in second place; Mottet became the new leader of the general classification. After a successful escape in the eleventh stage, Martial Gayant became the new leader. The twelfth stage ended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint that did not change the general classification. The Tour arrived in the Pyrenees in the thirteenth stage. Non-climbers, such as Gayant lost more than fifteen minutes, and so the non-climbers {{were removed from the}} top positions of the general classification; the new top three was Mottet– Bernard– Roche, all serious contenders for the final victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} was eventually to bow out on 23 February 1989 {{in one of}} the programme's most famous episodes which attracted more than 20 million viewers. After escaping from custody, Den returned to the famous canal (in Alperton) for one last rendezvous with Michelle. The episode ended with Den being shot {{by a member of the}} firm (who was carrying a gun concealed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of daffodils) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually hit the water had to be taped at the BBC's Ealing Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the Grand Union Canal were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning at a later date. In protest, Tony Holland and Julia Smith had their names taken off the episode's credits. Den's exit ended up being the creators' final contribution to the show.|$|E
25|$|After some holidays, Sagan {{came back}} at the Tour de Suisse. He {{finished}} fourth in the prologue and tenth in the second stage after winning the sprint of the second group on the road. On the mountainous stage 3, he was helped greatly to victory by his teammate Rafal Majka who nullified a lot of attacks before Sagan outsprinted the reduced group to the finish line. He came in second on the fourth stage, missing the race lead by a single second. He won the sixth stage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint to tie the record of victories in the Tour de Suisse at eleven wins. The record holders are Hugo Koblet and Ferdi Kubler. Sagan got boxed in during the sprint on the following stage by a dubious move from José Joaquín Rojas Gil but managed a second position to Alexander Kristoff. He finished the Tour de Suisse with the Points jersey. He then won the Slovak National Time Trial Championship on 26 June, followed by a solo win in the National Road Race Championships two days later. Both events were held in Sagan's hometown Žilina.|$|E

Like on day 1, Kirsten Wild powered to victory. The Dutch rider beat her compatriots Ellen van Dijk and Adrie Visser to the line.

After {{it becomes clear that}} the firm want Den dead, he escapes from custody but meets Michelle by the canal one last time, unaware that she is under surveillance. At the canal, Michelle tells Den that she will wait for him and that one day they will be together with Vicki as a family. After their emotional farewell, Den is shot by a man concealing a gun <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of daffodils and falls into the canal. With Den presumed dead, Michelle and Sharon are distraught. When a witness says Den had been seen with a mystery woman the day of his death, Sharon wonders who it was so Michelle admits it was her and that Den is Vicki's father. Feeling hurt, angry, deceived, and unable to accept Michelle's explanation, Sharon walks out. Later, Michelle's father, Arthur (Bill Treacher) accidentally overhears a conversation between Michelle and her mother Pauline (Wendy Richard) in which he discovers the truth about Vicki, and reacts with fury. Michelle and Sharon are estranged for months, until Vicki contracts meningitis later that year and the worry brings them closer and they reunite.|$|E
