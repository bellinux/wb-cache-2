50|$|Individual {{performances}} and off-court activities by Robertson and Lucas marked the season. Robertson {{was head of}} the NBA's Player Union and fought for the advancement of players' rights on a number of issues. He also posted another Hall Of Fame-caliber season as a scorer, accurate shooter, passer and <b>free</b> <b>thrower.</b> Lucas was involved in several off-court business ventures, including his own fast-food chain, Jerry Lucas Beef-N-Shakes. While injuries affected him this season, he remained one of the best rebounders in NBA history. He also continued to see time at center for the team as well as at forward. Both he and Robertson continued to play huge minutes for the team, rarely leaving the court during games.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the effects}} of {{negative}} stereotypes and observer pressure on athletic performance have been well researched, {{the effects of}} positive stereotypes on performance, particularly {{in the presence of}} observers, is not known. In the current study, White males watched a video either depicting Whites basketball players as the best <b>free</b> <b>throwers</b> in the NBA (positive stereotype), Black basketball players as the best <b>free</b> <b>throwers</b> in the NBA (negative stereotype), or a neutral sports video (control). Participants then shot a set of free throws, during which half the participants were also videotaped (observer condition), whereas the other half were not (no observer condition). Results demonstrated that positive stereotypes improved free throw performance, but only in the no observer condition. Interestingly, observer pressure interacted with the positive stereotype to lead to performance decrements. In the negative stereotype condition, performance decrements were observed both in the observer and no observer conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{physical}} model is developed, which suggests a pathway to determining the optimal release {{conditions for a}} basketball free throw. Theoretical framework is supported by Monte Carlo simulations {{and a series of}} free throws performed and analysed at Southbank International School. The model defines a smile-shaped success region in angle-velocity space where a free throw will score. A formula for the minimum throwing angle is derived analytically. The optimal throwing conditions are determined numerically by maximising the expected number of successful shots given the error pattern inherent to the player. This approach is fully quantified by the model presented and suggests a reliable way for individual free throw improvement. The model also explains recent NBA data showing that some of the most successful <b>free</b> <b>throwers</b> bear completely different conditions to the average player.
