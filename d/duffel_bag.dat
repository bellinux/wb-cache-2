5|$|On 8 September 1967, the {{electronic}} portion of Dyemarker was divided and the aerial, sensor-based portion was designated Muscle Shoals. On 1 June 1968, the aerial portion was redesignated Igloo White. That name {{became the most}} associated with the program though various elements received a number of separate codenames. All resources for Dyemarker/Muscle Shoals were redesignated Duck Blind in April 1968, and in June 1968 Muscle Shoals outright became Duel Blade. In October 1968 Duck Blind was changed to <b>Duffel</b> <b>Bag.</b>|$|E

After Oscorp scientist Dr. Conrad Markus uses Parker's blood {{to recreate the}} formula that created Spider-Man, the Prowler (Aaron Davis) steals the formula, and in the process, one of the spiders created by Markus crawls into the Prowler's <b>duffel</b> <b>bag.</b> Days later, the Prowler's nephew, grade-schooler Miles Morales, is bitten by the spider {{during a visit to}} Aaron's apartment. Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter Parker has, but does not tell his parents, Jefferson and Rio, due to his father's distrust of superheroes, confiding only in his best friend, Ganke Lee.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from military service, Groza {{reported to the}} Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. He showed up in army fatigues carrying all his clothes in a <b>duffel</b> <b>bag.</b> There, he joined quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form {{the core of the}} new team's offense. Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played a big part in the team's early success. In his first season, he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points. The Browns, meanwhile, advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14–9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and made it back to the championship game. Groza, however, was injured and could only watch as the team won its second championship in a row.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} types of buckles found in tie down straps. The two most common are {{threaded}} buckles and snap buckles. Threaded buckles work like those found on backpacks and <b>duffel</b> <b>bags</b> {{for the purpose of}} adjusting the length of the tie down strap. Snap buckles are also commonly found on backpacks and <b>duffel</b> <b>bags</b> to allow fastening of the strap. These two components are often used in conjunction with the threading buckle providing tension and the snap buckle providing fastening. While threading buckles come in metal varieties for use with tensioning fasteners like over-center and ratchet fasteners, snap buckles are often plastic and are not designed to withstand a great deal of tension.|$|R

25|$|While {{still in}} the parking lot, Mătăsăreanu was shot twice in the right buttock and the left forearm, forcing him to abandon his <b>duffel</b> <b>bag</b> of money, enter the {{get-away}} vehicle, and start the engine. Phillips retrieved the HK-91 from the open trunk and continued firing upon officers, while walking alongside the sedan, using it for cover. As Phillips approached the passenger's side of the get-away vehicle, he {{was hit in the}} shoulder and his rifle was struck in the receiver and magazine by bullets fired by police. After firing a few more shots with one arm, Phillips discarded the HK-91, and retrieved the Norinco Type 56 before exiting the parking lot and retreating onto the street while Mătăsăreanu drove down the road.|$|E
25|$|The next day, August 10, 1977, police {{investigated}} Berkowitz's {{car that}} was parked on the street outside his apartment building at 35 Pine Street in Yonkers. They saw a rifle in the backseat, searched the car, and found a <b>duffel</b> <b>bag</b> filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes, and a threatening letter addressed to Inspector Timothy Dowd of the Omega Task Force. Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to leave the apartment, rather than risk a violent encounter in the building's narrow hallway; they also waited to obtain a search warrant for the apartment, worried that their search might be challenged in court. The initial search of the vehicle {{was based on the}} rifle that was visible in the back seat, although possession of such a rifle was legal in New York State and required no special permit. The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00p.m. and entered his car. Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car. Falotico pointed his gun inches from the temple of the person of interest, while Detective Sgt. William Gardella pointed his gun from the passenger's side.|$|E
500|$|A {{translation}} of Plutarch's Life of Caesar by John Langhorne {{and his brother}} William published in 1770 was the first source {{to use the word}} [...] "carpet" [...] to describe the material used by Cleopatra's servant to sneak her into the palace. [...] Although the original meaning used by Plutarch was more akin to what is today known as a <b>duffel</b> <b>bag,</b> at the time of Langhorne's translation a carpet meant a type of [...] "thick fabric", not an actual rug. [...] But by the nineteenth century, semantic change led to the word taking on a different meaning. [...] The legend of Cleopatra hiding in a rug, although historically inaccurate, became the most popular image, with Gérôme {{one of the first to}} popularize it in modern art.|$|E

After she is {{sentenced to life in prison}} Sharon claims she is ill, going to a bathroom where Adam hid a <b>duffel</b> <b>bag</b> for her escape. She overcomes an officer with chloroform, and escapes through a window. Adam has given her a false identification, a passport and cash. She stops at a gas station, where she dyes her hair brunette and changes into a revealing outfit. (Case said that although the storyline was fun, she disliked being a brunette.) Later, Sharon is carjacked and her possessions stolen; the female carjacker dies after the car crashes. The body is identified as Sharon's, leaving her family and friends believing she died. Case (who wanted to do a Mr & Mrs. Smith-type storyline) said that when Sharon became a fugitive, she had her chance. The actress enjoyed playing the [...] "aggressive" [...] side of Sharon when she attacked the prison guard.|$|E

500|$|Authorities have {{acknowledged}} {{that since the}} exact cause of Bella's death remains unknown, asserting that it was homicide to a jury could be [...] "difficult to prove." [...] Rachelle Bond alleged that McCarthy had punched the toddler in the stomach multiple times after claiming Bella was a [...] "demon", {{and that he was}} the sole perpetrator of the murder. Prosecutors of McCarthy allege that Bella was murdered in one of many abusive occasions after she had been uncooperative about going to bed. Citing that McCarthy had decided to [...] "calm the child down," [...] they say Rachelle had not entered the room alongside her boyfriend. When she did enter, they say she witnessed him near the girl's body, which was [...] "swollen and gray," [...] indicating she was deceased. Rachelle Bond's attorney claims McCarthy threatened to murder her client if she contacted authorities. She also maintained that Rachelle was not involved with hiding the victim's body, which had initially been placed in garbage bags and concealed in a refrigerator. Bond later admitted to this accusation as part of a future plea deal. A cadaver dog brought to the house later indicated that it smelled something on the refrigerator. Bond contradicted the belief that the body was placed on Deer Island; she stated that McCarthy had [...] placed the body in a weighted <b>duffel</b> <b>bag</b> and disposed of it in the water, suggesting it drifted to the location where it was found.|$|E
