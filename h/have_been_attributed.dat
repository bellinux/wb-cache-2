5|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} accomplishments in sports <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Clement, but cannot be confirmed {{because of poor}} record keeping at the time. These claims include winning tennis championships in Iowa and South Dakota and setting world records in shot put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball, where it is claimed that Clement threw a baseball 275 feet.|$|E
5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced {{increased risk of}} extinction because of global warming.|$|E

5|$|Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, {{and were}} {{described}} on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption. The difficulty with this interpretation {{is that in the}} conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology Ahmose I ruled from c. 1539–1514 BCE, whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred somewhere between 1642–1540 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012. This among other contributing {{factors such as}} online dating and the upward mobility of people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to pushing {{the average age of}} marriage in China to 27, up from 20 in 1950, making it closer to global marriage trends.|$|E
5|$|Large {{explosive}} eruptions in {{the southern}} segment of the Southern Volcanic Zone occur on average every 725 years, and tephras from volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone have been transported over large distances. The largest Holocene volcanic eruption of the Southern Andes occurred 6,700 years before present at Cerro Hudson. Tephra layers found at Mallín El Embudo <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Mentolat, {{as well as to}} Melimoyu and Cerro Hudson.|$|E

5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to El Greco. This doubtful attribution {{is based}} on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, {{it does not seem to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|Benfica {{won their}} first European title in 1961, {{defeating}} Barcelona {{to win the}} European Cup, and successfully retained the title {{in the following year}} after defeating Real Madrid. Since then, they appeared in five more finals – 1963, '65, '68, '88 and '90 – but failed to reconquer the title. These consecutive final losses <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to a famous curse by Hungarian manager Béla Guttmann in 1962. Benfica have also played in three UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League finals – 1983, 2013 and '14 – losing all three.|$|E
5|$|Clan badge: There {{have been}} two clan badges (or plant badges) {{attributed}} to Clan MacAulay: cranberry and scots pine. Both clans MacAulay and MacFarlane <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> with a badge of cranberry. Clan MacFarlane, also a west-Dumbartonshire clan, claims a descent from Alwyn II, Earl of Lennox. The badge of scots pine {{has been attributed to}} all seven clans of Siol Alpin: Clan Grant, Clan Gregor, Clan MacAulay, Clan Macfie, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Macnab, and Clan MacQuarrie.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is {{widespread}} in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to the species now grouped as G.marginata over the last century.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the acute effects, radiation exposure (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population is exposed to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214Po and 218Po are thought to cause {{the majority of the}} estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium.|$|E
5|$|New backup oxygen {{generators}} and filters have been {{installed on the}} aircraft. The coughing symptoms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to acceleration atelectasis ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible {{as opposed to an}} issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
5|$|Pendle {{was part}} of the parish of Whalley, an area {{covering}} , too large to be effective in preaching and teaching the doctrines of the Church of England: both the survival of Catholicism and the upsurge of witchcraft in Lancashire <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to its over-stretched parochial structure. Until its dissolution, the spiritual needs of the people of Pendle and surrounding districts had been served by nearby Whalley Abbey, but its closure in 1537 left a moral vacuum.|$|E

5|$|The {{affected}} {{animals are}} mostly young Asian elephants {{that had been}} born in captivity, with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years (and three-quarters between one and eight years old). Some cases have affected newborns or adult elephants born in the wild (oldest aged 40 years), and three recorded cases have affected African elephants. The first documented fatal case for African elephants was Kijana, an eleven-month-old male in 1996. Since 2008, a number of cases <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to EEHV1 among wild Asian elephants.|$|E
5|$|The area {{displays}} some of {{the earliest}} urban settlements in Europe, with archeological sites showing continuous development from the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods. Major archeological finds include Early Helladic fortifications, Mycenaean era workshops and necropolis, a classical era amphitheater, and Paleochristian and Byzantine temples. Some of the earliest and best preserved specimens of Athenian Geometric pottery <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to the Trachones workshop and are featured in museum collections, including two kraters on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The bluebuck rock {{paintings}} from the Caledon river valley <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Bushmen.

The Bushmen possibly {{believed that the}} bluebuck had a supernatural potency, like other animals in their environment. The animals in the paintings are similar {{in proportion to the}} reedbuck, but the large ears, horns, and lack of a mane rule out species other than the bluebuck.|$|E
