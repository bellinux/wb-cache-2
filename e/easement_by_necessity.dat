2500|$|There is also {{an unwritten}} form of {{easement}} referred to as an implied easement or easement by implication, arising from the original subdivision of the land for continuous and obvious use of the adjacent parcel (e.g., for access to a road, or to a source of water) such as the right of lot owners in a subdivision to use the roadway on the approved subdivision plan without requiring a specific grant of easement to each new lot when first conveyed. An <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>necessity</b> is distinguished from an easement by implication in that the <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>necessity</b> arises only when [...] "strictly necessary", whereas the easement by implication can arise when [...] "reasonably necessary". <b>Easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>necessity</b> is a higher standard by which to imply an easement.|$|E

[...] Similarly, a merger doctrine extinguishes an <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>necessity</b> to a landlocked piece of property once that property is sold to one of the adjoining owners, thus extinguishing the necessity.

25|$|When a {{property}} owner misrepresents {{the existence of}} an easement while selling {{a property}} and does not include in the deed to the buyer an express easement over an adjoining property that the seller owns, a court may step in and create an <b>easement.</b> <b>Easements</b> <b>by</b> estoppel generally look to any promises not made in writing, any money spent by the benefiting party in reliance on the representations of the burdened party, and other factors. If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create an <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> estoppel.|$|R

40|$|Minnesotans {{have always}} taken {{pride in the}} vast rivers and lakes {{intricately}} woven throughout the state. This land-water mosaic has always been integral to state development. Yet regardless of how vital Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s lakes are considered to be, the law must keep apace with the dynamic and innovative society it serves. Today, the typical Minnesotan thinks in terms of driving to work, not rowing. The Daniel decision thus renders Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s cartway statute obsolete due to modern modes of transportation. In examining the Daniel decision, this case note begins with {{the historical development of}} Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s cartway legislation and an overview of the state power utilized in condemning cartways. A brief comparison is then made between statutory cartways and the typical common law <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>necessity.</b> A description of the relevant facts and reasoning of the Daniel decision follows. This note contends that the Daniel court correctly limited its decision to one of statutory interpretation. The court properly interpreted the statute in consideration of the state transportation arena that existed in 1913. The cartway statute and its interpretation are then compared to current water access trends in both statutory and common law. This note concludes that Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s cartway statute, as interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court, finds itself antiquated and in need of amendment due to the transportation needs of today 2 ̆ 7 s society...|$|E

25|$|<b>Easements</b> <b>by</b> prescription, {{also called}} {{prescriptive}} easements, are implied easements granted after the dominant estate {{has used the}} property in a hostile, continuous and open manner for a statutorily prescribed number of years.
