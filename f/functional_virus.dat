50|$|PCV's genome {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} of all viruses, requiring only a capsid protein (ORF2) and two replicase proteins (ORF1) in order to replicate and produce a <b>functional</b> <b>virus.</b> Due to the simplicity of PCV, it must rely heavily on the host's cellular machinery to replicate. The origin of replication is located on a small octanucleotide stem-loop that is flanked by palindromic repeats, with the ORF's being located head-to-head {{on both sides of the}} Ori. Specifically, ORF1 is located clockwise and ORF2 is located counterclockwise of the Ori. The two replicase enzymes that are created from ORF1, Rep and Rep', are conserved between the two types of PCV, and are part of the early phase of the virus. The replicases differ in that Rep is the full ORF1 transcript of 312 amino acids, whereas Rep' is a truncated form of ORF1 as a result of splicing and is only 168 amino acids in length. The promoter for rep (Prep) contains an Interferon-Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) that suggests Rep and Rep' are regulated by cytokine involvement, and is probably a means for the virus to overcome the host's immune responses to infection. Rep and Rep' form a dimer that binds to two hexameric regions adjacent to the stem-loop, H1 and H2, which is required for replication. When the dimer binds to this region, the replicases cleave the loop region of the stem-loop and remain covalently bound to the H1 and H2 regions of the DNA, which becomes the 5' end of the DNA. The newly formed 3'OH end forms a primer using host RNA polymerase, which is then used by the host's DNA polymerase to begin transcription of the viral DNA via rolling circle replication. After the complementary DNA strand has been created, the stem region of the stem-loop forms a loose, non-hydrogen bonded, quadruplet DNA structure. This loosely associated structure can form short lived DNA-trimers which forms two templates for replication, as well as maintaining the nucleic integrity of the stem region of the stem-loop. The termination of the replication sequence has not been identified, yet, though there is evidence supporting that Rep also represses its own promoter, Prep.The ORF2 region encodes Cap, which differs slightly between PCV-1 and PCV-2. This variation within PCV may explain why PCV-1 is non-pathogenic, while PCV-2 is pathogenic. The promoter for this protein is located within ORF1, within the site where Rep' is truncated, and is splice from the same exon to the starting point of the ORF2 coding region and expressed during both early and late phases. This is the immunogenic region of the virus and is the primary area of research for creating a vaccine to treat PMWS.|$|E

Consequently {{it is likely that}} a high proportion of individual RNA virus genomes, isolated from an infected host, will contain lethal mutations and be non-functional. This is problematic if the aim is to clone and investigate high-fitness, functional cDNAs and may also pose problems for sequence-based analysis of viral evolution. To address these challenges we have performed a study of the evolution of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) using deep sequencing and analysis of 84 full-length cDNA clones, each representing individual genomes from a moderately virulent isolate. In addition to here being used as a model for RNA viruses generally, CSFV has high socioeconomic importance and remains a threat to animal welfare and pig production. We find {{that the majority of the}} investigated genomes are non-functional and only 12 % produced infectious RNA transcripts. Full length sequencing of cDNA clones and deep sequencing of the parental population identified substitutions important for the observed phenotypes. The investigated cDNA clones were furthermore used as the basis for inferring the sequence of <b>functional</b> <b>viruses.</b> Since each unique clone must necessarily be the descendant of a functional ancestor, we hypothesized that it should be possible to produce functional clones by reconstructing ancestral sequences. To test this we used phylogenetic methods to infer two ancestral sequences, which were then reconstructed as cDNA clones. Viruses rescued from the reconstructed cDNAs were tested in cell culture and pigs. Both reconstructed ancestral genomes proved functional, and displayed distinct phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that reconstruction of ancestral viruses is a useful tool for experimental and computational investigations of virulence and viral evolution.

40|$|Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses found {{worldwide}} and {{are responsible for}} significant human and veterinary diseases, including dengue, Zika, and West Nile fever. Some flaviviruses are insect specific and replicate only in mosquitoes. We report a genetically divergent group of insect-specific flaviviruses from Anopheles mosquitoes that do not replicate in arthropod cell lines or heterologous Anopheles species, exhibiting unprecedented specialization for their host species. Determination of the complete sequences of the RNA genomes of three of these viruses, Karumba virus (KRBV), Haslams Creek virus, and Mac Peak virus (McPV), that are found in high prevalence in some Anopheles mosquito populations and detection of virus-specific proteins, replicative double-stranded RNA, and small interfering RNA responses in the host mosquito species provided strong evidence of a <b>functional</b> replicating <b>virus</b> in the mosquito midgut. Analysis of nucleotide composition in the KRBV and McPV sequences also revealed a pattern consistent with the virus evolving to replicate only in insects. These findings represent a significant advance in our knowledge of mosquito-borne flavivirus ecology, host restriction, and evolution...|$|R
40|$|Dystroglycan (DG) is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} cell surface molecule that provides a molecular link between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the actin-based cytoskeleton. Encoded by a single gene, DG is posttranslationally processed to form -DG, a peripheral protein identified as the cellular receptor for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Lassa fever virus (LFV), and the membrane-spanning subunit -DG. The link of -DG to the actin-based cytoskeleton and its association with the cellular signal transduction network suggest that it may function as an essential cofactor for the activity of -DG as a virus receptor. To address this issue, we constructed a deletion mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain of -DG and a C-terminal fusion between -DG and the transmembrane domain of PDGF receptor. Both mutants were <b>functional</b> as <b>virus</b> receptors, indicating that -DG does not act as a cofactor with -DG for arenavirus binding and entry. These observations are {{in agreement with the}} fact that LCMV infection is independent from the structural integrity of the actin-based cytoskeleton and suggest that -DG functions primarily in the attachment of arenaviruses to the cell surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{influenza}} virus hemagglutinin molecule possesses a globular head domain that mediates receptor binding and a stalk do-main at the membrane-proximal region. We generated <b>functional</b> influenza <b>viruses</b> expressing chimeric hemagglutinins encom-passing {{a variety of}} globular head and stalk combinations, not only from different hemagglutinin subtypes but also from differ-ent hemagglutinin phylogenetic groups. These chimeric recombinant viruses possess growth properties {{similar to those of}} wild-type {{influenza virus}}es and can be used as reagents to measure domain-specific antibodies in virological and immunological assays. Hemagglutinin (HA) is a homotrimeric molecule that is themajor surface glycoprotein of influenza virus. Each mono-mer consists of two disulfide-linked glycosylated polypeptides, HA 1 and HA 2, that are generated by proteolytic cleavage (15). These polypeptides make up two structurally distinct domains: a globular head, composed of part of HA 1, and a stalk structure, composed of portions of HA 1 and all of HA 2 (27). These domains are involved in two essential functions for the initiation of viral infection. The globular head domain contains a sialic acid binding pocket that mediates virus attachment to the host cell (18) ...|$|R
