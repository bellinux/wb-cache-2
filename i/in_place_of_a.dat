5|$|Shards of Alara also debuted mythic rares (red-orange), which replace one {{in eight}} rare cards on average. There are also premium {{versions}} of every card with holographic foil, randomly inserted into some boosters <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common, which replace {{about one in}} seventy cards.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} family consists of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. In some circumstances, the {{extended family}} comes to live either with or <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> member of the nuclear family. An example includes elderly parents who move in with their children due to old age. This places large demands on the caregivers, particularly the female relatives who choose to perform these duties for their extended family.|$|E

5|$|The first Sounds mascot was {{introduced}} during the team's inaugural 1978 season. Homer Horsehide, {{whose name was}} selected in a naming contest, resembled their major league affiliate's mascot — Mr. Red of the Cincinnati Reds. The character was human in appearance, {{with the exception of}} an oversized anthropomorphized baseball <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human head. The mustachioed mascot donned a uniform identical to that of Sounds players.|$|E
5|$|The west gate is {{the rear}} {{entrance}} to the Vizianagaram fort. This gateway is also built in Rajasthani style with a pavilion on top. The gate provides access to the royal tombs, and is a traditional gateway to take out dead bodies for cremation. <b>In</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moat, which existed in the past, {{there is now a}} well turned park extending to the west gate.|$|E
5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a bladderwort, {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part. This species can still trap and digest arthropod prey in its specialized bladder traps, but does so sparingly. Instead, it harbors a community of algae, zooplankton, and debris in the bladders, giving rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} bladders of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator-prey relationship.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and an 160 Mbyte flash ROM board <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (Dead or Alive 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{foundation}} the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange funerals, {{but over time}} took over {{all aspects of the}} arrangements from coffin-making to masonry. LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hearse. On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified the waiting room to be used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected return time to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as building blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> less user-friendly methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E

50|$|On September 28, 1992, he {{was signed}} as a free agent by the Philadelphia Eagles to replace an injured John Hudson. The next year, he started 4 games at right guard <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injured Eric Floyd.|$|R
25|$|The Patriots' storybook season {{continued}} as Drew Bledsoe {{came into the}} game in the second quarter <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injured Tom Brady – who replaced Bledsoe himself early in the season when he suffered a sheared blood vessel.|$|R
5|$|McAloney {{was born}} on 12 May 1910 in Adelaide, South Australia, the eldest son and second of six {{children}} of William Samuel McAloney and his wife Mary (née Murphy). The young McAloney was educated at Thebarton Technical High School and the Adelaide School of Mines. In 1925, McAloney registered for compulsory military training in the Citizen Military Force, serving as a private with the 43rd Battalion until November 1929. During this time, he gained employment as an automotive mechanic with Vrai Ltd, where he received on-the-job training <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> formal apprenticeship. McAloney was employed with Vrai for three years, before he took a position with Adelaide Car Service.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of the 2017 film Logan, its {{theatrical}} runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before Logan <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2010, Bumgarner {{was called}} up again {{to join the}} club, facing the Boston Red Sox the next day. He {{replaced}} Joe Martinez, who had made one start <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injured Todd Wellemeyer, in the rotation.|$|R
50|$|Although {{injuries}} and international duty have limited his availability for Otago, he remained {{a fixture in}} the squad, captaining the team for a stretch <b>in</b> 2007 <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injured Craig Newby. In 2008, he played his 50th match for the province.|$|R
50|$|Folsom {{was mostly}} a backup {{during his time}} with the team, until 1988, when he started 4 games <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injured Doug Cosbie. The next year, he started 16 games after Cosbie left the Cowboys via Plan B free agency.|$|R
5|$|Tom Dollery {{was called}} into the team after a run of heavy scoring for Warwickshire on {{difficult}} pitches at Edgbaston. He had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first-class matches for the season. Batsman Charlie Barnett was dropped after scoring only eight and six in the First Test. Joe Hardstaff junior was also left out; he had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, and had a toe infection, so the selectors were spared the predicament of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds. With Wright in for Young, and Coxon selected <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specialist batsman, England had a more attacking bowling line-up, something the retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly praised. He also thought the selection of Coxon was beneficial, as his swing bowling would ease the workload of batsman Bill Edrich, who had opened the bowling in the previous Test. O'Reilly regarded Edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought the extra burden with the ball was detracting from his main duty, batting.|$|E
5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or {{be replaced by a}} spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E
5|$|New York {{was unable}} to build on their 1970 success. Tarkenton left the team's 1971 {{training}} camp in a salary dispute, before coming back {{a few days later}} after signing a one-year contract. <b>In</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> salary increase, Tarkenton had asked for a large loan to get a tax break, but the Maras turned it down, and made sure the press knew the raise and loan were denied. Johnson missed most of the season with a knee injury, and the Giants dropped to 4–10. Before the 1972 season they traded Tarkenton, who frequently feuded with Webster, back to the Vikings. Initially the trade produced positive results, as New York rallied to finish 8–6 in 1972. The 1972 team was led by veteran journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton), who led the league in passing and had the best season of his career. They set a still-standing team record on November 26 when they scored 62 points via eight touchdowns and two field goals. After the 1972 season however, the Giants suffered one of the worst prolonged stretches in their history. Meanwhile, Tarkenton would lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and establish a Hall of Fame resume.|$|E
50|$|He {{started the}} last two games of the season at right tackle <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injured Solomon Page. He was waived on September 9, 2002, after not being able to control his weight {{problems}} and not getting himself into better playing shape.|$|R
50|$|As a rookie, {{he started}} 6 games at free safety <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injured Mel Renfro. The {{next year he}} was a reserve player. In 1969, he started in 13 games at right cornerback, before being benched in favor of Otto Brown.|$|R
