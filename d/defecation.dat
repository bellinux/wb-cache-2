5|$|Tripura {{has high}} {{incidence}} of open <b>defecation,</b> especially in the interior hilly and forest areas. The state has extensively implemented Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and currently the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and convergence with MGNREGS to address this problem. Schools and Anganwadi Center are focussed to provide with urinals and latrines, separate {{for boys and girls}} aling with baby friendly toilets in Anganwadi Centers to inculcate the habit of using sanitary latrines in young age. However many toilets lie dysfuncational due to lack of maintenance and damage. Earlier schemes of providing plastic squatting plates, free of cost to people, has not produced results as most of them lie unused as many people cannot afford to construct a toilet. Open <b>defecation</b> has created problems of diarrhoea and vulnerability to malaria. The Chief Minister of Tripura has envisioned to make the state Open <b>Defecation</b> Free (ODF) by 2017.|$|E
5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of <b>defecation.</b> The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with <b>defecation</b> can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, pungent, fruity smell. The {{mushroom}} is poisonous, containing muscarine compounds. Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, <b>defecation,</b> gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E

5|$|Hippo <b>defecation</b> creates {{allochthonous}} {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, urination, <b>defecation,</b> gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses <b>defecation</b> as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} chronic treatment with low doses of diazepam on body weight, <b>defecations</b> and urinations, vertical rears, the elevated platform test, and self-grooming in male rats exposed for 21 days to social isolation. The rats were treated for 21 days with diazepam (0. 2 mg/kg, i. p) or its vehicle. Social isolation led to decreased body weight and vertical rears, more <b>defecations</b> and urinations, increased reluctance to step down from the test platform, shorter duration of grooming, and longer reluctance to start grooming. Chronic diazepam in individually housed rats produced increase in body weight and vertical rears, {{decrease in the number}} of <b>defecations</b> and urinations, and shortening of the time of reluctance to step down from the platform. The number of grooming bouts, their duration, and reluctance to start grooming were not altered by diazepam, but it decreased the percentage of incorrect transitions. The obtained data indicate that chronic diazepam treatment of socially isolated rats changes non-grooming behavior and some grooming behavior parameters.

5|$|On 2 October 2014, Modi {{launched}} the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ("Clean India") campaign. The stated {{goals of the}} campaign included eliminating open <b>defecation</b> and manual scavenging. The plan was to achieve these aims in five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hyperbilirubinemia is {{a common}} {{physiological}} problem in approximately 80 % of preterm infants {{during the first week}} after birth. Increase in bowel movements reduces enterohepatic circulation and increases bilirubin excretion. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Field massage technique on bilirubin level and the number of <b>defecations</b> in preterm infants Method: This clinical trial was performed on 80 preterm infants aged 30 - 36 weeks, who were hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units of Qaem, Imam Reza, and Ommolbanin hospitals of Mashhad, Iran, in 2011. The enrolled infants were randomized into intervention and control groups. The control group received the routine care, and the intervention group received a 15 -minute massage twice a day (morning and evening), for five consecutive days. Field massage technique was applied by the researcher. The number of <b>defecations</b> and cutaneous bilirubin level were recorded on a daily basis until the sixth day after birth. Independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to analyze the data, using SPSS version 14. Results: The mean age of the intervention and control groups was 17. 2 ± 4. 5 and 17. 1 ± 4. 5 hours, respectively. The mean level of cutaneous bilirubin in the intervention and control groups on the first and sixth days were not significantly different (10. 7 ± 1. 5, 10. 8 ± 1. 4, 13. 4 ± 2. 0, and 13. 4 ± 2. 6, respectively; the first day: P= 0. 67, the sixth day: P= 0. 98).

40|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} {{are also}} used {{in the treatment of}} anxiety-related disorders. Clinical and preclinical evidence regarding their intrinsic anxiolytic efficacy has been mixed. In this study, we examined the potential anxiolytic-like effects of risperidone and olanzapine, and compared them with haloperidol, chlordiazepoxide (a prototype of sedative–anxiolytic drug) or citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). We used a composite of two-way avoidance conditioning and acoustic startle reflex model and examined the effects of drug treatments during the acquisition phase (Experiment 1) or extinction phase (Experiments 2 and 3) on multiple measures of conditioned and unconditioned fear/anxiety-like responses. In Experiment 4, we further compared risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol, citalopram and chlordiazepoxide in a standard elevated plus maze test. Results revealed three distinct anxiolytic-like profiles associated with risperidone, olanzapine and chlordiazepoxide. Risperidone, especially at 1. 0 mg/kg, significantly decreased the number of avoidance responses, 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalization, avoidance conditioning-induced hyperthermia and startle reactivity, but did not affect <b>defecations</b> or time spent on the open arms. Olanzapine (2. 0 mg/kg, sc) significantly decreased the number of avoidance responses, 22 kHz vocalization and amount of <b>defecations,</b> but it did not inhibit startle reactivity and time spent on the open arms. Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, ip) significantly decreased the number of 22 kHz vocalization, avoidance conditioning-induced hyperthermia and amount of <b>defecations,</b> and increased time spent on the open arms, but did not decrease avoidance responses or startle reactivity. Haloperidol and citalopram did not display any anxiolytic-like property in these tests. The results highlight the importance of using multiple measures of fear-related responses to delineate behavioral profiles of psychotherapeutic drugs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Definition and {{diagnosis}} of constipation remain challenging, {{partly due to}} different perceptions of the disease by doctors and patients. Aim: To evaluate prevalence and features of constipation among individuals seen in general practice, by comparing different diagnostic instruments. Methods: Standardized questionnaires and the Bristol stool form scale were distributed to all subjects attending 10 general practitioners for any reason in a 2 -week period. The questionnaires investigated constipation defined according to: (1) self-perception (yes/no); (2) a visual analogue scale; (3) Rome III Criteria. Results: The prevalence of constipation in 1306 subjects (790 female, 516 male) resulted: (1) 34 % self-reported; (2) 28 % by visual analogue scale; (3) 24 % by Rome Criteria. Constipation was more frequent in females. A high frequency of symptoms of obstructed <b>defecations</b> was observed with differences among patients with self-reported constipation with or without Bristol stool type 1 – 2. Conclusions: Prevalence of constipation among individuals attending their GP ranges between 24 and 34 %, according to the different definitions adopted. Symptoms of obstructed <b>defecations</b> are frequent. The combination of self-evaluation and the Bristol stool type scale is potentially useful to identify subgroups of patients with different clinical features in general practice...|$|R
5|$|Although wildcats are solitary, {{the social}} {{behavior}} of domestic cats {{is much more}} variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by <b>defecation.</b> Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, {{they do not have}} a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.|$|E
25|$|In {{developed}} countries, open <b>defecation</b> {{is considered}} to be a part of voluntary, recreational outdoor activities in remote areas.

40|$|Aim: {{to assess}} {{clinical}} efficacy of polietilenglicol (macrogol) with molecular weight 4000 kDa {{in children with}} chronic constipation. Patients and methods: clinical efficacy was assessed in 30 children aged 2 – 12 years with chronic constipation. The follow-up was performed on an out-patient basis, patients and their parents kept diaries, noting stool characteristics according to the Bristol stool scale. Coprological analysis and abdominal ultrasound were carried out. The duration of the follow-up after {{the withdrawal of the}} studied drug was 6 months. Results: during the 1 st week of treatment the frequency of stool increased in 23 (76, 6 %) children, normalization of stool frequency to the 4 th week of treatment was achieved in 93, 3 % of patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Published {{estimates}} of the prevalence of postcholecystectomy diarrhoea derive from retrospective or uncontrolled data. They ignore functional bowel syndromes and possible changes in diet and drug use.  AIMS—To determine prospectively whether and how often cholecystectomy leads to changes in bowel function and bowel symptoms, especially to liquid stools, over and above any non-specific effect of laparoscopic surgery.  SUBJECTS—Patients: 106  adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (85  women, 21  men). Controls: 37  women undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation.  METHODS—Before and 2 - 6 months after surgery patients were administered questionnaires about bowel frequency, bowel symptoms, diet, and drugs, and kept records of five consecutive <b>defecations</b> with assessment of stool form or appearance on a seven point scale.  RESULTS—In cholecystectomised women, stated bowel frequency increased, on average by one movement a week, and fewer subjects felt that they became constipated. However, records showed no consistent change in bowel frequency, stool form, or defecatory symptoms. Six women reported diarrhoea after the operation but in only one was it clearly new and in her it was mild. Change in dietary fibre intake did not associate with change in bowel function but stopping constipating drugs did in a minority. In women being sterilised there was no consistent change in bowel function. In men having cholecystectomy no consistent changes were observed.  CONCLUSIONS—In women, cholecystectomy leads to the perception of less constipation and slightly more frequent <b>defecations</b> but short term recordings show no consistent change in bowel function. Clinical diarrhoea develops rarely and is not severe.    Keywords: cholecystectomy; bowel habit; stools; diarrhoea; constipation; irritable bowel syndrom...|$|R
40|$|Psychotic {{fear and}} anxiety {{disturbances}} are seen at a relatively high frequency in patients with schizophrenia. Atypical anti-psychotics are believed to show superior efficacy in reducing these symptoms. However, clinical and preclinical evidence regarding their anxiolytic efficacy has been mixed. In this study, we evaluated the possible anxiolytic property of two atypicals, clozapine and olanzapine, and compared them with typical haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide (a prototype of sedative-anxiolytic drug) in two preclinical models of fear. In Experiment 1, we used a fear-induced passive avoidance and conditioned place aversion paradigm and {{examined the effects of}} clozapine (20 mg/kg, sc), haloperidol (0. 05 mg/kg, sc) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, ip). In Experiments 2 and 3, we used a two-way active avoidance conditioning paradigm and further compared the effects of clozapine (20 mg/kg, sc), haloperidol (0. 05 mg/kg, sc), chlordiazepoxide(10 mg/kg, ip) and three doses of olanzapine (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg/kg, sc). Results show that clozapine and chlordiazepoxide, but not haloperidol, significantly attenuated the shock conditioning-induced place aversion, decreased the amount of <b>defecations</b> and the number of the 22 -kHz vocalizations. Clozapine also reduced the shock conditioning-induced hyperthermia. Similar to clozapine, olanzapine also significantly decreased the amount of <b>defecations</b> and reduced the shock conditioning-induced hyperthermia, but it did not inhibit the 22 -kHz vocalizations. This study demonstrates that clozapine and olanzapine possess an intrinsic anxiolytic property, which is not attributable to its superior anti-“psychotic” effect or its favorable effects on motor functions or learning and memory processes. These findings also suggest that the combined use of passive avoidance and active avoidance conditioning models can be useful in better differentiating typical and atypical anti-psychotics as well as anxiolytics...|$|R
