25|$|Also in 2012, Disney Mobile {{launched}} a mobile game titled Where's My Perry? for iOS and Android. It {{was based on}} Disney's popular Where's My Water? game, using similar physics. In this game, Agent P <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into O.W.C.A. headquarters but the transport tubes are out, so he needs water for the backup underground hydrogenerators. If you struggle or get stuck, Major Monogram and Carl will offer encouragement while Doofenshmirtz will taunt him. Phineas and Ferb never appear in the game except in the opening splash screen. The game was expanded to include levels featuring Doofenshmirtz and other animal agents. The game has a 4.0 rating on iTunes, but has not been updated {{in more than a}} year.|$|E
25|$|It is {{revealed}} that Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> revenge on the Mitchells, especially Phil, {{because he believes}} Phil's father, Eric, murdered his own father, Henry, many years earlier. Their feud leads to Phil abducting Vincent's daughter Pearl Fox-Hubbard, with the two threatening to shoot each other, and Vincent trying to strangle Phil to death, though Vincent decides to end the feud when innocent Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) is accidentally killed. Phil's drinking worsens and he drives while intoxicated, with Ian and Dennis in the car. Distracted, Phil crashes the car, and Dennis is badly injured. In exchange for Sharon not telling the police about Bobby killing Lucy, Phil agrees with Ian that Ian will take the blame for causing the crash. While Dennis is being attended to, a doctor tells Phil that his scans showed he has cirrhosis, a disease garnered from his alcoholism. The doctor warns Phil that without treatment, he could die, but Phil remains in denial about this. He later researches cirrhosis online at home and when he finds out that Dennis is recovering, decides to give up drinking and rushes {{to the hospital to}} tell Sharon that he will always stand by her.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

The second verse discusses the various things that are touching the person (such as a suitcase and an elbow), and about how several of his personal items are missing (like a contact lens and a wallet). In the third verse, the speaker <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fresh air but the bus' fan is broken and his window does not open. This causes him to exclaim that he [...] "hasn't been in a crowd like this since I went to see The Who." [...] Finally, he laments about not getting off the bus sooner.|$|E
500|$|Suddenly, the sheriff's body disappears, and Reyes doubles over in pain. Doggett and Harrison pull up {{her shirt}} to reveal moving bulges in her stomach, as if {{something}} <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. Harrison then begins to bleed from her eyes. Doggett approaches Tommy, orders him to stop, and follows him down the hall when he fails to stop. [...] Doggett follows Tommy into a room, but falls down into a blackened abyss, where he is attacked by the insects. [...] However, due to Doggett's skepticism, {{he is able to}} fight off the illusion. [...] Because he does not believe they are real, they cease to be real. Doggett explains to Jeffrey that all of the creatures are imaginary and are produced by Tommy's imagination. This includes the bugs, the [...] "sheriff" [...] who had no organs, and Reyes' and Harrison's ailments. Jeffrey's wife and their cat Spanky killed themselves trying to remove the insect creatures, believing they were real.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{back to the}} {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd to the helicopter is actually an accident that {{made it into the}} finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E

The drug runner agrees, but is killed after telling that he believed Eko had no soul. Later, Eko visits the church of his hometown, where Yemi {{has become a}} priest. Eko asks him for a plane, because only United Nations relief and missionary aircraft are allowed to fly out of Nigeria, saying he will fly the drugs away from the Nigerians and give his brother money for a polio vaccine. Yemi refuses to help. Later, Eko approaches his brother again, asking simply for Yemi to sign ordination papers that make Eko and two associates priests so that they can arrange the flight themselves. His brother refuses, but reluctantly signs after Eko says that his two friends will burn the church to the ground if Yemi does not collaborate. Eko also buys Virgin Mary statues to hide the heroin within.|$|E
500|$|Howard {{reunited with}} Shyamalan for Lady in the Water, {{in which she}} acts as Story, a type of water nymph called a narf. The 2006 fantasy film release also stars Paul Giamatti as the co-lead.

Once he discovers that she is actually a character from a bedtime story who <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back home, he teams up with his tenants to protect her from creatures that try to keep her in their world. It underperformed at the box office, falling short of its $75million budget, and got largely negative reviews from critics. Next, she once again played Rosalind in Kenneth Branagh's 2006 film version of Shakespeare's As You Like It. It played in theatres in Europe before going directly to cable in the United States, premiering on HBO. Howard was nominated for a Golden Globe Award at the 2008 ceremony. The project got soundly negative reviews from the British media, while American reviewers gave it more favorable notice. [...] That year, she wrote and directed a short film, Orchids, as part of Glamour magazine's [...] "Reel Moments" [...] series funded by Cartier and FilmAid International.|$|E

[...] Maulbetsch immediately denied the rumor, saying: [...] "I have not resigned. [...] I am aware that a faction here <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me out, but I {{do not intend to}} throw up the sponge." [...] In December, pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew, and one Oklahoma newspaper observed: [...] "Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the past season. [...] They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. [...] Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game." [...] Ultimately, Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A's coach in football, baseball, and basketball. [...] It was announced that he would spend the remaining year of his contract on a leave of absence at half pay.|$|E
