5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this <b>ground</b> <b>plan</b> includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the <b>ground</b> <b>plan</b> for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Large scale {{maps are}} {{available}} for many countries. The building <b>ground</b> <b>plans</b> of those maps can be helpful for the reconstruction of 3 D building models from laser data and aerial images. This paper presents two studies on 3 D building reconstruction. The first study combines data of a laser scanner with a high point density with the <b>ground</b> <b>plans.</b> The reconstruction approach is data driven. The second study is more model driven and utilises the <b>ground</b> <b>plans</b> for the building reconstruction from aerial photographs with known orientations. Results of both approaches are described and {{the pros and cons}} of them are analysed. ...|$|R

5|$|It is {{possible}} that a church was present on the site in the Saxon era, although the earliest fabric in the church is Norman. The present <b>ground</b> <b>plan</b> {{was established in the}} 13th and 14thcenturies, from which time the church's external appearance dates, apart from a major rebuilding in the later part of the 15thcentury, when the range of high windows or clerestory was added. All styles of English Gothic architecture, are represented in the church: Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. During the civil war, a group of Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. In the 19thcentury the interior of the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott; some wall paintings were revealed, and stained glass was added.|$|E
5|$|Mantou kiln: The mantou kiln was {{the most}} common type of pottery kiln in north China, in {{historical}} periods when the dragon kiln dominated south China; both seem to have emerged in the Warring States period of approximately 475 to 221 BC. It is named (in both English and Chinese) after the Chinese mantou bun or roll, whose shape it (very approximately) resembles; the <b>ground</b> <b>plan</b> resembles a horseshoe. The kilns are roughly round, with a low dome covering the central firing area, and are generally only 2 to 3 metres across inside. However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370°C. There is a door or bricked-up opening at the front for loading and unloading, and one or two short chimneys at the rear.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edmund's son Sir Ambrose succeeded him in 1920. His son Sir Arthur {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of {{documentary}} film making in the years prior to, during and after the Second World War, working with John Grierson. He inherited the title on his father's death in 1951. The house was acquired by the Nation, and was given to the National Trust, in part-payment of death duties, in 1960. The West Wing was immediately demolished, being considered to have no architectural or historical significance, to reduce running costs and to return the house to its supposed mediaeval <b>ground</b> <b>plan.</b> Sir Arthur died in 1973 and was succeeded by his son Sir Charles. The Elton family is still resident in the house, which is now open to the public.|$|E

5|$|The first {{example of}} his final stage {{can be seen in}} a simple but very ingenious building, the Sagrada Família schools, a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a {{rectangular}} <b>ground</b> <b>plan</b> of , and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Família schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as a source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the <b>ground</b> <b>plan.</b> The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E

25|$|One {{example is}} the former offices of the Dutch steamtram company, Joana Stoomtram Maatschappij in Semarang by Thomas Karsten (1930). The <b>ground</b> <b>plan</b> of this {{single-storeyed}} building is identical {{to that of a}} traditional Javanese Joglo: tall columns support a hipped, two-tiered roof, which facilitates cross ventilation of the roof cavity.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{location}} of the site the church is not oriented, but directed to the southeast. The building consists of three longish naves on an asymmetric <b>ground</b> <b>plan.</b> While the northeastern nave is large and harbours a loft, in order to place more seats, the southwestern nave to Antwerpener Straße is narrow, rather resembling an aisle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} extending preexisting two-dimensional geometric data representing the <b>ground</b> <b>plans</b> of buildings to three-dimensional descriptions by the combination of this data with the analysis of aerial images. Frequently, <b>ground</b> <b>plans</b> have already been registrated and represented either analog in maps and plans or digital in a Geo Information System (GIS). Within the article the utilized <b>ground</b> <b>plans</b> are exemplary provided by a digital cadastral map, which is assembled as an area covering data base {{and at the moment}} is available for 40 % of Germany. Even though this information is very valuable for the 3 D building reconstruction, the available data structures contained in the GIS have to be expanded considerably until they can be used to support the interpretation of images. In general the available information has to be transformed into more complex structures, which are more suitable and knowledge on how to use this information has to be provided. This implies steps like the extraction of relations which are only contained implicitly in the available data, the elimination of unnecessary information (e. g. details not visible in aerial images) and the generation of hypotheses on the missing 3. dimension of the represented building. These hypotheses the can be verified and the unknown parameters can be determined by the analysis of the aerial images...|$|R
25|$|The church building, {{which is}} {{equipped}} with flat saddle roofs and executed in a steel skeleton construction, is entered via the large perron, which {{is located in the}} Wittelsbacher Allee.

25|$|Spring Hall, {{also known}} as Spring Hall Mansions, is a mansion {{situated}} off the Huddersfield Road, Halifax, West Yorkshire.
