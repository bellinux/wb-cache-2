Deformation of guitar neck by string tension constitutes a quality defect of finished product- guitars, which affect the acoustic of instrument. The neck bending modified length guitar strings which leads to obtaining false sounds. Therefore, the aim of the research was to establish the stresses and strains state of the guitar neck in terms of varying the position and force size and contour conditions. It was found that both deflection and stress are maximum values when force is applied on joint area between neck and guitar body.

The adsorption of NP to algal cell surfaces (Fig.  2 f) could accelerate their sedimentation (Fig.  2 g), which forces pelagic consumers {{to invest more}} energy in collecting their food near the sediment [195]. Bundschuh et al. [196], in contrast, uncovered an increase in Daphnia growth and partly reproduction after allowing an interaction between algae and TiO 2 NP for 1 – 3  days. Moreover, NP ingested together with the food could negatively influence digestion by clogging the gut with negative consequences on life history strategies of primary consumers in autotrophic food webs [195]. Similar patterns have been observed for detritus-based food webs [197]. Altogether, these observations suggest highly complex interactions between organic material (<b>irrespective</b> whether <b>of</b> particulate or dissolved nature), NP and biota, but are also pointing {{to a lack of}} mechanistic understanding.|$|R

From 1985 to 1996, abdominal exploration and gonadectomy were performed in 11 intersex children together with urogenital endoscopy and genitoplastic surgery in our institutes. Their median age was 6. 0 (range 0 – 15) {{years old and}} initial gender sex was female in 8 and male in 3. The initial 4 cases (group 1) underwent open abdominal exploration together with gonadectomy, while the latter 7 cases (group 2) underwent laparoscopic exploration simultaneously with 3 laparoscopic gonadectomy and 1 open one via a inguinal incision. Their final diagnoses were male pseudohermaphroditism in 4 cases, mixed gonadal dysgenesis in 3, true hermaphroditism in 2, XX gonadal dysgenesis in 1, and XY gonadal dysgenesis in 1. Consequently, 2 of initial male were reared as a female.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{immersed}} boundary {{method is}} introduced for simulating the fluid-structure interaction problem.

Therefore, the fluid is simply simulated on a fixed Cartesian mesh <b>irrespective</b> the movement <b>of</b> the immersed solid, which circumvents the mesh quality issue that frequently happens in the body-conforming mesh method. To enforce the correct boundary condition, we derive an additional moving force equation. This additional equation is integrated into a second order accurate fractional step method and solved with the conjugate gradient method. The proposed method is validated with several one-way fluid-structure interaction examples...|$|R

40|$|Doubtless {{a number}} of "purely" economic, {{political}} and geographical factors have handicapped until comparatively recently the progress of economic development in Ireland: We scarcely need to give examples. Yet not all communities that have suffered from the same, or similar handicaps in one historical period or another were defeated by them, economically speaking; in just {{the same way as}} the Irish people. Clearly such differences as there were must have arisen in part from the lack of exact identity in the several sets of historical circumstances in which these communities have found themselves situated. But we may also suppose that some responsibility for differences in rates of economic development should be laid at the door of diversity of social values. That is, there may have been, features of life in Ireland (of which certain vestiges remain today) that were out of harmony with the spirit <b>of</b> industrial society. <b>Irrespective</b> possibly <b>of</b> oppressive historical circumstances, these may have created by themselves an obstacle to the transformation of traditional Irish life in the direction that industrial, or even agrarian, revolution demanded.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that human cognitive processes are subject to systematic biases associated with particular emotional states. But how do these cognitive biases arise? This question was addressed {{by means of a}} pictorial Stroop task which allowed the development of such a bias to be assessed. In each of two experiments, spiderphobic participants were significantly impaired at naming the colours of phobia-related pictures relative to those of control pictures. Investigation of the magnitude of this effect for participants of different ages allowed two contrasting hypotheses concerning the development of such biases to be compared. The integral bias hypothesis asserts that the effects of emotion on cognition reflect integral links between emotional states and cognitive mechanisms, links that are not arbitrary but instead are fixed constituents of our mental architecture. In contrast, the inferred bias hypothesis asserts that these effects arise {{as a consequence of the}} gradual establishment of associations between particular emotional states and particular patterns of cognitive behaviour. It was found that the magnitude of the observed bias remained approximately constant <b>irrespective</b> either <b>of</b> the ages of participants or of the directly estimated durations of their phobias. This fixed relation provides strong support for the integral bias explanation of the cognitive effects of an emotional disturbance. Finally, the evolutionary context in which integral links between emotion and cognition may arise is discussed...|$|R
