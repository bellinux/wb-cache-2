40|$|AbstractDuring this research, {{experimental}} rolled homogeneous armour steel was cast, annealed {{and laser}} cut {{to form an}} appliqué plate. This Martensitic–Bainitic microstructure steel grade {{was used to test}} a novel means of engineering lightweight armour. It was determined that a laser cutting speed of 1200 [*]mm/min produced optimum <b>hole</b> <b>formations</b> with limited distortion. The array of holes acts as a double-edged solution, in that they provide weight saving of 45 %, providing a protective advantage and increasing the surface area. Data collected were used to generate laser cut-edge hole projections in order to identify the optimum cutting speed, edge condition, cost and deformation performance. These parameters resulted in the generation of a surface, with less stress raising features. This can result in a distribution of stress across the wider surface. Provided that appropriate process parameters are used to generate laser cut edges, then the hardness properties of the surface can be controlled. This is due to compressive residual stresses produced in the near edge region as a result of metallurgical transformations. This way the traverse cutting speed parameter can be adjusted to alter critical surface characteristics and microstructural properties in close proximity to the cut-edge. A relationship was identified between the width of the laser HAZ and the hardness of the cut edge. It is the thickness of the HAZ that is affected by the laser process parameters which can be manipulated with adjusting the traverse cutting speed...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{was made of}} the James Peak-Sharp Mountain area, {{in the southern part of}} the Bear River Range, Utah. The mapped area is located in north-central Utah between lat. 41 ° 222 ̆ 7302 ̆ 2 N. and lat. 41 ° 302 ̆ 7 N. and long. 111 ° 422 ̆ 7302 ̆ 2 W. and long. 111 ° 462 ̆ 7 W. It measures about 3. 8 miles in the east-west direction and 8. 7 miles in the north-south direction. The area is centered about 22 miles south-southeast of Logan, Utah. Stratigraphic units of late Precambrian to Mississippian age underlie the mapped area. The Precambrian units include the Mutual and Browns <b>Hole</b> <b>Formations.</b> The Brigham, Langston, Ute, Blacksmith, Bloomington, Nounan, and St. Charles Formations make up a complete Cambrian section. The Ordovician Garden City and Swan Peak Formations, the Ordovician-Silurian Laketown Formation, the Devonian Water Canyon and Hyrum Formations, and the Mississippian Lodgepole and Humbug Formations overlie the St. Charles in normal succession. The oldest unit the Precambrian Mutual Formation, crops out in the southern part of the area on the eastern side of James Peak. The rock units are progressively younger toward the northern part of the area. Mesozoic rocks are not present. The Salt Lake Formation of Tertiary age directly overlies the Paleozoic rocks. The main structural feature of the area is an asymmetrical north-south-trending anticline. The eastern flank dips more steeply than the western flank. The anticline plunges gently north and dies out southward. This anticline is one of a series of asymmetrical anticlines, all steeper on the east than on the west, that includes the Strawberry Valley anticline to the east and the anticline exposed in upper Wolf Creek Canyon to the west. The late Precambrian and early Paleozoic formations, which dip northeast on the eastern flank of James Peak, make up the northeastern flank of the anticline exposed in upper Wolf Creek Canyon. The early Paleozoic to Devonian formations that form Sharp Mountain and dip gently west make up the western flank of the Strawberry Valley anticline. Low-angle thrust faults have disrupted the Precambrian and Paleozoic formations on the eastern and southeastern flanks of James Peak. Displacement on the thrust fault north of upper Wellsville Creek is about 2, 000 feet. Movement was generally from the west. Normal faults have disrupted the Paleozoic and Tertiary formations along the eastern margin of Cache Valley and the Paleozoic formations east of McKenzie Mountain. Displacement is indeterminate along the eastern margin of Cache Valley. Maximum displacement, east of McKenzie Mountain, is about 1, 750 feet. The normal faults truncate the folds and thrust faults. The folds and thrust faults were formed during the Laramide orogeny. The normal faults were formed during Basin and Range normal faulting.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{quantitative}} {{study on the}} properties at death of fast-rotating massive stars evolved at low-metallicity-objects that are proposed as likely progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). We perform one-dimensional+rotation stellar-collapse simulations on the progenitor models of Woosley and Heger, and critically assess their potential {{for the formation of}} a black hole and a Keplerian disk (namely, a collapsar) or a proto-magnetar. We note that theoretical uncertainties in the treatment of magnetic fields and the approximate handling of rotation compromise the accuracy of stellar-evolution models. We find that only the fastest rotating progenitors achieve sufficient compactness for black <b>hole</b> <b>formation</b> while the bulk of models possess a core density structure typical of garden-variety core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors evolved without rotation and at solar metallicity. Of the models that do have sufficient compactness for black <b>hole</b> <b>formation,</b> most of them also retain a large amount of angular momentum in the core, making them prone to a magneto-rotational explosion, therefore preferentially leaving behind a proto-magnetar. A large progenitor angular-momentum budget is often the sole criterion invoked in the community today to assess the suitability for producing a collapsar. This simplification ignores equally important considerations such as the core compactness, which conditions black <b>hole</b> <b>formation,</b> the core angular momentum, which may foster a magneto-rotational explosion preventing black <b>hole</b> <b>formation,</b> or the metallicity and the residual envelope mass which must be compatible with inferences from observed LGRB/SNe.

Adopting two different sets of realistic equation of state (EOS) of dense matter, we perform the numerical simulations of general relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics under the spherical symmetry. We make comparisons of the core bounce, the shock propagation, the evolution of nascent proto-neutron star and the resulting re-collapse to black hole to reveal the influence of EOS. We also {{explore the influence of}} EOS on the neutrino emission during the evolution toward the black <b>hole</b> <b>formation.</b> We find that the speed of contraction of the nascent proto-neutron star, whose mass increases fast due to the intense accretion, is different depending on the EOS and the resulting profiles of density and temperature differ significantly. The black <b>hole</b> <b>formation</b> occurs at 0. 6 - 1. 3 sec after bounce when the proto-neutron star exceeds its maximum mass, which is crucially determined by the EOS. We find that the average energies of neutrinos increase after bounce because of rapid temperature increase, but at different speeds depending on the EOS. The duration of neutrino emission up to the black <b>hole</b> <b>formation</b> is found different according to the different timing of re-collapse. These characteristics of neutrino signatures are distinguishable from those for ordinary proto-neutron stars in successful core-collapse supernovae.
