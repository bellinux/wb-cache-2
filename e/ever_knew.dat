Her clothes, furniture, and even her snuff were sold by Christie's. It is highly unlikely that her husband <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> of her death. He died blind, deaf, lame and insane 14 months later.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after his visit to Virginia, Lincoln was assassinated. Porter, upon {{learning}} of Lincoln's assassination, was greatly upset by the news, as he admired Lincoln greatly. Porter called Lincoln the best man he <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> and ever will know. He stated that he felt some responsibility for Lincoln's death, as had he been {{with him on the}} night of his death, he might have prevented his murder.|$|E
500|$|Austrian School {{economist}} Friedrich Hayek was Keynes's {{most prominent}} contemporary critic, with sharply opposing {{views on the}} economy. Yet after Keynes's death, he wrote: [...] "He was the one really great man I <b>ever</b> <b>knew,</b> and for whom I had unbounded admiration. The world {{will be a very}} much poorer place without him." ...|$|E

500|$|General Webb was {{recalled}} {{because of}} his actions; William Johnson wrote that Webb was [...] "the only Englishman [...] <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> who was a coward." [...] Lord Loudoun was also recalled, although this occurred {{primarily because of the}} failure of the Louisbourg expedition. [...] Colonel Monro died in November 1757, of apoplexy that some historians have suggested was caused by anger over Webb's failure to support him.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} his education at Otakou Native School, Ellison {{was awarded a}} scholarship in 1882 to attend the famous Māori secondary school Te Aute College in the Hawke's Bay. He started playing organised rugby there, and during his final two years played in the school team that won the Hawke's Bay senior club championship. Later in life Ellison claimed that at Te Aute he learned, [...] "nearly all I <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> of forward play".|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} before Lincoln's assassination, Whitman {{observed}} the planet Venus shining brightly in the evening sky. He later wrote of the observation, [...] "Nor earth nor sky <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> spectacles of superber beauty {{than some of the}} nights lately here. The western star, Venus, in the earlier hours of evening, has never been so large, so clear; it seems as if it told something, as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity, with us Americans" [...] In the poem, Whitman describes the disappearance of the star: ...|$|E

500|$|On {{hearing the}} news Kenneth Williams {{wrote in his}} diary that [...] "I loved that man. His unselfish nature, his kindness, {{tolerance}} and gentleness were an example to everyone". In The Sunday Times in February 1969, Paul Jennings wrote of him: [...] "If I <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> a gentleman, it was Kenneth Horne.... He gave you his whole attention, his whole courtesy. And what a courtesy it was!... I knew him {{in the context of}} panel games, to which his marvellous unforced humour, spontaneous but beautifully timed, always added sparkle." ...|$|E
500|$|The judge, Sir Henry Hawkins, had a {{distinguished}} career, although {{after his death}} a former Solicitor General for England and Wales Sir Edward Clarke wrote: [...] "Sir Henry Hawkins was the worst judge I <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> or heard of. He had no notion whatever of what justice meant, or of the obligations of truth or fairness." [...] The prosecuting counsels, Charles Russell and Willie Mathews, {{went on to become}} Lord Chief Justice and Director of Public Prosecutions, respectively. The defence counsel, Frank Lockwood, later became Solicitor General, and he was assisted by H. H. Asquith, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twenty years later.|$|E
500|$|With all appeal avenues {{exhausted}} and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things I did to ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz.") ...|$|E

It was only after we finally became {{teammates}} and then retired that I could tell Tris Speaker of the underlying respect I had for him." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I <b>ever</b> <b>knew,</b> both as a baseball player and as a gentleman." [...] Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, [...] "He was a team player. As great a hitter as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ... Speaker was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and know how to play the hitters." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{prolific}} scorer, Cook scored 317 {{goals and}} 508 points in 591 games in his 15-year professional career. [...] Known as [...] "The Original Ranger", {{he led the}} team in goals six times. He was regarded as being the greatest right wing in the game's history when he retired, an opinion former teammate Frank Boucher retained many years later: [...] "Bill was the finest all-round player in Ranger history. And he's my choice as the best right winger hockey <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> – {{despite the fact that}} others disagree and give their votes to Rocket Richard or Gordie Howe. [...] I say Cook topped them both." [...] Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952, and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong's {{colleague}} on the Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Aldrin, {{said that}} he was [...] "deeply saddened by the passing. I know I am joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I <b>ever</b> <b>knew.</b> I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing... Regrettably, this is not to be." [...] Apollo 11 Command Module pilot Michael Collins said, of Armstrong, [...] "He was the best, and I will miss him terribly." [...] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that: [...] "As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters <b>ever</b> <b>knew</b> {{what was going on and}} I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Holloway, Violet and Julian lived {{mainly in}} the tiny village of Penn, Buckinghamshire. Holloway also owned other {{properties}} including a flat in St John's Wood in North West London, which he used when working in the capital, and a flat in Manhattan during the My Fair Lady Broadway years. The final {{years of his life}} were spent in Angmering, West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, Maurice Chevalier, Laurence Olivier and Arthur Askey, who said of him, [...] "He was the nicest man I <b>ever</b> <b>knew.</b> He never had a wrong word to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show." [...] While working in the US, Holloway numbered among his friends Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Burgess Meredith and Groucho Marx.|$|E

If {{in the course of}} a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper." [...] Eugene Wigner writes: [...] ""Jancsi," [...] I might say, [...] "Is angular momentum always an integer of h?
