Were the Diver Detection sonar systems to rely strictly on the <b>echograph</b> generated by the sonar units overlaid on a navigation chart, then a diver or SDV would appear as a relatively small moving shape that is refreshed with each transmission or ping of the sonar against a fluctuating background of sound clutter and reverberation.

This is problematic in {{that they would have}} to be highly trained sonar operators.

40|$|In {{the field}} of radiotherapy, advancements in {{treatments}} and early detection of accidents require the development of in vivo dosimeters. Solutions {{that have already been}} put forward only allow for skin dose measurements or imply a certain degree of invasiveness. The global objective of the present proposal is to prepare the grounds {{for the development of a}} unique, non-invasive, in-vivo dosimeter for radiotherapy. The concept of the new dosimeter is to read-out the cumulative effect of radiation on Ultrasound Contrast Agents (UCA). UCA’s are micro-bubbles that consist of a gas core embedded in a stabilizing encapsulation shell and which are routinely used in connection with ultrasonic imaging systems such as <b>echographs.</b> When exposed to radiation, the physical and structural properties of UCA’s will be modified in a nonreversible manner. As a result irradiated UCA’s will also alter the ultrasonic wave propagation characteristics. A measure of the change in ultrasonic wave properties in the presence of UCA’s during radiation can therefore be used as a dosimeter for radiotherapy. The project will deal with theoretical modelling, experimental validation and dosimeter optimization. The work plan consists out of three packages. Theoretical modelling will be applied to investigate the different interactions of interest. The interaction of ultrasound with a UCA can be modelled by implementing and improving models found in literature. The ionizing radiation interaction with a UCA will be studied by predicting its influence on the UCA parameters based on possible interactions of the radiation with the UCA's separate components. A thorough parameter study will reveal the changes ionizing radiation inflicts on the characteristics of the ultrasonic dispersion relations. Experimental validation will occur by confirming the findings of the three theoretical parts. The ultrasonic dispersion relations in the frequency domain 0. 5 - 20 MHz will be recorded by fine-tuning the fully functioning feasibility setup developed in the master thesis. Furthermore an inverse nonlinear least squares fitting model will be applied to link theory and experiment. The application of a number of techniques will be required to visualize the microstructure modifications of the UCA induced by ionizing radiation, including Freeze Fracture Electron Microscopy (structural), IR-spectroscopy (chemical) and thin layer chromatography (lipid degradation). Irradiation of samples will be carried out with different energy photons and at different dose rates at the calibration facility and at the RITA facility of SCK-CEN, Mol, Belgium and the Radiotherapy department of UZ Brussel. Finally, the theoretical and experimental findings will lead to the identification of optimal UCA parameters and frequency domains for which the radiation effects are most effectively observed. This implies designing and producing specialized microbubbles. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of imaged anatomical or biological structures {{and of their}} dynamics is an important task in terms of application and therefore of diagnostics.

40|$|Background: Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy which realizes in athlete's heart {{could create}} some problems of acoustic reflection {{related to the}} increase of myocytic and not-myocytic elements of the heart. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the ultrasonic backscatter myocardial indexes both as peak end-diastolic signal intensity and as its cardiac-cyclic variation in athlete's heart, compared to healthy sedentary controls. Methods: Two groups of ten subjects each, all males of mean age (31. 6 +/- 3. 5), and of comparable weight and height were analyzed: group (A) comprised ten cyclists of good professional level and group (C) included ten healthy subjects acting as controls. A 2 D-color Doppler echocardiography with a digital <b>echograph</b> Agilent Technologies (AT) Sonos 5500 was carried out on all subjects in the study for the conventional analysis of the left ventricular mass and function. The ultrasonic myocardial integrated backscatter signal (IBS) was analyzed with an "Acoustic Densitometry" module implemented on an AT <b>echograph.</b> The signal was also sampled with a R. O. I. placed at interventricular septum and at posterior left ventricular wall level. The systo-diastolic variation of the backscatter was also considered as Cyclic Variation Index (CVl(ibs)). Results: The left ventricular mass was significantly higher in athletes in comparison with controls (LVMbs: A: 154. 5 +/- 18. 7; C: 101. 4 +/- 12. 4; p < 0. 001). The end diastolic IBS signal did not show significant statistical differences between the two groups. The CVl(ibs) both at septum (A: 30. 5 +/- 5. 3; C: 27. 2 +/- 7. 3; p< 0. 002) and posterior wall level (A: 43. 7 +/- 9. 1; C: 40. 7 +/- 9. 1; p < 0. 001) though was comparable in both groups. Conclusion: The conclusions reached in the present study confirmed the physiology of the left ventricular hypertrophy of the athlete's heart evaluated with an ultrasonic integrated backscatter tissue characterization, in particular through the cyclic variation of integrated backscatter myocardial signal.

Considered properties include backscatter, attenuation, resonance phenomena, nonlinear oscillation and destruction mechanisms {{as a function of the}} applied ultrasound parameters. These properties have been investigated by acoustic and granulometric measurements conducted on a last generation microbubble experimental contrast agent (BR 14, Bracco Research SA, Geneva, Switzerland) for frequencies in the medical diagnostic range. In the first part of this work, a new tissue-mimicking phantom was designed, manufactured and employed to evaluate microbubble behavior in very similar conditions to those encountered inside the human body. During these studies microbubbles were insonified by means of a common commercial <b>echograph</b> while flowing through the phantom, that had been inserted into an ad hoc assembled flow circuit, aimed to simulate human microcirculation conditions. In addition, in order to explore possible improvements in signal processing techniques, the <b>echograph</b> was connected to a prototypal platform for acquisition and independent processing of the raw unfiltered radiofrequency signals. In the second part, whose focus was on the determination of microbubble intrinsic properties, microbubbles were studied in static conditions, employing single-element ultrasound probes driven by laboratory devices, offering higher flexibility in terms of generated signal parameters, and linked to high-performance data acquisition boards. In particular, a new methodology has been developed to study microbubble destruction mechanisms and three main patterns have been identified in the microbubble acoustic behavior, also establishing the boundary conditions for the onset of the corresponding underlying phenomena. These findings could represent interesting bases for theoretical modeling of microbubble acoustic behavior from linear oscillation to complete shell disruption. The outcome of each performed study has been also analyzed and interpreted to exploit possible implications for the improvement of current clinical techniques or for the potential development of new ones. A global characterization of the acoustic behavior of the studied contrast agent is finally provided, together with many indications for its effective employment in further in vivo testing and clinical trials...|$|E

Such abnormalities are not evident in the athlete's heart. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the ultrasonic backscatter myocardial indexes both as peak end-diastolic signal intensity and as cardiac-cyclic variation in two models of LVH: hypertensive cardiopathy and athlete's heart. Methods Three groups of 10 subjects each, all men of mean age (31. 6 +/- 3. 5 years), and of comparable weight and height, were analyzed. Group A comprised 10 cyclists of good professional level, while hypertensive patients were grouped in Group H. Both groups presented a comparable left ventricular mass (LVM). Group C included 10 healthy subjects acting as controls. The men with hypertension were selected on the basis of the results of ambulatory monitoring of the blood pressure according to ISM-World Health Organization guidelines (International Society of Hypertension).

Detection of these changes during the asymptomatic stage of CAD may allow early treatment and prevention of acute coronary events.

40|$|Although {{during the}} last two decades there has been an {{explosive}} outflow of Information from many areas of perinatal medicine- Information on fetal blood flow has been based on direct deductions rather than blood measure-ments. Actually we know less about the regulation of the fetal placental blood flows than we do aboüt the regula-tion of the blood flow to any other organ. There are se-veral reasons for this. One is the complexity of the ar-terial supply to the Uterus. Another problem is the dif-ficulty of measuring blood flow because of the inaccessi-bility of the fetus and its sensitivity to infection. Fur-thermore the placenta is an organ which does not have just one blood flow but two, each of which comes from a separ-ate organism. For these reasons there is little classi-cal literature on this important System.

Between the two PLR tests, we waited for approximately 5  min to obtain stable hemodynamic baseline values. Each PLR test was performed as previously described [6]. At its maximum effect, a second set of hemodynamic and Doppler measurements was performed (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The effects of PLR on cardiac output were measured by pulse contour analysis and not by transpulmonary thermodilution because these effects must be assessed by a real-time monitoring technique [6]. In practice, we observed the continuously changing value of pulse contour analysis-derived cardiac index while performing the Doppler measurements. As soon as the cardiac index value started to decrease, we considered that it had reached its maximum. At this precise time, we froze the image of the <b>echograph</b> and performed the Doppler measurements on the values displayed during the previous seconds.

Peak intensity, half-time (HT), the area under the curve of appearance and disappearance of microbubbles at 213 of PI, both in absolute and indexed values (/LVMi), were sampled.

40|$|A {{decrease}} in vascular elasticity {{and an increase}} in pulse wave velocity in hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy) cystathionine-β-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS−/+) mice has been observed. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in MMP-NO-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) inhibitory tertiary complex. However, the contribution of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms eNOS and iNOS in the activation of latent MMP is unclear. We hypothesize that the differential production of NO contributes to oxidative stress and increased oxidative/nitrative activation of MMP, resulting in vascular remodeling in response to HHcy. The overall goal is to elucidate the contribution of the NOS isoforms, endothelial and inducible, in the collagen/elastin switch. Experiments were performed on six groups of animals [wild-type (WT), eNOS−/−, and iNOS−/− with and without homocysteine (Hcy) treatment (0. 67 g/l) for 8 – 12 wk].

Included in this information are patient demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data, and radiology reports. The EHR automates and streamlines the clinician's work flow. The EHR has the ability to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter, as well as supporting other care-related activities directly or indirectly via interface—including evidence-based decision support, quality management, and outcomes reporting. ” It {{is important to note that}} an EHR is generated and maintained within an institution, such as a hospital, integrated delivery network, clinic, or physician office. An EHR is not a longitudinal record of all care provided to the patient in all venues over time. This paper presents a functional software development, specialized for obstetrics and gynecology practice in Bulgarian medical environment. The record design is subordinated to the Bulgarian and international medical laws for tracing the pregnancy period. It consists of three separated modules – medical history of the patient, administrative data, tracing the pregnancy in 3 trimesters with various tests and medical analyzes, different for each trimester. It allows multimedia history archive, heart rate records, 3 D/ 4 D video records, fetal morphology history, biochemical screening record, weekly <b>echograph</b> records and full laboratory history at simple screen. It performs telemedical functions through the possibility to connect from every point with Internet and to be accessible both – for patient and doctor. The EHR is unique for Bulgarian gynecology medical practice. It combines the validate paper version of pregnant patient record with separate medical exams that are performed from different specialists and genetic laboratories. ...|$|E

One major aim of the project is thecharacterisation and {{quantification}} of terrigenous sediment primarilysupplied by Ob and Yenisei rivers. The main objective of the presentstudy is the identification and characterisation of sediment echo typesin conjunction with geophysical and sedimentological investigations ofthe collected gravity cores. During the expeditions the geological work concentrated on a detailedsediment profiling survey by means of an ELAC sediment <b>echograph</b> (12 kHz), as well as a CHIRP system (2 - 8 kHz) and in 2003 PARASOUND (3, 5 kHz). For ground truthing bottom sediments were sampled usingMulticorer, Giant Box Corer, and Gravity Corer. High-resolution acoustic data and sediment gravity cores taken in theinner Kara Sea shelf during several expeditions up to 78 N allow us tobalance the Holocene sediment budget and to reconstruct the sedimentaryhistory. Cores were radiocarbon dated and linked to acoustic profilesusing whole-core physical properties. Two major acoustic Units could bedifferentiated, separated by a prominent unconform reflectorinterpreted as the base of the Holocene. Total Holocene sediment volume (above the unconformity) was determinedby echosounding surveys. Porosity of logged gravity cores wassubtracted from the total volume. The inner Kara Sea shelf, measuring 299746 km 2 yields a total Holocene sediment mass of 183, 5 * 1010 t. TheOb and Yenisei estuaries, with their sea water / fresh water mixingzone, act as major sediment sinks for fluvial derived terrigeneousmaterial in Holocene times. About 50 % of the river supplied matter,i. e. 23, 3 * 1010 t precipitate in this zone termed "marginal filter". Coastal erosion accounts for about the same amount of sediment influxas river runoff accumulating to 100 * 1010 t.

40|$|In this paper, we {{summarize}} data on terrigenous sediment {{supply in}} the Kara Sea and its accumulation and spatial and temporal variability during Holocene times. Sedimentological, organic-geochemical, and micropaleontological proxies determined in surface sediments allow to characterize the modern (riverine) terrigenous sediment input. AMS- 14 C dated sediment cores from the Ob and Yenisei estuaries and the adjacent inner Kara Sea were investigated to determine the terrigenous sediment fluxes {{and their relationship to}} paleoenvironmental changes. The variability of sediment fluxes during Holocene times is related to the post-glacial sea-level rise and changes in river discharge and coastal erosion input. Whereas during the late/middle Holocene most of the terrigenous sediments were deposited in the estuaries and the areas directly off the estuaries, huge amounts of sediments accumulated on the Kara Sea shelf farther north during the early Holocene before about 9 cal kyr BP. The maximum accumulation at that time is related to the lowered sea level, increased coastal erosion, and increased river discharge. Based on sediment thickness charts, <b>echograph</b> profiles and sediment core data, we estimate an average Holocene (0 - 11 cal kyr BP) annual accumulation of 194, 106 t/yr of total sediment for the whole Kara Sea. Based on late Holocene (modern) sediment accumulation in the estuaries, probably 12, 106 t/yr of riverine suspended matter (i. e. about 30 % of the input) may escape the marginal filter on a geological time scale and is transported onto the open Kara Sea shelf. The high-resolution magnetic susceptibility record of a Yenisei core suggests a short-term variability in Siberian climate and river discharge on a frequency of 300 - 700 yr. This variability may reflect natural cyclic climate variations to be seen in context with the interannual and interdecadal environmental changes recorded in the High Northern Latitudes over the last decades, such as the NAO/AO pattern. A major decrease in MS values starting near 2. 5 cal kyr BP, being more pronounced during the last about 2 cal kyr BP, correlates with a cooling trend over Greenland as indicated in the GISP- 2 Ice Core, extended sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic, and advances of glaciers in western Norway. Our still preliminary interpretation of the MS variability has to be proven by further MS records from additional cores as well as other high-resolution multi-proxy Arctic climate records...|$|E
40|$|The Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) or Tei {{index is}} a {{non-invasive}} and reproducible Doppler index that allows {{to evaluate the}} ventricular systolic and diastolic performance. In human medicine, it has been demonstrated to be useful in estimating the prognosis in patients affected by pulmonary hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In veterinary medicine, the reports regarding the application of MPI in dogs {{for the evaluation of}} the right ventricular performance are scant. MPI is calculated based on the following equation: (TCO-ET) /ET, where TCO is the interval from the cessation to the onset of tricuspidal inflow, and ET is the ejection time of the right ventricular outflow. MPI is independent from heart rate when TCO and ET are obtained from cardiac cycles of equal duration. The aim of this study was therefore to normalize MPI (adjusted-MPI) for heart rate and to verify if this new index can be useful to better evaluate the ventricular performance in dogs with variations of heart rate. Doppler evaluation (using the <b>echograph</b> Esaote MyLab 30 -Vet equipped with ECG monitoring and a 1 - 4 MHz phased-array transducer) was performed on a group of 112 dogs. The dogs of, different breed, age, and sex were divided in two groups: group 1 : healthy (29 dogs); group 2 : with heart disease (83 dogs). Group 2 was divided into 2 sub-groups: A (without heart failure: 49 dogs) and B (with heart failure: 34 dogs). MPI was obtained calculating the mean value of three different TCO and ET for each dog. The mean values of TCO, ET and heart rate were used in the statistical analysis. In particular, with adjusted-Y method and the parallel regression lines test, used to obtain a common angular coefficient, it was possible to normalize TCO and ET to the same heart rate (128, 04 bpm) and to calculate the adjusted-MPI (adj-MPI). MPI and adj-MPI values were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the three different groups of patients, and then, the Hocberg test allowed evaluation of a statistically significant difference between the three groups on the base of adj-MPI and non of MPI. We found that the adj-MPI in dogs with a heart rate between 59 and 213 bpm, was able to estimate more precisely the right ventricular performance compared to non-adjusted MPI, thus allowing a better distinction between healthy dogs and dogs affected by cardiac disease with or without heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of SIRRO (Siberian River Run off) expeditions of RV Akademik Boris Petrov were {{carried out in the}} Kara Sea during August and September 1999, 2000 and 2001. One major aim of the project is {{characterisation}} and quantification of terrigenous sediment primarily supplied by Ob and Yenisei rivers. We used a high resolution CHIRP echosounding system for selected profiles and additionally the ships sonar was used to obtain data of Holocene sediment thickness. The main objective of this study is the identification and characterisation of sediment echo types in conjunction with geophysical and sedimentological investigations of the collected gravity cores. During the expedition the geological work concentrated on a detailed sediment profiling survey by means of an ELAC sediment <b>echograph</b> (operating frequency of 12 kHz, impulse length of 1 ms, and 200 W transmitting power) as well as a GeoChirp sytem (2 - 8 kHz), and the sampling of bottom sediments using Multicorer, Giant Box Corer, and Gravity Corer for ground truthing. The history and extent of the Quaternary glaciations in Eurasia is controverse. Within this context, the largest remaining uncertainty is how far the Kara Sea ice sheet extended towards the east during the LGM (Svendsen et al., 1999; Polyak et al., 2000, 2002; Stein et al. 2002). The key question related to this problem is: how did the discharge of the siberian rivers respond/interact to an proximal ice sheet?Based on echosounding results we are able to reconstruct the palaeo drainage network of Ob and Yenisei rivers. Both rivers incised into the recent shelf, leaving filled and unfilled river channels and river canyons/valleys behind. The rivers were in the braided/meandering stage depending on the variable shelf gradient. Asymmetrical channel levee complexes with incision depths of 60 meters and more developed. The rivers formed channel levee complexes which in some places border to glacial dominated morphology, which implies fluvial deflection by an ice shield. This finding denots the non existence of an ice sheet on large areas of the Kara Sea shelf. Furthermore mapping of sediment thickness and character reveals no evidence for an ice dammed lake, as postulated by some workers. Sidorchuk et al. (2001) found macromeanders formed during the LGM until 14000 years BP, fluvial features an order of magnitude bigger than recent fluvial dimensions. Although the mean precipitation was lower than today, they related these features to an increased discharge which main cause is in their opinion the existence of permafrost, whose degradation (as recent) leads to the development of increased groundwater flow. Therefore it seems reasonable to relate fluvial features on the Kara Sea shelf, developed during sea level lowstand, to a pronounced riverine discharge as proposed by Sidorchuk et al. (2001) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{lamination}} and burrowing {{patterns in}} 17 box cores were analyzed {{with the aid}} of X-ray photographs and thin sections. A standardized method of log plotting made statistical analysis of the data possible. Several 'structure types' were established, although it was realized that the boundaries are purely arbitrary divisions in what can sometimes be a continuous sequence. In the transition zone between marginal sand facies and fine-grained basin facies, muddy sediment is found which contains particularly well differentiated, alternating laminae. This zone is also characterized by layers rich in plant remains. The alternation of laminae shows a high degree of statistical scattering. Even though a small degree of cyclic periodicity could be defined, it was impossible to correlate individual layers from core to core across the bay. However, through a statistical handling of the plots, zones could be separated {{on the basis of the}} number of sand layers they contained. These more or minder sandy zones clarified the bottom reflections seen in the records of the <b>echograph</b> from the area. The manner of facies change across the bay, suggests that no strong bottom currents are effective in the Eckernförde Bay. The marked asymmetry between the north and south flanks of the profile can be attributed to the stronger action of waves on the more exposed areas. Grain size analyses were made from the more homogeneous units found in a core from the transition-facies zone. The results indicate that the most pronounced differences between layers appear in the silt range, and although the differences are slight, they are statistically significant. Layers rich in plant remains were wet-sieved in order to separate the plant detritus. This was than analyzed in a sediment settling balance and found to be hydrodynamically equivalent to a well-sorted, finegrained sand. A special, rhythmic cross-bedding type with dimensions in the millimeter range, has been named 'Crypto-cross-lamination' and is thought to represent rapid sedimentation in an area where only very weak bottom currents are present. It is found only in the deepest part of the basin. Relatively large sand grains, scattered within layers of clayey-silty matrix, seem to be transported by flotation. Thin section examination showed that the inner part of Eckernförder Bay carbonate grains (e. g. Foraminifera shells) were preserved throughout the cores, while in the outer part of the bay they were not present. Well defined tracks and burrows are relatively rare in all of the facies in comparision to the generally strongly developed deformation burrowing. The application of special measures for the deformation burrowing allowed to plot their intensity in profile for each core. A degree of regularity could be found in these burrowing intensity plots, with higher values appearing in the sandy facies, but with no clear differences between sand and silt layers in the transition facies. Small sections in the profiles of the deepest part of the bay show no bioturbation at all...|$|E
30|$|In [13], {{the authors}} use {{relaying}} and cooperation {{to prolong the}} network lifetime. They also investigate path loss while considering different body parts for both single-hop and multi-hop topologies. Similarly, the authors in [24] use topology control to account for access delays due to the underlying medium access control (MAC) layer, however, {{at the cost of}} high energy consumption. In [25], the authors set an upper bound to determine the number of relay nodes, sensors, and their respective distances to the sink. Each sensor node performs single-hop communication while relaying nodes perform multi-hop communication to the sink. In [14], J. Elias et al. provide an optimal design for WBASNs by studying the joint data routing and relay positioning problem in order to increase the network lifetime. In this research work, the authors present an inter-based linear programming model which aims for (i) optimized number of relay positions, (ii) minimization of energy consumption of sensors and relays, and (iii) minimization of the installation cost. Simulation results show that this framework has a very short computing time as compared to the other frameworks. In [26], the authors study propagation models subject to network lifetime prolongation. These models reveal that single-hop communication is inefficient for far away nodes from the sink and the multi-hop communication is more suitable. In order to avoid hot spot links, extra nodes in the network, i.e., dedicated relay devices, are introduced. The authors in [19] propose M-ATTEMPT routing protocol in which they use single-hop communication for the delivery critical data and multi-hop communication for the delivery of normal data. In order to prevent damage of body tissues, they also introduce a temperature sensing mechanism to detect the hot spot problem of in-body sensors. In [27], Chen et al. introduce a new interference-aware WBASN that can continuously monitor vital signs of multiple patients and efficiently prioritize data transmission based on patients’ conditions. The authors proposed a solution that is based on an integrated hybrid scheduler which guarantees end-to-end delay with the capability to select the best possible route (best link quality) and minimum generated interference which results in high end-to-end packet reliability. In [28], sensing is considered as a service while improving energy efficiency. Thus, the authors present a unique set of design challenges and propose different solutions which are very helpful for current as well as future researchers. In [29], the authors present anycast routing protocol for monitoring patients vital signs while coping with the end-to-end traffic. To achieve minimum network latency, the protocol chooses a nearest data receiver related to the patient. The wireless network performs fall detection, indoor positioning, and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for the patients. Whenever, a fall is detected, the hospital crew gets intimated of the exact position of the patient. In [30], the authors present a cluster-based self-organization protocol. It focuses on relaying data via cluster heads to improve energy efficiency. Initially, the protocol builds a cluster-based structure and then efficiently transmits packets from source to destination. An interesting feature of this technique is the stability in terms of the selected number of cluster heads per round. In [31], the authors balance load of the sensor nodes by presenting a global routing protocol which is tested against real-time experiments along with computer-based simulations. Similarly, [32] introduces a personal wireless hub to collect personal health information of its user(s) through biomedical sensors. The sensed information is securely routed towards the health care unit if found eligible. In [33], Otto et al. present a prototype system for the health monitoring of people/patients at home. The system consists of an uninterrupted WBASN and a home health server. The WBASN sensors sense heart rate and locomotive activity such that the sensed information is periodically uploaded at the home server. The home server may integrate this information with a local database for user inspection, or it may further be forwarded to a medical server. Similarly, the idea of embedding medical devices with hospital information system is presented in [34]. The integration of ubiquitous <b>echograph</b> with the home information network make it very easy for the doctors to immediately diagnose the patients. In [35], Wang et al. present a distributed WBASN model for medical supervision. The system consists of three tiers: sensor network tier, mobile computing network tier, and remote monitoring network tier. This model provides collection, demonstration, and storage of vital information like ECG, blood oxygen, body temperature, and respiration rate. The system demonstrates many advantages such as low-power, easy configuration, convenient carrying, and real-time reliable data. In [36], the authors use wearable sensors to monitor daily activities of humans which they perform during different activities. The correct monitoring of these complex actions is challenging. For this purpose, they introduce activity recognition with the help of wearable sensing devices.|$|E
