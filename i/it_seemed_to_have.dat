5|$|At {{the time}} of the Duke's {{marriage}} in 1815, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young Princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, the Dukes of Clarence and Kent, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children, and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to father the heir to the throne.|$|E

25|$|Europe's {{success in}} this period stands in {{contrast}} to other regions. For example, {{one of the most}} advanced civilizations of the Middle Ages was China. It had developed an advanced monetary economy by 1,000 CE. China had a free peasantry who were no longer subsistence farmers, and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market. According to Adam Smith, writing in the 18th century, China had long been one of the richest, most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, most urbanized, and most prosperous countries in the world. It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in cast iron production, piston bellows, suspension bridge construction, printing, and the compass. However, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> long since stopped progressing. Marco Polo, who visited China in the 13th century, describes its cultivation, industry, and populousness almost in the same terms as travelers would in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Soundings at {{the site}} were first made by Max Mallowan during his survey of the area. Agatha Christie, his wife, wrote that they chose not to {{continue}} {{at the site}} because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Roman material. No trace of Roman occupation levels {{have been found in}} later excavations, however. Mallowan went on to excavate Chagar Bazar, another site to the south of Mozan/Urkesh. Excavations at Tell Mozan began in 1984 and have been conducted for at least 17 seasons up to the present time. The work has been led by Giorgio Buccellati of UCLA and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati of California State University, Los Angeles. The 2007 season was primarily dedicated to working on publication material, primarily excavation units A16, J1, J3 and J4. A small sounding was done in J1 to clarify the transition between Mittani and Khabur. The excavations have been assisted at various times by other groups including the German Archaeological Institute.|$|E

He suffered lung damage and was treated for a pulmonary haemorrhage at Guy's Hospital before recovering. Although he was {{the lead in the}} show, the premiere took place without him; it was criticised by reviewers, and The Observer thought that [...] "some of <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> strayed in by mistake out of a second-rate provincial pantomime". Formby returned within a week and the reviews were more positive, with The Observer stating that it was [...] "one of the successes of the season...

However, Toivonen admitted having problems with the car: [...] "I may have won the RAC Rally with Lancia, but I just did not know how to drive it. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a mind of its own."

500|$|Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch {{composed}} original {{music for}} the series. Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage, including National Football League games and the Olympics. The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series. Edelman said, [...] "It was original, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, {{and it has a}} certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15-second thing."

500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{no role in the}} development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, and to say that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a {{role in the development of}} female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E

Initially, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a successful enterprise.
