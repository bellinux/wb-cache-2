5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before <b>females</b> <b>and</b> the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in <b>females</b> <b>and</b> the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{employer}} to the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> also male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer to the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The result of this research showed that both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees used various types of request, both to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees...|$|R

The working age population (<b>females</b> <b>and</b> males between 16 and 64) is lower than England and Wales average, 60% compared to 64%. Data collected between 2010 and 2012 shows that average life expectancy at birth in the county is 85.3 years for <b>females</b> <b>and</b> 81.2 years for males. This compares favourably with the averages for England and Wales of 82.9 and 79.1 years respectively.

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are predominantly monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success.

5|$|Females of many spider species, {{including}} P. labiata, emit volatile pheromones {{into the}} air, and these generally attract males from a distance. The silk draglines of female jumping spiders also contain pheromones, which stimulate males to court <b>females</b> <b>and</b> may give information about each female's status, for example whether the female is juvenile, subadult or mature.|$|E
5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing <b>females</b> <b>and</b> fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated <b>females,</b> <b>and</b> enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether <b>female</b> <b>and</b> male newborns could be differentiated using physical and behavioural characteristics. Sixteen <b>female</b> <b>and</b> fifteen male newborns were videotaped interacting briefly with a <b>female</b> <b>and</b> male experimenter. Raters coded neonatal physical characteristics, and both neonatal and adult behaviours. Results showed that raters could discriminate {{the sex of}} the newborns based upon the degree of cuddliness and activity level. It was also found that adults responded differently with <b>female</b> <b>and</b> male newborns. Finally, the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> experimenter were found to differ in their behaviours with the newborns. Discussion focuses on the importance of methodological considerations in assessing sex differences in neonatal behaviours, and on the implications of neonatal behavioural sex differences on subsequent parent-child interaction...|$|R

5|$|Groups of {{wildebeest}} <b>females</b> <b>and</b> young live in {{the small}} areas established by the male. When groups of wildebeest join together, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting.|$|E
5|$|In both equine social systems, excess males {{gather in}} {{bachelor}} groups. These are typically young males {{who are not}} yet ready to establish a harem or territory. With the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy. Fights between males usually occur over estrus <b>females</b> <b>and</b> involve biting and kicking.|$|E
5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around <b>females</b> <b>and</b> try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired <b>females</b> <b>and</b> defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E

A contingency table can be created to display the numbers of individuals who are male and right handed, male <b>and</b> left handed, <b>female</b> <b>and</b> right handed, <b>and</b> <b>female</b> <b>and</b> left handed. Such a contingency table is shown below.|$|R
25|$|Mating {{occurs when}} a male wasp {{approaches}} a <b>female,</b> <b>and</b> the two undergo mutual or unilateral antennation, where the pair touches each other's antennae or the male probes the <b>female's</b> thorax <b>and</b> abdomen with his antennae. Then, the male mounts the <b>female</b> <b>and</b> begins to establish genital contact by touching the female's abdomen with his own. Copulation only lasts about five seconds.|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} of malaria parasites {{depends on the}} presence of sexual stages (gametocytes) in the blood, making the ratio <b>and</b> densities of <b>female</b> <b>and</b> male gametocytes important determinants of parasite fitness.
