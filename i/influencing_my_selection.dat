40|$|Aftershocks {{continued}} in the weeks following the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Questions about radiation leaks at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remained unanswered. In Egypt, mass protests forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign from office and triggered a wave {{of social and political}} unrest across the Middle East. In California, many wondered about the safety risks of having two nuclear power plants so near to earthquake fault lines. While recent events undoubtedly <b>influenced</b> <b>my</b> <b>selection</b> of images for this project in X-TRA, these objects came into being under very different circumstances. Photographed and re-presented here, they are but a small sampling from a larger project that looks to the depiction of race and the construction of whiteness. The Profiled series asks what comes after ideologies and their aesthetic manifestations have run their course. Cast, carved, burned, and broken, these are lingering shadows of people that once lived in this world, or in the imaginations of their makers, and serve to question the very idea of progress...|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} a typology or map of ethical behavior. The map is detailed {{in the table}} in the article. In the table a wide range of behaviors that {{can be found in the}} public service are listed. These behaviors are grouped into three categories: "Value-Based Ethics": Behaviors that serve the public good and maximize the values of life, health, and freedom, values that can be seen as being reflected in the Preamble to the U. S. Constitution; "Value Neutral or Relative Ethics": Behaviors that reflect an indifference to Value-Based Ethics, " and "No Values": Behaviors that reflect values that are at odds with the public good. While the map has primary applicability to those who serve in the public sector, it can also be seen as having applicability to those in the private sector. This is particularly the case among those in the private sector who strive to balance the goals of making a profit with contributing to the public good. While individuals in the private sector are not obliged to act in ways that give high priority to serving the public good, those in the public sector are so obligated. A major purpose of the map is to compare and contrast behaviors across the three categories and to 1 awaken understanding and insight that might serve as an impetus for nurturing and strengthening value-based behavior among those who serve in government. ________________________________________________________________ There is an old adage, "If you don't know where you're going, you could end up anywhere. " It has been seen by some as having great relevance to the field of public administration. A luminary in the field, Dwight Waldo, had made a similar observation over thirty years ago in his article entitled "Public Administration and Change: Terra Paene Incognita " (Waldo, 1969).

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2010 In species where {{offspring}} {{are restricted}} to neonatal habitats, fitness is dependent upon oviposition site selection by females, a concept {{often referred to as}} the preference-performance hypothesis. Before determining if this hypothesis can be applied to a particular species, it is necessary to know what habitat characteristics <b>influence</b> site <b>selection.</b> <b>My</b> study assessed which habitat characteristics are preferred for oviposition in Rana aurora (Northern Red-legged Frog) in northern Humboldt County, California. I had two objectives: (1) to determine what habitat characteristics predict oviposition site use by R. aurora, and (2) to identify what characteristics predict the density of egg masses at a pond. This study took place at 30 ponds across northern Humboldt County, California, which were visited weekly from December-April during the 2007 - 2008 breeding season. Pond characteristics assessed were number of egg masses, water temperature, pond area, canopy cover, emergent vegetation, floating vegetation, woody vegetation, and presence/absence of other amphibians and fish. 	There was a higher probability of egg masses being found in ponds with relatively low canopy cover, and greater densities of egg masses occurred in ponds with high levels of emergent and floating vegetation. These findings are supported by previous studies that show that R. aurora attach their egg masses to emergent vegetation and tadpoles use this vegetation as a nursery. Both of these results suggest that female R. aurora are actively selecting sites to increase offspring performance, but more research will be needed to determine if offspring survival is affected.

40|$|The {{influence}} of religion within the socialization process {{as it pertains}} to sexuality was examined among 20 emerging adults aged 21 - 24, using qualitative research methods. Overall, participants fell into two categories: religion was present but no significant influence and religion significantly <b>influenced</b> <b>my</b> sexuality. Results indicated that individuals within the religion was present but no significant influence category lacked internalization of religious beliefs and often perceived that sexual messages from intersecting influences were inconsistent. On the contrary, respondents who fell within the religion significantly <b>influenced</b> <b>my</b> sexuality group expressed that religious beliefs had become part of their personal belief structure and were an intrinsic motivator that guided behavior. Within this category there was diversity concerning the way religion influenced sexuality. In particular, participants fell into four categories: abstinent, delayed sexual debut, regret and desire to change, and acceptance of all lifestyles. Although religiosity was related to different outcomes among the religion significantly <b>influenced</b> <b>my</b> sexuality group, internalization and the consistency of messages among influencing sources were recurrent themes. Results reflect the idea that emerging adulthood is a time characterized by exploration and change and that there are various influences that intersect to impact the sexua...|$|R
