Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to}} the brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
