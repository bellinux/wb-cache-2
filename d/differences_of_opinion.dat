40|$|We study a model where a {{decision}} maker (DM) {{must rely on}} an adviser {{for information about the}} state of the world relevant for her decision. The adviser has the same underlying preferences as the DM; he may differ, however, in his prior belief about the state, which we interpret as <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> We derive a tradeoff for the DM: an adviser with greater <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> has greater incentives to acquire information, but reveals less of any information she acquires, via strategic disclosure. The <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> engenders two novel incentives for an agent to acquire information: a “persuasion ” motive and a motive to “avoid prejudice. ” When the DM can choose an adviser from a rich pool <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> types including a like-minded one, it is optimal to choose an adviser with at least some <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> Delegation can be demotivating because it eliminates the need for the adviser to persuade and avoid prejudice. <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> preference.

40|$|<b>Difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> {{is highly}} {{respected}} in Islam. The Prophet of Islam is even {{reported to have}} said that, “difference <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> is divine providence”. This paper tackles this issue particularly within the science of prophetic tradition, and relates it to the way Muslim legalists develop the logics of law. The paper first argues that <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> is not only natural but also needed in legal and social life. It is also—viewed {{in terms of social}} conflict—a requirement for a social integration. The paper speaks of the two sources of Islam—the Qur’ân and the prophetic tradition—as supportive <b>of</b> this <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and shows that the prophet, his companions, and closest followers are all involved in debate stemmed from their <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> This <b>difference</b> is the natural consequence <b>of</b> the <b>difference</b> in the level of understanding, different language, culture, way of thinking, custom, {{and the extent to which}} the companions are in engaged in the activities of the prophet...|$|R

5|$|<b>Differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> over {{social order}} between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E

His primary rival was Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Martín Torrijos, son of the former military dictator Omar Torrijos. Martín Torrijos ran on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Ruben Blades. Endara finished second, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos' 47%.|$|E

5|$|Foliot was Becket's rival for the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He {{objected to}} the king's choice {{on the grounds that}} Becket was too worldly, the only bishop or magnate known to have opposed the king's choice. When the newly elected {{archbishop}} was presented to the court before his consecration, Foliot remarked that the king had performed a miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop. Soon after Becket's consecration the king wrote to the pope asking for permission to make Foliot the royal confessor. This may have been a conciliatory move to appease Foliot after the loss of Canterbury, or it may have been that the king and the new archbishop were already having <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and the king wished Foliot to be a counter-weight to Becket's influence.|$|E
5|$|Other early designs {{included}} Drum House, which boasted Scotland's first venetian window, and Mavisbank, both near Edinburgh. Mavisbank House, constructed between 1723 and 1727, was {{the first}} Palladian villa in Scotland, a collaboration between Adam and the owner, amateur architect Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. The latter claimed much of the credit, and certainly criticised some of Adam's suggestions, although evidence suggests Adam got his way {{on a number of}} points. As at Hopetoun, here Adam enjoyed an unusually close relationship with his client, despite their <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> His most ambitious early work was the baroque, Vanbrugh-inspired house at Arniston, near Gorebridge. Built for Robert Dundas, a lawyer and politician linked to the Earl of Stair, Arniston includes extensive grounds laid out by Adam, with a parterre and cascade, and a main avenue centred on Arthur's Seat to the north. The stucco work to the hall at Arniston is one of Adam's finest Vanbrughian interiors.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} F-FDTL and PNTL have also reduced the {{effectiveness}} of East Timor's security services. During 2003 and 2004, members of the police and F-FDTL clashed {{on a number of}} occasions, and groups of soldiers attacked police stations in September 2003 and December 2004. These tensions were caused by the overlapping roles of the two security services, <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> between members of East Timor's leadership and the fact that many members of the PNTL had served with the Indonesian National Police prior to East Timor's independence while the F-FDTL was based around FALINTIL. In 2003, the East Timorese Government established three new paramilitary police forces equipped with modern weapons. The formation of these units led to dissatisfaction with the Government among some members of the F-FDTL.|$|E

5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon.

5|$|In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and {{her four}} younger daughters {{moved to a}} house in South Kensington—the eldest, Kate, had married in 1866. The ménage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now {{displaying}} considerable independence of spirit, and <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> arose between mother and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter Lucy, and went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877. In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, Julie Salis Schwabe. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death. However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of John Morley, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far {{more concerned about the}} best strategy to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E
