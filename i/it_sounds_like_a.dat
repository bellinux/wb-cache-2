25|$|The Barranca Arroyo {{is a small}} canyon {{structure}} {{about an}} hour and a half from the municipal seat. The water flows year round with several areas where it pools, but the water is cold. The area is surrounded by large mountains with abundant vegetation. There is camping, hiking and picnicking. The Peña de la Viuda is a natural monolith which falls directly into an arroyo. The area has abundant vegetation, and activities such as skiing, camping and hiking. La Escondida is an area in mountainous forest with a permanent fresh water spring. It permits camping and hiking. El Cidral is an area with cedar trees surrounding a clearing for camping and hiking. The Peña de la Glora waterfall is surrounded by thick vegetation. The lowest part has a natural spring and the upper part has a deep, unexplored cave. The Cueva de los Riscos (Cave of the Crags) is named after the crags which appear in various of its chambers. The entrance begins with a rocky descent then levels out to an area with sand. The center has a hillock with looks like a monolith rock. This can be climbed to observe the various crags with contain ice. One of these in the shape of a pulpit and another is called the “bell tower” because if it is struck <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bell.|$|E

However, the master tapes of the {{unreleased}} recordings {{were said to}} have been destroyed in a fire at the record label's warehouse in 1976. The Library of Congress has a 1964 recording of an Ibn Ali solo improvisation, recorded at Roach's home. John Murph in JazzTimes described it in 2014 as [...] "Thoroughly modern with a whimsical rhythmic undertow and wayward melodic passages, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> new Jason Moran composition." ...|$|E

[...] Lennon replied: [...] "You won't, you know. That's the best line in the song." [...] McCartney retained the phrase; he later said of his subsequent live performances of the song: [...] "that's the line when I think of John, and sometimes I get a little emotional during that moment." ...|$|E
500|$|After the game's release, a {{reviewer}} for Game Revolution praised its sound, {{saying that}} [...] "When you're {{in a crowded}} city, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crowded city. Walk past a bar, and you'll hear {{the noise of the}} drunken patrons inside. Wander near a slave auction, and you'll hear the auctioneer calling. Go to a party in the festival hall, and it sounds just like a party". The same reviewer also stated [...] "Planescape has just about the best sound I've ever heard in a game." [...] IGN gave the sound 8.5 out of 10 and noted that [...] "The game has fantastic speech and sound effects, but what's more impressive is the way they fade in and out depending on how close you're standing to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan Bimm of Now {{described}} [...] "Animal" [...] as [...] "catchy and creative" [...] {{and said}} that the horns and the [...] "playful vocal hook" [...] will appeal to listeners who enjoyed Britney Spears' [...] "Toxic" [...] (2003), a production of Miike Snow members Karlsson and Winnberg. Sam Richards of NME viewed [...] "Animal" [...] as an [...] "impressive piece of sleight of hand" [...] and compared its sound to that of The Police, [...] "while remaining bearable". Ben Hogwood of musicOMH said that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "lost Police song given a new, vividly coloured change of clothes". He felt that the lyrical vignettes and hooks seem [...] "awkward" [...] during the first listen, and [...] "gloriously different the next". Hogwood furthermore said that this applied for the album as a whole. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "kiddie-pop lilt".|$|E

500|$|... "Running to Stand Still" [...] earned {{critical}} praise upon The Joshua Trees release, {{which itself}} received very favourable reviews {{and went on}} to become the group's best-selling album. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "After the first few times through , you notice the remarkable music... <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lovely, peaceful reverie – except that this is a junkie's reverie, and when that realization hits home, the gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power." [...] In Time magazine's 1987 cover story on the band, Jay Cocks wrote that [...] "A U2 tune like 'Running to Stand Still', with a trancelike melody that slips over the transom of consciousness, insinuates itself into your dreams." [...] The Uncut magazine Ultimate Music Guide to U2 described the character sketch in the song as one of Bono's best. [...] The 1991 Trouser Press Record Guide, however, said that the song [...] "has mood but no presence".|$|E
500|$|... "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Jon Perks, whilst reviewing Schizophonic for Sunday Mercury, gave a positive review, stating, [...] "Okay, so <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hybrid of La Vida Loca and Madonna's La Isla Bonita, {{but with a}} swimming-costumed Geri on the cover and a summery tune, it's a winning combination". Chris Charles from BBC News commented that [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] could be mistaken with [...] "Spice Up Your Life", Halliwell's previous hit with the Spice Girls. For Russell Baillie from The New Zealand Herald, Halliwell spends time on the album [...] "flashing her eyelashes at , especially if they're foreign", calling the song [...] "glutinous". According to Rolling Stone, [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] was her [...] "impeccably timed contribution to the Latin-pop phenom, complete with awkwardly pronounced Spanglish". Jonathan O'Brien from Hot Press magazine was negative, stating that [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] was [...] "a dreadful pastiche of Madonna's 'La Isla Bonita'".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] {{and while there}} was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost {{enough to make you}} think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E

500|$|... "Mutual Core" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "best" [...] and [...] "climactic" [...] by Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, which elected Biophilia as the CD of the Week, and [...] "literally volcanic" [...] by Heather Phares of Allmusic. Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal stated that the track is [...] "earthbound". According to the Daily Mirror review, the track [...] "adds angry rebuke and glitchy distorted power chordings to the shimmering, ringing percussion and natural awe that feature on the astonishing tracks [...] "Virus" [...] and aptly named [...] "Crystalline"". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised {{the composition of the}} album and stated [...] "There’s something audacious and impressive about the way [...] "Hollow" [...] attempts to strike a weird balance between menace and calm, the vocals as lulling as the staccato backing is unsettling. Or [...] "Mutual Core"’s repeated shifts from a wheezing keyboard – it was doubtless built in a laboratory by the provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and professor Brian Cox, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 13th-century portative organ – to electronic bombardment". Möhammed Choudhery of Consequence of Sound analysed the use of Björk's voice in the album, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Treppel spoke {{positively}} {{about the}} album's opener [...] "Insomnia", naming it [...] "one {{of the best}} Megadeth songs of the past 15 years". The song features swirling Middle Eastern strings, crunching guitar line and, according to Treppel, some of Mustaine’s most demented lyrics. Treppel further described [...] "Ecstasy" [...] as [...] "grunge ballad" [...] and noted that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "reject from Cryptic Writings". He had mixed feelings about [...] "Seven", and observed [...] "The Doctor Is Calling" [...] like a tune that [...] "aims for creepy, but hits cheesy instead". By contrast, DeGrasso felt that [...] "The Doctor Is Calling" [...] along with [...] "Prince of Darkness" [...] were [...] "definitely heavy songs" [...] with [...] "really dark lyrics on them". Ellefson described the tracks [...] "Breadline" [...] and [...] "Wanderlust" [...] as [...] "melodic" [...] with [...] "very modern-sounding" [...] grooves. Neil Arnold from Metal Forces opined that [...] "Breadline" [...] is [...] "as melodic and commercial as Megadeth gets", while noting that [...] "Wanderlust" [...] and [...] "I'll Be There" [...] are [...] "probably two of the band's most underrated songs".|$|E
500|$|Kitty Empire of The Observer {{also thought}} that it shares {{similarities}} with [...] "Fighter". She cited the Björk song {{of the same name}} as another influence, due to its [...] "emotional territory" [...] Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "nothing we haven't heard from her before, but there's an urgency to it that suggests Christina needed {{to get it out of}} her system", while Matthew Horton of Virgin Media wrote that Aguilera sounds as though she is declaring war. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush was critical of the song, writing that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Cher disco song which features Aguilera [...] "overworking" [...] her vocal cords. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the song's message to be confusing and did not understand who exactly Aguilera is supposed to be rising up against on the song, writing [...] "She hollers 'And we're gonna rise up.../ For every time you wronged me/ Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me.' Which begs the question: Rise up against whom? Is the whole world really out to get her, or is this just an excuse to wear camouflage hot pants?" ...|$|E

500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match her mood. There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared some nights ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rock power ballad.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty-gritty {{of life on the}} road, and just {{what it feels like to}} be a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight." ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{recording}} {{was made}} in August at Armoury Studios in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage built upon their first mix of the song, adding and subtracting parts, and completed final recording and mixing. The band kept the arrangement tight to preserve the song's dynamic, sweeping melody. [...] "The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going dynamically," [...] keeping the recording simple, Vig recalled. [...] "Besides the drums and bass and some percussive loops, there's {{a little bit of}} guitar that Duke and Steve did. There's not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There's a few little ear-candy things that we did, but it's all meant to work around Shirley's singing." [...] Although Garbage owned its own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin, for legal reasons the song could not be recorded in a U.S. studio. [...] "The World Is Not Enough" [...] was completed, mixed and mastered {{at the end of the}} month, and the group returned to their recording studio in Madison to record their mix of the song. Garbage's version (the [...] "chilled-out remix") downplayed the classic Bond sound in favour of the band's style. Vig later said about the original recording, [...] "We're pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it's a Bond song." ...|$|E

500|$|Mark Iraheta of Complex {{magazine}} called [...] "Turn Up the Music" [...] a [...] "soon-to-be smash" [...] that will see Brown making [...] "substantial {{damage on the}} Top 100 charts". Robbie Daw of Idolator described the song as [...] "energetic" [...] and wrote that it follows {{in the footsteps of}} Brown's past hits [...] "Forever" [...] (2008) and [...] "Yeah 3x", [...] "but with more dancefloor urgency". Daw concluded by writing that the song [...] "should please the same crowd" [...] that listen to the music of LMFAO, Kesha and Lady Gaga. Melinda Newman of HitFix described [...] "Turn Up the Music" [...] as a cousin to LMFAO's [...] "Party Rock Anthem" [...] (2011), and called it [...] "an absolute smash". Scott Shelter of PopCrush awarded the song three and a half stars out of four, and noted its similarities to the work of David Guetta and LMFAO. Shetler also commented that the production was lacking originality and the song [...] "isn't going to blow anyone away from a lyrical perspective". Andrew Martin of Prefix magazine was critical of the song, writing that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> left over track from Guetta's album Nothing but the Beat (2011). At the 2012 BET Awards, [...] "Turn Up the Music" [...] was nominated for the Viewer's Choice Award.|$|E
500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Wass, {{a writer}} for Idolator, wrote that [...] "Lovebird" [...] {{was one of the}} two best songs on Glassheart, along with the title track. He further commented that it had strong radio potential, {{and that it would be}} {{successful}} if it were to be released in the United States, as <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "clone" [...] of [...] "Bleeding Love". Digital Spy critic Lewis Corner felt that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] as well as [...] "Better in Time". Although he noted that Lewis' vocal performance on [...] "Lovebird" [...] is very impressive, as with all her material, he was unsure of why it was included on the final cut of the album due to Glassheart having [...] "bigger" [...] songs on it, which were likely to chart better. [...] The Mirrors Clemmie Moodie thought that although the recording is a [...] "catchy" [...] song, it does not compare to [...] "Bleeding Love", but noted that it does contain [...] "lyrical gems", including “Your lovebird's flyin’ away, ’cos my heart's been stuck in a cage". Hermoine Hoby, writing on behalf of The Observer, wrote that Lewis appears to be following in the footsteps of singer-songwriter Adele, due to the inclusion of [...] "big heartfelt ballads" [...] such as [...] "Lovebird" [...] and [...] "Fireflies" [...] on Glassheart. For Hoby, Lewis' vocals are just as [...] "technically irreproachable" [...] as Whitney Houston's and Mariah Carey's.|$|E
