40|$|This memo {{describes}} how to carry <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multifrequency</b> (DTMF) signaling, other tone signals and telephony events in RTP packets. 1 Introduction This memo defines two payload formats, one for carrying <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multifrequency</b> (DTMF) digits, other line and trunk signals (Section 3), {{and a second}} one for general multi-frequency tones in RTP [1] packets (Section 4). Separate RTP payload formats are desirable since low-rate voice codecs cannot be guaranteed to reproduce these tone signals accurately enough for automatic recognition. Defining separate payload formats also permits higher redundancy while maintaining a low bit rate. The payload formats described here {{may be useful in}} at least three applications: DTMF handling for gateways and end sytems, as well as "RTP trunks". In the first application, the Internet telephony gateway detects DTMF on the incoming circuits and sends the RTP payload described here instead of regular audio packets. The gateway likely has the necessary digi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This memo {{describes}} how to carry <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multifrequency</b> (DTMF) signaling in RTP packets. 1 Introduction This memo defines a payload type for carrying <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multifrequency</b> (DTMF) digits in RTP packets. A separate payload type is desirable since low-rate voice codecs cannot be guaranteed to accurately reproduce DTMF. Defining a separate payload type also permits higher redundancy {{while maintaining a}} low bit rate. The DTMF payload type must be suitable for both a gateway and end-to-end scenario. In the gateway scenario, a gateway connecting a packet voice network with the PSTN recreates the DTMF tones and injects them into the PSTN. Since DTMF digit recognition may take several tens of milliseconds, careful time and power (volume) alignment is needed to avoid generating spurious digits. For interactive voice response (IVR) systems directly connected to the packet voice network, time alignment and volume levels are not important, since the unit will not perform any signal analysis t [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{methods for}} DTMF signal {{detection}} {{are important for}} developing telecommunication equipment. This paper presents a hybrid signal processing and artificial intelligence based approach {{for the detection of}} <b>Dual-tone</b> <b>Multifrequency</b> (DTMF) tones under the influence of White Gaussian Noise (WGN) and frequency variation. Key innovations include the use of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) bandpass filter for reduction of noise from DTMF input samples, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for intelligent classification of the detected DTMF carrier frequencies. The proposed hybrid DTMF detector scheme is based on power spectrum analysis by means of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Goertzel’s Algorithm is used to estimate the seven fundamental DTMF carrier frequencies. The tone detection scheme employs decision logic to detect valid DTMF tones from low and high DTMF frequency groups. Comparison of this hybrid DTMF tone detection model with existing DTMF detection techniques proves the merits of this proposed scheme. 1...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [119]- 122) Three {{digital signal}} processing (DSP) techniques for telecommunication systems are presented in this thesis. First, a single-channel speech enhancement technique using spectral subtraction algorithm is presented. This method suppresses the noise in speech by subtracting the estimated noise spectrum from the noisy speech. Computer simulations and real-time experiments on the TMS 320 C 50 system are presented to show that this algorithm achieves good speech enhancement in both white noise and periodic noise cases. Second, a dual-channel acoustic noise and echo cancellation microphone (ANECM) system is developed for hands-free telephone system. In the traditional adaptive noise canceling (ANC) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) systems, a very high order finite impulse response (FIR) filter is required to achieve satisfactory performance. However, high order filter results in high cost, slow convergence, high excess mean-square error, and numerical error. In the unique structure of ANECM system, two low order filters are required to cancel the noise and echo. A comparison of system performance shows that the new ANECM system has a better overall performance than the traditional AEC and ANC systems. Finally, a <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multifrequency</b> (DTMF) receiver implemented on the TMS 320 C 50 system is presented. With a modified Goertzel algorithm, the energies of the received signal at eight DTMF frequencies are efficiently computed. Five system tests are performed to determined whether a valid DTMF tone pair has been received. Real-time experiments are conducted to evaluate the system performance with the noise and speech signal present. The results show that this receiver not only correctly detects the input digits {{but it has also}} met the requirements of CCITT standard. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
