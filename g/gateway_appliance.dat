2500|$|According to Network World, Blue Coat has [...] "a broad {{security}} portfolio including hardware, {{software and}} services." [...] It's biggest business is in products that filter web traffic on corporate networks. As of 2011, one of Blue Coat's most important products were Web gateways that scan internet traffic for security threats, authenticate users and manage encrypted traffic.

50|$|Because {{encryption}} can {{be difficult}} for users, security and compliance managers at companies and government agencies automate the process for employees and executives by using encryption appliances and services that automate encryption. Instead of relying on voluntary co-operation, automated encryption, based on defined policies, takes the decision and the process out of the users' hands. Emails are routed through a <b>gateway</b> <b>appliance</b> that has been configured to ensure compliance with regulatory and security policies. Emails that require it are automatically encrypted and sent.|$|E
50|$|The {{connection}} to the mobile network is made by acquiring a SIM card number from the mobile operator and installing it in the gateway. Typically, direct-to-mobile <b>gateway</b> <b>appliances</b> are used for hundreds to thousands of text messages per month. More modern appliances now offer the capability of send up to 100,000 messages each day. Several vendors that have historically provided GSM Gateway equipment for voice also have SMS capability. Some are more primitive than others. The more capable devices are designed with SIM management to regulate the number of SMS messages per SIM, ODBC to connect to a database, and HTTP interfaces to interact with third party applications.|$|R

50|$|StorSimple marketed a {{cloud storage}} <b>gateway</b> {{computer}} <b>appliance</b> called Cloud-integrated Storage (CiS). Their approach claimed to integrate primary storage data deduplication, automated tiered {{storage of data}} (across local and cloud storage), data compression, encryption, and significantly faster data backup and disaster recovery times. StorSimple was certified for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and VMware. It integrated with cloud storage from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Rackspace.In 2012 StorSimple {{was considered to be}} at the forefront of its genre.|$|R
5000|$|Another product {{introduction}} in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments {{to assist in}} compliance with data protection regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley.

One of the services provided by CipherTrust is tracking of Zombie computers, which are a primary source of spam.|$|E
40|$|Small {{and medium}} sized {{businesses}} often operate local area networks that connect via service providers to the Internet. If multiple connections are required, {{there are two}} options available: A gateway router that operates the border gateway protocol or a simpler <b>gateway</b> <b>appliance</b> that mostly uses load balancing and often network address translation. However, there is no simple way to multi-home small networks, when access links have diverse performance parameters, capacities or costs. Dynamic overflow routing addresses this issue in a straightforward way. This paper discusses dynamic routing and details, how bandwidth resources can be managed. It gives a simple estimate that helps to forecast resources for routing decisions and it underlines {{the need for a}} bidirectional gateway routing mechanism, accounting simultaneously for upstream as well as downstream traffic...|$|E
50|$|IIoT and MES <b>Gateway</b> appliances: Computer <b>appliances</b> {{that are}} {{designed}} to translate data bidirectionally between control systems and enterprise systems. Proprietary, embedded, firmware applications running on the appliance use point-to-point connections to translate data between field devices in their native automation protocols and MES systems through their APIs, ODBC, or RESTful interfaces.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBecause of {{high-speed}} growth of computer control technology and communication technology, {{it led to}} the birth of smart home. ZigBee technology is intended to be a suitable standard for a low-rate wireless home control system.

50|$|An XML {{appliance}} is a special-purpose {{network device}} used to secure, manage and mediate XML traffic. They are most popularly implemented in service-oriented architectures to control XML-based web services traffic, and increasingly in cloud-oriented computing to help enterprises integrate on premises applications with off-premises cloud-hosted applications. XML appliances are also {{commonly referred to}} as SOA <b>appliances,</b> SOA <b>gateways,</b> XML gateways, cloud brokers. Some have also been deployed for more specific applications like Message-oriented middleware. While the originators of the product category deployed exclusively as hardware, today most XML appliances are also available as software <b>gateways</b> and virtual <b>appliances</b> for environments like VMWare.|$|R
40|$|Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a concept, {{which has}} {{attracted}} significant attention as a promising approach towards the virtualization/“softwarisation” of network infrastructures. With {{the aim of}} promoting NFV, this paper outlines an integrated architecture, designed and developed {{within the context of}} the EU FP 7 T-NOVA project, which allows network operators not only to deploy virtualized Network Functions (NFs) for their own needs, but also to offer them to their customers, as value-added services (Network Functions as-a-Service, NFaaS). Virtual network <b>appliances</b> (<b>gateways,</b> proxies, firewalls, transcoders, analyzers etc.) can be provided on-demand as-a-Service, eliminating the need to acquire, install and maintain specialized hardware at customers' premises. A “NFV Marketplace” is also introduced, where network services and functions created by a variety of developers can be published, acquired and instantiated on-demand...|$|R
