The experimental research used non Factorial Completely Randomized Design and each treatments was replicated three times. Single factor concentration of ratio of rice husk ash and coupling agent 3 -methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (MPS) (70 phr: 1 phr, 100 phr: 1 phr, 130 phr: 1 phr, 160 phr: 1 phr, 190 phr: 1 phr and 220 phr : 1 phr). The parameters were hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break and ageing resitance before and after ageing. The results showed that all treatments have a influence on vulcanized dock fendor and meet the quality requirements SNI 06 - 3568 - 2006 for treatment concentration of ASP 70 tol ASP 160 with characteristics hardness of 70 <b>Shore</b> <b>A,</b> 75 <b>Shore</b> <b>A,</b> 78 <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> dan 80 <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> after ageing 68 <b>Shore</b> <b>A,</b> 72 <b>Shore</b> <b>A,</b> 76 <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> dan 78 <b>Shore</b> <b>A.</b> The tensile strength before (19 N / mm 2, 21 N / mm 2, 17 N / mm 2 and 16 N / mm 2), after ageing (17 N / mm 2, 20 N / mm 2, 15 N / mm 2 and 15 N / mm 2).

This study evaluated the effect of thermocycling on water absorption, solubility, <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> hardness and color stability of permanent soft liner materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two chemically activated soft liner materials (Sofreliner S; GC Reline Ultrasoft) were tested. Twenty cylindrical specimens (30. 0 x 1. 0 mm) were prepared for measuring water absorption and solubility and another twenty (30. 0 x 3 mm) for analyzing <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> hardness and color stability. Color was measured by a spectrophotometer before and after 2000 thermocycles. A one-way ANOVA test and Tukey test at a 5 % confidence level (p< 0. 05) were performed. RESULTS: The results did not show statistical differences for water absorption, solubility or color stability. The post-thermocycling <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> hardness values were significantly higher than those before the treatment. CONCLUSION: Thermocycling of soft liner materials increased <b>Shore</b> <b>A</b> hardness...|$|R
