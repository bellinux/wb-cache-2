5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to the fact that <b>it</b> <b>promises</b> security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In {{a study of the}} Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E

25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball {{that ought to}} make him a little fortune. <b>It</b> <b>promises</b> {{to become one of the}} greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E

Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what <b>it</b> <b>promises</b> than what it delivers, {{and that it is}} better in theory than practice.

[...] Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India called it a [...] "simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a vivah". Madhuparna Das of The Telegraph criticised Vivah for lacking plot, flat characters and mentioning that the story was [...] "rather weak and improbable." [...] BBC described Vivah as [...] "a didactic, worthy, and highly sanitised take on reality in keeping with the Rajshri tradition." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave only 1 out of 5 stars and condemned the screenplay, calling both Kapoor and Rao [...] "insipid and boring." [...] A review carried by Anupama Chopra mentioned, [...] "Sooraj Barjatya's fantasy world is carefully constructed, but his conviction infuses his films with an emotional heft."
