2500|$|After talking {{briefly with}} reporters, Wallenda called his grandmother, who {{reportedly}} {{had been too}} frightened to watch the walk, in order {{to let her know}} he made it safely. In a news conference shortly thereafter, Wallenda remarked [...] "I feel like I'm on cloud nine right now... The impossible is not quite the impossible <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>set</b> your mind to it." [...] He credited a combination of prayer, concentration, and preparation for his success.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{continues}} to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced {{themselves from their}} association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a [...] "rock band" [...] in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated [...] "I don't think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska", noting elsewhere, [...] "It was never a deliberate thing , but I think it just naturally happened because there's {{a lot of different}} styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like Ween and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>set</b> yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska". Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained [...] "Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the 'adventure' songs than really 'ska' songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms", adding [...] "we were never really a good ska band anyway".|$|E
