40|$|A novel {{procedure}} for isoflavones extraction from soybean seeds using the “green solvent” water was set-up for its future industrial up-scaling. The optimized processing <b>flow-scheme</b> proposed here {{consists of a}} 1 : 5 flour weight-to-water volume ratio mixed by vertical stirrers for 6 min. at 40 °C, with a final 12000 -rpm centrifugation, and subsequent lyophilization to ensure stability and easy dosage of the extracts. Results showed that preliminary UV-C light flour irradiation for at least 1 h can improve isoflavones extraction and reduce anti-nutritional factors. Principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factorial analysis (DFA) highlighted specific operational conditions, such as extraction volume and time, UV time exposure, and centrifugation speed, for preferential extraction of specific isoflavones. The extraction efficiency varied according to variety choice within a range of 40 - 73...|$|E
40|$|Microbial phosphorus-cycling, with {{particular}} emphasis on algal/bacterial competition, was studied in depth profiles through the halocline separating a brackish top layer, rich in nitrate and poor in phosphate, from the underlying coastal water, poor in both nitrate and phosphate, in the Sandsfjord area, western Norway. At 2 stations along the axis of natural freshwater outflow, physiological P-deficiency of algae and bacteria in the brackish layer was inferred from rapid luxury consumption of added PO 43 - by organisms in size fractions > 1 mum and 1 - 0. 2 mum, respectively. In {{a branch of the}} fjord without natural freshwater outlets, luxury consumption in the brackish layer was less, and without a clear difference between the 2 water layers. High luxury consumption coincided with short (1 mum and 1 - 0. 2 mum was found to depend on whether label was added as (gamma-AVP) -P- 32 or as (PO 43 -) -P- 32, indicating that coupling of uptake to hydrolysis by cell-bound enzymes could modify the outcome of algal-bacterial phosphorus competition. Disappearance rate of P- 32 from the 1 - 0. 2 mum size fraction following initial labeling and a subsequent cold chase with PO 43 - was used to estimate the flow-rate of phosphorus through the microbial food web. Combined with measured kinetic constants for PO 43 - uptake, alkaline phosphatases and 5 'nucleotidases, a coherent <b>flow-scheme</b> could only be obtained assuming very low (< 1 nmol l- 1) concentrations of PO 43 - and nucleotides. Chemically measured concentrations of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) more than 2 orders of magnitude above the estimated nucleotide level and with an estimated turnover time of ca 500 h, are consistent with the view that this large P-reservoir consists mainly of slowly hydrolyzable polymers...|$|E
