25|$|One {{aspect of}} Sierra Leone that {{is alleged to}} have aided the disease, is the strong desire of many to have very {{involved}} funeral practices.

25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three <b>hug,</b> <b>and</b> the lights were {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E

25|$|A Boy and His Blob is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle {{platform}} in which players control {{a young boy}} as he cooperates with a blob-like creature to overcome various obstacles. The boy can feed the blob a variety of jellybeans, which are unlocked as the game progresses and {{vary depending on the}} level, which transforms it into one of fifteen different objects {{that can be used to}} solve puzzles and defeat enemies. These include ladders for climbing, anvils to drop on top of enemies, holes that allow the boy to drop through platforms, and cannons for shooting to the hard-to-reach areas. Unlike the original NES game, which only displayed each jellybean's flavor, this version allows players to select beans from a wheel that shows what each bean does. The boy can also <b>hug</b> <b>and</b> scold the blob, as well as call to it to revert its transformation and bring it to his side. However, the boy will die if he touches an enemy or a hazardous object, or falls from a great height, sending the player back to the beginning of the area. The game is split into four worlds, each containing ten levels and a boss battle. Finding three chests hidden within each main level unlocks additional challenge levels, which rewards bonus developer material such as concept art and storyboards when cleared.|$|E
