United {{equalised}} in injury-time through Giggs, who converted a Beckham cross: a Teddy Sheringham goal a {{few minutes}} <b>earlier</b> <b>had</b> been disallowed. A draw meant that United either needed to win in Italy, or get a score-draw of 2–2 or greater.|$|E

The Tosi machinery ordered <b>earlier</b> <b>had</b> been used for other ships so the British agreed to furnish her propulsion machinery while the Americans provided the ship's armament, fire-control equipment and electronics.|$|E
5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months <b>earlier</b> <b>had</b> resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days <b>earlier</b> <b>had</b> used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was {{reported}} that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished <b>earlier</b> <b>had</b> ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years <b>earlier</b> <b>had</b> greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E

When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected <b>earlier</b> <b>had</b> she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{became the}} first team to win the European Cup or Champions League without being the champions of Europe or champions of their country the {{preceding}} season.

While Manchester United finished the season as Treble champions, Bayern ultimately lost the DFB-Pokal final to Werder Bremen, which meant they finished the season with the Bundesliga title as their only silverware.|$|E

He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|On November 29 a {{disturbance}} in the ITCZ began gaining organization near Palmyra Island, which the ITCZ had been near {{for a week}} prior. The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50mph and a pressure of 1002.7mbar and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the last report received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours <b>earlier,</b> <b>had</b> reported only small winds and 1004.7mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.|$|E
