25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is part of}} the {{limbic system}} which is related to fear cognition and <b>emotional</b> <b>learning.</b> Individuals with social anxiety disorder have been found to have a hypersensitive amygdala; for example in relation to social threat cues (e.g. perceived negative evaluation by another person), angry or hostile faces, and while waiting to give a speech. Recent research has also indicated that another area of the brain, the anterior cingulate cortex, which was already known {{to be involved in the}} experience of physical pain, also appears to be involved in the experience of 'social pain', for example perceiving group exclusion. A 2007 meta-analysis also found that individuals with social anxiety had hyperactiviation in the amygdala and insula areas which are frequently associated with fear and negative emotional processing.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired <b>emotional</b> <b>learning.</b> These adverse effects {{are believed to be}} due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been detoxified multiple times but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears {{to be the most important}} factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{structure}} {{that is the}} center of most neurobiological events associated with fear is the amygdala, located behind the pituitary gland. The amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning. It is essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of <b>emotional</b> <b>learning</b> memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdala generates the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdala may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in safe mode, meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, the amygdala will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.|$|E

40|$|As {{people get}} older, {{they tend to}} {{remember}} more positive than negative information. This age-by-valence interaction has been called “positivity effect. ” The current study addressed the hypotheses that baseline functional connectivity at rest is predictive of older adults' brain activity when <b>learning</b> <b>emotional</b> information and their positivity effect in memory. Using fMRI, we examined the relationship among resting-state functional connectivity, subsequent brain activity when <b>learning</b> <b>emotional</b> faces, and individual differences in the positivity effect (the relative tendency to remember faces expressing positive vs. negative emotions). Consistent with our hypothesis, older adults with a stronger positivity effect had increased functional coupling between amygdala and medial PFC (MPFC) during rest. In contrast, younger adults did not show the association between resting connectivity and memory positivity. A similar age-by-memory positivity interaction was also found when <b>learning</b> <b>emotional</b> faces. That is, memory positivity in older adults was associated with (a) enhanced MPFC activity when <b>learning</b> <b>emotional</b> faces and (b) increased negative functional coupling between amygdala and MPFC when learning negative faces. In contrast, memory positivity in younger adults was related to neither enhanced MPFC activity to emotional faces, nor MPFC–amygdala connectivity to negative faces. Furthermore, stronger MPFC–amygdala connectivity during rest was predictive of subsequent greater MPFC activity when <b>learning</b> <b>emotional</b> faces. Thus, emotion–memory interaction in older adults depends {{not only on the}} task-related brain activity but also on the baseline functional connectivity...|$|R
