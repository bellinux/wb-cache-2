50|$|In H-aggregates a <b>hypsochromic</b> {{shift is}} {{observed}} with low or no fluorescence.|$|E
50|$|For example, β-acylpyrrole {{will show}} a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of 30-40 nm in {{comparison}} with α-acylpyrroles.|$|E
50|$|This {{can occur}} {{because of a}} change in {{environmental}} conditions: for example, a change in solvent polarity will result in solvatochromism. A series of structurally related molecules in a substitution series can also show a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift. <b>Hypsochromic</b> shift is a phenomenon seen in molecular spectra, not atomic spectra - it is thus more common to speak of the movement of the peaks in the spectrum rather than lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronic}} transitions {{of molecules}} in solution can depend strongly {{on the type}} of solvent with additional bathochromic shifts or <b>hypsochromic</b> shifts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypsochromic</b> shift (from ancient Greek ὕψος (upsos) [...] "height"; and χρῶμα chrōma, [...] "color") is {{a change}} of {{spectral}} band position in the absorption, reflectance, transmittance, or emission spectrum of a molecule to a shorter wavelength (higher frequency). Because the blue color in the visible spectrum has a shorter wavelength than most other colors, this effect is also commonly called a blue shift.|$|E
5000|$|Solvatochromism is {{the ability}} of a {{chemical}} substance to change color due to a change in solvent polarity. Negative solvatochromism corresponds to <b>hypsochromic</b> shift (or blue shift) with increasing solvent polarity. The corresponding bathochromic shift (or red) is termed positive solvatochromism. [...] The sign of the solvatochromism depends on the difference in dipole moment between the ground and excited states of the chromophore.|$|E
50|$|A {{molecular}} {{logic gate}} can processes modulators much like the set up seen in de Silva’s ‘Proof-of-principle’ but incorporating different logic gates on the same molecule. Such a function is called integrated logic and is exemplified by the BODIPY-based, half-subtractor logic gate illustrated by A. Coskun, E. U. Akkaya and their colleagues (as shown below). When monitored at two different wavelengths, 565 and 660 nm, XOR and INHIBIT logic gates are obtained at the respective wavelengths. Optical studies of this compound in THF reveal an absorbance peak at 565 nm and an emission peak at 660 nm. Addition of an acid results in a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of both peaks as protonation of the tertiary amine results in an internal charge transfer. The colour of the emission observed is yellow. Upon addition of a strong base, the phenolic hydroxyl group is rendered deprotonated, resulting in a photoinduced electron transfer, which in turn renders the molecule non-emissive. Upon addition of both an acid and a base, the emission of the molecule is observed as red, as the tertiary amine would not be protonated while the hydroxyl group would remain protonated resulting {{in the absence of}} both PET and ICT. Due to the great difference in emission intensity, this single molecule is capable of carrying out an arithmetic operation; subtraction at a nanoscale level.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{absorption}} {{spectrum of the}} irradiated sample was taken and showed a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift from 542 to 536  nm, which {{may be attributed to}} a partial release of IC {{from the surface of the}} AuNPs.|$|E
30|$|Thus, the {{presented}} results {{testify to}} the presence of several common feature characteristics of all prepared CP/O 300 nanocomposites: the <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of the peak position, the growth of the integral intensity, the weakening of the vibronic structure, and the increased width.|$|E
40|$|Although buffer-specific {{effects on}} {{molecular}} recognition are known in biological science, they remain rare in supramolecular chemistry. The binding between a cationic dye, Mallard Blue (MalB), and polyanionic heparin in aqueous NaCl (150 mM) is studied in three commonly-used buffers (Tris-HCl, HEPES, Phosphate, each 10 mM). Although MalB {{has a very}} similar UV-Vis spectrum in each buffer, the sensory response towards heparin was different in each case. This can be ascribed to differences in the complex formed. In Tris-HCl which has the least competitive chloride counter-anions, MalB exhibits a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of 25 nm, assigned to strong binding and aggregation of the dye on heparin. In more competitive HEPES, containing a sulfonate anion, there is weaker binding and less aggregation of MalB along the heparin; the <b>hypsochromic</b> shift is only 15 nm. In phosphate buffer, MalB can interact quite strongly with buffer phosphate anions; although heparin binding is still observed, the <b>hypsochromic</b> shift associated with dye aggregation is only 5 nm. As such, specific buffer interactions with the MalB-heparin complex mediate host-guest binding and sensing. Buffer choice must be made carefully in studies of molecular recognition – we would caution against using phosphate and sulfonate containing buffers when studying electrostatic binding...|$|E
30|$|It was {{possible}} to confirm the release of ICs from the AuNPs surface, due to the plasmonic heat of the irradiated nanoparticles, by observing {{a decrease in the}} height of the AuNPs using AFM and by observing one <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of the plasmon band using UV-Vis spectrophotometry.|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} computational study was performed for the spectroscopic properties of novel 2 (1 H) -pyridones. The compounds {{were found to}} be virtually non-fluorescence in solution while modestly fluorescent in solid state. The solvent effects on the UV-vis and fluorescence maxima were estimated by means of a series of ab-initio quantum chemical calculations in conjunction with Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) method. Influence of structural displacements and intermolecular interactions in crystalline state were examined in details on the spectra of two representative compounds by using Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) scheme. The FMO pair interaction analysis of the spectra indicate that (1) intermolecular hydrogen bonds provoke bathochromic shifts (2) electrostatic interactions induce <b>hypsochromic</b> shifts (3) crystal packing effects induce <b>hypsochromic</b> shifts in total from the maxima in vacuo...|$|E
40|$|A {{waterborne}} polyurethane-based polymeric dye (WPU-CFBB) was synthesized by anchoring 1, 4 -bis(methylamino) anthraquinone (CFBB) to waterborne polyurethane chains. The number molecular weight, {{glass transition}} temperature, and average emulsion particle size for the polymeric dye were determined, respectively. This polymeric dye exhibited intriguing optical behaviors. The polymeric dye engendered two new absorption bands centered at about 520 [*]nm and 760 [*]nm {{if compared with}} CFBB in UV-vis spectra. The 760 [*]nm peak showed <b>hypsochromic</b> shift with the decrease of average particle sizes. The polymeric dye dramatically demonstrated both <b>hypsochromic</b> and bathochromic effects with increasing temperature. The fluorescence intensity of the polymeric dye was much {{higher than that of}} CFBB. It was found that the fluorescence intensities would be enhanced from 20 °C to 40 °C and then decline from 40 °C to 90 °C. The fluorescence of the polymeric dye emulsion was very stable and was not sensitive to quenchers...|$|E

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Donald D Johnson, Katherine A Roberts, Joseph L PetersonForensic Science, Hemoglobin, <b>Hypsochromic</b> Shift, Soret Band, Time Since Death, UV-VIS SpectrophotometryThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine time since death based on the <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of hemoglobin's Soret band. Three experiments were conducted to examine the Soret band shift over time, the degree of inter-subject variation, and the accuracy and precision of the technique. Using different lysing methods on the erythrocytes, blood from six euthanized rats were tested over different time since death intervals using an Implen NanoPhotometer P 300 to obtain an absorption spectrum. Rat blood was collected from multiple rats from the time of death up to 84 hours after death. There was no change detected over time of the Soret band of hemoglobin after death. The results from the six rats were consistent with each other and supported that there was little to no inter-rat variation of the Soret band location. Furthermore, the method was determined to be both accurate and precise between the duplicated results...|$|E
40|$|The photophysical {{behavior}} of the amphiphilic cationic hemicyanine dye N-n-heptyl- 4 -(((dimethylamino) phenyl) ethenyl) pyridinium bromide (H 7 HC) has been examined in various environments with the intention to assess its state of adsorption on a TiO 2 mesoporous film. In some solvents, such as short-chain alcohols or chloroform, the dye is dissolved as a monomer. In other solvents, like water and cyclohexane, it is found in concentration-dependent aggregate forms. H 7 HC monomer absorption and fluorescence spectra show a symmetric solvatochromic effect previously found for other amphiphilic hemicyanines (Fromherz, P. J. Phys. Chem., 1995, 99, 7188). Aggregates are of the H-type; i. e., they are formed by repulsive interaction and display a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift in their absorption spectra. When adsorbed on nanostructured mesoporous TiO 2 films, H 7 HC is found in aggregate form, which evolves {{in the course of}} time by displaying a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift in the absorption maximum. Photoelectrochemical studies with an ITO-TiO 2 -H 7 HC electrode revealed that aggregates are responsible for the ability of the dye to photosensitize TiO 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of sunscreens is often {{influenced by the}} solvents inwhich they are dissolved. In this regard, the ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of 13 UVA and UVB sunscreen chemicals were determined in 12 solvents ofvarying polarity and cosmetic interest. Changes inboth the wavelength of maximum absorbance (K max) and molar absorptivity () were observed {{for many of the}} sunscreen-solvent sys ems studied. Observed <b>hypsochromic</b> and bathochromic shifts in K max for a number of sunscreen chemicals were related to their structure and polarity. Polar solvents shifted the K max of polar sunscreens to shorter wavelengths (<b>hypsochromic)</b> andshifted less polar sunscreens to longer wavelengths (bathochromic). Ortho-substituted sunscreen chemicals, uch as salicylates and anthranilates xperienced a minimum or no UV absorbance shift. With the exception of PABA, most sunscreens showed increased absorbance in both polar and non-polar solvents and decreased absorbance in semi-polar solvents, such as hexylene glycol and C• 2 -C• 5 alcohols benzoate. The results of this study should aid the cosmetic chemist in selecting appropriate solvents and vehicles for sunscreen chemicals...|$|E

We studied two types of functionalization - hydroxylation and fluorination of the nanodiamond surface. It is shown that only slight spectral shifts occur (batochromic shifts in case of the hydroxylation, and <b>hypsochromic</b> ones in case of the fluorination). The semiempirical approach demonstrates the ability to easily and simply handle nanoclusters with hundreds carbon atoms...|$|E

30|$|The FT-IR {{spectrum}} of AgNPs (Figure S 11 a) obtained after the sunlight exposed degradation of MB shows that some peaks have disappeared, specifically the peaks at 1489 and 1178  cm− 1 both due to vibration of heterocyclic skeleton, indicating the cleavage of heterocyclic ring. Moreover, the peaks at 1350  cm− 1 due to C–N stretching are also disappeared inferring the cleavage of C–N bond in N-methyl group. This is further {{supported by the}} large <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of λ max in the UV–Vis spectrum {{in the presence of}} sunlight.|$|E

Significant dichroic effects (mostly hypochromic effects and <b>hypsochromic</b> bands shifts) were reported. The effect {{is related to}} the chemical structure: some dye structures always possess dichroism (azo, stilbene, thiazole and oxazine), some dyes demonstrate sometimes dichroic effects (anthraquinoid, indigoid) while other structures never demonstrate dichroic effects (sulphur, diphenylmethanes, triarylmethanes, phthalocyanines).

40|$|The {{designation}} of E/Z-geometrical isomers in 3 -acylidene 2 -oxindoles by NMR spectroscopy {{can lead to}} erroneous assignment of alkene stereochemistry because of the narrow chemical shift range observed over a large series of analogues. In contrast, UV-Vis spectroscopy offers a convenient and more reliable method for alkene stereochemical assignment. A combination of X-ray crystallography and theoretical studies shows that the observed differences in UV-Vis spectroscopic behaviour relate to the twisted conformation of the Z-isomers that provides reduced conjugation and weaker <b>hypsochromic</b> (blue-shifted) absorbances relative {{to those of the}} E-isomers...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{series of}} mono-, di- and tri-bromo- 3 H-naphtho[2, 1 -b]pyrans was synthesised {{by the traditional}} union of a 2 -naphthol with an alkynol. The bromine atom(s) in these naphthopyrans was readily replaced by a vinyl group using a Suzuki coupling reaction with vinyl boronic anhydride pyridine complex. The efficiency of the Suzuki vinylation reaction decreases with {{the increasing number of}} bromine atoms to be substituted. The vinylnaphthopyrans served as styrene analogues and readily underwent a thermally initiated free radical addition co-polymerisation with styrene to efficiently afford low molecular weight poly(styrene-co-naphthopyrans). The photochromic response of the bromonaphthopyrans and vinylnaphthopyrans followed the established colour-structure relationships for photochromic naphthopyrans. The photochromic response of toluene solutions of the poly(styrene-co-naphthopyrans) was characterised by a <b>hypsochromic</b> shift of the λmax relative to that recorded for the vinylnaphthopyran monomers. Increased half-lives were noted for the copolymers derived from the bis- and tris-vinylnaphthopyrans where some degree of crosslinking was expected. A further <b>hypsochromic</b> shift in λmax resulted for the thin films of the poly(styrene-co-naphthopyrans). Of particular note was the behaviour of the 3 -(2 -vinylphenyl) - 3 -phenylnaphthopyran which gave the typical yellow colour of the photomerocyanine coupled with the predictable large half-life. However, all photochromism of this naphthopyran was lost upon polymerisation suggesting that an alternative pathway supervenes in the expected polymerisation sequence...|$|E

Monobasic bases like pyridine, methyl substituted anilines and such other bases exhibit 1 : 2 stoichiometry giving hexa – coordinated adductds. The dibasic bases such as 1, 10 -phenanthroline and 2, 9 - neocuproine exhibit 1 : 1 stoichiometry giving hexacoordinated adducts.

The stability of the supramolecular complex significantly diminished when sulfocalixarenes of smaller ring size served as host compounds but the pH affected the association strength to a much lesser extent.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis comprises the synthesis and examination of several series of azo dyes of general structure (I) where Y incorporates the terminal nitrogen atom in a five- or six-membered saturated heterocyclic ring system, and Ar is an aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic residue, often containing substituent groups. Results are interpreted {{in terms of the}} effect of Ar and Y. (electronic and steric) on the conjugation of the lone pair of electrons of the terminal nitrogen atom {{with the rest of the}} system. Thus, -the pyrrolidinoazo dyes (Y=-CH 2 CH 2 -) absorb at similar wavelengths to their NN-diethyl analogues whilst the corresponding piperidino dyes (Y=-CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 -) show <b>hypsochromic</b> shifts of ^max The presence, of a Y-heteroatom in a six-membered saturated ring increases this <b>hypsochromic</b> effect. Absorption bands of the mono-protonated chromogens have also been examined; in the azobenzene series it is found that variation of the terminal amino group produces a change from almost exclusive protonation at the ß-azo nitrogen atom (azonium'ion) to nearly quantitative protonation at the terminal nitrogen atom (ammonium ion). Trends in the p. m. r. spectra'of the dyes have been noted. Fastness properties of the dyes'on polyester are given. Light fastness ratings are generally low, although the presence of a Y-heteroatom in the six-membered terminal amino ring is advantageous, resulting in values approaching those of the NN-diethyl counterparts. The light fastness properties of monoazo dyes are discussed generally...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we showed that}} the hybrid {{functional}} PBE 0 was able to reproduce the absorption band λMAX {{with a standard deviation}} of 6  nm. This value could be matched but not improved using various combinations of hybrid functionals PBE 0, B 3 LYP and B 3 P 86. It is also very close the experimental error, which would typically be of few nm. The structure–property relationships study based on structural and electronic descriptors analysis showed that the bathochromic or <b>hypsochromic</b> shifts are influenced by the number and position of OH groups, the hardness, electrophilicity, ionization potential, electron affinity and electronegativity descriptors.|$|E
40|$|Using {{advanced}} QM/MM methods, the surprisingly negligible {{shift of}} the lowest-lying bright electronic excitation of the deprotonated p-coumaric acid (pCA(-)) within the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is shown to stem from a subtle balance between <b>hypsochromic</b> and bathochromic effects. More specifically, {{it is found that}} the change in the excitation energy {{as a consequence of the}} disruption of the planarity of pCA(-) inside PYP is nearly canceled out by the shift induced by the intermolecular interactions of the chromophore and the protein as a whole.

30|$|The blueshift in λ max {{suggests}} {{the formation of}} N-demethylated intermediates in degradation pathway. The color of MB solutions becomes less intense (<b>hypsochromic</b> effect) when auxochromic groups (methyl or methylamine) are removed. For dyes containing auxochromic alkylamine groups, N-dealkylation {{plays an important role}} in photocatalytic degradation [68]. No new peaks for intermediates appeared during the degradation of both MG and MB and almost nil COD value after the reaction indicates the complete degradation of dyes in sunlight. Hence in the light reactions, it appears degradation takes place via demethylation process and in the absence of light the removal of color is due to adsorption. However, further research using other plasmonic nanoparticles is required to prove this mechanism.|$|E
