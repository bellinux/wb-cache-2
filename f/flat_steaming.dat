5000|$|Gua bao (...) , {{also known}} as steamed bao, pork belly buns, or ambiguously, bao, is a Taiwanese snack food {{consisting}} of a slice of stewed meat and other condiments sandwiched between <b>flat</b> <b>steamed</b> bread. The steamed bread is typically 6-8 cm in size, semi-circular and flat in form, with a horizontal fold that, when opened, gives the appearance {{that it has been}} sliced. The traditional filling for gua bao is a slice of red-cooked porkbelly, typically dressed with stir-fried suan cai (pickled mustard greens), cilantro, and ground peanuts.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{workings}} comprise {{three groups of}} shallow open workings and a shaft. Surviving crushing and concentrating plant located {{on the site of}} the mill shed includes a jaw crusher, jigs, tables and a <b>flat</b> bed <b>steam</b> engine. The mill shed has mostly collapsed, although some of the bush timber uprights and part of the roof frame, with corrugated iron sheets, remains standing. The nearby workshop, which is similarly constructed, has partly collapsed around a tractor with a front loading scoop.|$|R
5000|$|Bánh phở - The <b>steamed</b> <b>flat</b> {{and thin}} cake made from rice flour and water before being cut into strips. The strips {{are not only}} called Bánh phở but also [...] "con phở" [...] or [...] "cọng phở," [...] noodles {{that are used in}} phở. The width of the strips is usually around 1cm or less.|$|R
6000|$|VI. [...] By peaks that flamed, or, all in shade, [...] Gloom'd the {{low coast}} and quivering brine [...] With ashy rains, that {{spreading}} made [...] Fantastic plume or sable pine; [...] By sands and <b>steaming</b> <b>flats,</b> and floods [...] Of mighty mouth, we scudded fast, [...] And hills and scarlet-mingled woods [...] Glow'd {{for a moment}} as we past.|$|R
25|$|The {{weight of}} the boiler rested on the water drums, and thus on {{supports}} from the firing <b>flat's</b> deck. The <b>steam</b> drum was only supported by the watertubes and was allowed to move freely, with thermal expansion. If superheated, the superheater elements were hung from this drum. Compared to the earlier Scotch and locomotive boilers, water-tube boilers with their reduced water volumes were considered lightweight and didn't require extensive supports.|$|R
50|$|The upper crown {{sheet of}} the inner firebox is, as with most {{locomotive}} boilers, approximately flat and horizontal, so as to maintain a constant depth of water over this hottest part of the firebox. This <b>flat</b> surface, with <b>steam</b> pressure on its upper side, requires stays to support it. As {{it is not a}} constant distance from the boiler barrel, unlike the firebox sides, this staying is difficult to arrange.|$|R

50|$|The {{pilothouse}} has an elliptical forward {{face and}} a <b>flat</b> rear. A <b>steam</b> radiator provides heat, and a ladder provides access to the pilothouse roof. The large wheel dominates the house, its size dictated by the entirely manual steering gear, an anachronistic feature for the time. Voice pipes run to the engine room and saloon. Bells provide additional communication to the engine room. Whistles are fitted for signals to ships and shore.|$|R
50|$|The {{excursion}} {{train is}} made up of restored 1920s era coaches, previously owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian National Railway, Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. The railway's equipment collection also includes rolling stock not used on the excursions, including a former Ontario Northland Railway business car #200, a combination passenger/baggage coach used as a museum, two wooden cabooses, one steel wide-vision ex-CPR caboose, a ballast car, various boxcars, <b>flat</b> cars, and <b>steam</b> generator cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{components}} of the hull were shipped out from Ontario in 19 freight cars. The hull itself was divided into 20 watertight compartments, and to allow as shallow a draft as possible, {{the bottom of the}} hull was almost perfectly <b>flat.</b> The compound <b>steam</b> engines were highly efficient and had been employed in many ships, but they had never been used before on a sternwheeler. Bonningtons sternwheel was 25.0 ft in diameter and had 20 buckets, which was the steamboat word for paddles.|$|R
5000|$|The museum {{underwent}} major building {{works in}} 2007. This entailed removing the Rennie <b>flat</b> V <b>steam</b> engine (now {{to be found}} at Chatham Historic Dockyard) to create a larger exhibition space, a cafe and improved toilet facilities. With {{the closure of the}} East London Line in December 2007 for extensive upgrading the museum hoped that the access shaft into the tunnel (originally built to be the grand entrance hall to the tunnel) could be capped with a concrete shelf at the bottom, above the level of the trains. This shelf was completed in early 2010, with the inauguration taking place in late January. The access shaft took in its first groups from the general public on 14 February 2010 (Valentine's Day) when it was opened as the 'Tunnel of Love' for short historical presentations detailing the history of the tunnel and of some interesting historical notes from the private life and diary of Brunel's son, Isambard.|$|R
50|$|Construction was {{subcontracted}} to S. Sørensen, who bid NOK 1,039,400 for the job. The {{lower cost}} would normally {{have resulted in}} lower state subsidies, but the money was instead permitted {{to be used to}} increase the rail weight from 15 to 17.5 kilograms per meter and a wider curve radius. Construction was eased by the <b>flat</b> landscape. Two <b>steam</b> locomotives, named Tønsberg and Eidsfoss, were bought from Baldwin Locomotive Works along with six passenger carriages from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. Eidsfoss Verk built their own forty-eight cargo cars. Tønsberg was delivered in April 1899 and Eidsfoss in May and both participated in the construction work.|$|R
60|$|And yet {{the fancy}} may linger, without blame, over the shining meres, the golden reed-beds, the countless water-fowl, the strange and gaudy insects, the wild nature, the mystery, the majesty--for mystery and majesty there were--which haunted the deep fens for many a hundred years. Little thinks the Scotsman, whirled {{down by the}} Great Northern Railway from Peterborough to Huntingdon, what a grand place, even twenty years ago, was that Holme and Whittlesea, which is now but a black, unsightly, <b>steaming</b> <b>flat,</b> from which the meres and reed- beds {{of the old world}} are gone, while the corn and roots of the new world have not as yet taken their place.|$|R
60|$|Hence {{that vast}} {{labyrinth}} of banks between Lynn and Wisbeach, of mud inside, {{brought down by}} the fen rivers; but outside (contrary to the usual rule) of shifting sand, which has come inward from the sea, and prevents the mud's escape--banks parted by narrow gullies, the delight of the gunner with his punt, haunted by million wild-fowl in winter, and in summer hazy <b>steaming</b> <b>flats,</b> beyond which the trees of Lincolnshire loom up, raised by refraction far above the horizon, while the masts and sails of distant vessels quiver, fantastically distorted and lengthened, sometimes even inverted, by a refraction like that which plays such tricks with ships and coasts in the Arctic seas. Along {{the top of the}} mud banks lounge the long black rows of seals, undistinguishable from their reflection in the still water below; distorted too, and magnified to the size of elephants. Long lines of sea-pies wing their way along at regular tide-hours, from or to the ocean. Now and then a skein of geese paddle hastily out of sight round a mud-cape; or a brown robber gull (generally Richardson's Skua) raises a tumult of screams, by making a raid upon a party of honest white gulls, to frighten them into vomiting up their prey for his benefit; or a single cormorant flaps along, close to the water, towards his fishing ground. Even the fish are shy of haunting a bottom which shifts with every storm; and innumerable shrimps are almost the only product of the shallow barren sea: beside, all is silence and desolation, as of a world waiting to be made.|$|R
