Italian Americans, along with other whites, enjoyed benefits of the G.I. Bill that were denied many African Americans due to racial discrimination.|$|E

After school, she returned home in her school uniform and played in the coffee mill (her clothes still smelling of fresh coffee at school the next day). She found school boring compared to her grandmother's lessons, and frequently got into trouble. As punishment, {{she was forced to}} read novels aloud to a blind nun. The experience taught her a love of literature which influenced her choice of major in college. Her parents wanted her to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> <b>and</b> her teachers expected everyone in the school to attend a university.|$|E

Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> <b>and</b> you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Veitch told Brown {{that she}} {{believed}} that the JC's Girls ministry needed to move to Las Vegas, and he responded supportively. By 2008, Veitch had moved to Las Vegas and based the new chapter of JC's Girls at Central Christian Church in nearby Henderson, Nevada, leaving {{the leadership of the}} Riverside chapter to Albee. That year, Veitch collaborated with Annie Lobert, a former call girl working with Hookers for Jesus, an organization similar to JC's Girls. The organizations were both represented at that year's AVN Adult Entertainment Expo. The PussyCat Preacher, a documentary film about Veitch's experiences starting JC's Girls, was released that February. The following month, pornographic film actor Sophia Lynn left the sex industry after becoming a Christian; she underwent {{more than a year of}} counselling with Veitch through JC's Girls. Veitch had flown to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to spend a weekend educating Celebrate Community Church about the sex industry. The church soon gave Lynn a job in its office, a scholarship to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> <b>and</b> a place to live. Lynn said, [...] "I hope I don't have to wake up from this.

500|$|Curt accompanies Steve, last year's {{high school}} student class president, and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the back-to-high-school sock hop. In one story line, Curt is desperate to find a {{beautiful}} blonde girl driving a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird that he sees {{en route to the}} dance: at a stoplight, she appears to say [...] "I love you" [...] before disappearing around the corner. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt to see what he could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth. Curt waits by the telephone booth and early the next morning, he is awakened by the phone ringing. It turns out to be [...] "The Blonde" [...] who says she knows him and maybe she would see him cruising the coming night. Curt replies probably not, intimating that he decided to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> <b>and</b> will be leaving that morning.|$|E

2500|$|As Wallenda grew, he transitioned {{from being}} a clown to juggling to a dog act. [...] In 1991, at age 12, he told a {{reporter}} he {{was not interested in}} becoming a high-wire artist when he grew up. [...] "It's just not worth it," [...] he explained. [...] "We're risking our lives out there. We could die." [...] Instead, he said, he dreamed of being a pilot. [...] Soon after, Wallenda made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13. When he graduated high school, his parents encouraged him to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> <b>and</b> explore his options.

Cross told the Daily News of Los Angeles: [...] "I want people to leave my film feeling uplifted and having a better understanding of what it's like to live in our world." [...] The feature-length version of the film includes interviews with family members and friends of children with autism. Cross said work on the documentary was difficult: [...] "It was long, and it was tedious. I swear on my grave that I'm not doing another documentary. It took two years to finish." [...] During the film's production, Cross and Bowers appeared on a program hosted by Paula Zahn on CNN to discuss their work.|$|E

2500|$|The demonstrations raised {{questions}} for Harvard students {{about their own}} role in the nation's economic elite—the so-called [...] "1%". Even participants struggled {{with the question of}} how Harvard students could authentically express solidarity with the downtrodden of the world. Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive financial aid policies. Neal Gabler wrote in the New York Times that Harvard students were [...] "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were [...] "likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers." [...] One Harvard graduate who had already joined Occupy Boston told the Boston Globe that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: [...] "I’m the first person in my family to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> <b>and</b> I worked hard to go to Harvard, but I feel that the way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’" [...] Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting [...] "We are the one percent" [...] and yelling insults.|$|E
2500|$|His {{biological}} father, Abdulfattah [...] "John" [...] Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. March 15, 1931), {{grew up in}} Homs, Syria and {{was born}} into an Arab Muslim household. Jandali {{is the son of}} a self-made millionaire who did not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> <b>and</b> a mother who was a traditional housewife. While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities. Although Jandali initially wanted to study law, he eventually decided to study economics and political science. He pursued a PhD in the latter subject at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble (b. August 1, 1932), a Catholic of Swiss and German descent, who grew up on a farm in Wisconsin. As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age. Jobs's full biological sister (Mona Simpson), notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: [...] "it wasn't that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a Muslim. But {{there are a lot of}} Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it's not that unusual." [...] Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's official biographer, additionally states that Schieble's father [...] "threatened to cut Joanne off completely" [...] if she continued the relationship.|$|E
