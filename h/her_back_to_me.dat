60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Just so. Thats {{where she}} had me. I shouldn't have {{believed}} her a bit if she'd turned <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Towards {{the close}} of the {{afternoon}} I saw a female in front of me, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> walking, and pushing a bicycle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You maraudin' hathen! 'Tis {{the only}} cutty I iver loved. Handle her tinder, or I'll chuck you acrost the nullah. If that poipe was bruk--Ah! Give <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Sorr!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right--the best thing," [...] said Dr. May; and {{he whispered}} to Ethel, [...] "Go with her, but don't try to rouse her--don't talk <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She flung 'erself down in {{the chair}} agin with <b>'er</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and for nearly three-quarters of an hour we sat there without a word. Then, to our joy, we 'eard {{footsteps}} turn in at the gate. Quick footsteps they was. Somebody turned the handle of the door, and then a face looked in at the window that made me nearly jump out of my boots in surprise. A face that was as white as chalk with temper, and a bonnet cocked over one eye with walking fast. She shook 'er fist at me, and then she shook it at Miss Lamb.|$|R
5000|$|Fantasia Barrino {{included}} {{a sample of}} the song on [...] "Collard Greens and Cornbread" [...] from <b>her</b> 2010 album <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Duke. O, Valerio, I am {{desperately in}} love: That lady, {{with whom you}} saw me talking, has--But I lose time; she's gone; haste after her,-- find her,--bring <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|On {{turning the}} corner of the house, and gaining a view of the garden, I was startled by seeing a {{stranger}} walking in it. The stranger was a woman--she was lounging along the path with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and was gathering the flowers.|$|E
60|$|Then turning <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{she smiled}} on him so sweetly that {{although}} really {{he was more}} loth to go than I, Leo would have followed her through a furnace door, as indeed, had he but known it, {{he was about to}} do.|$|E
5000|$|A {{version of}} the song [...] "Somewhere Else" [...] was also {{recorded}} by alternative country singer Kathleen Edwards on <b>her</b> 2003 album <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Misery! What misery? Why {{should she}} be miserable? Must a woman need be miserable because {{she lives with}} her husband? You hear me say that I will forgive everything. Even she will not doubt me when I say so, because I have never lied to her. Let <b>her</b> come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and she shall live in peace and quiet, and hear no word of reproach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} it is. I felt very much so when the horses ran away, and for fifteen minutes I sat {{clinging}} to Mamma, expecting to be killed. Every unkind, undutiful word I'd ever said <b>to</b> <b>her</b> came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and was worse to bear than the fear of sudden death. It scared {{a great deal of}} naughtiness out of me, and dear Mamma and I have been more to each other ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have kept}} my word, sirs," [...] he said, [...] "and I look to have nae wrang amang ye. If {{this is no}} the {{prisoner}} ye sought," [...] he said, addressing Earnscliff, [...] "ye'll render <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again. I am answerable for her to those that aught her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must take}} a wider view," [...] I said resolutely, {{thinking}} that with this exceptional creature {{this was the right}} note to strike. She looked at me steadily for a moment, and then the tears she had been keeping down flowed unrestrained. She jumped up and stood in the window with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{gave the}} promise. No words can say how sorrowfully I gave it. She {{instantly}} took her arm from my waist, walked {{away to the}} window, and stood looking out with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> After a moment she spoke once more, but without turning round, without allowing me to catch the smallest glimpse of her face.|$|E
6000|$|I {{knelt down}} by the tomb. I laid my hands, I laid {{my head on the}} broad white stone, and closed my weary eyes on the earth around, on the light above. I let <b>her</b> come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Oh, my love! my love! my heart may speak to you NOW! It is {{yesterday}} again since we parted--yesterday, since your dear hand lay in mine--yesterday, since my eyes looked their last on you. My love! my love! ...|$|R
60|$|The person coming was Mary Jane. She {{went to the}} coffin, very soft, and kneeled {{down and}} looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear <b>her,</b> and <b>her</b> <b>back</b> was <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and {{everything}} was all right. They hadn't stirred.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some people," [...] said Irene softly, [...] "think {{the moon}} on <b>her</b> <b>back</b> is evil; <b>to</b> <b>me</b> she's always lovely. Look at those cypress shadows! Jon, Father says we {{may go to}} Italy, you and I, for two months. Would you like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, I came to {{the room}} by the open windows, and your mamma was {{standing}} up, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and leaning on the mantel-piece, with {{her face in her}} handkerchief; and the Doctor was standing up too, only his back was to the fireplace; and when he saw me, he made me a sign to go away, and I went directly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Reaching {{the hall}} {{just as the}} lady said her last words, I {{caught a glimpse of}} her face, and {{discovered}} the middle-aged stranger who had called on [...] "Miss Jillgall," [...] and had promised to repeat her visit. A second lady was at the door, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> taking leave of her friend. Having said good-by, she turned round--and we confronted each other.|$|E
60|$|I found Mr Abney {{pacing the}} room, {{a look of}} {{annoyance}} on his face. At the desk, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Audrey was writing. It was part of her work {{to take charge of}} the business correspondence of the establishment. She did not look round when I came in, nor when Mr Abney spoke my name, but went on writing as if I did not exist.|$|E
6000|$|Again I pondered, and <b>her</b> {{words came}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "That he who {{can write a}} great book is greater than a king; that the gift {{of being able to}} write is given to anybody in trust; that an author should never forget he is God's servant." ...|$|R
6000|$|My resentment deepened. Fate {{had played}} me a wanton trick. Cynthia trusted me. If I were weak, I {{should not be}} the only one to suffer. And {{something}} told me that I should be weak. How could I hope to be strong, tortured by the thousand memories which the sight of <b>her</b> would bring <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{will come}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Tranquil," [...] he said. [...] "I {{know what people}} are saying, {{but that does not}} trouble me. They do not know Marcella as I do. She promised and she will keep her word--keep it joyously and gladly, too. If I did not know that I would not wish its fulfilment. When she is free she will turn <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on that {{brilliant}} world and all it offers <b>her</b> and come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> My part is to wait and believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace, Mother Agnes, peace!" [...] he said. [...] "Take this lady, dry her, array her in {{your best}} gown, give her food, warm her, and bring <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Short? What care I if the robe be short? Obey, {{or it will}} not be come, and he cometh, but go and she goeth, and then who will shelter one who talks so much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{far more}} charming face," [...] I heard him say. [...] "But no--not a more {{beautiful}} figure. What figure was ever {{more beautiful than}} hers? Something--but not all--of her enchanting grace. Where is the resemblance which has brought <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> In the pose of the figure, perhaps. In {{the movement of the}} figure, perhaps. Poor martyred angel! What a life! And what a death! what a death!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{looked up}} and caught her eye. Her smile went back in {{and she gave me}} a cold look of suspicion. Then I laughed, and laid down on the floor to laugh easier. It seemed funny to me. By nature and geniality I am a hearty laugher, and I went the limit. When I came to, Mame was sitting with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> all {{contaminated}} with dignity.|$|E
60|$|There is {{only one}} {{consolation}} to set against them--a consolation that ought <b>to</b> comfort <b>me,</b> and that does comfort me. All the graces and gentleness of her character--all the frank affection of her nature--all the sweet, simple, womanly charms which used to make her the darling and delight of every one who approached <b>her,</b> have come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with herself. Of my other impressions I am sometimes a little inclined to doubt. Of this last, best, happiest of all impressions, I grow more and more certain every hour in the day.|$|R
6000|$|... "And when thou wast dead, ah! I wept, because I was undying and thou wast dead. I wept {{there in}} the place of Life so that had I been mortal any more my heart had surely broken. And she, the swart Egyptian--she cursed me by her gods. By Osiris did she curse me and by Isis, by Nephthys and by Anubis, by Sekhet, the cat-headed, and by Set, calling down evil on me, evil and {{everlasting}} desolation. Ah! I can see her dark face now lowering o'er me like a storm, but she could not hurt me, and I--I know not if I could hurt her. I did not try; it was naught <b>to</b> <b>me</b> then; so together we bore thee hence. And afterwards I sent her--the Egyptian--away through the swamps, and it seems that she lived to bear a son and to write the tale that should lead thee, <b>her</b> husband, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>her</b> rival and thy murderess.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} done your hearts good, girls, to see those poor old faces light up as I showed my scraps, and asked if the work would be ready by Christmas. Grammer fairly swam in the gay colors I strewed over her bed, and enjoyed them like a child, while Almiry tried to be grim, but had to give it up, as she began at once to cut aprons, and dropped tears all over the muslin when <b>her</b> <b>back</b> was turned <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I didn't know a washed-out old maid could be so pathetic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{now what}} do you intend to do?" [...] she asked. [...] "Find him in New Orleans, if you can, of course. But how?" [...] She rose quickly, went to the fireplace, and stood for a moment with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Suddenly she turned. [...] "It ought not to be difficult, after all. Auguste de St. Gre is a fool, and he {{confirms}} what you say of the expedition. He is, indeed, a pretty person to choose for an intrigue of this kind. And your cousin,--what shall we call him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go-be-off-with-you!" [...] {{he shouted}} {{at me as}} if I was deaf. [...] "Her eyes! her eyes! While you stop chatterboxing here, her eyes are in danger. What with her frettings and her cryings and her damn-nonsense-lofe-business, I swear you my solemn oath her sight was in danger when I saw her a whole {{fortnight}} gone-by. Do you want my big pillow to fly bang at your head? You don't want him? Be-off-away with you then, or you will have him in one-two-three time! Be-off-away--and bring <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before night!" ...|$|E
60|$|I let her go--I wished not {{to frighten}} her--and I {{contented}} myself with remarking that Miss Bordereau {{would not have}} locked up such a glorious possession as that--a thing a person {{would be proud of}} and hang up in a prominent place on the parlor wall. Therefore of course she had not any portrait. Miss Tita made no direct answer to this and, candle in hand, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> ascended two or three stairs. Then she stopped short and turned round, looking at me across the dusky space.|$|E
5000|$|As Hahn {{recounted in}} her book China <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> (1944), {{she was forced to}} give Japanese {{officials}} English lessons in return for food, and once slapped the Japanese Chief of Intelligence in the face. He came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> the day before she was repatriated in 1943 and slapped <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> [...] China <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> was an instant hit with the public. According to Roger Angell of The New Yorker, Hahn [...] "was, in truth, something rare: a woman deeply, almost domestically, at home in the world. Driven by curiosity and energy, she went there and did that, and then wrote about it without fuss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] he interrupted. [...] "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} it all over every day since. You know yourself what the Ingelow determination is. It's a good thing in a good cause but a bad thing in a bad one. And it is no easy thing to conquer when you've let it rule you for years as I have done. But I have conquered it, or you have conquered it for me. Child, here is a letter. It is to your mother--my sister Elizabeth. In it I have asked her <b>to</b> forgive <b>me,</b> and <b>to</b> forget our long estrangement. I have asked <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with you and her boys. I want you all--all--at Greenwood and I will do the best I can for you all." ...|$|R
60|$|On my {{way back}} a thought struck <b>me,</b> and going <b>to</b> where our mysterious guide stood still as Lot's wife after she {{had been turned into}} a pillar of salt, I offered it to her, hoping that she would unveil her face and drink. Then {{for the first time she}} showed some sign of being human, or so I thought, for it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that she bowed ever so little in {{acknowledgment}} of the courtesy. If so--and I may have been mistaken--this was all, for the next instant she turned <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on <b>me</b> <b>to</b> show that it was declined. So she would not, or for aught I knew, could not drink. Neither would she eat, for when Leo tried her afterwards with food she refused it in like fashion.|$|R
