5|$|Often {{classified}} {{with the}} galagos by early students, the cheirogaleids (<b>dwarf</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs)</b> were placed {{with the other}} lemurs from Gregory's 1915 classification until the early 1970s, when several anthropologists proposed {{that they were more}} closely related to lorisoids, based on morphological data.

5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E
500|$|Though giant mouse lemurs are {{relatively}} small cheirogaleids, they are {{more than three times}} larger than the smallest members of the family, the mouse lemurs.

5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss <b>and</b> conserve energy. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>lemurs</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|R
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive <b>lemurs</b> (Lepilemur) <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations.

40|$|In the wild, snakes {{are known}} to elicit strong antipredator {{responses}} in primates. Primates often mob the snakes, which is also accompanied by loud calls.

Nevertheless, the snake stimuli used here were strong enough for these naïve primates. For ringtail lemurs (Lemur catta), the reactions to uncovering a hidden rubber snake was tested. But the lemurs showed no avoiding reactions. A question for further research is whether the different results for lemurs were not caused by different experimental procedure.

500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{classification}} of lemurs above the genus level has seen many changes. Early taxonomists proposed a variety of classifications for lemurs, but generally separated indriids from other lemurs and placed the aye-aye in a major group of its own; some classified the <b>dwarf</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> with the galagos.

500|$|Like other cheirogaleids, {{the dental}} formula for giant mouse lemurs is {{on each side}} of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars—a total of 36teeth.

The first upper premolar (P2) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P3). Unlike mouse lemurs and more like dwarf lemurs, giant mouse lemurs have a prominent anterior lower premolar (P2). Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M1–2) have a more anterior hypocone that sits opposite the metacone, compared to the mouse lemurs' more posterior hypocone, which is presumably a symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait. Also on M1 and M2, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small cuspules.

40|$|Sensory specializations, {{particularly}} in the visual system, have been crucial factors {{in the evolution of}} brain and behavior in primates (Allman, 2000). The entire output of the retina is channeled through the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve connecting the eye and brain. We have mapped the density of retinal ganglion cells in flattened retinal whole mounts in the dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius, and the Philippine tarsier, Tarsius syrichta. Figure 1 illustrates these maps, which reveal that the ganglion cell density is much lower throughout the retina in dwarf lemur than in the tarsier.

40|$|We studied phylogenetic {{relationships}} of 39 primate species using sequences of the ε-globin gene. For 13 species, we also included flanking sequences 5 ′ of this locus.

However, analysis of the 5 ′ flanking sequences did not support grouping the atelines with Callicebus and the pitheciins. Our data support the classification of platyrrhines into three families, Cebidae (consisting of Cebus, Saimiri, Aotus, and the callitrichines; Atelidae—the atelines; and Pitheciidae —Callicebus and the pithiciins.

40|$|AimSmall {{body size}} in Madagascar's <b>dwarf</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Cheirogaleidae) is {{generally}} viewed as primitive. We investigated {{the evolution of}} body size in this family and in its sister-taxon, the Lepilemuridae, from phylogenetic, ontogenetic and adaptive perspectives. LocationMadagascar. MethodsWe used a phylogenetic method to reconstruct the evolution of body size in lemurs, and allometric regression models of gestation periods and static and growth allometries in Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae {{to test the hypothesis}} that dwarfing occurred as a result of truncated ontogeny (progenesis). We also examined adaptive hypotheses relating body size to environmental variability, life history, seasonality of reproduction, hypothermy (use of torpor), and a diet rich in plant exudates. ResultsOur results indicated that cheirogaleids experienced at least four independent events of body size reduction from an ancestor as large as living Lepilemuridae, by means of progenesis. Our interpretation is supported by the paedomorphic appearance and parallel ontogenetic trajectories of the dwarf taxa, as well as their very short gestation periods and increased fecundity. Lepilemur species that occupy more predictable environments are significantly larger than those occupying unpredictable habitats. Main conclusionsCheirogaleidae appear to be paedomorphic dwarfs, a consequence of progenesis, probably as an adaptation to high environmental unpredictability. Although the capacity to use hypothermy is related to small body size, this advantage is unlikely to have driven dwarfing in cheirogaleids. We propose that gummmivory/exudativory co-evolved with body size reduction in this clade, probably from a folivorous ancestor. Their small size is derived, and their suitability as models for the ancestral primate' is therefore dubious...|$|E

Other species, such as fork-marked lemurs and needle-clawed bushbabies, specialize on tree gum, while indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs are folivores.
