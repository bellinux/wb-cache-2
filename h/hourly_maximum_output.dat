40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{influences of}} a pre-load and vibration amplitude on driving {{performance of a}} surface acoustic wave (SAW) linear motor, and proposes a simulation model for the SAW linear mo-tor. In experimental results, <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> force and <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> power of the SAW linear motor depended on it’s pre-load. Optimum pre-loads for the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> force and for the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> power were both linear functions of the SAW linear motor’s vibration amplitude. No-load velocity of the SAW linear motor, however, decreased linearly with in-creasing pre-load. A new simulation model to explain these phenomena is proposed. There is a good agree-ment between the experimental and simulation results. I...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{amplification}} {{options for}} patients with mixed hearing loss. Devices tested include percutaneous and transcutaneous bone conductors (BCDs) and middle ear implants with their actuator directly coupled to the cochlea. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. METHOD AND PARTICIPANTS: <b>Maximum</b> <b>output</b> was studied with simulators. As simulators are lacking for the middle ear implants (the Vibrant Soundbridge [VSB] and the Cochlear's Direct Acoustic Cochlear Stimulator [Codacs]), the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> had to be measured in patients (4 and 5 patients, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> averaged at 0. 5, 1, and 2 kHz was the main outcome measure, which was expressed in dB HL, using appropriate transformation tables. RESULTS: The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> was the highest for the Codacs device and was above the patients' uncomfortable loudness levels. The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> of the VSB varied between 65 and 85 dB HL, and that of percutaneous BCD varied between 68 and 80 dB HL {{depending on the type}} of device. The transcutaneous BCD, the Sophono device, had the lowest output. CONCLUSION: Only with the Codacs device can the complete dynamic range be used. The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> of the VSB is lower and variable owing to the coupling to the cochlea. For patients with a sensorineural hearing loss component up to 50 dB HL, a percutaneous BCD forms a good treatment option that is completely independent of the middle ear status. The transcutaneous Sophono BCD is suitable {{for patients with}} a (sub-) normal sensorineural hearing loss component of 20 dB or less...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that random quantum {{channels}} exhibit significant violations of multiplicativity of <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> p-norms for any p> 1. In this work, we show that a weaker variant of multiplicativity nevertheless holds for these channels. For any constant p> 1, given a random quantum channel N (i. e. a channel whose Stinespring representation corresponds to a random subspace S), we show that with high probability the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> p-norm of N ⊗n decays exponentially with n. The proof is based on relaxing the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> ∞-norm of N to the operator norm of the partial transpose of the projector onto S, then calculating upper bounds on this quantity using ideas from random matrix theory. ...|$|R
