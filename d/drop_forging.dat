25|$|Press forging {{can be used}} {{to perform}} all types of forging, {{including}} open-die and impression-die forging. Impression-die press forging usually requires less draft than <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> and has better dimensional accuracy. Also, press forgings can often be done in one closing of the dies, allowing for easy automation.|$|E
25|$|The {{cycle and}} motor {{manufacturing}} industries brought into existence {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary trades. Most notably these were general engineering, metal casting, <b>drop</b> <b>forging,</b> chain-making and the manufacture of instruments and gauges, machine tools, and all types of electrical equipment. The manufacture of aircraft, aero engines and related equipment also took place in Coventry as early as 1916, and during World War II the aircraft industry dwarfed all other local industries. With the outbreak of war many of the motor firms switched to aircraft work, and the whole of Coventry's industrial skills and resources turned to war production of one sort or another.|$|E
25|$|Materials : Early {{windlasses}} were individually hand forged from {{a single}} piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their windlasses 'silvered' (or chrome plated) for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. Windlasses are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and rustproof surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a single eye, but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>Forged</b> - a {{piece of}} red-hot iron or steel placed within an {{impression}} and then struck with the matching impression mounted on a heavy top hammer or ram. Typically the work piece is struck through successive impressions to squeeze the material to finished shape. Adjustable wrenches are <b>drop</b> <b>forged.</b> Nice detailing like on a cast iron piece, but not brittle. Makes a good strong tool, heavy gear, or cam shaft.|$|R

25|$|Production forging {{involves}} significant {{capital expenditure}} for machinery, tooling, facilities and personnel. In {{the case of}} hot forging, a high-temperature furnace (sometimes {{referred to as the}} forge) is required to heat ingots or billets. Owing {{to the size of the}} massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce, as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal, a special building is frequently required to house the operation. In the case of <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> operations, provisions must be made to absorb the shock and vibration generated by the hammer. Most forging operations use metal-forming dies, which must be precisely machined and carefully heat-treated to correctly shape the workpiece, as well as to withstand the tremendous forces involved.|$|E
500|$|In 1920 Charles Churchill & Co {{participated in}} a machine tool {{exhibition}} at the Olympia exhibition centre in London between 4 and 25 September involving many manufacturers and agents. A tabulated list published at the time showed the company's stationary exhibits comprised machines for boring and drilling, centring, planing, shaping, <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> and gear hobbing, as well as upright, radial and sensitive drills, furnaces, centre and precision lathes, [...] "tool/cutter grinders" [...] and twist-drill machinery. In addition, it exhibited running examples of boring and turning mills, machines for broaching, gear cutting, thread milling, horizontal plain milling, universal milling and vertical milling, along with internal, surface and [...] "cylinder/plain/universal" [...] grinders, automatic and [...] "capstan/turret" [...] lathes. There are many notices before and subsequent to this of the company's participation in exhibitions reported in American Machinist.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>forging</b> is a forging {{process where}} a hammer is raised and then [...] "dropped" [...] onto the {{workpiece}} to deform it {{according to the}} shape of the die. There are two types of drop forging: open-die <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> and closed-die <b>drop</b> <b>forging.</b> As the names imply, the difference is {{in the shape of the}} die, with the former not fully enclosing the workpiece, while the latter does.|$|E

50|$|The {{materials}} that are used most commonly in <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> are aluminum, copper, nickel, mild steel, stainless steel, and magnesium. Mild steel is the best choice, and magnesium generally performs poorly as a <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> material.|$|E

50|$|Fuller {{was born}} in Grafton, Massachusetts in 1862. He had one younger sister. His father was a Civil War veteran, who after the war found work in a shoe-making factory. Service in the war caused Fuller's father to suffer lifelong health problems, issues that {{eventually}} lead to his death in 1880. George Fuller was only eighteen years old. In the years after his father's death, Fuller assumed financial responsibility for his sister and widowed mother. Though he had the aptitude and desire to go to college, he put the idea aside {{in an effort to}} support his family. He took a job at the Worcester <b>Drop</b> <b>Forge</b> Works where he worked as an accountant. The Worcester <b>Drop</b> <b>Forge</b> Works would soon become the Wyman-Gordon Company, which became a leading manufacturer of bicycle parts, railroad couplers, copper wire, and automobile and aircraft parts. It would be in Wyman-Gordon Company that George Fuller would make his name.|$|R
