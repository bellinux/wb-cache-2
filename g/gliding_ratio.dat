40|$|Abstract: An {{inflatable}} cell model of paragrlider’s wing canopy {{has been investigated}} in wind tunnel experiments, {{which is designed to}} represent the dynamic behaviors of each cell comprising the canopy. Effects of air-intake of paraglider canopy have also been investigated in this study. The improvement of the shape of air intake and pressure distribution from the standpoints of aerodynamics will contribute to raise flexible wing <b>gliding</b> <b>ratio</b> and safety. To perform the experiment, flexible wing canopy cell model and simplified rigid air intake model had been prepared. Cross-sectional wing profiles and internal surface pressures of the cell model are measured at different angle of attack and Reynolds number, to understand the formation characteristic of paraglider wing canopy model. The cell model is fully inflated at greater than a few degrees angle of attack. In order to understand the lift and drag behaviors, external pressure distributions of the cell model are measured...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary spastic {{paraplegia}} (HSP) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} caused by motoneuron degeneration. It is linked to at least 30 loci, among them SPG 10, which causes dominant forms and originates in point mutations in the neuronal Kinesin- 1 gene (KIF 5 A). Here, we investigate the motility of KIF 5 A and four HSP mutants. All mutations are single amino-acid exchanges and located in kinesin’s motor or neck domain. The mutation in the neck (A 361 V) did not change the gliding properties in vitro, the others either reduced microtubule affinity or gliding velocity or both. In laser-trapping assays, none of the mutants moved {{more than a few}} steps along microtubules. Motility assays with mixtures of homodimeric wild-type, homodimeric mutant and heterodimeric wild-type/mutant motors revealed that only one mutant (N 256 S) reduces the <b>gliding</b> velocity at <b>ratios</b> present in heterozygous patients, whereas the others (K 253 N, R 280 C) do not. Attached to quantum dots as artificial cargo, mixtures involving N 256 S mutants produced slower cargo populations lagging behind in transport, whereas mixtures with the other mutants led to populations of quantum dots that rarely bound to microtubules. These differences indicate that the dominant inheritance of SPG 10 is caused by two different mechanisms that both reduce the gross cargo flux, leading to deficient supply of the synapse...|$|R
