The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the ability of a newly developed wheat grazing model to predict fall-winter forage and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield as well as daily weight gains of steer (Bos taurus) grazing on wheat pasture in Oklahoma. Experimental data of three independent field studies were used. The first was a variety trial in which fall-winter forage and grain yields were harvested. The second was a planting date experiment in which forage in the fall-winter period and grain yields were harvested. The third was a steer <b>grazing</b> <b>experiment</b> in which standing wheat biomass and steer weight gain were monitored. For the variety trials, the model efficiency (ME), which reflects how well model predictions match measured data (1 means a perfect match), was 0. 102 for fall-winter forage prediction and 0. 367 for grain yield. For the planting date experiment, the ME was 0. 615 for predicting fall-winter forage yields and 0. 409 for grain yields when a root downward extension rate of 20 mm d- 1 was used.

Clovers were sown in December 1996 and ryegrass in March 1997 into the pure clover swards. Lamb liveweight gains were similar in year 2 (1130 kg/ha/yr), but in year 3, gains were greater on pastures sown with caucasian than on those sown with white clover (1290 vs. 1110 kg/ ha/yr).

This paper describes an alternative method for evaluation of bacterial grazing rate by meiofauna and macrofauna using bacteria pre-enriched with stable isotopes.

Cultured bacteria contained 2. 9 % of 15 N and were enriched sufficiently {{to be used as}} tracers during <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments.</b> Cultured bacteria presented a biovolume (0. 21 μm 3) and a percentage of actively respiring bacteria (10 %) similar to those found in natural communities.

Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, have been employed to help to restore shallow lakes in the Netherlands, dominated by cyanobacteria, to their former clear state. Zebra mussels have been present in these lakes since they were created in the 19 th century by the excavation of peat and are usually {{not considered to be}} an invasive species. Most <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> using Dreissena have been performed with uni-cellular phytoplankton laboratory strains and information on grazing of larger phytoplankton taxa hardly exists. To gain more insight in to whether D. polymorpha is indeed able to decrease cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton, we therefore performed <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> with zebra mussels and two species of cyanobacteria, that greatly differ in shape: colony forming strains of Microcystis aeruginosa and the filamentous species Planktothrix agardhii. For both species a toxic and a non-toxic strain was selected. We found that zebra mussels cleared toxic Planktothrix at a higher rate than non-toxic Planktothrix, toxic or non-toxic Microcystis. Clearance rates between the other strains were not significantly different. Both phytoplankton species, regardless of toxicity, size and shape, were found in equal amounts (based on chlorophyll concentrations) in the excreted products of the mussels (pseudofaeces). The results show that zebra mussels are capable of removing colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria from the water, regardless of whether the cyanobacteria are toxic or not. This implies that the mussels may be used as a biofilter for the removal of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in shallow (Dutch) lakes where the mussels are already present and not a nuisance. Providing more suitable substrate for zebra mussel attachment may lead to appropriate mussel densities capable of filtering large quantities of cyanobacteria. ...|$|R

Laboratory experiments using two clones of C. polylepis were conducted in a comparative approach. The clones were similar in size and shape, but differed in their toxicity, as demonstrated by the Artemia bioassay. To study the effects of toxic C. polylepis on protozooplankton grazers, <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> were performed with the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina Dujardin as grazer. A first experiment was carried out in order to follow batch culture growth and initial grazing of O. marina when fed toxic or non-toxic clones of C. polylepis. Ingestion of the toxic clone was 27 % of ingestion when fed with the non-toxic clone. When O. marina was fed with the toxic clone, vacuoles within O. marina cells contained fewer food particles and the cells grew slower (58 % of the division rate estimated for the non-toxic clone). A second experiment was conducted to determine the grazing and growth response of O. marina as a function of algal food concentration. Profound differences in ingestion, clearance, division, and gross growth efficiency of O. marina when fed the two clones of C. polylepis were again apparent. the toxin acts as a grazers deterrent, even at algal concentrations of 400 x 103 ml- 1, O. marina was not killed by the presence or ingestion of toxic C. polylepis.

40|$|Semi {{natural grasslands}} {{are among the}} most species rich and {{endangered}} ecosystems in Central Europe. Most of the Central European grasslands are man made. Since the middle of the last century semi natural grasslands have been becoming threatened when intensification of agricultural practice increased. They have been fertilized, afforested or abandoned. The maintenance of remaining semi natural grasslands by management is one main task in European nature conservation. Traditional management methods (e. g. mowing, mulching) encounter their logistical and financial limits and grazing represent possible economically and ecologically viable alternatives for the conservation of open areas. There are very insufficient scientific studies about the comparison of different grazers and studies about grazing occur mostly over a relatively short time period (often three years). Therefore, the present study focused on scientific monitoring and comparability of long term <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> in Nature Conservation. Chapter 2 dealt with the grazing effects of large herbivores on a pre alpine Pine forest. In the Nature Reserve “Stadtwald Augsburg” year round grazing with Przewalski horses and red deer should maintain these Pine forests. The vegetation development of both types of grazing and the difference between the grazers were on focus. Vegetation composition of some sites in the Przewalski enclosure developed towards vegetation composition of open land. In the red deer enclosure the decline of shrub layer was greater than in the Przewalski enclosure. The decline of grass layer was greater in the Przewalski enclosure than in the red deer enclosure. These results can also be seen in the development of selected plant species. Vegetation structure after eight years in the Przewalski enclosure was closer to the desired target than in the red deer enclosure. Chapter 3 focused on the vegetation development in the “Semi open Pasture Landscape Höltigbaum” after twelve years of grazing management. Vegetation development after five years of grazing and after twelve years of grazing was compared. Analyses were conducted with particular attention to the influence of grazing on different habitat parameters and structural diversity. There were little changes in vegetation composition of poor grassland. Some sites developed towards poor grassland and on few sites succession advanced. In {{the first five years of}} grazing species number had been increasing followed by a decrease of species number. The development of habitat parameters showed an adaptation to grazing and confirmed the results of the multivariate analysis. These positive effects could already be determined after five years of grazing. The mixed grazing with cattle and sheep seems to be an ideal management tool for the maintenance of semi natural landscape. The year round grazing maintained and favoured structural diversity and the conservation of temporarily open and species rich grasslands, dry grasslands and heathland was successful. In chapter 4 a comparative analysis of six long term <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> in Germany was performed. By comparing long term <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> with a trait based approach general patterns of grassland development due to grazing should be worked out. The change of plant functional traits in relative importance over time was taken into account as well. The functional approach was chosen because study areas differ in their abiotic conditions and occurring plant species. A comprehensive vegetation dataset of six different long term <b>grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> was used to identify common trends. The analysis showed that the development of traits was convergent on single grazed sites for almost all sites and divergent on mixed grazed sites. On single grazed sites proportions of following trait attributes increased: short term persistent seedbank, clonal growth, preference eaten, moderately grazing tolerant, moderately trampling tolerant, canopy height < 0. 3 m. It is important to ensure equal or quite similar grazing systems. Then the functional approach is well suited for comparing grazed areas with various habitat types and different grazing animals. If areas have been coincidently grazed by two different species, the functional traits tend to deviating developments. Finally, in Chapter 5 the results of the previous chapters were reviewed and concluding remarks were given...|$|R

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy of transgenic corn hybrids for residue <b>grazing.</b> In <b>Experiment</b> 1 two irrigated corn fields were used after grain harvest, one Roundup Ready® and it’s non-transgenic control line to evaluate <b>grazing</b> performance. This <b>experiment</b> was terminated after 35 days due to excessive snow cover. There {{was no significant difference}} in performance in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 was conducted the following year using dryland corn. In Experiment 2 corn root worm protected variety (Bt), Roundup Ready®, and their non-transgenic control line were evaluated. No differences in animal performance were observed between either genetically enhanced hybrid and their non-transgenic control...|$|R
40|$|<b>Grazing</b> <b>experiments</b> were {{performed}} with the zooplankters Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna feeding on nitrogen- and phosphorus-limited cells of two green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Selenastrum capricornutum). To analyze {{the role of the}} cell wall structure in digestibility of the algae by Daphnia, the same experiments were carried out with both wild-type C. reinhardtii and a cell wall-deficient mutant. The nonlimited algae were efficiently assimilated, whereas P- and N-limited algal cells were not. Especially P-limited cells passed mostly intact and viable through the gut and were thus spared from heavy grazing pressure. In life-history <b>experiments,</b> D. pulex <b>grazing</b> on nonlimited algae reached the largest body size, whereas animals fed N- or P-limited algae exhibited reduced growth.
