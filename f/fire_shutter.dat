50|$|It was Saturday night, and the cabaret {{was filled}} to capacity, {{as it was}} one of the most popular night spots in Osaka. There were {{partitions}} in the fire exits, but they did not work. Notification to the fire station was delayed by 13 minutes. The <b>fire</b> <b>shutter,</b> which was not automatic, did not work. Multiple factors were responsible for the loss of life, including the design of the building itself, which had previously been a Kabuki theater. There was no fire sprinkler system. The existence of various different types of enterprises within one building was also a problem. The regulations and laws at the time of the construction of buildings collectively allowed these faults to occur.|$|E

40|$|A large {{building}} space {{would be}} compartmented with fire resistant structures to inhibit {{the spread of}} fire. Compartment walls with fire resistance level specified in building regulations serve for this purpose. An opening in a compartment wall for communication between adjoining compartments would be protected by a <b>fire</b> <b>shutter</b> with a fire resistance level {{equal to that of}} the wall in terms of integrity. In a fire emergency, this opening will not be available to building occupants for evacuation and a fire exit door close to the opening is arranged in many local shopping malls. The fire shutters would be heated to an elevated temperature, when subjected to a building fire and emit thermal radiation to any adjacent compartment. An evacuee using the adjacent exit door close to the heated shutter would receive a thermal radiant heat flux and would cause skin injury. This creates problems for evacuation in a fire emergency. This paper surveys the typical <b>fire</b> <b>shutter</b> installations in 14 shopping malls and 47 installations close to exit doors are reported upon. Typical configurations for the shutter-exit door set are identified. The thermal radiant heat flux from these shutters was determined, in order to predict and recommend a safe distance between the fire shutters and individuals standing at a distance where they would be free from skin injury. The implications are that in typical applications, the <b>fire</b> <b>shutter</b> should be properly located at a safe distance from the building exits. The minimum distance between a <b>fire</b> <b>shutter</b> and nearby exits is thus recommended for typical installations. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|In Japan, metal <b>fire</b> <b>shutters</b> {{are used}} {{in all kinds of}} {{buildings}} as fire partition. However, in large spaces with high ceilings and long spans, it has been impossible to use metal <b>fire</b> <b>shutters</b> because of the size of their housings and their heavy weight. A system of fire-resistant screens chat can be used to form fire partitions has been developed to meet this need. The performance of this system is equal to that of conventional metal <b>fire</b> <b>shutters.</b> This paper describes experiments and simulations which confirm the system's fire resistance and motional performance. It also describes how this system is applied to a multipurpose gymnasium. ~lRODUCTION It has been impossible to compartmentalize a large space with metal <b>fire</b> <b>shutters</b> or metal <b>fire</b> doors in case of fire up to now because of the size of their housings and their heavy weight. Therefore, alternative measures were taken, {{such as the use of}} big water guns, to extinguish fires at an early stage or small areas within a large space to contain smoke and fire, Now, we have developed a fire-resistant screen system, to solve such problems. This system can prevent fire from spreading in a large space, and also enables an open plan without the need for guide studs for <b>fire</b> <b>shutters.</b> This paper outlines this fire-resistant screen system, its fire resistance, and its motional performance. It also introduces an example of a multipurpose gymnasium in which the system was first realized...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fire shutters {{as a component}} in the fire safety design of a large building is examined {{from the perspective of}} a "minimum escaped velocity (MEV) " by the occupant in order not to experience pain from the exposure to the shutter's thermal radiation. Using typical fire shutter's geometry determined from a survey of 14 large shopping malls in Hong Kong and the shutter's temperature reported in the literature, the range of MEV and its dependence on shutter's parameters are determined. Shutter's geometry and the occupant's initial location relative to the shutter are shown to be important factors affecting the required MEV for safety. For a particular compartment's geometry, a "safe escape (SE) " region can be identified as a function of the <b>fire</b> <b>shutter</b> size, escape door's location, and the expected walking speed of an occupant. The size of the SE region can be used as a quantitative design criterion for the design of a fire safety system involving the <b>fire</b> <b>shutter.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Protected lobbies may be stipulated by fire {{codes to}} protect {{openings}} in compartment walls. Such lobbies will {{in some cases}} impair the communication between different parts in a building. In the circumstances, the use of fire shutters may be considered. However, fire shutters available in Hong Kong's market can only provide resistance to fire in terms of integrity. As heat flux can be transmitted by radiation, such fire shutters cannot {{be regarded as a}} like-to-like substitution to protected lobbies. This paper is to demonstrate that a double <b>fire</b> <b>shutter</b> system can be an appropriate alternative means of protection to the openings against the spread of flame and heat in stead of using lobby. The effectiveness of the double shutter system will depend on the separation between the shutters and the emissivity of the shutters.

40|$|Performance-based {{design is}} {{commonly}} applied to projects that have difficulties in complying with prescriptive fire codes in the Far East. There are procedures for evaluating fire resisting construction and structural elements with fire resistance ratings {{lower than the}} values specified in the fire codes. The equal temperature-time exposure concept or t -equivalent rule is commonly applied to support the argument. This paper will discuss whether installing two <b>fire</b> <b>shutters</b> each of a 2 -hour fire resistance period is equivalent to one 4 -hour shutter. The standard temperature-time curve under ASTM E 119 was applied to show they are not equivalent and to illustrate the inadequacy. Further, there are concerns in applying such an approach for bigger fires as the radiative heat flux acting on the construction element is not included. Fire hazard assessment on fire resisting construction with lower ratings under postflashover fires should be evaluated with caution. Full-scale burning tests with bigger fires are suggested {{as a means to}} support the argument or demonstrate that the equal temperature-time concept would work as expected.

5000|$|The M7 {{introduced}} auto-exposure in {{aperture priority}} mode: the user sets the aperture on the lens manually, {{and the camera}} chooses a shutter speed. Manual exposure is also available. The shutter is electronically controlled, but speeds of 1/60th and 1/125th of a second are mechanically governed if the battery fails. Like the M6 TTL, the M7 features an [...] "off" [...] position on the shutter speed dial. The shutter release is redesigned with two distinct levels of pressure: the first detent locks the exposure reading, the second <b>fires</b> the <b>shutter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Later {{versions}} (designated [...] "E") incorporated {{an additional}} safety mechanism: an internal [...] "shutter", also activated by {{rotation of the}} shell after firing, which closed the channel between the striker in the nose and the powder magazine in the base until it was clear of the gun which fired it. On <b>firing,</b> the <b>shutter</b> resisted acceleration ("setback") and the accelerating shell body pushed against it, preventing the shutter from moving. When acceleration ceased shortly after the shell left the gun barrel, the shutter ceased to [...] "set back" [...] and was free to spin outwards, activating the fuze.|$|R

5000|$|Events {{have passed}} until Hasumi's {{homeroom}} students are staying {{overnight in the}} school, preparing an elaborate haunted house for the school cultural festival. Hasumi lures Miya to the rooftop, knocking her out and throwing her off the roof to fake her suicide; as she had grown suspicious of Tadenuma's disappearance. When another student comes to the roof looking for Miya, she finds the suicide note forged by Hasumi; he quickly kills her too. As Hasumi has no method of masking his murder of the second student, he quickly {{comes up with a}} plan. Hasumi to start a school massacre against his students for which he will frame Kume, who frequents a shooting range, by wearing his shoes throughout the killings. Throughout the massacre, Hasumi's shotgun can be seen possessed by ex-partner in crime Dave, talking to him. As the students hear the bangs of the shotgun, Hasumi tricks most of the students by using the intercom to warn them of [...] "an intruder with a shotgun" [...] and orders the students to proceed to the roof - which he had locked access to beforehand - and wait until help arrives. With some of the students proceeding to the stairs to the roof, another group hide inside the art room, closing it off with <b>fire</b> <b>shutters</b> and barricading the entry points. One of the students, skilled archer Kakeru, manages to escape the school far enough with his archery gear to find a man who is able to call the police. He later runs back to the school to rescue his crush Satomi, who is found trying to escape by roping out of a window of the art room and slips, breaking her ankles. Kakeru screams out her name, alerting Hasumi to their presence, who then proceeds to aim out of a window at the two students. The Kakeru readies an arrow and fires at Hasumi, but Hasumi fires as well, deflecting the arrow off-course, slaying Kakeru, and then Satomi. With the group of students still in the art room thinking they are safe, they are unaware that they did not untie the rope that Satomi had used to rappel down out of. Hasumi climbs the rope and proceeds to slay the group.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} construction, focal plane shutters, as used on most SLRs, only allow normal xenon flash units {{to be used}} at shutter speeds slow enough that the entire shutter is open at once, {{typically}} at shutter speeds of 1/60 or slower, although some modern cameras may have an X-sync speed as high as 1/500 (e.g. Nikon's D40 DSLRs). Special electronic flash units for focal-plane <b>shutters</b> <b>fire</b> several times as the slit moves across the film.

5000|$|The Leaf shutter or more {{precisely}} the in-lens shutter is a shutter contained within the lens structure, often close to the diaphragm consisting {{of a number of}} metal leaves which are maintained under spring tension and which are opened and then closed when the shutter is released. The exposure time is determined by the interval between opening and closing. In this shutter design, the whole film frame is exposed at one time. This makes flash synchronisation much simpler as the flash only needs to <b>fire</b> once the <b>shutter</b> is fully open. Disadvantages of such shutters are their inability to reliably produce very fast shutter speeds ( [...] faster than 1/500th second or so) and the additional cost and weight of having to include a shutter mechanism for every lens.|$|R
