40|$|We {{report a}} novel pattern in species richness, {{complementary}} to the well-known species-area relationship. We show that, as sample area increases, {{the variation in}} relative richness decreases among otherwise comparable spatial units. This pattern holds for southern African birds, French birds, Cape Proteaceae and the trees of Barro Colorado Island. We propose a scale-free method for quantifying this pattern by measuring the multifractal intensity of species richness, which is the multi-scale tendency of adjacent patches with the same area to differ in richness. By this measure, spatial variability is strongest for Cape Proteaceae and weakest for Barro Colorado Island trees. Our results have implications for area-dependent estimates of species-richness, for example in reserve planning and in simulation-based studies. They imply that such estimates are most accurate for large areas, and {{will be subject to}} substantial uncertainty when the multifractal intensity is high and the area is small.

40|$|Productivity of grey rhebok and {{mountain}} reedbuck was studied at Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve (eastern Free State) between September 1999 and May 2002. Within a study area of 550 ha, all herds of grey rhebok and all territorial male mountain reedbuck were identified, and general population dynamics were monitored. Lambs of both species were born seasonally between September and February, while most deaths occurred between June and November. Population levels {{appeared to be}} controlled in both species mainly by the eviction of young males, but the effects of extreme weather conditions were significant, being demonstrated by the deaths of 27 % and 51 % of the grey rhebok {{and mountain}} reedbuck populations respectively during heavy snow in September 2001. Disease and predation played no role in population control. Grey rhebok formed stable harem herds with home ranges varying between 23 ha and 104 ha (95 % MCP), {{with an average of}} 57. 9 ha. Home ranges in areas with extensive steep slopes tended to be smaller than those in flatter areas. The <b>ecological</b> <b>density</b> was 1 / 15. 7 ha. Territorial male mountain reedbuck were often solitary, and only accompanied by females when these moved into their territories. Home ranges of males varied between 7 ha and 21 ha (95 % MCP), with an average of 14. 8 ha, and all had areas of steep slopes within. Females showed strong preference for steep slopes and used much greater areas than males. The <b>ecological</b> <b>density</b> was 1 / 8. 7 ha. Grey rhebok rested less than mountain reedbuck, but did not feed for longer. Grey rhebok were active intermittently all day and night, but tended to be more active in the early morning and late afternoon than {{in the middle of the}} day. During the day, mountain reedbuck were most active in the late afternoon, rested for longer periods in the middle of the day, but were also very active at night. Body condition was investigated seasonally in mountain reedbuck at Sterkfontein and also Tussen die Riviere Nature Reserve. Kidney fat indices and leg fat percentages were lowest at the end of winter before the rains started and when the nutritive value of the veld was at its lowest. Endoparasites were investigated in both antelope species, but primarily in mountain reedbuck. Seventeen species of helminths, including fifteen nematodes, one trematode, and one cestode were recovered from mountain reedbuck at Sterkfontein and TdR.

This body of research, however, primarily concentrated on how political processes shape the population dynamics, especially competitive and (de) legitimating relations between organizational forms. Though {{some of the ways}} in which population level processes moderate political processes have been recognized, these ideas have remained untested. This study is an attempt to extend research on political influences and population dynamics by examining whether organizational infrastructure, construed as a density dependent subpopulation level process, moderates the impact of particular changes in the political environment, namely changes in the legal framework and political turmoil, on the rate of organizational founding. The analyses were carried out using event history methods and data on all unions that were founded in İstanbul and Ankara, two major centers of unionism in Turkey, during the 1947 - 1980 period. The local character of most unions founded in İstanbul and Ankara during the period and regulation that stipulated industry-based organization allowed for investigating the infrastructural process, and its interaction with political opportunity, by using <b>ecological</b> (<b>density</b> dependence) models.

40|$|Between 1970 and 1975 Natal Parks Board hel. icopter {{counts of}} {{waterbuck}} (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) in the Umfolozi Game Reserve (UGR) declined from 1 098 to 494. The {{purpose of this}} project was to study the ecology of waterbuck {{with an emphasis on}} population regulating mechanisms, so that the reality and significance of this decline could be assessed. Density estimates for 1976 - 1977 were over twice the 1976 helicopter count of 319, but the population was confirmed to be declining. The <b>ecological</b> <b>density</b> of waterbuck represented 11, 9 per cent of the metabolic biomass of grazers, which compared well with data from other areas. However, the other species' proportionate contributions to biomass were far from optimal, with an excess of short grass feeders. High juvenile mortality (80, 7 per cent), attributable mainly to severe tick (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus) infestations, was the principal cause of the present decline. These severe infestations were probably symptomatic of poor condition of the whole waterbuck population, which meant that the ultimate cause of juvenile mortality lay elsewhere. The hypothesis that the waterbuck population was in a stressed condition was supported by their habitat utilization patterns, their feeding ecology and aspects of their behaviour. The dynamics of interspecific associations suggested that the primary habitat of Waterbuck was that now occupied by nyala (Tragelaphus angasi) and what had been recorded were the results of competition pushing waterbuck into an unfavourable habitat. Feeding studies indicated that nutritious food for herbivores represented a limited resource in UGR during winter, for which waterbuck may be largely outcompeted and that nyala and impala (Aepyceros melampus) were the rnain competitors. Interspecific competition was the probable ultimate cause of the decline of waterbuck in UGR. It was recommended that the numbers of nyala and impala be reduced and that this action be integrated into a more precise management plan for UGR than exists at present.

I located 130 unique owl territories within a 1, 890 km?? study area. I calculated a minimum crude density of 0. 14 owls/km??, and an <b>ecological</b> <b>density</b> of 0. 40 owls/km??. Ninety-five territories {{had at least one}} nest during the six years of study. I mapped cover types in the mountain range using spectral analysis of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery from 1988. I delineated 17 cover types to assess owl habitats. The distribution and density of owls were different among the habitats in which they occurred. Three general habitats occurred in the mountain range: canyon live oak (Ouercus chrysolepis) /big-cone Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa); mixed conifer/hardwood; and mixed conifer. I found 62, 27, and 41 owl territories in each of these habitat types, respectively. The densities of sites in each of the habitats were 0. 43, 0. 20 and 0. 11 sites/km??, respectively. The mean nearest neighbor distance of territory centers was 1, 564 m with a minimum distance of 664 m. The {{spatial distribution of}} observed owl sites was significantly different than expected from a random distribution of sites (X?? = 30. 71, df = 5, P < 0. 001). I used multiple concentric plots (3 ha, 20 ha, 79 ha, 177 ha, 314 ha, and 707 ha) around owl nest sites, owl non-nest sites and random sites to test whether owls selected cover types differently than their availability. Both nesting and non-nesting owls used spatial habitat configurations that were different from that at available sites at 3 ha, 20 ha, 79 ha, 177 ha, 314 ha scales and 3 ha, 20 ha, 79 ha, 177 ha, 314 ha, and 707 ha scales, respectively. However, owl nest sites differed from owl non-nest sites only at the level of 3 ha plots. Fragmentation of suitable habitat was significantly greater at non-nesting owl sites and random sites than it was at nesting owl sites.

40|$|Four {{distinct}} theoretical {{programs have}} examined market entry decisions of multiunit firms, advancing different {{explanations for the}} relationship between a firm's likelihood of entry into a geographical market and the number of rivals that are already present in the target market. Within the strategy literature, theory of strategic interactions explains that firms will want to establish a foothold in markets where their multimarket competitors are scarce, but avoid markets where there are many multimarket competitors. Within economic geography, positive externalities such as increase in demand explain firms' desire to locate close to their rivals whereas negative externalities such as competition explain their desire to avoid them. Within the <b>ecological</b> tradition, <b>density</b> dependence theory explains this relationship in terms of legitimation of an organizational form in a particular market and subsequently increased competition for resources there. Within new institutional theory, the presence of rivals is seen as a signal that a particular market is suitable for entry. Although generally quoted and mentioned in the literature, these four explanations have not been sufficiently separated to indicate whether these four mechanisms all operate simultaneously or whether one of them might account for the often found inverse-U-shaped relationship. Distinguishing firms with different strategies and using various moderators, we test the four explanations jointly and demonstrate their scope of operation...|$|R

Variation in the detection of common taxa resulted in significant differences in apparent faunal density and community composition among investigators. Such bias has the potential to produce spurious ecological interpretations if not appropriately controlled or accounted for. We recommend that photographic studies document the use of multiple annotators and quantify potential inter-investigator bias. Randomisation of the sampling unit (photograph or video clip) is clearly critical to the effective removal of human annotation bias in multiple annotator studies (and indeed single annotator works) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} community {{structure and}} association patterns {{for a small}} population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, inhabiting the Port Stephens embayment in southeastern Australia. Association data for 120 regularly sighted individuals were obtained from seasonal photoidentification surveys collected over 7 years (1998 - 2007). Using a combined cluster and social network analysis approach, we found association patterns between dolphins were hierarchically structured, where two mixed-sex communities were subdivided into smaller, temporarily dynamic social groups. Community membership corresponded to differences in individual ranging patterns and habitat occupation. The larger eastern community inhabits a typically marine environment, while individuals of the western community range over a larger area that is dominated by estuarine processes. Both communities were composed of long-term preferred companions; however, the degree of social cohesion differed considerably between the two communities. Associations between individuals were considerably stronger and temporally more stable in the western community. Western individuals also had significantly fewer preferred associates despite living in similar-sized schools. Finally, in direct contrast to associations within each community, intercommunity associations were highly variable and resulted primarily from aggregative behaviour. We propose the segregation of communities resulted from individual adaptation to local environmental conditions, facilitated by individual variability in association preferences. The disparity in association patterns between communities may have resulted {{from a combination of}} <b>ecological,</b> population <b>density,</b> kinship and anthropogenic factors. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of crowding in a market center on rates of change in organizational niche width and on organizational mortality. It proposes that, although firms with wide niches benefit from risk spreading and economies of scale, they are simultaneously exposed to intense competition. An analysis of organizational dynamics in automobile manufacturing firms in France, Germany, and Great Britain shows that competitive pressure not only increases the hazard of disbanding but also prompts organizational transformations {{that give rise to}} processes of resource partitioning. Emphasizing the content/process distinction in conceptualizing organizational change, the article finds that the process effect of changes in niche width and position increases mortality hazards. We discuss our findings in light of the processes investigated by the <b>ecological</b> theories of <b>density</b> dependence, resource partitioning, and structural inertia, and point to the theoretical links that help to integrate these theories...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We compare lizard assemblages of Cerrado and Amazonian savannas to {{test the}} {{ecological}} release hypothesis, which predicts that niche dimensions and abundance should be greater in species inhabiting isolated habitat patches with low species richness (Amazonian savannas and isolated Cerrado patches) when compared with nonisolated areas in central Cerrado with greater species richness. We calculated microhabitat and diet niche breadths with data from 14 isolated Cerrado patches and Amazon savanna areas and six central Cerrado populations. Morphological data were compared using average Euclid-ean distances, and lizard abundance was estimated using the number of lizards captured in pitfall traps over an extended time period. We {{found no evidence of}} ecological release with respect to microhabitat use, suggesting that historical factors are better microhabitat predictors than ecological factors. However, data from individual stom-achs indicate that ecological release occurs in these areas for one species (Tropidurus) but not others (Ameiva ame-iva, Anolis, Cnemidophorus, and Micrablepharus), suggesting that evolutionary lineages respond differently to environmental pressures, with tropidurids being more affected by ecological factors than polychrotids, teiids, and gymnophthalmids. We found no evidence that ecological release occurs in these areas using morphological data. Based on abundance data, our results indicate that the <b>ecological</b> release (<b>density</b> compensation) hypothesis is not supported: lizard species are not more abundant in isolated areas than in nonisolated areas. The ecology of species is highly conservative, varying little from assemblage to assemblage. Nevertheless, increases in niche breadth for some species indicate that ecological release occurs as well...|$|R
40|$|Little is {{understood}} about how environmental heterogeneity influences the spatial dynamics of sexual selection. Within human-dominated systems, habitat modifi-cation creates environmental heterogeneity that could influence the adaptive value of individual phenotypes. Here, {{we used the}} gray catbird to examine if the ecologi-cal conditions experienced in the suburban matrix (SM) and embedded suburban parks (SP) influence reproductive strategies {{and the strength of}} sexual selection. Our results show that these habitats varied in a key <b>ecological</b> factor, breeding <b>density.</b> Moreover, this <b>ecological</b> factor was closely tied to reproductive strategies such that local breeding density predicted the probability that a nest would contain extra-pair offspring. Partitioning reproductive variance showed that while within-pair success was more important in both habitats, extra-pair success increased the opportunity for sexual selection by 39 % at higher breeding densities. Body size was a strong predictor of relative reproductive success and was under directional selection in both habitats. Importantly, our results show that the strength of sexual selectio...|$|R

We propose that, although firms with wide niches benefit from risk-spreading and economies of scale, they are simultaneously exposed to intense competition.

We apply this reasoning to the analysis of organizational dynamics in the populations of automobile manufacturing firms in France, Germany, and Great Britain. Our results suggest that the decrease in survival chances due to overlap density outweighs the benefits of broad niche for most firms in our populations.
