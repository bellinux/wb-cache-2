Recently, molecular interactions between E. chaffeensis 47 -kDa tandem repeat (TR) protein (TRP 47) and the eukaryotic host cell have been described. In this investigation, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that E. chaffeensis-secreted tandem repeat protein 120 (TRP 120) interacts with {{a diverse group}} of host cell proteins associated with major biological processes, including transcription and regulation, cell signaling, protein trafficking, and actin cytoskeleton organization. Twelve target proteins with the highest frequency of interaction with TRP 120 were confirmed by cotransformation in yeast. <b>Host</b> <b>targets,</b> including human immunoglobulin lambda locus (IGL), cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX 2), Golgi-associated gamma adaptin ear-containing ARF binding protein 1 (GGA 1), polycomb group ring finger 5 (PCGF 5), actin gamma 1 (ACTG 1), and unc- 13 homolog D (UNC 13 D; Caenorhabditis elegans), colocalized strongly with TRP 120 in HeLa cells and with E. chaffeensis dense-cored morulae and areas adjacent to morulae in the host cytoplasm. The TR domain of TRP 120 interacted only with PCGF 5, indicating that distinct TRP 120 domains contribute to specific <b>host</b> <b>target</b> interactions and that multiple domains are required to reconstitute TRP 120 interactions with other <b>host</b> <b>targets.</b> Three previously defined molecular interactions between TRP 47 and host proteins, PCGF 5, IGLL 1, and CAP 1, were also associated with TRP 120, demonstrating that molecular cross talk occurs between Ehrlichia TRPs and <b>host</b> <b>targets.</b> These findings further support the role of TRPs as effectors that reprogram the host cell...|$|R

50|$|Studied R genes usually confer {{specificity}} {{for particular}} strains of a pathogen species (those that express the recognized effector). As first noted by Harold Flor in his mid-20th century {{formulation of the}} gene-for-gene relationship, a plant R gene has specificity for a pathogen avirulence gene (Avr gene). Avirulence genes are now known to encode effectors. The pathogen Avr gene must have matched specificity with the R gene for that R gene to confer resistance, suggesting a receptor/ligand interaction for Avr and R genes. Alternatively, an effector can modify its <b>host</b> cellular <b>target</b> (or a molecular decoy of that target), and the R gene product (NLR protein) activates defenses when it detects the modified form of the <b>host</b> <b>target</b> or decoy.|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{pathogens}} deliver type III effector proteins {{into the}} plant cell during infection. On susceptible (r) hosts, type III effectors {{can contribute to}} virulence. Some trigger the action of specific disease resistance (R) gene products. The activation of R proteins can occur indirectly via modification of a <b>host</b> <b>target.</b> Thus, at least some type III effectors are recognized at site(s) where they may act as virulence factors. These data indicate that a type III effector’s <b>host</b> <b>target</b> might be required for both initiation of R function in resistant plants and pathogen virulence in susceptible plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, RPM 1 -interacting protein 4 (RIN 4) associates with both the Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola 1 (RPM 1) and Resistance to P. syringae 2 (RPS 2) disease resistance proteins. RIN 4 is posttranslationally modified after delivery of the P. syringae type III effectors AvrRpm 1, AvrB, or AvrRpt 2 to plant cells. Thus, RIN 4 may be a target for virulence functions of these type III effectors. We demonstrate that RIN 4 {{is not the only}} <b>host</b> <b>target</b> for AvrRpm 1 and AvrRpt 2 in susceptible plants because its elimination does not diminish their virulence functions. In fact, RIN 4 negatively regulates AvrRpt 2 virulence function. RIN 4 also negatively regulates inappropriate activation of both RPM 1 and RPS 2. Inappropriate activation of RPS 2 is nonspecific disease resistance 1 (NDR 1) independent, in contrast with the established requirement for NDR 1 during AvrRpt 2 -dependent RPS 2 activation. Thus, RIN 4 acts either cooperatively, downstream, or independently of NDR 1 to negatively regulate RPS 2 in the absence of pathogen. We propose that many P. syringae type III effectors hav...|$|R
