50|$|A Büchner funnel is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} equipment used in filtration. It is traditionally made of porcelain, but glass and plastic funnels are also available. On top of the funnel-shaped part there is a cylinder with a fritted glass disc/perforated plate separating it from the funnel. The <b>Hirsch</b> <b>funnel</b> has a similar design; it is used similarly, but for smaller quantities of material. The main difference is that the plate of a <b>Hirsch</b> <b>funnel</b> is much smaller, and the walls of the funnel angle outward instead of being vertical.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hirsch</b> <b>funnels</b> {{are shaped}} much like normal funnels, but contain holes or {{sintered}} glass {{at the base}} for quick filtrations.|$|R
50|$|When {{used with}} filter paper, filter <b>funnels,</b> Buchner and <b>Hirsch</b> <b>funnels</b> {{can be used}} to remove fine {{particles}} from a liquid in a process called filtration. For more demanding applications, the filter paper in the latter two may be replaced with a sintered glass frit.|$|R
