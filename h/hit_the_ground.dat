5|$|Joss {{made his}} major league debut with the Cleveland Bronchos (also {{known as the}} Bluebirds) against the St. Louis Browns. The Browns' Jesse Burkett hit a shallow pop fly in the {{direction}} of right fielder Zaza Harvey. Home plate umpire Bob Caruthers ruled that Harvey did not make a clean catch, so Burkett was credited with a hit. (Harvey and witnesses said the ball never <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.)</b> Joss finished his major league debut with a one-hitter.|$|E
5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before they <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} Polish Horseshoes is {{to knock the}} glass bottle off the stake either by hitting it {{directly}} or by <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> stake. If <b>the</b> disc <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> stake and the bottle is knocked off, then 1 point is scored unless the bottle is caught before it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> If <b>the</b> disc <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> bottle directly and the bottle is knocked off, then 2 points are scored if <b>the</b> bottle <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and only 1 point if the bottle is caught before it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R

50|$|Scoring examples: If a thrower <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> bottle {{directly}} and the defenders fail to catch both {{the bottle and}} the disc, the throwing team earns 3 points, one for <b>the</b> bottle <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> one for <b>the</b> disc <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and one for <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> bottle directly. If the defending team catches both the bottle and the disc, the throwing team only gets the 1 point (for <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> bottle). If <b>the</b> disc <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> stake rather than the bottle, then 1 point is scored for each object that <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> (<b>the</b> bottle and/or the disc). If the defending team catches both, then no points are scored. If the bottle is not dislodged, but the receiving team fails to catch the disc, the throwing team gets 1 point.|$|R
5|$|The girl can {{stabilize}} wobbling dishes {{by pressing}} {{the button on}} the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears {{at the top of}} the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 {{operating}} as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused {{a fire in}} engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew {{lost control of the}} aircraft. The unmanageable plane, at a speed of 275 knots, <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at a dairy farm and burned. All passengers and crew, as well as a dairyman on the ground, died.|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him.

5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground),</b> Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Rashad Carmichael intercepted a pass by Jonathan Crompton {{leading to a}} Williams third-down run from the 1 to give the Hokies a 7-0 lead. Williams scored again, this time from the 3, to push the lead to 14-0 in the second quarter. Tennessee then took the momentum. Montario Hardesty ran through 301-pound {{defensive}} tackle Cordarrow Thompson’s tackle for a 4-yard run to cap an 80-yard drive. Janzen Jackson’s interception set up Crompton’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Moore with 18 seconds remaining in the first half. Instead of running out the clock, Taylor threw from his 33 to Jarrett Boykin, who was stopped inside the Volunteers’ 5 as the clock apparently expired. Tennessee players left the field but were summoned back and reluctantly returned as a video review showed that Boykin’s knee <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with 2 seconds remaining. Matt Waldron kicked a 21-yard field goal as the first half ran out to give Virginia Tech a 17-14 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E

5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{received}} 292 {{reports of}} tornadoes {{in the preceding}} 24 hours. It broke {{the record for the}} most tornado touchdowns in 24 hours with 219 in the United States from midnight to midnight CDT (0500 – 0500 UTC) breaking the 24-hour record of 147 (in both totals, excluding confirmed tornadoes outside the United States that were part of the outbreak) set by the 1974 Super Outbreak. Of those 219 tornadoes, 59 touched down in Alabama and 79 <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in Tennessee, accounting for well over half of the tornadoes that touched down on April 27. On April 27 alone, the National Weather Service in Huntsville, Alabama issued 92 tornado warnings, 31 severe thunderstorm warnings, and seven flash flood warnings.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 21 January 1944, Sayn-Wittgenstein, {{wireless}} operator Ostheimer {{and board}} mechanic Unteroffizier Kurt Matzuleit {{took off on}} a Zahme Sau (Tame Boar), a combination of ground controlled and airborne radar, night fighter intercept mission flying the Ju88R4+XM (Werknummer 750 467—factory number), which normally {{was assigned to the}} Technical Officer of NJG2. At 22:00 contact with the first of five Lancasters was established and shot down which was observed to explode at 22:05. Between 22:10 and 22:15 the second Lancaster was shot down. Observers reported the third Lancaster exploded at approximately 22:30, followed shortly by number four, which <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at 22:40. During the fifth and final attack, the four-engined bomber was burning when their Ju 88 came under attack, presumably from British fighter escorts. In the attack, their left wing caught fire. Sayn-Wittgenstein ordered his crew to jump, and Ostheimer and Matzuleit parachuted to safety from the damaged aircraft.|$|E
5|$|With {{the clear}} {{goal of a}} manned landing {{replacing}} the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights, NASA had to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> running, and decided to discard the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command / service module design. The mission module {{was determined to be}} only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary. They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost three}} years in the wilderness, Fingleton {{returned}} to the Test arena in the First Test at Durban. After making two in the first innings, he was unbeaten on 36 when Australia reached their second innings target with nine wickets in hand. During the first innings, a 140km/h gale <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> uprooting trees and forcing balls that were heading into the wind to do U-turns. He followed this with 62—the innings top-score—and 40 in the Second Test at Johannesburg. After taking a 93-run first innings lead, Australia needed a Test record of 399 in the second innings to win on a turning wicket, and after the early demise of Brown, Fingleton joined McCabe in a 177-run partnership that pushed the score to 1/194. Such was the dominance of McCabe that he scored more than 80% of the runs during this partnership. Australia needed only 125 with half the day remaining and eight wickets in hand when poor visibility ended play. McCabe had flayed the attack and reached 189 not out when the South Africans had the match called off, claiming that the fieldsmen were endangered by the batsman's vigorous hitting.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{was awarded}} the first bar to his DSO on 24 September 1943. Four nights later, on the 28/29 September whilst {{carrying}} out an intruder operation between Celle and Hanover Braham encountered what he identified to be a Do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight. He downed the enemy aircraft which <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and exploded. He then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but could not quite catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby. One source suggests {{the victim of the}} crash was German ace Hans-Dieter Frank (55 victories), flying a Heinkel He 219, who collided with another German fighter while trying to evade Braham. The very next night he claimed a Bf 110. His victim was identified as German ace August Geiger of IV/NJG 1 (53 victories). Geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned. Within minutes Braham fired on a Ju 88 which he claimed as damaged. Frank, Vinke and Geiger were the 17th, 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of the Second World War (and aerial warfare).|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{returned}} to operations on 13 March. 602 were strengthened over {{this time by}} the arrival of Flight Lieutenant James Harry Lacey, an already established fighter pilot with considerable combat experience. Lacey commanded several Flights in 602 over the spring and summer, 1942. By coincidence, Lacey would end the war on 28 aerial victories also. He flew with Finucane and 602 on Circus 114 which targeted the railway yards at Hazebrouck. Finucane fought an Fw 190 from 23 to 8,000ft. He claimed it shot down and it was witnessed by Sergeant Paul Green. Fighter Command claimed eight for the loss of six. JG 26 recorded no losses in the battle and the Germans issued a communiqué on losses. Air Chief Marshal Charles Portal requested proof from Sholto Douglas to demonstrate Fighter Command's claims were accurate. Douglas issued him with combat reports from the Kenley Wing which stated two German aircraft were seen to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and one pilot bailed out. These claims cannot be substantiated through German losses. One source records a loss of Bf 109 from I./ JG 26.|$|E

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E
