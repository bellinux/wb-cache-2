5000|$|There {{are many}} options for moving grain from one {{location}} to another. Some of these options include conveyors such as belt conveyors, drag conveyors, screw conveyors, and pneumatic conveyors. Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines. Another commonly used conveyor is screw conveyors. Screw conveyors, also known as augers, are conveyors made from a <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> with rotational motion to move grain. They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various screw conveyors. The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with screw conveyors, the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the grain damage.Pneumatic conveyors use a moving air-stream to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second. [...] In research by Baker et al. breakage levels of maize in pneumatic conveyors were found to be similar to those of bucket or drag conveyors.|$|E

30|$|Several biomechanical {{studies have}} shown an {{advantage}} of the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> over a screw type implant for unstable and osteoporotic pertrochanteric fractures. Strauss et al. [15] concluded that fixation of the femoral head with a <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> was biomechanically superior to fixation with a standard sliding hip screw in a cadaveric, unstable pertrochanteric hip fracture model. In a cellular polyurethane foam surrogate model of the femoral head, Sommers et al. [26] demonstrated that the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> of the pertrochanteric fixation nail provided the greatest resistance to cut-out compared to the lag screw design of the extramedullary dynamic hip screw and the intramedullary gamma nail. Jewell et al. [9] compared the standard DHS design with a DHS fixed to shaft of femur with locking plate and concluded that a locking screw DHS would be particularly useful in patients with osteoporotic bone and in patients with less stable fracture configurations. Windolf et al. [27] compared the mechanical performance of the DHS and <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> in paired cadaveric specimens under dynamic loading. They noted 100  % cut-out in the DHS group, but only 50  % cut-out in the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> group. They also noted increased fracture collapse in the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> group. The compressed bone around the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> theoretically provides improved resistance to cut-out relative to the osteoporotic, non-compressed bone surrounding the DHS [17]. Additionally, these spiral blade implants may provide better rotational control of the fracture construct, especially when the lag screw is placed in an eccentric position [26].|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe cross-flow fan (CFF) is a lifting and propulsion device that retains {{the advantages of}} a fixed-wing aircraft by using a ducted lift fan. There is no upper limit to the rotor length-to-diameter ratio of a CFF, allowing the device to be installed {{along the length of}} the wing or lifting device. The CFF discharged vector can be easily rotated about the fan axis since the fan has no angular requirements, further allowing the capability of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) by thrust vectoring. CFF possess the potential to propel an airframe to flight; however adequate thrust must be produced by the CFF in order for it to realize VTOL. Conventional CFFs designs with straight blades produce unacceptable noise levels for personal air vehicle operation. It is believed that <b>helical</b> <b>blades</b> could solve the sound pressure level problem and produce more thrust to aid VTOL. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, ANSYS-CFX, a three-dimensional (3 -D) straight-bladed model was validated against previous studys experimental results.

30|$|Late <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> {{migration}} {{was seen}} in an otherwise asymptomatic patient at the sixth month of follow-up that had little impact on fracture healing. The tip–apex distance {{in this case was}} 16  mm. A similar late migration of tip of the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> was reported by Gardner et al. [14] after pertrochanteric fixation nail in elderly patients with pertrochanteric fractures. All position changes occurred within first 6  weeks postoperatively, with no subsequent detectable migration or telescoping with no significant differences between stable and unstable fractures [14]. Gardner et al. also reported reverse migration of blade in 8  % cases and intra-articular penetration in one patient. We did not observe reverse migration of blade in the present study. The average sliding of lag screw was 3.6  mm (range 2 – 10  mm) in the present study, which was lower than a previous study using the DHS alone [28]. This supports the concept of a fixed angle implant and bone construct with a locking side plate, both of which provides stable fixation in unstable pertrochanteric fracture. Fitzpatrick et al. [29] in their randomized controlled trial have reported the average sliding of 7.4  mm with dynamic <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> group. Short shaft engagement of <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> could have led to the binding of the blade in the barrel. This could explain the lesser degree of sliding obtained in the present study.|$|E
40|$|Oral PresentationSession: Trauma: Updates in Hip Fracture ManagementProximal femoral {{fractures}} {{are commonly}} encountered {{in our daily}} practice. However, significant complications still occur and most fractures heal with significant collapse, resulting in limb shortening and limping gait. The fixation over the femoral head region is still not satisfactory and lag screw cut-out occurs 6 - 19 %. The <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> plate fixation was devised {{as an attempt to}} improve the fixation of the femoral head. The theoretical advantage includes an increased cross section area to resist cut-out and a decreased amount of bone removed from the femoral head during insertion. An anti-rotation mechanism was also devised, which potentially decreased the amount of rotational displacement during fracture collapse. A total of 104 dynamic <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> plate fixations were performed in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. The average age was 82. The indications include AO/OTA 31 A 1 and A 2 fractures. Cut-out of the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> occurred in two patients (1. 9 %). All other fractures united with different degrees of shortening. The theoretical advantages of the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> fixation of the osteoporotic femoral head appear to be valid.

30|$|A {{number of}} {{variations}} of basic sliding hip screws {{have been proposed}} because of such complications in elderly patients with AO 31 A 2, 31 A 3 type fractures; in these excessive collapse can lead to shortening and hardware failure [5, 13]. One proposal was to improve implant anchorage in the femoral head {{by the use of}} a <b>helical</b> <b>blade.</b> The shape of the blade leads to improved rotational stability of the femoral head and neck fragment, which is vital for reducing the risk of cut-out, and may contribute to fewer delayed unions or varus angulation in unstable pertrochanteric fractures [14, 15]. The tip of the blade allows for compaction of the bone when it is inserted, which is thought responsible for improving anchorage in femoral head [16, 17]. Another study reported that the DHS with fixed angle locking screws (locking side plate) would reduce the risk of DHS failure and would be particularly useful in patients with osteoporotic bone or for patients with less stable fracture configurations [9]. The dynamic hip helical system (DHHS), designed by AO/ASIF, merges the concept of locking side plate, <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> and dynamic hip screw. Several biomechanical studies have shown that <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> has the potential to decrease the cut-out rate [14, 15], but few clinical studies have been reported. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the radiological and functional outcome in elderly patients with unstable pertrochanteric fractures treated with the DHHS.

The decision for augmentation is made after implantation of the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> and is based on the clinical judgement of the bone strength of the femoral head during blade insertion by the surgeon. The only contra-indication for proximal femoral nail augmentation is a perforation of the femoral head by the Kirschner-wire or by the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> because this would lead to cement leakage in the hip joint.

Materials and Methods: Eight pairs of human cadaveric femurs were used; in one group [center-center (C-C) group], the <b>helical</b> <b>blade</b> of PFNA was fixed randomly in central position both in anteroposterior and lateral view, whereas in the other group it was fixed in inferior one-third position in anteroposterior and in central position in lateral view [inferior-center (I-C) group].
