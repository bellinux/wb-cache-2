40|$|Interiors is a {{slippery}} discipline. Among all <b>designed</b> artefacts, <b>interiors</b> themselves are uniquely ephemeral {{and hard to}} define. The practice <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> is relatively unregulated. The <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> is patchy and contested. The theoretical basis <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> is largely unexplored in comparison {{to those of other}} disciplines. How, therefore, might we speculate about the role, validity and purpose <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> in the 21 st century? Thinking inside the box is a reader designed to help students, academics, thinkers and practitioners <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> do just that. Thinking inside the box is a collection of essays by prominent thinkers in the field <b>of</b> <b>interiors,</b> from Mark Taylor, co-author of ‘Intimus’ to Shashi Caan, the practitioner, and former head <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> at Parsons, the new School of Design in New York. They address themes ranging from cushions, curtains, and feminism to the relationship between the interior and the enclave in the contemporary age of terror; from the regulation of the profession <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> to the representation <b>of</b> the <b>interior</b> on the page, and in history. This diverse reader is simply and clearly organised into four main sections: • What is <b>interior</b> <b>design?</b> – debates on the identity, the profession, and the regulation <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> • Why do we do <b>interior</b> <b>design?</b> – essays on the relationship between theory and practice in <b>interiors</b> • <b>Histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> – stories from the practice <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> and meditations on the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the discipline • How do we teach <b>interior</b> <b>design?</b> – case studies from, and reflections upon, the education <b>of</b> the <b>interior</b> designer. Thinking inside the box has been commissioned and edited by the Interiors Forum Scotland, a grouping <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> academics from the University of Dundee, Edinburgh College of Art, Glasgow Metropolitan University, the Glasgow School of Art, and Napier University, Edinburgh, and The Lighthouse, Scotland’s Centre for Architecture, Design, and the City. ...|$|R

The earliest recorded <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> {{is rooted in}} the renaissance Era, a time of great change and rebirth in the world of art and architecture, and much of this time saw understated, simple treatments, eventually moving towards more elaborate fabrics of multiple layers of treatments, including, towards the end of this period, valances, swags, jabots, and pelmets. By the Baroque and early Georgian period (1643-1730), elaborate and theatrical treatments placed high emphasis on the cornice and pelmet as a way to finish off the top of a window treatment.|$|E

The book is organized around six thematic chapters: home, work, retail, display, leisure and culture. Each one comprises a selection of case studies in chronological order. 52 key examples dating from 1900 to the present are explored in terms of context, concept, organization and detail and are illustrated with photographs, plans, sections, concept drawings and sketches. This unique history will be invaluable for students <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> architecture and <b>design</b> seeking a survey tailored especially for them, as well as appealing to interested general readers...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{uses the}} Italian {{expression}} “l’interno nell’interno” {{to identify a}} specific case {{of the relationship between}} interior and interiority in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> furnishing and <b>interior</b> <b>design.</b> From the Middle Ages to the twentieth century in Western culture various types of furniture locate a specific type of space—made of wood, curtains or masonry—within a previous domestic space. These new spaces are often bound up with the desires for privacy, well-being and concentration. They permit people to withdraw into themselves, to have more intimacy, or engage in a privileged dialogue with others. To demonstrate this close relationship between interior and interiority this essay chooses three typologies of the “interno nell’interno”: namely the studiolo, master bed and window. The first two are analysed as pieces of furniture, while the window is analysed as a space. The three typologies are selected for their special character as paradigms in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> furnishing and <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> and their unique character as spaces of interiority. The essay analyses them by drawing on authors who write on the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> art, literature, philosophy, psychology, interiority, in addition to specialized texts on the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interiors</b> and architecture. In the conclusion, with the use of phenomenological and psychoanalytical approaches (especially Elvio Fachinelli’s claustrophilic interiorisation), the essay demonstrates that these three models were true rooms of interiority in past ages. The studiolo, master bed and window can be considered mediums of inner development and wellbeing. The purpose of the essay is to show that the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> furnishing and <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> can be understood and interpreted in accordance with values complementary to those commonly used, values that adopt an interdisciplinary approach and problematicity as a method of study, in order to shed light on the actual relationship between interior and interiority. Although this relationship was more evident in past ages, rather than in the present, the interpretational method adopted here is also offered as a possible key to studies <b>of</b> contemporary <b>interiors.</b> This article is published as part of a collection on interiorities...|$|R

40|$|As a {{relatively}} new conceptual narrative, the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> has various potential starting points. Thus far, interior design histories have followed either art, architectural or decorative arts histories {{in order to establish}} a coherent, progressive narrative that might both contextualize and frame possibilities for contemporary practice. While older historical surveys of the discipline typically located the origins of interior design in ancient civilizations such as Greece or Rome, recent historical surveys have followed an art historical convention in locating the origins of interior design in the Paleolithic caves of Europe. This paper contains a review of literature on the beginnings of interior design's historical narrative, as well as a reconsideration of the cave as a conceptual foundation for interior design theory and practice. The Paleolithic cave is here re-evaluated as both an historical origin that distinguishes interior design history from architectural and art history, and as a speculative, theoretical space rich with possibilities...|$|E

40|$|Interior space {{encloses}} {{the daily}} routines of human life. Each space will invoke different responses {{due to their}} function and organisation, their history and atmosphere, and their environmental and material conditions. The room {{is central to the}} understanding of the interior. It is an enclosure of space within which occupancy, in its myriad of forms, takes place. This is a book about the history of Twentieth Century Interior Design, as told through a series of exemplary interiors and rooms. The <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>Design</b> is often outlined in parallel to the development of architecture, but the process of creating an interior is different to the process of creating architecture, a procedure where ‘new build’ is the primary form of spatial expression. The creation of an interior is generally based around the understanding of, and working with, existing spaces and buildings. Whether the existing component of this process is a real building, or merely the outline of a project drawn on a screen or page, the existing space will provide the impetus for the design and hence the creation of the interior. Therefore the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>Design,</b> whilst inexplicably connected to the enclosure within which it is contained, cannot adequately be reflected solely by the history and development of architecture.  This book will define the history of modern Interior Design as told through the development of the discipline of re-using existing buildings and spaces. It will outline the history of the development of the subject through a selection of interiors that have been created as autonomous spaces contained within an existing building envelope. Whilst the architectural container is acknowledged, these interiors have been created in an historic and stylistically independent manner. It is these interiors that constitute what might be considered as ‘exemplary’ forms of Interior Design. In other words the creation of interior space through reuse, interiors that are created independently of, as opposed to simultaneously with the envelope, involves the creation of the most prototypical forms of Interior Design. The author acknowledges that the principle will exclude many buildings, housing what may be considered as ‘classic’ examples of modern interior spaces, but it is considered that this approach could allow Interior Design to separate itself from architectural history, and therefore be able to develop its own spatial and historical discourse through the examination of specific exemplars of interior space...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{catering}} firm J. Lyons & Co as contributors of hotel {{expansion in the}} West End of London between 1888 and 1935. Introducing {{the development of the}} steel-framed building type, it aims to provide a design historical explanation for the advance of hotels in location, design and interior decoration. The spatial layout of the West End and Piccadilly provide a specific focus for the Regent Palace Hotel, as a building proposed upon the redevelopment of the Regent Street quadrant in 1915. A central argument includes an emergence of the economy hotel in the public space of Edwardian urban reconstruction, as a consequence of material, technological and social processes of the early twentieth century. Removing the imperialist connotations represented by the previous grand Victorian hotels, this study uses design history to investigate the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> and architecture in new luxury hotels. Specifying site location, building facades and urban geographies in Piccadilly as extended architectural frameworks from thoroughfares to thresholds. The main objectives are to reveal how new hotels were built in the late Victorian and Edwardian period, by examining interiors, gender and luxury in relation to one hotel. Analysing the public and private rooms on three levels: lower ground, ground, and upper floors, the thesis examines these as socio-spatial layouts. The large public rooms in the Regent Palace Hotel adapted to incorporate new modes of interior decoration, which established how the new luxury hotel attracted a broader clientele in the modernisation of the West End. The Regent Street quadrant had originated on empire and spectacle in a period of economic transformation, yet in the Edwardian period this space witnessed increased patterns of consumption and a new commodity culture. The study emphasises the capitalist enterprise in hotels, new services and industries, by placing J. Lyons & Co into the urban history of the West End...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> for the Union-Castle passenger liners sailing from Southampton to South Africa between 1945 and 1977, {{when the last}} Union-Castle ship left Cape Town. Interrogating the passenger accommodation of five Union-Castle ships, Pretoria Castle (1948). Edinburgh Castle (1948), Pendennis Castle (1960), Windsor Castle (1961), and Reina del Mar (1973), it analyses the design choices and decisions taken by Union-Castle and its managing company, British & Commonwealth Shipping Ltd. (B&C), posits reasons for these, and considers their implications {{for the creation of}} Union-Castle's interiors. Drawing upon established design-historical methods, I also argue throughout for an interdisciplinary approach, in particular since this enables a reading of the 'un-designed' and non-canonical space. I contend that it is essential to engage with the wider histories that provided the environment for Union-Castle's operations, and argue that this is a design history that cannot be meaningfully written without also tracing the relationship between Union-Castle, B&C and the Afrikaner National Party government (1948 - 1994). It is this relationship that provides the underlying discussion of the thesis {{the extent to which the}} co-constitutive themes of both the 'representation of politics' and the 'politics of representation' informed the interior design of Union-Castle's ships Such was the nature of the National Party's hegemony that its political ethos can clearly be demonstrated to have had an impact not only upon the process by which, but also the interiors of the vehicles with which, the shipping line conducted business. Of critical significance to this history is the fact that nowhere on board any of the ships that provide my case studies is there ever any reference to black Africa Instead, a series of interiors were produced which were variously inscribed with wholly 'white' ideas about emigration, nationhood and colonial relations between Britain and Africa, and, in the post-colonial period, with ideas about British heritage versus modernity power-broking vis a vis Pretoria and with discourses associated with the rise of air travel and mass tourism.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} women were seminal to the {{development}} of interior design as a discipline and profession in Sydney, Australia. Covering the period from the 1920 s to the 1960 s, this study identifies Thea Proctor, Nora McDougall, Margaret Lord, Phyllis Shillito and Mary White as foundational leaders who progressively advanced interior design in Sydney through individual and collective understandings of design. Focussing on their contributions to this development, this study explains complex interrelationships between women and modernity in interior design. This emergence of the discipline and profession in Sydney situates the initiatives of these five women at a transitional phase of the field&# 146;s global development when &# 145;interior decoration&# 146; is challenged by modern attitudes and artistic theories of &# 145;design&# 146;. Working as individuals, Proctor and her successors advance the profession&# 151;previously characterised as a &# 145;natural&# 146; pursuit for women of &# 145;taste&# 146; and &# 145;style&# 146;&# 151;by their artistic, rational and practical approaches to interior design. At a time when no distinct discipline exists in Sydney, the women offer instruction and forge new directions by reformulating previous overseas traditions: incorporating a wide-range of aesthetic and theoretical conceptions of design, demonstrating common and different approaches to practice, and integrating changes in requisite knowledge and skills in response to their times. The women&# 146;s programs are conventional and progressive, common and diverse, universal and particular in content and meaning. Working within a variety of settings, the women importantly establish professional jurisdiction situating interior design in a modernist context. Significantly, their contributions challenge past readings that have diminished the early women of interior design, and at the same time, embody all the conflicts, ruptures, paradoxes and contradictions that are cental to modernity. This research redresses the lack of institutional <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> in Sydney and links theories of modernism and modernity to issues of gender and profession to explain the women&# 146;s significant contributions to interior design at a critical juncture of the field&# 146;s development. As such, their stories and legacy of design in Sydney contribute to a wider picture of women and modernity in interior design...|$|E
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} {{version of the}} following article: EDWARDS, C., 2013. Complete house furnishers: the retailer as interior designer in nineteenth-century London. Journal of Interior Design, 38 (1), pp. 1 - 17, which has been published in final form at: [URL] research paper considers {{the history of a}} particular moment {{in the development of the}} interior decoration/design business. Although the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>interior</b> <b>design</b> practice has been well charted as ‘‘art/design history,’’ the business and professional history has been somewhat neglected, except for work on particular firms. The issues examined relate to four particular aspects. The first covers the distinctions between decorators, upholsterers, furnishers, and architects and how these differences were reflected in the work undertaken. Related to this is a brief examination of why many architects ignored interior work. Secondly, is the nature of the customer base and how it reacted in response to changing social and economic factors. Thirdly, there are the issues of marketing and promotion that were aimed at a much wider audience than architects would expect, and finally a consideration of the house furnisher as a foundation for the development of the professional interior decorator/designer. To address these issues, the paper offers an overview of the rise, maturity, and change of the house furnisher as the most important contributor to the supply of interior design/decoration advice and products in the second half of the nineteenth century. By taking case studies of important players in the field, the paper will consider why architects gave up their role as arbiters of taste in interior works, and how the house furnishing businesses took over. This is of some interest as it not only explores an issue that still remains in the interior design world—the notion of who controls the work, but also explores the nature and pre-history of professional interior design service providers in the period. Although the scope of this essay is potentially wide ranging, it is limited to the second half of the nineteenth century and focuses on London for its case studies. Through a consideration of primary sources, often using the trade press for commentaries, a sense of the contemporary issues is made. In addition, the recent work by scholars in the field is used to interpret the changes described. As a foundation for the subsequent development of a profession, the house furnisher had laid a number of ground rules. Apart from the issue of the control of work, they encouraged the development of specialized knowledge, and they recognized the importance of training and education, and to some extent, exercised control of access to the industry...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interior</b> <b>Design</b> {{the kitchen}} is the most {{traditional}} room in the house, for it has evolved more slowly over the centuries than other spaces that are more on show. In peasant homes it {{is the heart of}} everyday family life: this is where meals are cooked, domestic chores are done, children are tended, and even sleeping pallets are spread on the floor. In nobles’ dwellings {{the kitchen is}} occupied by servants and later by other staff: until the 19 th century it is far removed from the living and entertaining areas since its smells and noises are not welcome in polite society. As the middle classes become established, it becomes the scene of the housewife’s activities. This essay relates the idea of intimacy to the space, furnishing, and equipment of the kitchen from 1880 to 1940. The subject is handled chronologically, but with a narrative emphasis based on the visual sequence of the kitchen interiorscape, in other words by interpolating historical notes and critical commentary among the images: selected highlights orchestrate the kitchen’s various interpretations accordingly. After a brief outline of the kitchen’s evolution from antiquity to the 17 th century, the essay proper begins with the concept of intimacy as the Dutch of that century gave it modern expression: kitchens in Flemish painting portray a vivid scene of interiority. Later, the ‘warm workshop’ of chefs and housekeepers in the early 19 th century turns into the woman’s realm of the Victorian era. From 1860 to 1890 a series of inventions simplifies the life of the housewife. A serene interiority links the kitchen (1895) of the painter Carl Larsson with that of the Gamble House (1907 - 08) by Greene & Greene: a diluted Art Nouveau informs a tranquil domes¬tic world. In {{the first decade of the}} 20 th century, on the other hand, Christine Frederick’s scientific kitchen (1912), with its standardized labour and the ‘mechanical bride’ idea derived from Taylorism, anticipated the fragmentation of the soul in Ludwig Kirchner’s kitchen (1918). In Europe the experimental designs of the 1920 s and 1930 s prefigured a minimal and wholly functional kitchen. In America, on the other hand, the next decade saw designs for ‘the kitchen of tomorrow’ – to paraphrase the title of a book on the home of Henry Wright and George Nelson (1946). Before ‘easier living’ arrives, the Streamline interlude represents the idea of the Future with the aerodynamic looks of its utensils. Lastly, Nelson’s essays, articles and designs bring the practicality of the American kitchen into the modern era: the ‘continuous kitchen’ is an idea that has lasted – though with many transformations – until the present day...|$|E
