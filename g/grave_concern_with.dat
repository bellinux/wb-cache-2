40|$|Abstract: With {{the rapid}} {{industrial}} growth, {{the need for}} renewable energy sources is rising fast. Being a developing country, Bangladesh aims towards industrial expansion, which is always followed by increased energy consumption. Considering the fact that fossil fuel is not sustainable and biomass sources are abundant and offer more versatility, the latter have become an attractive alternative to petroleum-based products. Moreover, utilization of biomass also seems promising because of biodegradability and lower greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring reduced environmental pollution, a <b>grave</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> fossil-fuel technology. Biomass can range from agricultural byproducts to industrial and municipal wastes, however, very few biomass sources are currently being used in Bangladesh. Moreover, biomass {{can also be utilized}} to derive valuable chemicals, which are potential raw materials in several existing industries in Bangladesh. Despite having massive potential in Bangladesh, there haven't been organized studies on feedstock types, quantities, characterization and applications. Here we present an organized study to identify potential biomass sources and their available quantities. Considering specific waste fractions from varying sources, total amount of utilizable biomass resources have been calculated. A categorized proximate analysis data summary of varying biomass is also prepared that can be consulted in the futur...|$|E
40|$|Abortion is {{an issue}} as long as history and hotly debated in all {{societies}} and communities. In some societies and countries it is legal, while other countries have no legal basis, and some countries have made it a crime. Today up to 90 % of abortions {{take place in the}} first trimester, about 9 % in the second trimester, and the rest in the third trimester. This paper deals with the issue of late termination of pregnancy, the practical medical aspects, legal issues, international aspects, and the dilemma for the professional. In early history, abortion was accepted by clergy and societies, but in recent history it is more restricted and in some countries prohibited. It does not seem that restriction leads to a lower abortion rate, but rather an active contraceptive policy, campaign, and availability to prevent pregnancies that are unwanted. In countries where abortion is restricted, the trend has been an increase in illegal abortion that leads to unsafe abortion with complications, permanent injuries, and maternal mortality. Unsafe and illegal abortion is a public health concern that governments should try to prevent and instead find ways to strengthen their commitments toward better and safer health and family planning services for women. Late termination of pregnancies {{is an issue}} of <b>grave</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> many practical medical aspects, ethical questions, and professional dilemmas. This is especially of concern because of the viability of the fetus and should only take place in order to prevent harm to the physical and mental health of the mother or due to an anomaly or disability of the fetus...|$|E

30|$|Sedimentation is {{a matter}} of <b>grave</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> respect to the Koshi rivers/tributaries which spans a {{staggering}} length of 720  km with about 92, 538  km 2 of drainage area (Nayak 1996). Huge deposition on the low land area governs the river channel system and the river has shown to be shifted 115  km westwards in the last 200  years (Agarwal and Bhoj 1992; Gole and Chitale 1966) covering 770  km 2 with sand (Nayak 1996). The dynamism of the Koshi is described by the cause of lateral shifting, frequent flooding, “piggyback” thrusting sequences, extensive bank erosion, neotectonics, tilting, sedimentological adjustment in its basin (Nepal et al. 2014; Ghatak et al. 2012; Rahman 2011; Jain and Sinha 2005; Nakayama and Ulak 1999; Sinha 1998; Khalequzzaman 1994; Blair and McPherson 1994; Schelling 1992; Agarwal and Bhoj 1992). This shifting dynamics result in the destruction of floodplains and the agricultural lands (Moench 2010). After the construction of the Koshi Barrage in 1962; eight major floods have been occurred since last 55  years (Mazumder 2011). On other hand, a research indicated that the sediments supply is limited in Nepal Himalayas which shows that the precipitation is not the only cause of erosion (Andermanna et al. 2012). Climatic and tectonic variations have contributed to the geomorphic diversity across the flood plain (Sinha et al. 2005). The flood fed sedimentation poses a challenge because of infertility and hardly used except in small quantities for construction materials (Hooning 2011). The existence of dynamism of hydrological system in Gangetic rivers is therefore vulnerable and is characterized by shifting of the channel along with the flood sediments which directly affects the people in the basin (Ghatak et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Mercury is a {{pollutant}} of <b>grave</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> {{well documented}} neurological and developmental health impacts. Better sensing methodology would improve detection {{and control of}} mercury and thus reduce its health burden. Gold nanoparticles provide a sensing medium with potential advantages in sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and cost over established techniques. Mercury readily adsorbs {{onto the surface of}} the gold changing the localized surface plasmon resonance which is measured as a shift in the peak optical absorbance wavelength. This shift is dependent on the mercury concentration and predictable with classical electromagnetism. This work investigates some of the fundamental relationships driving sensor response. The effects of mass transfer and surface kinetics on mercury/gold nanoparticle adsorption are determined with analytical models and experimental results based on impinging flow geometry. To decouple mass transfer and surface kinetics adsorption, electrical analogy models are constructed and fit to the experimental data. The models can account for variations in flow conditions and surface coatings on the nanoparticles. These models are generalizable to other systems. Results from these fundamental investigations are used to improve and extend sensor performance. The time response or collection efficiency is optimized depending on system requirements. Using the knowledge gained, the applicability of gold nanoparticle mercury sensors is extended to a fiber optic based system and aqueous detection. Nanorods deposited on the surface of a fiber optic cable have a linear response with concentration and are able to detect mercury down to 1. 0 &# 956;g/m 3. The modification of an established oxidation/reduction scheme for use with the sensor allows for the detection of ionic and organic mercury from water samples which ordinarily would not be reactive with gold nanoparticles. The aqueous sensor was able to detect mercury below the EPA's drinking water limit...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The new {{epidemic}} of Zika virus infection raises <b>grave</b> <b>concerns,</b> especially <b>with</b> the increasingly-recognized link between emerging cases of microcephaly and this infectious disease. Besides small cranial dimensions, there are striking morphologic anomalies in the fetal brain. Key anomalies include cortical developmental malformations and a peculiar distribution of pathologic calcifications. These potentially indicate a new pattern of congenital {{central nervous system}} infection. Methods: Eight women underwent fetal MRI. Four infants also underwent postnatal CT. Five of the women underwent amniocentesis. Results: All neonates were born with microcephaly. On fetal MRI, ventriculomegaly, marked reduction of white matter thickness, severe sylvian fissure simplification, abnormal sulcation, and diffuse volumetric loss of cerebellar hemispheres were consistently seen. On postnatal CT, diffuse subcortical and basal ganglia calcifications were observed. The Zika virus was detected in two amniocenteses by polymerase chain reaction assays.

30|$|In {{addition}} to column capacity, the structural system affects vertical load vulnerability (estimated parameter: 2.673; Table  2) {{as well as}} earthquake load (estimated parameter: 2.321; Table  2) substantially. This interaction indicates that factory buildings become more vulnerable as disintegration of the structural system increases. Although flat plate structures (as part of lateral load carrying system) are not permitted by the BNBC (1993), about 19 % of all factory buildings (Fig.  5 b) were built using flat plate structures for greater floor height. This {{is a matter of}} <b>grave</b> <b>concern</b> because <b>with</b> flat plates, the region around the column is always the critical location as it transfers combined gravity and lateral loads in a relatively small, shallow section. Unbalanced moments generated due to seismic action need to be transferred to columns from the flat plate. Brittle punching failures of flat plates were observed during several earthquakes as documented by Mitchell et al. (1995) and Mitchell et al. (1990). Despite the significant effect, structural system shows positive (Table  3) but weak correlation (Table  4) with both vulnerabilities.|$|R
40|$|Family-centred {{care is a}} {{ubiquitous}} term in paediatric health facilities. It {{means that}} an admitted child can never {{be treated as a}} single individual patient and that the family is the unit of care, as the parents and family are central to the child’s wellbeing, especially during traumatic experiences. There is no rigorous evidence that family-centred care works, but qualitative research is drawing out some <b>grave</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> how it is implemented. Part {{of the problem is that}} there are many descriptions of family-centred care, but few definitions and some of its component parts may be in place in some health services without the whole model being in place. This causes confusion amongst health professionals and parents and children and makes it impossible to test in a randomised controlled trial. Visit any children’s health facility anywhere - rich countries, poor ones; tertiary paediatric facilities, community child health services, institutions for children with disabilities - and one will find that they say they practise family-centred care. It may be in mission statements, clinical practice guidelines, leaflets for parents, signs on walls, policy documents - in other words, everywhere. “Family-centred care” sounds good; it sounds like something to which every health institution which cares for children should definitely use and sounds like a wonderful and ideal way to care for children who need healthcare. After all, every child has a family and every family is affected when a child is ill. There is a wealth of literature about family-centred care, far too much to include here, or even in a single systematic review. Much research has been conducted on it, while many have tried to test it and its application in healthcare. It has been approached from many angles - the children’s, the parents’, the nurses’, the doctors’, the allied health professionals’ and from health service managers’ perceptions. Sociologists have had a go, as have historians, philosophers, anthropologists, just about everyone. But what is it? And what does it mean for those on the receiving end, the families? Does it matter? Does it make a difference? Can we test it? Is there an alternative? In this paper I attempt to answer these questions and consider another model - that of child-centered care...|$|R

During the first wave (i. e., 1990 - 95), the Indian corporate houses {{seem to have been}} bracing up to face foreign competition while the second wave (i. e., 1995 - 2000) experienced a large presence of multinational firms. M&As also determined, to a large extent, the nature of foreign investment in the country during this period. A large share of these M&As were between firms belonging to the same business groups with a view to increase their respective controlling blocs in order to guard against a takeover. However, the study could not find any evidence of efficiency-related factors influencing M&As. It is rather growth of the firm in terms of their asset-size and market share that have been noticed. There are indications that one of the main motives could have been financial, that is, to increase the equity size, which can be further used to borrow resources for modernization.

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} and explain relationships between some major factors associated with successful reading at Grade 5 level in South African primary schools. In South Africa, <b>grave</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> regards to low levels of student achievement pervade research initiatives and educational debates. Despite considerable investments in educational inputs (such as policy and resources) and processes (such as curriculum provision and teacher support), outcomes (such as student achievement) remain disappointingly low. The South African population is characterized by great diversity and variation. With 11 official languages, current educational policy in South Africa advocates an additive bilingualism model and students in Grade 1 to 3 are taught in their mother tongue. Thereafter, when these students progress to Grade 4, the language of learning and teaching changes to a second language, which in most cases is English. At this key developmental stage students are also expected to advance from learning to read to a stage where they can use reading in order to learn. With this complexity of issues in mind, Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) {{was used to determine}} the effect of a number of explanatory variables at learner and school level on reading achievement as outcome variable, while controlling for language using the South African Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2006 data. As an international comparative evaluation of reading literacy involving more than 40 countries, PIRLS 2006 was the second, after PIRLS 2001, in a series of planned five-year cycles of assessment to measure trends in children’s reading literacy achievement, policy and practices related to literacy. Grade 5 learners in South African primary schools who participated in PIRLS 2006 were not able to achieve satisfactory levels of reading competence. The gravity of this finding is exacerbated by the fact that these learners were tested in the language in which they had been receiving instruction during the Foundation Phase of schooling. This study found most significant factors associated with reading literacy at learner-level, but {{this does not mean that}} the existence of teacher- and school-level factors is not of importance. While some explanatory factors at learner-level can more easily become the target of reading interventions, the higher level effect of the classroom and school are not diminished by this study. Creemers’ Comprehensive Model of Educational Effectiveness was utilized as theoretical point of departure. Creemers’ model was adapted for the purposes of this study to reflect a South African model of reading effectiveness in contrast with Creemers’ original use of it as a model of school effectiveness. Evidence was provided that the conceptual framework was inadequate in identifying factors affecting reading achievement for all South African language groupings. More specifically, the adapted South African reading effectiveness model was only appropriate in explaining reading achievement scores for the Afrikaans and English language groupings than for those from African language groupings.
