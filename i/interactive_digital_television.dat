50|$|BBC Red Button is {{the brand}} name for the BBC's <b>interactive</b> <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> services, which are {{available}} through Freeview (digital terrestrial), as well as Freesat, Sky (satellite), and Virgin Media (cable). Unlike Ceefax, the service's analogue counterpart, BBC Red Button is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes and can be accessed from any BBC channel. The service carries News, Weather and Sport 24 hours a day, but also provides extra features related to programmes specific at that time. Examples include viewers to play along at home to gameshows, to give, voice and vote on opinions to issues, as used alongside programmes such as Question Time. At some points in the year, when multiple sporting events occur, some coverage of less mainstream sports or games are frequently placed on the Red Button for viewers to watch. Frequently, other features are added unrelated to programmes being broadcast at that time, such as the broadcast of the Doctor Who animated episode Dreamland in November 2009.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Usability {{evaluation}} {{for applications}} based on emerging information technology brings new challenges. <b>Interactive</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Television</b> (iDT) is considered as {{the convergence of}} television and computer technologies. The main iDT feature is that the user may interact with the application; therefore usability should be a main concern when designing iDT applications. Current research usually focuses on iDT applications from a technical point of view, rather than a user– centered approach. There {{is a need for}} new usability evaluation methods or at least for the use of traditional evaluations in novel ways. A set of heuristics is proposed, in order to help the usability evaluations of iDT applications.
