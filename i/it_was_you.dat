By the time ain't appeared, an't was already being used for am not, are not, and is not.

500|$|Douglas Jackson Brooks (born June 19, 1956), known professionally as Doug Stone, is an American {{country music}} singer. He debuted in 1990 {{with the single}} [...] "I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box)", the first release from his 1990 self-titled debut album for Epic Records. Both this album and its successor, 1991's I Thought <b>It</b> <b>Was</b> <b>You,</b> earned a {{platinum}} certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Two more albums for Epic, 1992's From the Heart and 1994's More Love, are each certified gold. Stone moved to Columbia Records to record Faith in Me, Faith in You, which did not produce a Top Ten among its three singles. After suffering {{a heart attack and}} stroke in the late 1990s, he exited the label and did not release another album until Make Up in Love in 1999 on Atlantic Records. The Long Way was released in 2002 on the Audium label (now part of E1 Music), followed by two albums on the independent Lofton Creek Records.|$|E
500|$|The cast of Twin Peaks did {{not know}} who would be {{revealed}} as Palmer's killer for some time. Wise had hoped his character Leland {{would not be the}} eventual murderer; as the parent of a young girl he was disturbed by the idea of portraying a man who had murdered his daughter. Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said [...] "Ray, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you,</b> it was always you". However, Wise felt that the end result was [...] "beautiful", and that it left him and his character [...] "satisfied and redeemed". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after this, Histiaeus was {{released}} from his duties in Susa by Darius and sent to Ionia. He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt. However, Herodotus leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in Persia. When he arrived in Sardis, Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras: [...] "I will tell you, Histiaeus, {{the truth of this}} business: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> who stitched this shoe, and Aristagoras who put it on." [...] Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus. However, having just got rid of one tyrant, the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back. He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus, unless they agreed to serve him.|$|E
500|$|Manley {{describes}} Headley as {{just under}} medium height with sloping shoulders. His movements were precise and economical on the cricket field; his cap was usually at a slight angle and his sleeves were buttoned {{down to the}} wrist. Wisden noted in 1933 that his timing and placement of the ball was perfect. Exceptionally quick on his feet, he watched the ball onto the bat {{more than any other}} batsman. According to Wisden, all his shots were equally good but most notable was his on drive played from the back foot. He hit the ball hard and was very difficult to get out. He faced criticism for playing off the back foot so often, but R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed his square cut, late cut, and hook were exceptionally good. Headley was particularly effective on bad batting wickets. C. L. R. James calculated that Headley averaged 39.85 and passed fifty on seven occasions in thirteen innings on difficult wickets. According to James's reckoning, Bradman in similar conditions passed fifty once, and averaged 16.66 in fifteen innings. Headley himself preferred batting when the odds favoured the bowlers as he had to go for his shots and play his natural attacking game. He stated: [...] "On a bad wicket, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> and the bowler...no nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for [...] "Volcano" [...] {{are written}} from the {{perspective}} of a younger Bono addressing his modern-day self; he said, [...] "It's this young guy going, 'The fuck happened to you?'" [...] The Edge composed the song's bass intro. [...] "Raised by Wolves" [...] is about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which killed 33 people but were narrowly avoided by Bono that day. The song is written {{from the perspective}} of Andy Rowen (brother of Bono's childhood friend Guggi), whose presence at the bombings would later drive him into heroin addiction, a subject also addressed in U2's 1984 song [...] "Bad". [...] "Cedarwood Road" [...] reminisces about the street in Dublin on which Bono lived during his youth. The cherry blossom tree referenced in the lyrics was from the Rowen family garden. [...] "Sleep Like a Baby Tonight", written about a pedophile priest, was described by Qs Tom Doyle as featuring [...] "deceptively lullaby-like... synth pulses" [...] reminiscent of Kraftwerk. Their album The Man-Machine was gifted by Bono to Ali when they were dating as teenagers and is name-checked in [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] in the line, [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> who made me your man/Machine". [...] "This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now" [...] takes musical cues from one of the group's childhood inspirations, the Clash. According to the liner notes, the song is dedicated to the Clash's guitarist/vocalist Joe Strummer. The closing track, [...] "The Troubles", was described by Bono as [...] "an uncomfortable song about domestic violence".|$|E

2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play.

Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with {{his fingers through his}} face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking the ball into the end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over.

2500|$|According to Theodoret, {{when the}} emperor tried {{to enter a}} Milanese church, where Ambrose was about to {{celebrate}} a mass, the bishop stopped him and rebuked {{him for what he}} had done. And because the emperor “had been brought up according to divine words and understood well that some affairs are handled by priests, others by emperors”, he could do nothing but return [...] "weeping and sighing" [...] to the palace. Eight months had passed and Theodosius still sat in the palace, moaning and sobbing. His magister officiorum Rufinus, who [...] "used great freedom of speech due to the familiarity with the emperor", noticed this behaviour, approached and asked him why he was weeping. Having been told, he volunteered to see the bishop and ask him to reconsider. Theodosius hesitantly agreed and even chose to follow Rufinus from a distance. Ambrose was not restrained at all when negotiating with Rufinus, scolding him and even accusing him of complicity in the massacre: [...] "Rufinus, you are as impudent as a dog, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> who advised the emperor such a bloodshed." [...] When the emperor showed up, Ambrose at first remained stubborn and changed his mind only after Theodosius promised to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution.|$|E
