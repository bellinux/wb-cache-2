5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the group and an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the set and returns an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This {{is a type of}} symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|If an {{interval}} {{of the real}} numbers is partitioned into two non-empty parts L, R, such that every <b>element</b> <b>of</b> L is (strictly) less than every <b>element</b> <b>of</b> R, then either L contains a largest element or R contains a smallest element, but not both.|$|E

5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the array. The middle <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
5|$|A key <b>element</b> <b>of</b> quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle for charged, material particles requires the quantization of light into photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the ring and an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the module and returns an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal {{the structure of the}} ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
