5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed that Johnson had a comfortable lead over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was an uphill battle against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of <b>John</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility that Johnson had the sympathy of the media and voters.|$|E
5|$|It is more {{reliably}} recorded that in 1455 the Bishop of Caithness, William Mudy, granted Stroma {{and other}} lands and castles {{to his brother}} Gilbert. It eventually passed {{into the hands of}} the Sinclair family, who have held the title of Earl of Caithness since 1455. In 1659 George Sinclair, the 6th Earl of Caithness, granted the wadset of Stroma to <b>John</b> <b>Kennedy</b> of Kermuck, who had fled to the far north after being outlawed following the fatal wounding of John Forbes of Watertown.|$|E
5|$|Since the New York State Militia {{had been}} sent to assist Union troops at Gettysburg, the local New York Metropolitan Police Department was the only force on hand to try to {{suppress}} the riots. Police Superintendent <b>John</b> <b>Kennedy</b> arrived at the site on Monday to check on the situation. Although not in uniform, people in the mob recognized him and attacked him. Kennedy was left nearly unconscious, his face bruised and cut, his eye injured, his lips swollen, and his hand cut with a knife. He had been beaten to a mass of bruises and blood all over his body.|$|E

5|$|The rift in the Democratic party {{caused by}} the primary was slow to heal; Boddy's {{supporters}} were reluctant to join Douglas's campaign, even with President Truman's encouragement. The President refused to campaign in California; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt. Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt, had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948, but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower. Fundraising {{continued to be a}} major problem for Douglas, the bulk of whose financial support came from labor unions. The weekend after the primary, Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss strategy for the general election campaign. They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $197,000 (today, about $2,400,000). They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts Congressman John F. Kennedy, a political opponent of Nixon's, came to Nixon's office and gave him a donation of $1,000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., his father. <b>John</b> <b>Kennedy</b> indicated that he could not endorse Nixon, but {{that he would not be}} heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career. Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist.|$|E
5|$|The armies met on 21 June in Lochaber and Alexander, {{suffering}} the defection of Clan Chattan (the MacKintoshes) and Clan Cameron, was heavily defeated. Alexander escaped probably to Islay but James continued his {{assault on the}} Lordship by taking the strongholds of Dingwall and Urquhart castles in July. The king pushed home his advantage when an army reinforced with artillery was dispatched to the isles. Alexander probably realised that his position was hopeless and tried to negotiate terms of surrender but James demanded and received his total submission. From August 1429 the king delegated royal authority to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar for the keeping of the peace {{in the north and}} west. The Islesmen rose again in September 1431 and inflicted two important defeats on the king's men – Mar's army was beaten at Inverlochy and Angus Moray's in a fierce battle near Tongue in Caithness. This was a serious setback for James and his credibility was adversely affected. In 1431, before the September uprising, the king had arrested two of his nephews, <b>John</b> <b>Kennedy</b> of Carrick and Archibald, Earl of Douglas possibly {{as a result of a}} conflict between John and his uncle, Thomas Kennedy in which Douglas may have become involved. Douglas's arrest had raised tensions in the country and James acted to reduce the unrest by freeing the earl on 29 September – it was quite likely that the king made the earl's release conditional on support at the forthcoming parliament at Perth at which James intended to push for further funding for the campaign against the Lordship. Parliament was in no mood to allow James unconditional backing – he was allowed a tax to fund his Highland campaign but parliament retained full control over the levy. The rules parliament attached to the taxation indicated a robust stand against further conflict in the north and probably led to the turnaround that took place on 22 October when the king 'forgave the offence of each earl, namely Douglas and Ross '. For Douglas this was a formal acknowledgement of his having already been freed three weeks earlier but for Alexander this was a total reversal of crown policy towards the Lordship. Four summer campaigns against the Lordship were now officially at an end with James's wishes having effectively been blocked by parliament.|$|E

25|$|In 1790, William Kelly of Glasgow used a {{new method}} {{to assist the}} draw stroke. First animals, and then water, {{was used as the}} prime mover.

Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in Ancoats, was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules; their firm prospered and eventually merged into the Fine Spinners & Doublers Association. In 1793, <b>John</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was addressing the problem of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse.
