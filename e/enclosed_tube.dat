5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
25|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats, and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion. The main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food in one direction: from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
25|$|Super Speed Water Slides: These two water slides, {{also known}} as Geronimo Falls, were set {{slightly}} {{apart from the rest}} of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water—which made a large splash—and then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today, however the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> slides still use the same end splash pool that 2 of the other old speed slides used.|$|E

500|$|The second slide tower, {{along the}} park's {{southern}} border, features two rides with more moderate thrill ratings. On The Rip, riders hop into a four-person, cloverleaf-shaped tube. They descend a dark tunnel before entering a large, open bowl. The raft circles {{the centre of}} the bowl then exits down through the centre and into a splashdown pool. The Rip is the first and currently the only ProSlide Behemoth Bowl in Australia. The BRO (Blue Ringed Octopus) is a water slide consisting of eight [...] long lanes.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the Raman response of the inner tube radial breathing modes (RBMs) in double-wall carbon nanotubes is reported. It revealed {{that the number of}} observed RBMs is two to three times larger than the number of possible tubes in the studied frequency range. This unexpected increase in Raman lines is attributed to a splitting of the inner tube response. It is shown to originate from the possibility that one type of inner tube may form in different types of outer tubes {{and the fact that the}} inner tube RBM frequency depends on the diameter of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>tube.</b> Finally, a comparison of the inner tube RBMs and the RBMs of tubes in bundles gave clear evidence that the interaction in a bundle is stronger than the interaction between inner and outer tubes.

40|$|Wounding is {{a severe}} {{impairment}} of function, especially for an exposed organism like the network-forming true slime mould Physarum polycephalum. The tubular network {{making up the}} organism's body plan is entirely interconnected and shares a common cytoplasm. Oscillatory contractions of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>tube</b> walls drive the shuttle streaming of the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic flows underlie the reorganization of the network for example by movement toward attractive stimuli or away from repellants. Here, we follow the reorganization of P. polycephalum networks after severe wounding. Spatial mapping of the contraction changes in response to wounding reveal a multi-step pattern. Phases of increased activity alternate with cessation of contractions and stalling of flows, giving rise to coordinated transport and growth at the severing site. Overall, severing surprisingly acts like an attractive stimulus enabling healing of severed tubes. The reproducible cessation of contractions arising during this wound-healing response may open up new venues to investigate the biochemical wiring underlying P. polycephalum's complex behaviours...|$|R

50|$|Riders {{begin by}} {{climbing}} 65 {{feet to the}} top of the Blastenhoff tower. Two-passenger rafts are brought {{to the top of}} the tower on a conveyor belt. After passengers board and once the blocking systems indicates the channel ahead is clear, a small conveyor rolls the raft forward into the first drop — the ride's largest. At the bottom of the drop, water jets propel the raft uphill into a small dip and then another short uphill section. The raft then enters an <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> section and travels 190 degrees back the other direction. This section features two drops and two uphill blasts followed by a right turn in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube.</b> Upon exiting the tube the raft drops downhill, turns right again then drops downhill a second time. Another uphill blast leads to a downhill section then the final uphill blast sends the rafts into an <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> with a right turn helix followed by a left turn then a final small drop into the splash pool.|$|E

5000|$|A {{single tooth}} from the Petrified Forest Formation of the Late Triassic Chinle Group, {{found at the}} Placerias Quarry at St. Johns, Arizona, has been {{identified}} as one of Uatchitodon. It is slightly younger than the teeth of U. kroehleri found in Virginia. Venom-conducting teeth were first noted from the Placerias Quarry in the 1980s, but they were not interpreted as belonging to Uatchitodon until 1992. The tooth, known as MNA V3680, differs from those of U. kroehleri in that the grooves are fully <b>enclosed</b> and form <b>tubes</b> within the teeth. There are faint furrows at the sutures that <b>enclose</b> these <b>tubes.</b> The tubes, which are presumably venom canals, end at discharge orifices near the tip of the crown. MNA V3680 is the earliest example of a tetrapod with completely enclosed tooth canals for the delivery of oral toxins, which are seen today in elapid snakes.|$|R

40|$|Inexpensive {{synthesis}} of electroceramic materials {{is required for}} efficient energy storage. Here {{the design of a}} scalable process, flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), for {{synthesis of}} size-controlled nanomaterials is investigated focusing on understanding the role of air entrainment (AE) during their aerosol synthesis with emphasis on battery materials. The AE into the enclosed FSP reactor is analysed quantitatively by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and calculated temperatures are verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Various Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) particle compositions are made and characterized by N 2 adsorption, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction while the electrochemical performance of LTO is tested at various charging rates. Increasing AE decreases recirculation in the <b>enclosing</b> <b>tube</b> leading to lower reactor temperatures and particle concentrations by air dilution as well as shorter and narrower residence time distributions. As a result, particle growth by coagulation - coalescence decreases leading to smaller primary particles that are mostly pure LTO exhibiting high C-rate performance with more than 120 mAh/g galvanostatic specific charge at 40 C, outperforming commercial LTO. The effect of AE on FSP-made particle characteristics is demonstrated also in combustion synthesis of LiFePO 4 and ZrO 2...|$|R
