40|$|The total {{lifecycle}} of {{a vehicle}} contains many phases, from production to sales to first customer to second customer and so on {{until the end of}} life. Each one of these phases includes different activities in different business areas and under different conditions. This means that the customers´ needs will vary depending on which lifecycle phase the vehicle is in and the offered services have to be adapted to this. Therefore it is important for truck developing companies to know when a transition, from one lifecycle phase to another has occurred. This study is based on a case study provided by Scania, a company that develops trucks and busses. Delimitations were that the study would focus on connected long-haulage trucks that are in Europe under their first life cycle phase, that the developed services would be described on a conceptual level and not cover any economic aspects. With this in mind, the following research questions were created: RQ 1) What defines a transition phase? RQ 2) How can the long-haulage trucks’ usage pattern be used to identify a transition phase? RQ 3) Which data is needed to identify a transition phase? RQ 4) Based on the results of RQ 2 and RQ 3, how could the transition alert service be designed? RQ 5) Which applications could the transitions alert service be used for? The study included a literature study covering product lifecycle theory, servicification, second-hand market, big <b>data,</b> <b>telematics,</b> intelligent vehicles and statistic hypothesis testing. Further, two truck drivers were observed in order to get better understanding of the transportation business and the truck driving activities. Two qualitative interview studies were made with hauliers, service salesmen, truck salesmen and distributors from Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden. The results of the empirical studies were analysed and RQ 1 could be answered. Transition phase is the period between two different vehicle owners and/or two different ways of utilizing the truck. The analysis also gave a good picture of how the trucks are used during their life and in the transition phases, which gave an idea about usage patterns that could answer RQ 2. The answer was formulated as something named phase-DNA, composed by six parameters that should change during a transition phase: Geography, Route, Driver, Traffic Condition, Assignments and Services. Through a group brainstorming with experts in connected services, ideas of which data {{that could be used to}} describe each one of the parameters in the phase-DNA were found. These were sorted and evaluated until at least one data type for each parameter was set. The specific data types were chosen because they reflected their parameter well and because they were data that were accessible in order to conduct tests and validations. The final set of data types consisted of: Route Shape, Amount of Stops, Run Time, Idle Time, Distance Driven, Coasting, Driver ID, Average Speed, Fuel Consumption and Workshop History Data. This set of data types was used for the formulation of a hypothesis, that said that after a transition phase at least some of these data types should change. This was also the point where RQ 3 was answered. II The hypothesis was analysed using an exploratory analysis by plotting all the data types over time and observing if a change could be seen close to the change of ownership. The result showed that Amount of Stops and Driver ID were the most indicative data types, these two were further analysed with a statistical hypothesis test and a visualisation method. The results were used to develop an algorithm that is able to give an indication if a transition phase has occurred. The algorithm searches for changes in the six data types: Driver ID, Amount of Stops, Run Time, Distance Driven, Idle Time and Route Shape. The results from the empirical studies were used to define requirements for the development of a service based on the information of phase transition called transition alert service (TAS), which is the answer to RQ 4. Furthermore possible stakeholders that could be interested in the transition phase information were investigated together with an examination of their needs. TAS fulfils the five main needs identified from the stakeholders: ease start and cancellation of services, avoid unnecessary telecom expenses, avoid that information goes to the wrong customer, find new customers and customize services. In order to solve this, an algorithm detecting a transition phase was developed; it was done by searching for changes in the six data types: Driver ID, Amount of Stops, Run Time, Distance Driven, Idle Time and Route Shape. Moreover if the TAS information is combined with other information it could be used for creating new services. Through different idea generation workshops a large number of new ideas and concepts were generated, which became the answer to RQ 5. In total eleven applications for the transition alert service were developed: nine connected to change in ownership and two connected to change in utilization. Additionally, one support service named "Vehicle History" that is based on collected historical TAS was created. Further, one total solution named "No Worries Second-Hand" was created that includes five of the developed services. This total solution offers the customer the perfectly suitable second-hand truck without having to spend time searching for it. It also consists of a contract saying that if the customer signs a R&M contract, the dealer will buy back the vehicle and offer a new used vehicle when the old one gets too old or used. TAS makes this total solution possible by giving the dealer access to information about the truck and through this predict phase transitions. In conclusion, the developed services and especially the combination of them into a total solution would, according to the authors, favour the transition from a product focused company to a total solution provider, and extend the knowledge about the second-hand market...|$|E

40|$|BibliografiaThe rapid {{development}} {{of technology in}} all the scientific fields has caused the convergence of them into the same science’s field. An {{example of this is}} Telematics; a synergetic combination of informatics and telecommunications. Nowadays telematics is not very common in the context of airport technologies. However, many of the paperwork, data and services are computer-based and then retransmitted to telecommunications systems. In this thesis the characteristics that surround telematics technology are studied, and the benefits of its use are analyzed through case studies. To develop models, Machine Learning and Data Science techniques have been used. These techniques allow the extraction of proper information of the <b>data</b> obtained by <b>telematics.</b> The models include different procedures, including prediction and interpretation data techniques. As a result, the application of this model could be useful in different fields or environments. In this thesis, the models are adapted to the extraction of the information about the characteristics of Telematics in Vehicles; therefore if this model is going to be used in other ambits, it should be adapted to the new context (keeping the main base). During the thesis different application uses for the model are suggested. These applications, joining <b>data</b> and <b>telematics</b> services, might provide many advantages in the ground operations management at the airport such as the fuel consumption optimization across an accurate use of the concerning features affecting the fuel waste, reducing therefore emissions and avoiding monetary penalties for the accomplishment of certain environment protocols...|$|R

40|$|We analyze <b>telematics</b> <b>data</b> from a Belgian {{portfolio}} of young drivers who underwrote a pay-as-you-drive insurance product in between 2010 and 2014. Using installed black box devices, <b>telematics</b> <b>data</b> are collected {{on how many}} kilometers are driven, during which time slots and on which type of roads. Car insurance is traditionally priced based on self-reported information from the policyholder, most importantly: age, license age, postal code, engine power, use of the vehicle, and claims history. However, these observable risk factors are only indirect indicators of the accident risk and don’t reflect the real driving behavior. By constructing predictive models for the claim frequency, we compare the performance of different sets of predictor variables (e. g. traditional vs purely telematics) and discover the relevance and impact of adding telematics insights. In particular, we contrast the use of time and distance as exposure-to-risk, the basic rating unit underlying the insurance premium. We show how to incorporate the divisions of the distance driven by road type and time slots as compositional predictors in the model and how to interpret their effect on the average claim frequency.

40|$|Telematics {{technology}} - {{the integrated}} use of telecommunication and informatics - may fundamentally change the car insurance industry by allowing insurers to base their {{prices on the}} real driving behavior instead of on traditional policyholder characteristics and historical claims information. Telematics insurance or usage-based insurance (UBI) can drive down the cost for low-mileage clients and good drivers. Car insurance is traditionally priced based on self-reported information from the policyholder, most importantly: age, license age, postal code, engine power, use of the vehicle, and claims history. Over time, insurers try to refine this a priori risk classification and restore fairness using no-claim discounts and claim penalties {{in the form of}} the bonus-malus system. It is expected that these traditional methods of risk assessment will become obsolete. Your car usage and your driver abilities can be better assessed based on <b>telematics</b> <b>data</b> collected, such as: the distance driven, the time of day, how long you have been driving, the location, the speed, harsh or smooth breaking, aggressive acceleration or deceleration, your cornering and parking skills [...] . This high dimensional data, collected on the fly, will force pricing actuaries to change their current practice. New statistical models will have to be developed to adequately set premiums based on individual policyholder’s motoring habits instead of the risk associated to their peer group. In this work, we take a first step in this direction. We analyze a <b>telematics</b> <b>data</b> set from a European insurer, collected in between 2010 and 2014, in which information is collected on the amount of meters insureds drive. Besides the number of meters driven, we also registered how this distance is divided over the different kind of road types and time slots. This data allows car insurers the use of real driving exposure to price the contract.

Using telematics technology enables tailor-made car insurance pricing based on the driving behavior of the policyholder. We develop a statistical modeling approach using generalized additive models and compositional predictors to quantify and interpret the effect of telematics variables on the expected claim frequency.

40|$|A {{telematic}} based {{system for}} enabling automatic fault detection {{of a population}} of vehicles is proposed.

Successful telematics {{can be realized}} through the integration of navigation and spatial information.

The development of GPS is used to provide the navigation data, but the performance is limited in areas where poor satellite visibility environment exists. Hence, multi-sensor fusion including IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), GPS (Global Positioning System), and DMI (Distance Measurement Indicator) is required to provide the vehicle’s position to service provider and driver behind the wheel. The multi-sensor fusion is implemented via algorithm based on Kalman filtering technique. Navigation accuracy can be enhanced using this filtering approach. For the verification of fusion approach, land vehicle test was performed and the results were discussed.

Under normal GPS environment, the horizontal position errors were under 40 cm in curve trajectory and 27 cm in linear trajectory, which are definitely depending on vehicular dynamics...|$|R
40|$|In Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) {{automobile}} insurance, {{the premium}} is fixed {{based on the}} distance traveled, while in usage-based insurance (UBI) the driving patterns of the policyholder are also considered. In those schemes, drivers who drive more pay a higher premium compared to those with the same characteristics who drive only occasionally, because the former are more exposed {{to the risk of}} accident. In this paper, we analyze the simultaneous effect of the distance traveled and exposure time on the risk of accident by using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). We carry out an empirical application and show that the expected number of claims (1) stabilizes once a certain number of accumulated distance-driven is reached and (2) it is not proportional to the duration of the contract, which is in contradiction to insurance practice. Finally, we propose to use a rating system that takes into account simultaneously exposure time and distance traveled in the premium calculation.

40|$|To {{create a}} “win-win-win ” {{proposition}} for insurers, teens and their parents, the industry needs a technology-driven, safety-focused solution {{that addresses the}} requirements of all parties, monitors teen driving and reduces losses — in real time. Executive Summary Teen driving {{is a major concern}} for both fami-lies and the insurance industry, and the catalyst behind numerous awareness programs and cor-rective steps. While it is encouraging to know that since 2005, deaths from automobile accidents involving teens have dropped 47 % (from 5, 889 to 3, 150 in 2011), 1 errors traced to teenage driv-ers were identified as the cause of 75 %-plus of the 3, 150 deaths reported in 2011 — the last year reliable data was available. This is a troubling sta-tistic that calls {{for the development of a}} more comprehensive solution to help safeguard young drivers and their passengers. With the evolution of the SMAC StackTM (social, mobile, analytics and cloud), insurers have the opportunity and the ability to devise a more com-pelling solution focused on safe driving for teens. In this paper, we examine the needs of teen driv-ers, their parents and their insurers — those who have the most to gain from a value-centered and highly effective safe-driving program. We will also detail a SMAC-based solution tailored to this group of stakeholders. Key elements of the solution include: • A smart mobile app that appeals to teens; provides driver scores that can be compared with those of peers; monitors driving; and offers safe-driving tips for young people. • Software that sends real-time alerts to parents concerning their teen’s faulty driving or breach of any governing rules (speeding, driving outside pre-defined geographic areas and roads, etc.). • Capabilities that help insurers reduce losses by utilizing meaningful <b>data</b> from <b>telematics</b> devices across networks.

The technique, which is inspired by the Immune System self-regulation mechanism, was originally conceptualised to eliminate very similar instances in data classification tasks. We adapt the method to detect hot spots from a <b>telematics</b> <b>data</b> set containing {{hundreds of thousands of}} data points indicating incident locations involving heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) across the United Kingdom. The objective is to provide HGV drivers with information regarding areas of high likelihood of incidents in order to continuously improve road safety and vehicle economy. The problem presents several challenges and constraints. An accurate view of the hot spots produced in a timely manner is necessary. In addition, the solution is required to be adaptable and dynamic, as thousands of new incidents are included in the database daily. Furthermore, the impact on hot spots after informing drivers about their existence has to be considered. Our solution successfully addresses these constraints. It is fast, robust, and applicable to all different incidents investigated. The method is also self-adjustable, which means that if the hot spots’ configuration changes with time, the algorithm automatically evolves to present the most current topology. Our solution has been implemented by a telematics company to improve HGV safety in the United Kingdom...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the SPR- 3650 research project is to provide an accurate overview of striping operation so that INDOT {{finds a way to}} effectively save significant investment for purchasing new striping trucks in near future without compromising roadway striping operation and maintenance. <b>Telematics</b> <b>data</b> collection technology was selected to collect 2012 striping season operation, from April 2012 to November 2012, in real-time via wireless network to analyze complete striping operation performance including four striping trucks and multiple supporting vehicles in Crawfordsville and Greenfield district. The performance analyses include productivity, utilization, idling, WMS, materials consumption, and fleet tracking. The research focused productivity and utilization as key performance components. Productivity and utilization analyses revealed that striping operation could be improved and the striping fleets were underutilized. The potential improvement of current utilization can significantly contribute return on investment of additional asset procurement in near future. To improve the striping performance four recommendations were suggested. The research provides district boundary comparative analysis, possible operation scenarios, and performance measurement metrics as recommendations for future striping performance enhancement. Several statistical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation and triangular distribution model were used to develop the performance metrics. An expected outcome of the research is that INDOT roadway striping operation can be improved by considering recommendations and data analyses results for future striping seasons...|$|R
