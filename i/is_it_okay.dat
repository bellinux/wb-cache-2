Lin declared this in response to press reports that Chen accused Lee Teng-hui of embezzling NT$ 1.6 billion from the national coffers when interrogated by prosecutors of his corruption scandals, but then immediately asked his lawmaker to deny the accusation after prosecutors confirmed that Chen did file the accusation against Lee. Lin said that Lee should face legal prosecution if he was really involved in the corruption scandal as accused by Chen, also adding that if Chen ratted on Lee's embezzlement scandal based on a sense of justice, [...] "why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> for him to embezzle {{a tremendous amount of}} money, and why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to accuse Lee and then deny the accusation?"

40|$|This article {{reports on}} an ethnographic experiment. Four finger eating experts and three novices {{sat down for}} a hot meal and ate with their hands. Drawing on the {{technique}} of playing with the familiar and the strange, our aim was not to explain our responses, but to articulate them. As we seek words to do so, we are compelled to stretch the verb ―to taste. ‖ Tasting, or so our ethnographic experiment suggests, need not be understood as an activity confined to the tongue. Instead, if given a chance, it may viscously spread out to the fingers and come to include appreciative reactions otherwise hard to name. Pleasure and embarrassment, food-like vitality, erotic titillation, the satisfaction or discomfort that follow a meal—we suggest that these may all be included in ―tasting. ‖ Thus teasing the language alters what speakers and eaters may sense and say. It complements the repertoires available for articulation.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{investigating}} preferred driving speeds and frequency of speeding of 320 Queensland drivers. Despite growing community concern about speeding and extensive research linking it to road trauma, speeding remains a pervasive, and arguably, socially acceptable behaviour. This presents an apparent paradox regarding the mismatch between beliefs and behaviours, and highlights the necessity {{to better understand the}} factors contributing to speeding. Utilising self-reported behaviour and attitudinal measures, results of this study support the notion of a speed paradox. Two thirds of participants agreed that exceeding the limit is not worth the risks nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to exceed the posted limit. Despite this, more than half (58. 4 %) of the participants reported a preference to exceed the 100 km/hour speed limit, with one third preferring to do so by 10 to 20 km/hour. Further, mean preferred driving speeds on both urban and open roads suggest a perceived enforcement tolerance of 10 %, suggesting that posted limits have limited direct influence on speed choice. Factors that significantly predicted the frequency of speeding included: exposure to role models who speed; favourable attitudes to speeding; experiences of punishment avoidance; and the perceived certainty of punishment for speeding. These findings have important policy implications, particularly relating to the use of enforcement tolerances...|$|E

Alison Taylor (The Five Levels of an Ethical Culture, 2017) reported five levels of an ethical culture, from an individual, interpersonal, group, intergroup to inter-organizational (Taylor 2017). In (Nelson and Treviño 2004), ethical culture should be thought of {{in terms of a}} multi-system framework included formal and informal systems, which must be aligned to support ethical judgment and action. Leadership is essential to driving the ethical culture from a formal and informal perspective (Schwartz 2013; Trevino and Nelson 2011). Formally, a leader provides the resources to implement structures and programs that support ethics. More informally, through their own behaviors, leadership is a role model whose actions speak louder than their words, conveying “how we do things around here.” Other formal systems include selection systems, policies and codes, orientation and training programs, performance management systems, authority structures, and formal decision processes. On the informal side are the organization’s role models and heroes, the norms of daily behavior, organizational rituals that support or do not support ethical conduct, the stories people tell about the organization and their implications for conduct, and the language people use, etc. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to talk about ethics?

If I have a caesarean {{for my first}} baby do all the other births have to be caesareans as well? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> {{for a woman to}} have a caesarean just because she wants one…or is she being selfish? What are the real risks of caesarean section? And why is the caesarean rate rising steadily in Australia, so that one in three babies is now born this way? These questions, and many others about this hotly-debated surgical operation, are all answered in Hail Caesar, a well-informed and provocative explanation of every aspect of caesarean birth. From the pen of a woman doctor who has personally performed more than 4, 000 caesareans comes a guide to the operation packed with facts, sympathetic to all viewpoints, and up-to-date in its attitudes. Caesarean, says Caroline de Costa, while not a natural method of birth, is now both common and safe, and should be {{regarded as one of the}} normal birth methods. Accurate information about the surgery should be supplied to all pregnant women, so that when faced with the possibility of the surgery for themselves they can make an informed decision. Currently women who give birth by caesarean too often end up feeling guilty or negative about their experience because they have not been well prepared.

40|$|As we {{went through}} the program, what we determined, and what we all agreed on, was that the thrust {{coefficient}} (Cf) of the nozzle, after you get past a certain point, is really an engineering parameter. It s not a fundamental parameter {{that is going to be}} highly variable. Once we knew what the contour of the nozzle was, and once we knew what its characteristic was out to 2 : 1, we could calculate what the 48 : 1 thrust coefficient was going to be. In every case that we made a test, the calculation was precise. We weren't looking for a problem out at 48 : 1. Once we crushed the nozzle and said, "Yeah, we can land on the boulder," and once we had the thermal profile of that columbium nozzle, we did not require a lot of effort there. The real characterization was done in throttling over the 10 : 1 with the injector and controlling the mixture ratio on that - the whole head-end assembly - out to 2 : 1. I think everybody at NASA and Grumman agreed that flying like you test is great, particularly if you are using an aircraft engine. But, in this case, the thrust coefficient of the nozzle was not an issue. We had the tandem configuration of the service module, the command module, and the LEM sitting out there, and we were to fire the LEM. On Apollo 5, we were firing the LEM to show how it would work. There was a problem. I can t remember where the problem was, but something caused a problem before that engine had finished its burn. It was not in the engine, but there was some other problem, and NASA made a controlled shutdown. Then, they came to us and asked, "Hey, we re up there. We want to finish this test program. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> if we restart that engine again in space with this tandem configuration?" We said, "As long as it has been more than forty minutes since you shut down, our analysis says that you will be okay in terms of the thermal characteristics of the inside of that chamber. " They restarted it and pushed that system around in orbit on Apollo 5. It turned out, that when it came to Apollo 13, we went back into the record, and said, "Hey, we have pushed this system around up there on Apollo 5, and we have also restarted this tandem configuration. " The requirements on Apollo 13 were to put it back into play. The spacecraft was out of free return to the earth at the time of the accident. It would not have come back. NASA said, "Okay, we ll use the descent engine to put the spacecraft in a free trajectory; it will go around the moon and be on free trajectory back to Earth. " Then, as it came around the far side of the moon, the guys found out that they had an oxygen problem. As you remember, things were getting pretty bad in there. They said, "We ve got to get it back as fast as we can. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> if we re-fire the engine? Now, we re in a free trajectory, so we want to put as much delta-v (or change in velocity) in as we can. Can we re-fire right now?" We said, "Yes, the data says it has been this period of time. " We could re-fire the engine, run the rest of the duty cycle up as far as we needed while preserving enough fluids to make the final correction as the spacecraft got near Earth, and restart the engine. It was pretty fortuitous that we could give them those answers...|$|E
40|$|For a {{very long}} time now I have been quite {{interested}} in having my personal web server. Senior project gave me the perfect opportunity to explore and to custom design web server that would fit my future storage/web needs. There are multiple aspects of the project that I worked on to custom design the web server. The list and brief description of each of these categories is given bellow. 1. 	Ftp Options: There are several ftp options available, so I researched these options and found the client service that would work best with my requirements. 2. 	Number of Users: One of the critical aspects of the server construction requirement is that each user should have access to sufficient amount of storage, processor power, and memory allocated to have flawless usage. Therefore, I would need to estimate my data sharing needs which would determine the type of processor and amount RAM. Hard drive space would also be dependent on this. 3. 	Security Issues: This {{is also one of the}} major parts of the project to determine the system environment for secure data sharing. 4. 	Required Storage: I already have multiple relatively large hard drives that I have been using for quite some time now, but it seems that with growing trends in technology gigabytes are turning into megabytes. Therefore I would want to start with large storage up front, and still have options to increase storage in future. 5. 	Required Speed: Speed is quite critical for large data sharing, so I would need to research and implement solution that would be relatively high speed enabled. 6. 	Power Efficiency: Server by nature is going to be run all the time, so I would want to have system that is power efficient. 7. 	Minimum specification: I would also need to set minimum system specification, so that I can have longer time before next hardware upgrade needed. 8. 	Redundant Components: It is very common to have redundant system components in server system such as power supplies, and ethernet ports. These components would provide uninterrupted access even if one of them fails. I would need to find components that would best fit my needs. 9. 	Operating System Selection: There are many options available for OS ranging from Windows, Redhat, to open linux. Each of these have different functions, and so I would need to closely study them to find appropriate OS for my system. 10. 	Hard Drive Raid Options: There are several different types of hard drive raid options available, some are hardware based and some are software based. I would need to evaluate these options to find appropriate option for me. 11. 	Cost and Benefit Analysis: Last but not least, I would need to do cost and benefit analysis to see how much I am getting for the money I spend. Is it beneficial to choose the highest performance system? Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to go with second or third best in market? This way I would get most for the money I spend...|$|E
