5|$|In 358, Julian first turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to the Frankish tribes, {{crossing}} the lower Rhine {{and forced the}} Salii and Chamavi tribes to surrender and become tributarii (tribute-payers).

Finally, he again switched <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to the Alamanni, {{crossing the}} Rhine at Mainz and forcing the submission of the new paramount kings Hortarius and Surmarius.|$|E
5|$|Their first target, the isle of Saint Vincent, fell on June 18th, and d'Estaing turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> {{to other}} islands. He {{had hoped to}} capture Barbados, a key British possession, but after making no {{progress}} against the prevailing easterly trade winds, he turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> instead to Grenada.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912â€“13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b> Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Beach Thomas {{was the son}} of a rural clergyman. He {{attended}} Shrewsbury School and the University of Oxford before {{embarking on}} a short-lived career as a schoolmaster.

5|$|From that point, Manne refocused <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> {{on his own}} drumming. It {{might be}} argued that he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he {{recorded}} numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.|$|E
5|$|Julian {{now turned}} <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to {{rebuilding}} the fortress at Tres Tabernae (Saverne), {{which had been}} destroyed by the Alamanni.

6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} frank and honourable, Mr. Littlepage, since it enables Miss Wallace {{to understand the}} object of <b>his</b> <b>attentions,</b> and leaves nothing to doubt, or uncertainty." ...|$|R
5|$|Keynes {{was always}} {{confident}} {{he could find}} a solution to whatever problem he turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to, and retained a lasting faith in the ability of government officials to do good.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March 1938, Hitler {{announced}} {{the unification of}} Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Hitler then turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer did {{important}} {{research in}} theoretical astronomy (especially {{as related to}} general relativity and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and quantum field theory, including its extension into quantum electrodynamics. The formal mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics also attracted <b>his</b> <b>attention,</b> although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, which include the neutron, meson and neutron star.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of whom {{else should}} I speak?--Has {{he not been}} your shadow the whole day?--so marked in <b>his</b> <b>attentions,</b> as scarce to deem it {{necessary}} to conceal his suit?" ...|$|R
5|$|Instead, {{he turned}} <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> to the Anstruther Burghs, {{a set of}} five burghs which were located only 15 miles from his newly {{purchased}} estate at Balgonie in Fife.|$|R

5|$|Simpson and Percy {{made the}} podium in every {{meeting of the}} ISAF Sailing World Cup in 2012, {{including}} gold at the Hyeres French World Cup regatta. They competed at the 2012 Olympic Games, again in the Star class, failing to defend their title despite being in the lead throughout the competition, but winning the silver medal. After the Star class {{was removed from the}} Olympic sailing disciplines, Simpson turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to the America's Cup, moving to San Francisco to train in March 2013. He was known for his athleticism, and for <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to detail in preparing the boat to obtain the best possible performance.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, Fauxlivia visits Newton in a high-security prison, {{and passes}} him the {{equivalent}} of a suicide pill that causes him to self-destruct and bleed out mercury. Fauxlivia realizes Peter has become suspicious of her actions, and sleeps with him to draw away <b>his</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile Joe Turner {{saw that}} all the other {{passengers}} were got carefully out of the train. He was particularly polite in <b>his</b> <b>attentions,</b> however, to the [...] "late passenger!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense! <b>His</b> <b>attentions</b> {{are nothing}} but {{distress}} to her! Sensible grown-up young women are not apt to be flattered by importunity from silly boys. Has he told you otherwise?' ...|$|R
50|$|The bride was passionately in {{love with}} her husband, but <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> were elsewhere.

5|$|The Hindu {{practice}} of appearing before {{the people at}} the jharokha was started by Humayun, though the practice is generally credited to Akbar.

5|$|To {{fend off}} the Huns, Theodosius had to pay an {{enormous}} annual tribute to Attila. His successor, Marcian, refused to continue to pay the tribute, but Attila had already diverted <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> to the West. After Attila's death in 453, the Hunnic Empire collapsed, {{and many of the}} remaining Huns were often hired as mercenaries by Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist. For a time he turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence {{he was able to}} complete his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E
60|$|He added {{many other}} tender speeches to this declaration, and the Princess, to whom such remarks were a new experience, {{could not help}} feeling pleased and touched by <b>his</b> <b>attentions.</b>|$|R
