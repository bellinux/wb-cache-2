5|$|Reynolds {{was born}} on February 10, 1917, in Bethany, Oklahoma. His father was a preacher in the Church of the Nazarene. His mother {{was a member of}} the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. As a young child, he didn't play baseball, as his father did not approve of playing sports on Sundays. Reynolds {{threatened}} to run away from home <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> wouldn't let him play football; his father relented.|$|E
5|$|Petrović {{worked for}} a number of landlords {{throughout}} Šumadija until 1787, when he and his family left the region and settled in the Austrian Empire, fearing persecution {{at the hands of the}} Ottoman janissaries. It is said that as they were preparing to cross the Danube into Austria, Petrović's father began to have second thoughts about leaving Šumadija. Knowing that the entire family would be put in jeopardy <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> stayed behind, Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It was almost impossible to find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E

25|$|Abe, and indirectly, the Tokugawa shogun, were {{disturbed}} by Nariakira’s removal from responsibility over the Ryūkyū Western Trade Treaty crisis because their policy concerning {{the crisis was}} predicated on their trust in him, not in his father or Zusho Hirosato. Narioki and Zusho had already proven themselves untrustworthy by not being completely reliable on matters concerning Ryūkyū. Abe knew {{that the only way}} Nariakira could gain control of the Ryūkyū crisis was <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> and Zusho were removed; through Abe’s intervention, this too was accomplished.|$|E
25|$|Grace {{never went}} to {{university}} as his father was intent upon him pursuing a medical career. But Grace was approached by both Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club. In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate. Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from Caius College, Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition. Grace {{said he would have}} gone to either Oxford or Cambridge <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> had allowed it. Instead, he enrolled at Bristol Medical School in October 1868, when he was 20.|$|E
25|$|Tsarnaev {{was born}} in Kyrgyzstan. As a child, he emigrated {{with his family to}} Russia and then, when he was eight years old, to the United States under {{political}} asylum. The family settled in Cambridge and became U.S. permanent residents in March 2007. He became a U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012, while in college. His mother, Zubeidat, also became a U.S. citizen, {{but it is not clear}} <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> Anzor, ever did. Tamerlan, his brother, was unable to naturalize expeditiously due to an investigation against him, which held up the citizenship process. At Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a public high school, he was an avid wrestler, and a Greater Boston League winter all-star. He sometimes worked as a lifeguard at Harvard University.|$|E
50|$|Nelsson {{started playing}} {{football}} {{when he was}} 4 years old in Hornbæk <b>IF,</b> where <b>his</b> <b>father</b> also was trainer. Later, he got contacted by scouts from FC Nordsjælland, and joined the club on 25 March 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{other members}} of the Rougon-Macquart family also appear in L'argent: Saccard's sons Maxime (b. 1840) and Victor (b. 1853). <b>If</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> {{obsession}} is with building wealth, Maxime's obsession is with keeping it. A widower, Maxime (who {{played a central role in}} La curée) lives alone in opulence he does not share. In Le docteur Pascal, Maxime is described as prematurely aged, afraid of pleasure and indeed of all life, devoid of emotion, and cold, characteristics introduced in L'argent. Maxime is described as a [...] "dissemination" [...] of characteristics, having the moral prepotency of <b>his</b> <b>father</b> and the pampered egotism of his mother (Saccard's first wife).|$|R

500|$|Although {{his father}} destined John for a {{clerical}} career, {{according to the}} late 13th-century Tales of the Minstrel of Reims he [...] "was unwilling". Instead, the minstrel continued, John fled to his maternal uncle at the Clairvaux Abbey. Encouraged by his fellows, he became a knight and earned a reputation in tournaments and fights. Although elements of the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims are apparently invented (for instance, John {{did not have a}} maternal uncle in Clairvaux), historian Guy Perry wrote that it may have preserved details of John's life. A church career was not unusual for youngest sons of 12th-century noblemen in France; however, <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> sent John to a monastery he left before reaching the age of taking monastic vows. John [...] "clearly developed the physique that was necessary to fight well" [...] in his youth, because the 13th-century sources Akropolites and Salimbene di Adam emphasize his physical strength.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were strongly}} interested in [...] "world building," [...] and the alternate universe {{allowed them to}} create a very similar world with {{a large amount of}} detail to fill in the texture of the world. An alternate universe also allowed them to show [...] "how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line," [...] according to co-director Jeff Pinkner. However, the producers also realized the concept of the alternate universe could be confusing to viewers. To avoid this, elements of the world were introduced in small pieces {{over the course of the}} first two seasons before the larger revelation in the second-season finale and the third season. J. H. Wyman stated that he would often pass the story ideas for the alternate universe by his father to see if it made sense, and would rework the script <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> found it confusing. Such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from the alternate universe with nearly no ties to the main characters; as stated by Wyman, they would be able to [...] "make two shows about one show," [...] a concept that the network executives embraced.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a lot of}} character development {{that many of the}} actors had been waiting for. Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going to the prom begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured the moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would be like <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the support beam that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day become. This is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
60|$|Norman felt as <b>if,</b> while <b>his</b> <b>father</b> {{looked at}} him as he now did, {{the rest of the world}} were nothing to him; but, perhaps, the driving past the school brought him to a {{different}} mind, for he walked into the house slowly and dejectedly.|$|R

The two are off on the final leg of the journey stopping along the way in Alek's hometown where they elude police. Although they reach Istanbul {{they do not have}} tickets but in the quest to get them Liverpool stars Kenny Dalglish, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, recognise him who come to the rescue and makes possible for Will to realise his dream and much more than he could have imagined <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> original plans had come to be.|$|R

2500|$|In a CBS {{interview}} with Katie Couric, Wayne described why he {{goes by the}} name of [...] "Wayne" [...] instead of his given name, Dwayne. Carter explained, [...] "I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne". Couric asked Wayne <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> knew of this and Wayne replied with a smile, [...] "He knows now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{death of}} his father {{impacted}} Mkhitaryan greatly. He feels that <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was still alive, [...] "everything would be different." [...] He gave him useful advice from a professional point of view. People who have watched Mkhitaryan and his father, say that their styles resemble each other very much. He has said, [...] "I believe he sees me and is proud of me…" [...] His mother {{is the head of the}} national teams department in the Armenian Football Federation and his elder sister, Monica, works at UEFA's headquarters.|$|E

Placide explains {{this is going}} to be rather difficult: 1) woman do not turn up again after a date, 2) he is afraid to have children as ugly as the daughters of his brother.|$|R

50|$|Censorinus (died 53 BC) was {{a friend}} and {{contemporary}} of Publius Crassus, son of the triumvir Marcus Crassus.

2500|$|Grace {{had been}} [...] "notoriously unscholarly" [...] as a boy.

In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate.

2500|$|After {{their return}} to New York City from a brief visit to Mar del Plata in 1930, {{the family moved to}} Little Italy in lower Manhattan. In 1932 Piazzolla {{composed}} his first tango, [...] "La Catinga". The following year he took music lessons with the Hungarian classical pianist Bela Wilda, a student of Rachmaninoff who taught him to play Bach on his bandoneon. In 1934 he met Carlos Gardel, {{one of the most important}} figures in the history of tango, and played a cameo role as a paper boy in his movie El día que me quieras. Gardel invited the young bandoneon player to join him on his [...] tour. Much to Piazzolla's dismay, his father decided that he was not old enough to go along. The disappointment of being forbidden to join the tour proved to be fortunate, as it was on this tour in 1935 that Gardel and his entire orchestra perished in a plane crash. In later years, Piazzolla made light of this near miss, joking that <b>if</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> had not been so careful, Piazzolla would be playing the harp rather than the bandoneon.|$|E

But Rose was wide-awake, and escaped all his snares, professing great contempt for such foolish customs.
