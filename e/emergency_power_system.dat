25|$|On 30 June 2012 around 6:25 hours local time, {{an alarm}} went off, and the cooling {{system of the}} spent fuel pool halted. At that time, the {{temperature}} was 33.3 degrees Celsius; no leakage of radioactive contaminated water was reported. On 4 June, a similar situation caused the cooling to be halted. On 1 July shortly after 3 p.m. the cooling was resumed, the water temperature of the pool having risen to 42.9°C. TEPCO had feared that the temperature could reach 65°C, the upper limit designated in safety regulations.

50|$|A continual {{power system}} is a {{large-scale}} system for reliably supplying large amounts of uninterrupted power. Examples of a continual power system include uninterruptible power supply and an <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system.</b> The need for a continual power system has risen {{over the last few}} decades because energy resources in the market are getting less and at a higher price as the industrial revolution progresses. This is due to several reasons such as the growth in global economy, depletion of energy resources, and the environmental impacts of energy production.|$|E
30|$|A {{study by}} Klebanoff et al. showed that PEMFC could {{successfully}} replace the {{ram air turbine}} (RAT) <b>emergency</b> backup <b>power</b> <b>system</b> [5]. Hence, leading aircraft manufacturers are working on PEMFC-powered propulsions and APUs as part of establishing “more-electric airplanes” [1, 6]. The “more-electric airplanes” will replace the pneumatically powered and hydraulically <b>powered</b> <b>systems</b> (e.g., ECS and cargo doors) with lighter and more efficient electric systems [7]. Consequently, PEMFC is tested for various aeronautic applications, ranging from nose wheel drive motor, hybrid with batteries, exclusively powering small manned aircrafts to <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> [8, 9, 10, 11].|$|R

50|$|An {{uninterruptible}} power supply, also uninterruptible power source, UPS or battery/flywheel backup, is {{an electrical}} apparatus that provides emergency {{power to a}} load when the input power source or mains power fails. A UPS differs from an auxiliary or <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The on-battery runtime of most uninterruptible power sources is relatively short (only a few minutes) but sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment.|$|E
50|$|Power {{supply of}} the line is {{provided}} at two different points. In case of power cut at both supply points, an <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> that becomes operational within 15 seconds, ensures running of the trains until the next station. If the backup generator system fails, an uninterruptible power source (UPS) supplies energy for emergency lighting and the electronic devices at the operations control center up to three hours. The signalization of the metro line {{as well as at}} the depots and railroad switches, also the vehicle drive-control systems are fully automated. However, they can be handled manually when needed.|$|E

5000|$|Long term {{power outages}} can cause damage beyond the {{original}} disaster {{that can be}} mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system.</b> The United States Department of Energy states: [...] "homeowners, business owners, and local leaders may have {{to take an active}} role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own." [...] Major institutions like hospitals, military bases and educational institutions often have extensive backup power systems.Preparedness does not stop at home or at school. The United States Department of Health and Human Services addresses specific emergency preparedness issues hospitals may have to respond to, including maintaining a safe temperature, providing adequate electricity for life support systems and even carrying out evacuations under extreme circumstances. FEMA encourages all businesses to have an emergency response plan and the Small Business Administration specifically advises small business owners to also focus emergency preparedness and provides a variety of different worksheets and resources.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{claim that}} laws against price-gouging could {{discourage}} businesses from proactively {{preparing for a}} disaster. One example given {{in support of this}} view is that a business could install an expensive <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> for power outages. However, if it is prohibited from large price increases, the costs cannot be recovered during the relatively short amount of time when there is no power. As a result, a business that proactively prepared could not compete with others that did not. (This is generally unnecessary for similar businesses in close proximity to one another, anyway.) According to this theory, the end result would be needless shortages and more hardship for the public, or under extreme circumstances, it could be deadly. To correct the situation, those opposed to price gouging laws argue that if not abolished entirely, laws would have to be amended to allow the amortization of equipment that is useful only during a disaster. Unlike amortizing for tax purposes, this would account for how equipment is sporadically paid off internally with the extra revenue, which is not normally done.|$|E
5000|$|FEMA {{notes that}} long term power outages can cause damage beyond the {{original}} disaster {{that can be}} mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an <b>Emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system.</b> The United States Department of Energy states that 'homeowners, business owners, and local leaders may have {{to take an active}} role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own." [...] This active role may include installing or other procuring generators that are either portable or permanently mounted and run on fuels such as propane or natural gas or gasoline. Concerns about carbon monoxide poisoning, electrocution, flooding, fuel storage and fire lead even small property owners to consider professional installation and maintenance. Major institutions like hospitals, military bases and educational institutions often have or are considering extensive backup power systems. Instead of, or in addition to, fuel-based power systems, solar, wind and other alternative power sources may be used. Standalone batteries, large or small, are also used to provide backup charging for electrical systems and devices ranging from emergency lights to computers to cell phones.|$|E
5000|$|In {{hydraulic}} elevator <b>systems,</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> {{will lower}} the elevators {{to the lowest}} landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>systems.</b> Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, {{the increasing use of}} current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as [...] "soft-start" [...] contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.|$|R

50|$|In recent years, large {{units of}} a utility power station are usually {{designed}} on a unit system basis {{in which the}} required devices, including the boiler, the turbine generator unit, and its power (step up) and unit (auxiliary) transformer are solidly connected as one unit. A less common set-up consists of two units grouped together with one common station auxiliary. As each turbine generator unit has its own attached unit auxiliary transformer, it {{is connected to the}} circuit automatically. For starting the unit, the auxiliaries are supplied with power by another unit (auxiliary) transformer or station auxiliary transformer. The period of switching from the first unit transformer to the next unit is designed for automatic, instantaneous operation in times when the <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> needs to kick in. It is imperative that the power to unit auxiliaries not fail during a station shutdown (an occurrence known as black-out when all regular units temporarily fail). Instead, during shutdowns the grid is expected to remain operational. When problems occur, it is usually due to reverse power relays and frequency-operated relays on grid lines due to severe grid disturbances. Under these circumstances, the emergency station supply must kick in to avoid damage to any equipment and to prevent hazardous situations such as the release of hydrogen gas from generators to the local environment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{beginning}} of Route A takes {{place after the}} incident occurs and is told from Watase's perspective. Early on in the rescue operation, Watase encounters a [...] "monster" [...] and faints. He wakes up with amnesia, unable to remember {{who he is and}} what he is doing at LABO. Through the assistance of two of his squadmates - Kazami and Jun - and a hallucinatory voice he keeps hearing in his head, Watase progresses to gather information about himself and the situation. The three meet and rescue three other trapped civilians: Yuuri, Ena and Ukita. At a security room in LABO, the group of six learn that three other people (Natsuhiko's group) are also stuck in LABO. Watase's group decide to collaborate to search for the other party and find an escape route. Along the way, they encounter two murder scenes (one of a girl they had never seen before) and learn of a possibility that a terrorist group is in LABO. This forms a rift in the group where they believe one of them may be a potential terrorist and traitor, the most suspicious being Watase due to his amnesia. The distrust heightens when Yuuri disappears and Watase finds her dead near a staircase; at the security room, the group views the video footage recorded where Watase claims to have found Yuuri but the body does not appear in the video, leading Jun and Ukita to be skeptic of Watase and firmly believe him to be the traitor in the group. Watase escapes from the room and determines {{that the only way to}} save everyone is to head for the center of LABO where the nuclear reactor is located at ("Area N"). Upon entering Area N, expecting there to be a burning reactor, he finds a cold room with machines in it instead. Confused by the situation, he goes further in and finds Natsuhiko's body in critical condition. As Watase begins to carry Natsuhiko's body to take him to the infirmary, Salyu appears and confronts him, at which Watase ends up putting her unconscious. Carrying Natsuhiko and Salyu's bodies to the infirmary, Watase encounters Kazami who assists with him on performing a blood transfusion for Natsuhiko. During the process, Watase and Kazami are forced to run away as Ukita and Jun, each with a weapon in their hand, locates the two. A blackout occurs and the <b>emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> is booted up; in the midst of it, Salyu awakens and attempts to choke Kazami while stating that Watase was the one who shot Natsuhiko and is a terrorist; Kazami breaks free of Salyu's grasp and, after confirming Salyu's announcement, attacks Watase. Watase, with Natsuhiko's body, bolts back towards Area N for safety, locks the gate and collapses. In the last scene, as Watase loses consciousness, he sees Natsuhiko standing up and telling him to get up.|$|E

5|$|While {{none of the}} {{affected}} counties or cities {{declared a state of}} emergency following the event, the Small Business Administration did approve a request by the Office of Emergency Services for a disaster declaration in late September. This formality paved the way for low interest loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage, but only about 50 claims were expected. Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement.

5000|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> {{were used}} as early as World War II on naval ships. In combat, a ship may lose the {{function}} of its boilers, which power the steam turbines for the ship's generator. In such a case, one or more diesel engines are used to drive back-up generators. Early transfer switches relied on manual operation; two switches would be placed horizontally, in line and the [...] "on" [...] position facing each other. a rod is placed in between.
