40|$|Problems {{experienced}} during cure cycle of epoxy adhesives in film form concern especially false bonding due to extraneous substances (e. g., protective Teflon layer) or to an incorrect or too long storage of the adhesive. In {{addition to these}} problems, a sudden blackout or a not planar application of the pressure can hinder {{the performance of a}} complete polymerisation cycle. Thus, after having collected some information on the most frequent events that reduce joints quality in aerospace industry, all those cases were approximately reproduced in laboratory with a <b>hot-plates</b> press and materials really used in practice (2024 T 3 aluminium alloy treated with chromic acid anodization). Acoustic emission monitoring followed the whole period of cure cycle, indicating in real time occurrence of adhesion and/or polymerisation phenomena. A wide database was so created with all the cases of concrete industrial interest, so to allow a statistical evaluation of AE data, leading to a reliable quality evaluation. Results obtained by acoustic emission were confirmed submitting adhesive specimens to a DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) analysis so to measure the degree of polymerisation and finally with shear tensile tests...|$|R

To apply hard ground of this variety, the plate to be etched is placed upon a <b>hot-plate</b> (set at 70 degrees C), a kind of metal worktop that is heated up. The plate heats up and the ground is applied by hand, melting onto the plate as it is applied. The ground is spread over the plate as evenly as {{possible}} using a roller.

40|$|A {{multi-purpose}} prepregging {{machine has}} been designed and built for NASA Langley Research Center. The machine has numerous advantages over existing units due to its various modular components. Each of these can be used individually or simultaneously depending on the required prepregging method. A reverse roll coater provides the ability to prepare thin films from typical hot-melt thermoset formulations. Also, if necessary, the design allows direct fiber impregnation within the reverse roll coater gap. Included in the impregnation module is a solution dip tank allowing the fabrication of thermoplastic prepregs from solution. The proceeding modules within the unit consist of four nip stations, two <b>hot-plates,</b> a hot-sled option and a high temperature oven. This paper describes the advantages of such a modular construction and discusses the various processing combinations available to the prepregger. A variety of high performance prepreg material systems were produced on IM 7 (Hercules) carbon fiber. These included LaRC RP 46, a PMR-type resin processed from methanol and two polyamide acids, LaRC IA and LaRC ITPI, prpregged from N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP). Parameters involved {{in the production of}} these prepreg materials are presented as are the mechanical properties of the resulting good quality laminates.

50|$|A {{heat-conductive}} surface, such as porcelain or metal, {{is heated}} to a temperature that will induce a nociceptive response in an animal subject - normally 50-56 °C. The subject is then placed {{onto the surface}} and prevented from leaving the platform by blockades. The latency to pain-reflex behavior is measured. One complication of this assay is its unsuitability for repeated testing. Animals that {{have been subjected to}} the <b>hot-plate</b> test in the past display a behavioral tolerance phenomenon, which is characterized by decreased latencies and reduced sensitivities to antinociceptive agents. Another complication of the <b>hot-plate</b> test is determining what constitutes a behavioral pain response; is it the lifting/licking of paws, vocalization, attempting to climb out of the cylinder, etc. Also, delivering the heat stimulus in a controlled fashion presents difficulties due to each section having varying temperatures based upon surface area exposure and whether the animal is moving or not.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, {{barbecues}} are {{a popular}} summer pastime.

Coin-operated or free public gas or electric barbecues are common in city parks. While Australian barbecue uses similar seasonings to its American counterpart, smoking or sugary sauces are used less often. Beer is often drizzled over cooking chops and steak during cooking, the theory being that it adds flavour while making the meat more tender. Meat is sometimes marinated for flavour and is then cooked on a hot plate or grill. Australian barbecues tend to be either all <b>hot-plate</b> or half and half hot-plate/grill.

Habituation to the unheated <b>hot-plate</b> reduced the basal nociceptive latency of SHR, suggesting cognitive/emotional modulation of pain in this strain, but did not alter the magnitude of CIA.

In the tail-flick and <b>hot-plate</b> test, PV was stimulated continuously {{for a period of}} 30 min, during which every 5 min either a tail-flick or <b>hot-plate</b> test was performed. Stimulation of PV induced important prolongations of the reaction times on tail-flick and <b>hot-plate</b> tests. However, there was no significant correlation between the results of the two tests. The effect of stimulation was immediate and did not outlast the stimulation period. PV stimulation did not give rise to tolerance, either within the stimulation period of 30 min, or during the successive testing days. After the termination of these acute pain tests, rats were inoculated with Mycobacterium butyricum. All animals developed polyarthritis. PV stimulation had a profound suppressive effect on the scratching and biting behaviour displayed by the animals. This reduction in scratching and biting behaviour was specific for PV stimulation since stimulation of another target, the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (4 animals), had no effect on these behaviours.

40|$|Objective and design: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} whether the antinociceptive activity of rofecoxib is mediated, at least in part, through changes in the brain serotonergic system. Materials and subjects: Male Wistar rats weighing 180 - 200 g (groups of eight) were subjected to the <b>hot-plate</b> and formalin tests after rofecoxib, treatment, Cortical areas were removed for serotonin (5 -HT) level, 5 -HT 2 and mu-receptor evaluation. Treatment: Rofecoxib was administered orally at doses of 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg for the time course evaluation in the <b>hot-plate</b> test (30, 60 and 120 min), and at the dose of 10 mg/kg for the formalin test and biochemical determinations. Methods: The tests performed were the <b>hot-plate</b> and the formalin assays. HPLC was used to determine 5 -HT levels and radioligand-binding assays were utilized to evaluate the characteristics of 5 -HT 2 and mu-receptors. The data were analysed by ANOVA or Student's t test. Results: The lowest active dose of rofecoxib in the <b>hot-plate</b> test was 10 mg/kg. The percentage of the maximum possible effect (%MPE) values were: control = 1. 7 +/- 3. 4; treated 23. 4 +/- 6. 5 (p< 6. 05). The same dose had a significant effect on both phases of the formalin test. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) significantly decreased the activity of rofecoxib in the <b>hot-plate</b> test, Rofecoxib treatment increased serotonin levels and decreased the maximum number of 5 -HT 2 receptors. 5 -HT levels (ng/g) were: control = 240. 1 +/- 28. 5, rofecoxib = 326. 1 +/- 19. 9 in the frontal cortex. The characteristics of mu-receptors did not change. Conclusions: These results suggest that rofecoxib may exert its therapeutic effect, at least in part, through the central serotonergic system.

Following left and right hind paw stimulation with a phlogogen and vehicle, respectively, the animals were placed individually on a <b>hot-plate</b> surface at 51 ºC and the withdrawal latency for each paw was determined simultaneously in measurements performed at 15, 60, 180, and 360 min post-challenge. Plantar stimulation of rats (250 and 500 µg/paw) and mice (125 - 500 µg/paw) with carrageen an led to a rapid hyperalgesic response of the ipsilateral paw that reached a plateau from 15 to 360 min after challenge. Pretreatment with indomethacin (4 mg/kg, ip) inhibited the phenomenon at all the times analyzed. Similarly, plantar stimulation of rats and mice with prostaglandin E 2 (0. 5 and 1 µg/paw) also resulted in rapid hyperalgesia which was first detected 15 min post-challenge. Finally, we observed that the MHP test was more sensitive than the classical Hargreaves' test, being able to detect about 4 - and 10 -fold lower doses of prostaglandin E 2 and carrageenan, respectively. In conclusion, the MHP test is a simple and sensitive method for detecting peripheral hyperalgesia and analgesia in rats and mice.
