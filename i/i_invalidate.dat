We calculate radiative corrections to its mass and to that of the heavier CP-even neutral Higgs boson. We find large corrections that increase with the top quark and squark masses, and vary with the ratio of vacuum expectation values ν 2 /ν 1. These radiative corrections can be as large as O(100) GeV, and have the effect of (<b>i)</b> <b>invalidating</b> lower bounds on ν 2 /ν 1 inferred from unsuccessful Higgs searches at LEP I, (ii) in many cases, increasing the mass of the lighter CP-even Higgs boson beyond mz, (iii) often, increasing the mass of the heavier CP-even Higgs boson beyond the LEP reach, into a range more accessible to the LHC or SSC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} tickets, a computational {{mechanism for}} hard-real-time autonomous resource management. Autonomous spacecraft control {{can be considered}} abstractly as a computational process whose outputs are spacecraft commands. In {{order to make the}} engineering of such systems tractable, these computations are usually organized as multiple parallel threads of control. It is sometimes necessary, particularly in emergency situations, for one thread of control not only to issue certain commands, but to actively prevent the issuing of other commands by other threads of control. Tickets are software objects that act as intermediaries between control processes and low-level commands. In order to gain access to a low-level command a control process must be in posession of a valid ticket for that command. Tickets can be <b>invalidated</b> <b>i...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{estimation of}} short dynamic panel data models with error cross-sectional dependence. It is shown that under spatially correlated errors, an additional, generally non-redundant, set of moment conditions becomes available for each i - specifically, instruments {{with respect to}} the individual(s) which unit i is spatially correlated with. We demonstrate that these moment conditions remain valid when the error term contains a common factor component, in which situation the standard moment conditions with respect to individual <b>i</b> itself are <b>invalidated,</b> and thereby the standard dynamic panel GMM estimators are inconsistent. The resulting estimators are computationally attractive and do not require estimating the number of unobserved factors. Simulated experiments show that the resulting method of moments estimators perform well in terms of both median bias and root median square error. ...|$|R

40|$|Discussions {{of how to}} {{establish}} peaceful societies occasionally arouse skepticism and controversy. Leaders and international scholars do not usually debate whether peace is desirable but rather how to achieve it in their societies. A comprehensive treatment of the concomitants of peace {{is beyond the scope}} of this chapter. However, we argue that one important element of a peaceful society is that its citizens are happy and satisfied with their lives. Several considerations arise regarding how peace and well-being are related and whether this relation should inform national policies. For example, although peaceful conditions may foster well-being, it is also possible that well-being facilitates attitudes and perceptions (such as trust and confidence in the government) that foster peace. If a happy citizenry contributes to peace, govern-ments should take well-being into account in their policy decisions. Nevertheless, one objection to this proposal is that focusing policies on well-being might detract attention from the social and economic situation. If feelings of well-being lead to positive perceptions of society, then abusive governments might choose to divert and entertain people without necessarily improving their actual living conditions. The potential misuse of policies informed by well-being, though possible, does not <b>invalidate</b> <b>i...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} GMM estimation of a short dynamic panel data model when the errors are correlated across individuals. We focus particularly on the conditions required in the cross-sectional dimension of the error process for the dynamic panel GMM estimator to remain consistent. To this end, we demonstrate that cross-sectional independence (or uncorrelatedness) is not necessary - rather, it suffices that, {{if there is such}} correlation in the errors, this is weak. We define a stochastic scalar sequence to be cross-sectionally weakly correlated at any given point in time if the sequence of the covariances of the observations across individuals i and j at time t, given the conditioning set of all time-invariant characteristics of individuals i and j, converges absolutely as N grows large. Spatial dependence satisfies this condition but factor structure dependence does not. Consequently, the dynamic panel GMM estimator is consistent only in the first case. Under cross-sectionally weakly correlated errors, an additional, non-redundant, set of moment conditions becomes relevant for each i - specifically, instruments with respect to the individual(s) which unit i is correlated with. We demonstrate that these moment conditions remain valid when the errors are subject to both weak and strong correlations, in which situation the standard moment conditions with respect to individual <b>i</b> itself are <b>invalidated</b> - meaning that the dynamic panel GMM estimator is inconsistent. Simulated experiments show that the resulting method of moments estimators largely outperform the conventional ones in terms of both median bias and root median square error. ...|$|R

At the time he entered China, Worthy was the first American reporter to visit and broadcast from there since the country's communist revolution in 1949. While in China Worthy interviewed Samuel David Hawkins, an American soldier who was captured by the Chinese during the Korean War and defected to China in 1953. His passport was seized upon {{his return to the}} U.S. from China and American lawyers Leonard Boudin and William Kunstler represented Worthy in an unsuccessful lawsuit seeking the return of his passport.

[...] Worthy was again represented by Kunstler, who successfully persuaded a federal appeals court to overturn Worthy's conviction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found the restrictions unconstitutional. The court held that the government could not make it a crime under the Constitution to return home without a passport. Years later, Kunstler wrote in his autobiography, My Life As A Radical Lawyer, that the Worthy passport case was his [...] "first experience arguing an issue about which I felt passionate," [...] was the [...] "first time <b>I</b> had ever <b>invalidated</b> a statute," [...] and that success [...] "confirmed my faith in the justice system." ...|$|R
40|$|Nutrition {{and eating}} habits {{are one of}} the items of healthy {{lifestyle}} as well as mental and physical well-being. Eating should be performed on regular basis and all nutrition components have to be represented in proper proportion. The interrelation of sugars, fats (seba) and proteins is very important (55 - 60 % : 25 - 30 % : 10 - 15 %), sufficient protein ingestion (3 - 6 portions a day), fruit and vegetables (3 - 5 portions a day), dairy products (2 - 3 portions a day), meat and meat products (1 - 2 portions a day). Drinking liquids should be sufficient and should be kept within the range of about 30 ml per 1 kg of our body weight, and of course the drinking liquids is important integral part of our nutrition. The aim of this work has been to evaluate and assess quality of eating habits of nurses working at Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Anaesthesiological Resuscitation Ward (ARW) according to NutriDan programme. In order to accomplish this aim the following four hypotheses have been postulated: H 1 The nurses working at ICU and ARW eat their meals on regular basis. H 2 The nurses working at ICU and ARW have their menus containing fruit and vegetables with ratio in accordance with recommended quantities for daily consumption (4 x 100 g). H 3 The consumption of liquids at work is lower than that out of work (at home). H 4 The interrelation of sugar, fat and proteins in nurse menus is in harmony with individual estimate of energy expenditure. Research has been outlined and drawn up as quantitative one and anonymous questionnaire (answer sheet) has been used containing 3 parts (general pat, special part and the menu mentioned above applied in time period of 24 hours). One hundred and four questionnaires (104) have been distributed in all while fifty-two (52) pieces of which have been given to nurses working at Anaesthesiological Resuscitation Ward and fifty-two (52) pieces of the questionnaire have been given to nurses working at Intensive Care Units. The aforementioned questionnaires have been distributed in three hospitals and seventy-three (73) have been received for our evaluation, of which forty-three (43) from nurses working at Anaesthesiological Resuscitation Ward and thirty (30) from nurses working at Intensive Care Units. For research data processing we have applied two programs: Microsoft Excel program and NutriDan program; the results obtained have been processed so as to be presented as graphs. The aim of the work has been fulfilled and the hypotheses 1, 2 and 4 se have been <b>invalidated</b> <b>i.</b> e. disconfirmed whereas the hypothesis 3 has been confirmed. The nurses working at Intensive Care Units and Anaesthesiological Resuscitation Ward do not eat their meals on regular basis, they often have lower energy taking, moreover they do not have correct interrelation of sugar, fat and proteins. The aforementioned nurses show lower and irregular consumption of fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products and dietary fibre. Consumption of liquids is sufficient both at work and at home. The management of hospitals and wards as well will be made familiar with the results of this bachelor's degree diploma work i. e. those where the research has been carried out. This work {{can be used as a}} source material for lectures and enlightenment material in order to change the attitude of nurses of intensive care to eating habits of theirs...|$|R
