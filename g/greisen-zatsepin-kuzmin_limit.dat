40|$|Abstract We {{show that}} in a large class of models the string {{excitation}} and black hole pictures invoked as an explanation of trans-GZK cosmic ray events are equivalent. Single particle inclusive distributions are thermal at the Hagedorn temperature. The hadron multiplicities are reminiscent of multiplicities in heavy nucleus initiated interactions. Primary cosmic rays of energies exceeding the <b>Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin</b> (GZK) <b>limit</b> pose an exciting challenge to particle physics and/or astrophysics. In essence, there are no known sources within about 50 Mpc capable of producing hadrons of energies substantially exceeding energies of 5 × 10 19 eV. Nevertheless, the trans-GZK cosmic rays produce air showers very similar in their structure to hadron induced ones. For a recent review of this puzzle, the reader may consult Sigl’s article [1]. In order to resolve the puzzle, we conjectured [2] that the primaries are neutrinos, which are able to penetrate {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMBR) essentially uninhibited. In interactions with atmospheric nuclei, however, they have CM...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the highest energy cosmic rays remains an enigma.

They must be accelerated locally, as otherwise background radiations would severely suppress the flux of protons and nuclei, at energies above the <b>Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin</b> (GZK) <b>limit.</b> Nearby Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), Hypernovae, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and their flares, have all been suggested and debated as possible sources. A local sub-population of type Ibc supernovae (SNe) with mildly relativistic outflows have been detected as sub-energetic GRBs or X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) and recently as radio afterglows without detected GRB counterparts. We measure the size-magnetic field evolution, baryon loading and energetics, using the observed radio spectra of SN 2009 bb.

40|$|Understanding {{the origin}} of the highest energy cosmic rays is a crucial step in probing new physics at {{energies}} unattainable by terrestrial accelerators. Their sources remain an enigma half a century after their discovery. They must be accelerated in the local universe as otherwise interaction with cosmic background radiations would severely deplete the flux of protons and nuclei at energies above the <b>Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin</b> (GZK) <b>limit.</b> Hypernovae, nearby GRBs, AGNs and their flares have all been suggested and debated in the literature as possible sources. Type Ibc supernovae have a local sub-population with mildly relativistic ejecta which are known to be sub-energetic GRBs or X-Ray Flashes for sometime and more recently as those with radio afterglows but without detected GRB counterparts, such as SN 2009 bb. In this work we measure the size-magnetic field evolution, baryon loading and energetics of SN 2009 bb using its radio spectra obtained with VLA and GMRT. We show that the engine-driven SNe lie above the Hillas line and they can explain the characteristics of post-GZK UHECRs.

25|$|In theory, either {{high enough}} energy {{concentrations}} or random chance could trigger the tunneling needed to set this event in motion. However an immense number of ultra-high energy particles and events {{have occurred in}} the history of our universe, dwarfing by many orders of magnitude any events at human disposal. Hut and Rees note that, because we have observed cosmic ray collisions at much higher energies than those produced in terrestrial particle accelerators, these experiments should not, at least for the foreseeable future, pose a threat to our current vacuum. Particle accelerators have reached energies of only approximately eight tera electron volts (8×1012 eV). Cosmic ray collisions have been observed at and beyond energies of 1018 eV, a million times more powerful– the so-called <b>Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin</b> <b>limit</b> – and other cosmic events may be more powerful yet. Against this, John Leslie has argued that if present trends continue, particle accelerators will exceed the energy given off in naturally occurring cosmic ray collisions by the year 2150. Fears of this kind were raised by critics of both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider at the time of their respective proposal, and determined to be unfounded by scientific inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of {{the energy}} and arrival {{directions}} of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 {{by members of the}} Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020eV. A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical <b>Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin</b> <b>limit</b> to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin and}} nature of extreme energy cosmic rays (EECRs), which have {{energies}} above the 50 EeV, the <b>Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin</b> (GZK) energy <b>limit,</b> {{is one of the}} most interesting and complicated problems in modern cosmic-ray physics. Existing ground-based detectors have helped to obtain remarkable results in studying cosmic rays before and after the GZK limit, but have also produced some contradictions in our understanding of cosmic ray mass composition. Moreover, each of these detectors covers only a part of the celestial sphere, which poses problems for studying the arrival directions of EECRs and identifying their sources. As a new generation of EECR space detectors, TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up), KLYPVE and JEM-EUSO, are intended to study the most energetic cosmic-ray particles, providing larger, uniform exposures of the entire celestial sphere. The TUS detector, launched on board the Lomonosov satellite on April 28, 2016, from Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia, is the first of these. It employs a single-mirror optical system and a photomultiplier tube matrix as a photo-detector and will test the fluorescent method of measuring EECRs from space. Utilizing the Earth's atmosphere as a huge calorimeter, it is expected to detect EECRs with energies above 100 EeV. It will also be able to register slower atmospheric transient events: atmospheric fluorescence in electrical discharges of various types including precipitating electrons escaping the magnetosphere and from the radiation of meteors passing through the atmosphere. We describe the design of the TUS detector and present results of different ground-based tests and simulations. Comment: 19 pages; v 2 : figures 6 and 9 replaced to match the published versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} pattern of the onset of {{complete}} absorption (the black limit) in the high energy hadron-hadron collisions. The black limit arises due to the hard and soft interaction dynamics {{as a function of the}} impact parameters b. Both hard and soft mechanisms provide universal dependence of the partial amplitude of the high energy elastic hadron- hadron scattering on the impact parameter b and result in the radius of interaction proportional to (s/s_ 0). We find that with increase of the collision energies hard interactions lead to a faster increase of the impact parameter range where the partial wave amplitudes are approaching the unitarity limit. Consequently, we argue that at super high energies whenthe radius of hadronic interactions significantly exceeds static radii of the interacting hadrons(nuclei) the ratio of total cross sections of nucleon-nucleon, meson-nucleon, hadron-nucleus, nucleus-nucleus collisions becomes equal to one. The same universality is also expected for the structure functions of nuclei: F_ 2 A(x,Q^ 2) /F_ 2 N(x,Q^ 2) > → 1, at very small x, and for the ratio >σ_gamma A/>σ_>γ p→ 1 at superhigh energies. We analyze how accounting for the energy dependence of the interaction radii changes the geometry of hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, the energy dependence of total, absorption and inelastic cross sections, the distribution over the number of wounded nucleons in proton-nucleus collisions and find that these effects are noticeable already for the LHC energies and even more so close to the <b>Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin</b> <b>limit.</b> Comment: 24 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
