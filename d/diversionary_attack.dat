5|$|The {{extent to}} which both Graffham and Fortitude North {{influenced}} German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed, with some historians arguing that very little of either deception reached the enemy. While others argue {{that the existence of}} fictional units in Scotland helped confirm German fears of a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> in the region.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack.</b> As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E

50|$|The {{attack on}} al-Faw {{was preceded by}} Iraqi <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> in {{northern}} Iraq, using the Iranian opposition group the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, which supported Iraq.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{the advance}} to Es Salt and Amman, <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> {{across the entire}} front were planned to precede {{the passage of the}} Jordan River and the {{establishment}} of a bridgehead on the eastern bank. The <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> were to be coordinated with an Arab raid led to T. E. Lawrence on the Hejaz railway station at Deraa. This railway line ran from Constantinople to Damascus, continuing southwards through eastern Syria [...] east of Jerusalem all the way to Medina.|$|R
5|$|Madero {{sent some}} of his forces to make a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> on Agua Prieta, which proved successful; the {{resulting}} First Battle of Agua Prieta was significant {{in that it was}} the first time railroads were used by the rebels to gain surprise and that US forces were involved in the fighting. The town was recaptured by federal troops two weeks later once additional reinforcements arrived.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a {{military}} engagement fought primarily {{as part of the}} Battle of Arras, in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, during the First World War. The main combatants were the Canadian Corps, of four divisions, against three divisions of the German Sixth Army. The battle, which took place from 9 to 12 April 1917, was part of the opening phase of the British-led Battle of Arras, a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> for the French Nivelle Offensive.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France. By that time, the BEF {{consisted}} of 10 infantry divisions in three corps, a tank brigade and a Royal Air Force detachment of around 500 aircraft. The BEF was pinned by a German <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> through Belgium and then isolated {{by the main}} attack that came through the Ardennes forest. Well-equipped and highly mobile Panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht overran the French and then British prepared defences. There was some fierce fighting, however being dwarfed by the German land forces most of the BEF withdrew to a small area around the French port of Dunkirk.|$|E
50|$|The {{battered}} 308th {{played a}} minor {{role in the}} Battle of the Day River in May/June 1951, making <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> on Ninh Bình and Phủ Lý.|$|R
50|$|This version, {{which was}} executed, {{was an attack}} from the Estonian west coast. There were a series of <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> to confuse the Soviet {{defenders}} - Südwind, Westwind and Nordwind.|$|R
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} its {{secondary}} role, during {{the balance of}} October and November, during the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive Operation, the army was twice ordered to make <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks.</b> Rokossovsky wrote in his memoirs: ...|$|R
5|$|Now {{in charge}} of the {{resistance}} on Naboo, Sykes leads a mission to liberate the Camp 4, a detention center where the Trade Federation has placed most of Naboo's important leaders. After the camp is freed, Sykes is contacted by Captain Panaka, and the plan to finally liberate Naboo is set in motion. After taking part in the <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> on Theed that allows Queen Amidala and Panaka to infiltrate the Palace and capture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, Sykes joins the rest of Bravo Flight in the climactic assault on the Droid Control Ship. Partnered with R2-C4, Sykes knocks out the Droid Control Ship's Shield Generator, which allows young Anakin Skywalker to destroy the ship from within. With the Trade Federation army disabled, Naboo is freed.|$|E
5|$|Operation Windsor {{was planned}} to {{commence}} at 05:00 on 4 July, following a bombardment by 21 artillery regiments, with Le Régiment de la Chaudière and The North Shore Regiment attacking Carpiquet, as {{a squadron of}} the Sherbrooke Fusiliers protected the northern flank with a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> on Franqueville. To the south, the RWR was to advance and seize the hangars of Carpiquet airfield. At {{the same time as}} the Canadian attack, the 43rd Division was to attack further south down the north side of the Odon to capture Verson. Once the regiments had captured Carpiquet, the QWR would push through and take control of the airfield control buildings. The capture of the airfield would enable further Anglo-Canadian attacks against Caen.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E
25|$|Also, 3rd War Area's 32nd Army Group made <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> {{south of}} Nanchang on the Kan River and sent plainclothes {{detachments}} into Nanchang to harass the Japanese {{to aid the}} 9th War Area offensive.|$|R
5|$|The <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> went well, with Soviet forces acting {{under the}} {{impression}} that the Poles had targets other than Vilnius. Despite their <b>diversionary</b> intent, these <b>attacks</b> succeeded in their own right, with Generał Józef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite unexpectedly strong resistance, and Generał Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in three days and Baranowicze in four.|$|R
25|$|For {{the second}} day, Magruder {{was able to}} {{continue}} fooling McClellan south of the river by employing minor <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks.</b> He was able to occupy 60,000 Federal troops while the heavier action occurred north of the river.|$|R
5|$|During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences {{along the}} coasts of England {{to protect against the}} {{possibility}} of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack.</b> Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E
5|$|In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria was {{deprived}} of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with {{command of the}} imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the Duke of Marlborough, into a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack,</b> and partly because Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes {{thought that he had}} acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him which he understood were part of a plan to lure French forces from the main attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{arrived in}} Egypt on 18 May 1940, {{and joined the}} 17th Brigade's other two infantry battalions in camp at Beit Jirja. A further period of training in Palestine followed before the battalion {{took part in the}} fighting against the Italians in Libya in January–February 1941, during which the 2/5th was involved in attacks on Bardia and Tobruk, as the Australians went into battle for the first time. During the fighting around Bardia, the battalion's commander, Wrigley, was seriously wounded in an artillery bombardment, and was temporarily replaced by Major George Sell, as the battalion was committed to the fighting in {{the second phase of the}} assault, advancing through the bridgehead that had been established towards the railway switchline. Later, during the assault on Tobruk, the 2/5th was tasked with conducting a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> to the east of the Italian perimeter. The battalion's time in Libya cost it 32 killed, and 60 wounded.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, German and Estonian units {{launched}} Operation Beowulf {{to clear}} Soviet {{forces from the}} West Estonian archipelago. There were a series of <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> to confuse the Soviet defenders. The operation had achieved its objectives by 21 October.|$|R
50|$|British {{troops were}} sent on <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> on the French coast, at St. Malo and Cherbourg. An {{expedition}} to western Africa captured the French slaving station at Senegal. In North America, a force was dispatched to take Louisbourg and Quebec.|$|R

5|$|The main Japanese counterattack {{began on}} 16 October, signalled {{by a large}} bonfire on Sattelberg. The attack was conceptualised as a three-pronged action, {{involving}} a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> by elements of the 79th Infantry Regiment to the north from Bonga, a company-level attack on Scarlet Beach from the sea by elements of the 79th with the Sugino Craft Raiding Unit, and a drive from Sattelberg by {{the remainder of the}} 79th and 80th Infantry Regiments orientated upon two lines of advance: one towards Scarlet Beach, conforming with the Song River, and the other striking towards Heldsbach advancing astride the Sattelberg Road. If successful, it was intended that following a regrouping, the two infantry regiments would then clear Finschhafen and Langemak Bay, but Japanese plans went awry from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Tuvia Raviv's armored brigade {{began its}} <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> against the 16th Division's {{bridgehead}} at 5:00 PM on October 15, striking at the bridgehead's center from the east, after a fire preparation. It was repulsed by the Egyptians, {{as had been}} expected, but succeeded in its purpose. When the 16th Division's southern flank came under increasing Israeli attack, the Egyptians assumed that the Israeli objective was to roll up the Second Army's right flank, not to open a corridor {{to the west bank}} for Israeli forces to cross the canal. For the next 24 hours, this remained the general impression among Egyptian commanders, and they reacted accordingly. Had they discovered the Israelis' true intentions earlier, the Egyptians would almost certainly have been able to defeat the Israeli operation, in light of the greater strength of their forces and reserves near the Deversoir area, on the east and west banks of the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Aisne River and encountering the trench system, cavalry was found ineffective. While cavalry divisions {{were still being}} formed in Britain, cavalry troops quickly became accustomed to fighting dismounted. Britain continued to use cavalry throughout the war, and in 1917, the Household Cavalry conducted its last mounted charge during a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> on the Hindenburg Line at Arras. On the orders of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the Life Guards and the Blues, accompanied by {{the men of the}} 10th Hussars, charged into heavy machine gun fire and barbed wire, and were slaughtered by the German defenders; the Hussars lost two-thirds of their number in the charge. The last British fatality from enemy action before the armistice went into effect was a cavalryman, George Edwin Ellison, from C Troop 5th Royal Irish Lancers. Ellison was shot by a sniper as the regiment moved into Mons on November 11, 1918.|$|E
50|$|The 3rd Guards Tank Army, {{commanded}} by Pavel Rybalko, moved northwards toward the Lyutezh bridgehead {{under cover of}} darkness and <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> out of the Bukrin bend. Masses of artillery were shifted northwards, but the movements went unnoticed by the Germans.|$|R
5000|$|According to Sadeh's {{original}} plan, {{the attack}} would {{begin with an}} artillery bombardment by the 88th Battalion on the fort and the villages of Iraq Suwaydan and Beit 'Affa. <b>Diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> on the neighboring villages would prevent reinforcement of the Egyptian forces in the fortress.|$|R
25|$|The {{establishment}} of a bridgehead on the east bank of the Jordan River and the advance to Es Salt and Amman was to be preceded by <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> across the entire front and coordinated with an Arab raid led by T. E. Lawrence on the Deraa Hejaz railway station.|$|R
5|$|During the morning, while a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> {{was made}} by the 2/23rd Battalion, and patrols from the 2/24th to the north {{attempted}} to break through, a company from the 2/48th, under the command of Captain Deane Hill, attempted to reach the summit at Sattelberg. Two platoons launched attacks during the early afternoon, but were beaten back by the twenty Japanese defenders that were dug in around the spur. Late in the afternoon, a third platoon, 11 Platoon, under the command of Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Tom Derrick, attempted another attack from further {{to the right of the}} position but it too was checked by machine-gun fire and lobbed grenades. As the light began to fade, Derrick reported his lack of progress to his company commander and was subsequently ordered to withdraw, so that another attempt could be made in the morning. Derrick's response to this order was to obfuscate, however, and instead of withdrawing, he subsequently led his platoon forward, attacking 10 Japanese positions with grenades as his men supported him with Bren and Owen submachine-gun fire.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} commandos were used mainly as highly trained {{infantry}} units {{for the rest}} of their involvement in the North African campaign and for the majority of this time they were attached to the 36th Infantry Brigade. Over the course of the next five months the commandos were involved in a number of costly attacks and periods of static defence, in between which they carried out aggressive fighting patrols. Indicative of the nature of the fighting during this time was No. 6 Commando's attack on the Green Hill feature on 30 November 1942. The main attack was launched at 4:00am, as three troops—Nos. 3, 4 and 6 Troops—attacked from the north and west, while No. 5 Troop conducted a <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack</b> from the flank. As soon as the main force left its line of departure it came under intense oblique fire from interlocking medium and heavy machine guns positioned in a diamond-shaped perimeter on top of the hill. The fire was so intense that the troop providing support by fire on the flank was unable to suppress it and the attack was temporarily postponed until the afternoon when it was hoped that artillery support could be utilised.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{wanted to}} seize the high ground south of Gettysburg, {{primarily}} Cemetery Hill, which dominated the town, the Union supply lines, and the road to Washington, D.C., and he believed an attack up the Emmitsburg Road {{would be the best}} approach. He desired an early-morning assault by Longstreet's Corps, reinforced by Ewell, who would move his Corps from its current location north of town to join Longstreet. Ewell protested this arrangement, claiming his men would be demoralized if forced to move from the ground they had captured. And Longstreet protested that his division commanded by John Bell Hood had not arrived completely (and that Pickett's division had not arrived at all). Lee compromised with his subordinates. Ewell would remain in place and conduct a demonstration (a minor <b>diversionary</b> <b>attack)</b> against Culp's Hill, pinning down the right flank of the Union defenders so that they could not reinforce their left, where Longstreet would launch the primary attack {{as soon as he was}} ready. Ewell's demonstration would be turned into a full-scale assault if the opportunity presented itself.|$|E
50|$|A year later, during Fleet Landing Exercise Number 7, Smith {{had three}} destroyer-transports. He {{designated}} the three companies of the 7th Marines embarked on these ships as the Mobile Landing Group. During the exercise these units again made night landings, either {{to protect the}} main assault, or conducted <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{period of}} upkeep and {{recreation}} from 9–28 August ensued at Eniwetok before she departed with , [...] and [...] for neutralization and <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> against the Bonins. [...] From 31 August to 2 September, strikes from Franklin inflicted ground damage, sank two cargo ships, destroyed enemy planes in flight, and undertook photographic surveys.|$|R
50|$|During April, the {{division}} once again came under command of XXXIII Corps and advanced down {{the west bank}} of the Irrawaddy. After Rangoon, the capital, was captured in early May, {{the division}} was directly commanded by the new headquarters of Twelfth Army and resisted Japanese <b>diversionary</b> <b>attacks</b> across the Sittang River during the monsoon.|$|R
