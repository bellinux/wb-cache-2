500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{debate over the}} years as to the depth of the Yogo dike and how many ounces of rough sapphires per ton it contains. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Delmer L. Brown, a geological engineer and gemologist, conducted the most thorough scientific exploration up to that time, concluding that the dike was at least [...] deep and that the concentration of rough sapphires was not constant throughout the deposit. Brown found that the dike had intruded into a pre-existing fault that had been a conduit for groundwater circulation. The overlying shale, the Kibbey Formation, was deposited on an unconformity, an ancient Mississippian-age karst <b>erosion</b> <b>surface,</b> and was not intruded by the dike. This groundwater action produced collapsed zones which were intruded by the dike to form breccia zones. Recent erosion in the area removed the overlying shales and again exposed the limestone to groundwater action which produced collapse breccias which include fragments of the dike rock. He determined that the erosion of the dike in the current erosion cycle was minimal.|$|E

40|$|We present ice-penetrating radar {{evidence}} for ancient (pre-glacial) and extensive <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> preserved beneath the upstream Institute and Möller ice streams, West Antarctica. Radar data reveal a smooth, laterally continuous, gently sloping topographic block, comprising two surfaces {{separated by a}} distinct break in slope. The <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> are preserved in this location due to the collective action of the Pirrit and Martin–Nash hills on ice sheet flow, resulting in a region of slow flowing, cold-based ice downstream of these major topographic barriers. Our analysis reveals that smooth, flat subglacial topography does not always correspond to regions of either present or former fast ice flow, as has previously been assumed. We discuss the potential origins of the <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Erosion</b> rates across the surfaces are currently low, precluding formation via present-day glacial erosion.

40|$|The high {{frequency}} {{and diversity of}} <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> throughout the Barnett Shale give a unique view into the short-duration stratigraphic intervals that were previously {{much more difficult to}} detect in such fine-grained rocks. The <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> in Barnett Shale exhibit variable relief (5. 08 – 61 [*]mm) which commonly consists of shelly laminae, shale rip-up clasts, reworked mud intraclasts, phosphatic pellets, and/or diagenetic minerals (dolomite and pyrite) mostly with clay-rich mudstone groundmass. Several factors control this lithological variation, including the energy conditions, rate of relative sea-level fluctuation, rate of sedimentation, sediment influx, and the lithofacies type of the underlying as well as the overlying beds. The erosional features and their associated surfaces make them serve at least in part as boundaries between different genetic types of deposits but with different scales according to their dependence on base level and/or sediment supply. Accordingly, the studied <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the Barnett Shale can be grouped into three different scales of sequence stratigraphic surfaces: sequence-scale surfaces, parasequence-scale surfaces, and within trend-scale surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{information}} on the soil erosion periods of Pleistocene on the Loess Plateau is rare. Here, we present results of the field work at Luochuan, Weinan, Tongchuan, Fufeng, Baoji, and Yangling, and a comparison between the SPECMAP, ODP- 677 delta(18) O curve, and the magnetic susceptibility curve of loess-paleosol sequence. We took the conformity surfaces between the loess and paleosol layers as credible <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces.</b> After some field work and analyses on the <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces,</b> we concluded that intensive soil erosion had occurred during the climate transform period, especially when the climate changed from cool-dry to warm-wet. After comparing the SPECMAP, ODP- 677 delta(18) O curve, and the magnetic susceptibility curve of the loess, the simultaneous leaps of these curves might show climate transition periods and also erosion events that could occur. This comparison suggested {{that there might be}} 13 erosion periods, which existed at 2. 580 MaBP, 2. 190 MaBP, 1. 870 MaBP, 1. 240 MaBP, 1. 120 MaBP, 0. 964 MaBP, 0. 865 MaBP, 0. 760 / 0. 780 MaBP, 0. 621 similar to 0. 479 MaBP, 0. 412 MaBP, 0. 336 MaBP, 0. 245 MaBP, and 0. 128 MaBP.

40|$|International audienceWe {{reconstruct}} {{the history of}} topographic growth in southern Africa {{on both sides of}} the Orange River valley from an integrated analysis of <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces,</b> crustal deformation and climate change. First, we propose an inventory of <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> observed in the study area and classify them according to their most likely formative process, i. e. chemical weathering or mechanical erosion. Among the various land units observed we define a new class of landform: the pedivalley, which corresponds to a wide valley with a flat erosional floor. In the Orange River valley, we mapped three low-relief <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces,</b> each bevelling a variety of lithologies. The oldest and most elevated is (1) a stripped etchplain evolving laterally into (2) a stepped pediplain bearing residual inselbergs; (3) a younger pediplain later formed in response to a more recent event of crustal deformation. These are all Cenozoic landforms: the etchplain is associated with a late Palaeocene to middle Eocene weathering event, and the two pediplains are older than the middle Miocene alluvial terraces of the Orange River. Landscape evolution was first driven by slow uplift (10 m/Ma), followed by a second interval of uplift involving a cumulative magnitude of at least 200 m. This event shaped the transition between the two pediplains and modified the drainage pattern. A final phase of uplift (magnitude: 60 m) occurred after the Middle Miocene and drove the incision of the lower terraces of the Orange River. Climate exerted a major control over the denudation process, and involved very humid conditions responsible for lateritic weathering, followed by more arid conditions, which promoted the formation of pedivalleys. Collectively, these produce pediplains...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Scalloped and planar <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> are {{developed}} at numerous stratigraphic levels above prograded tidal flat fenestral limestones and beneath more open marine skeletal limestones inthe Middle Ordovician limestone sequence, Virginia. Scalloped surfaces consist of smooth curved basins (10 cm to over 1 m wide) with intervening steep, locally overhanging walls and sharp ridges. Relief {{is up to}} 30 cm. The scalloped surfaces pass laterally into planar erosional contacts. Erosional surfaces truncate grains and cements and rare incipiently brecciated (vadose) fabrics. Fossiliferous breccias occur rarely above contacts. Some contacts are bored locally " and enerusted by calcareous algae and bryozoans. Erosional contacts between fenestral limestones and overlying skeletal beds are extremely sharp {{and there is no}} burrowing across the contacts. Locally, submarine hardgrounds converge onto scalloped/planar e o-sional contacts. The <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> are believed to have formed initially as exposed karst on supratidal, prograded, earl) " lithified tidal flat limestones, as indicated by vadose features beneath some contacts. Further erosion in tidal rock platform environments is indicated by position of <b>erosion</b> <b>surfaces</b> beneath open marine carbonates, organic encrustation f contacts, local marine cements beneath some contacts, local bored contacts, and by reported higher ates of tidal erosion compared tosubaerial erosion in the Recent. These surfaces do not appear to have been documented to any extent in ancient carbonate s quences. However, the abundance of such surfaces along modern coasts and in karst errains, and in the Middle Ordovician limestones of Virginia, suggests hat hey might be more abundant elsewhere. Finally, these surfaces might be useful in defining paleoshorelines in the absence of tidal fiat deposits...|$|R
