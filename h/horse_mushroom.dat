50|$|Agaricus arvensis, {{commonly}} known as the <b>horse</b> <b>mushroom,</b> is a mushroom of the genus Agaricus.|$|E
50|$|Contains 19 {{species in}} six subgroups {{similar to the}} <b>horse</b> <b>mushroom,</b> A. arvensis, it has {{versatile}} heterothallic life cycles.|$|E

5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on <b>horse</b> chestnut. The <b>mushroom</b> prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|R

In the United States it has been found in Indiana, and elsewhere in eastern North America. Although often described as [...] "rare", a 1997 study suggests that it may be relatively common in Illinois. It has been suggested that {{an increase in the number}} of dead elms, a byproduct of Dutch elm disease, has contributed to its resurgence.|$|R
50|$|Much prized {{by farmers}} for generations, the <b>horse</b> <b>mushroom</b> is {{regarded}} as one of the most delicious edible fungi, although the fruitbodies of this and other yellow-staining Agaricus species often have a build-up of heavy metals, such as cadmium and copper.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species may}} be {{confused}} with Agaricus campestris. Amanita virosa and similar, closely related species, are morbidly toxic. Agaricus xanthodermus ("the yellow stainer") causes gastrointestinal problems.Agaricus arvensis, the <b>horse</b> <b>mushroom,</b> is an excellent edible. White Clitocybe species that also grow on lawns, and in grassy places may be dangerous to eat.|$|E
50|$|Destroying angels can {{be mistaken}} for edible fungi such as the button mushroom, meadow mushroom, or the <b>horse</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Young {{destroying}} angels that are still enclosed in their universal veil can {{be mistaken for}} puffballs, but slicing them in half longitudinally will reveal internal mushroom structures. This {{is the basis for}} the common recommendation to slice in half all puffball-like mushrooms picked when mushroom hunting. Mushroom hunters recommend that people know how to recognize both the death cap and the destroying angel in all of their forms before collecting any white gilled mushroom for consumption.|$|E

This project investigates effects of givenness on word order produced by 3 to 5 year old children acquiring German as their first language and in an adult controll group. 2) ‘Input’ Study Information structure in child directed speech: This project investigates effects of givenness on word order in caregivers’ (native German speaking adults) speech addressed to children. 3) ‘Comment’ Study Information structure in child language: word order in co-ordinate noun phrases when old item is commented upon. This project investigates effects of information structure (given and commented upon vs. new) on word order produced by 3 to 5 year old children acquiring German as their first language. 4) ‘Narrative’ Study (“Magician”) Information structure in child language: word order in co-ordinate noun phrases in childrens' narratives This project wants to investigate effects of information structure (given vs. new) on word order in co-ordinate noun phrases where {{the introduction of the}} first item and the subsequent mention of both, the then given and a new item, are embedded in a strech of coherent discourse. Word order produced by 3 to 5 year old children acquiring German is studied in an elicited narrative task. 5) Basic Study with 9 -year olds Information structure in child language: word order in co-ordinate noun phrases.

40|$|Agricultural runoff {{is a major}} {{non-point source}} {{pollutant}} in the Midwest and has been documented as a significant contributor to nutrient loads in the Mississippi River and subsequent hypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. In an attempt to minimize eutrophication, researchers have been collaborating with farmers to improve best management practices targeting nutrient retention. Over {{the past four decades}} riparian buffers have proven effective in retaining nutrients and sediment from agricultural runoff. We hypothesize that the addition of biochar to vegetated buffers can further improve nutrient attenuation by enhancing nutrient adsorption and cycling soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. In June 2012, fifteen flumes were established adjacent to fifteen existing flumes that were installed in 2008 for a related study at Southern Illinois University 2 ̆ 7 s farms. Each flume was either vegetated and/or amended with one of ten treatments and replicated three times: 1) giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl) established in 2008; 2) Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.); 3) orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.); 4) giant cane and compost (i. e., <b>horse</b> manure and <b>mushroom</b> compost); 5) biochar (i. e., pine and oak feedstock pyrolyzed between 450 °C and 650 °C.); 6) biochar and giant cane; 7) biochar, giant cane, and compost; 8) corn; 9) volunteer herbaceous species; and 10) a non-amended, non-vegetated control. Soil samples were collected prior to the application of soil amendments and nutrients were assessed annually. Surface runoff samples were collected from significant rain events (i. e., precipitation 3 ̆e 2. 5 cm) and analyzed for nutrient and sediment levels. Data indicate that various combinations of biochar, compost, and giant cane were successful at reducing the frequency of surface runoff events as well as reducing concentrations of NO 3 - and NH 4 + in agricultural surface runoff. Concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) were greatly reduced when biochar and giant cane were present in the buffer without the addition of compost. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were lowest for the established giant cane treatment. There {{were no significant differences in}} the concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) among the various buffer treatments. Data from this study are promising for the incorporation of biochar, compost, and giant cane into vegetated buffers to reduce the concentration of nutrients in agricultural surface runoff...|$|R
