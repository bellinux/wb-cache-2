The springs located on Meager Creek are called Teiq {{in the language of}} the Lillooet River and were the farthest up the Lillooet River. The spirit-beings/wizards known as [...] "the Transformers" [...] reached them during their journey into the Lillooet Country, and were a [...] "training" [...] place for young First Nations men to acquire power and knowledge. In this area, also, was found the blackstone chief's <b>head</b> <b>pipe</b> that is famous of Lillooet artifacts; found buried in volcanic ash, one supposes from the 2350 BP eruption of Mount Meager.|$|E
5000|$|The {{major changes}} {{were in the}} frame, engine, swingarm, and a-arms. The most visible change is in the frame {{right in front of}} the {{cylinder}} the 85-86 frame has a single down bar, but the '87+ has a single wishbone down-tube. The 85-86 exhaust goes out the side of the cylinder and the '87+ goes straight out the front in between the split downbar, hence the <b>head</b> <b>pipe</b> design changed for '87+. For '87+, a head motor mount was added and connects the engine to the backbone of the frame (under tank). The 85-86 is also a non powervalved motor as the '87+ have powervalves (aka: [...] "poor man's turbo-charger"). The front shocks are also about 3" [...] longer than previous models. The air intake from the carburetor to the cylinder is in a 5 bolt pattern and larger than the other years providing more air flow. Hence, the 87's are desired by tuners and racers for the larger base air flow. The 1987-on LT250R and the LT250R's big brother, the LT500R or Quadzilla, used the 5-bolt intake design. Also the '87+ used a 6 speed transmission instead of the 5 speed used on the 85-86 models. The engine color was changed from silver used on the 85-86 models to blue for the '87+ models.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is useful}} {{to keep in mind}} that {{although}} the waves traverse the entire expansion chamber over each cycle, the actual gases leaving the cylinder during a particular cycle do not. The gas flows and stops intermittently and the wave continues on to the end of the pipe. The hot gases leaving the port form a [...] "slug" [...] which fills the header pipe and remains there for the duration of that cycle. This causes a high temperature zone in the <b>head</b> <b>pipe</b> which is always filled with the most recent and hottest gas. Because this area is hotter, the speed of sound and thus the speed of the waves that travel through it are increased. During the next cycle that slug of gas will be pushed down the pipe by the next slug to occupy the next zone and so on. The volume this [...] "slug" [...] occupies constantly varies according to throttle position and engine speed. It is only the wave energy itself that traverses the whole pipe during a single cycle. The actual gas leaving the pipe during a particular cycle was created two or three cycles earlier. (This is why exhaust gas sampling on two stroke engines is done with a special valve right in the exhaust port. The gas exiting the stinger has had too much resident time and mixing with gas from other cycles causing errors in analysis.) ...|$|E

40|$|Fine-grained energy {{metering}} {{in homes}} and buildings pro-vides a promising technique {{for addressing the}} unmaintain-able energy consumption levels of worldwide buildings. Me-tering electricity, lighting, natural gas, HVAC, occupancy, and water on a per appliance or room basis can provide invaluable insight when trying to reduce a building’s energy footprint. A myriad of sensor designs and systems collect data on partic-ular building aspects, but are often hampered by installation difficulty or ongoing maintenance needs (like battery replace-ment). We address these common pitfalls for water and heat metering by developing a small, energy-harvesting sensor that meters using the same thermoelectric generator with which it powers itself. In short, {{the rate at which}} the harvester captures energy is proportional to the heat production of the monitored appliance or pipe and this relationship allows us to estimate energy use simply based on the sensor’s ability to harvest. We prototype our sensor in a bracelet shaped form-factor that can attach to a shower <b>head</b> <b>pipe,</b> faucet, or appliance to provide local hot water or heat metering...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A chance {{constrained}} {{model is}} presented for the minimum cost design of water distribution networks.

There is currently no universally accepted definition or measure of the reliability of water distribution systems.
