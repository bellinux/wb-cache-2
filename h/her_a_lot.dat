25|$|The couple faced another hurdle when Brenda {{wanted to}} publish {{an article about}} the alarm of her {{pregnancy}} but Dylan objected, arguing that it was very personal. Typical of their relationship, Brenda and Dylan were once again reconciled after another dispute. In addition, Brenda was the victim of an armed robbery at the Peach Pit. This scene shocked <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> and led her to see a psychologist, Dylan helped <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> when she began to have nightmares about this event. Things get more serious when Brenda {{spends a lot of time}} with Dylan without worrying about the limitations imposed by her parents. The latter invited her to a trip to Mexico and Brenda agrees, despite the formal prohibition of her father. The trip will be punctuated by a dispute and a passage at the customs where Brenda will realize that she does not have her passport and is therefore forced to phone her parents. When Brenda's parents are aware of her trip to Mexico with Dylan, the girl's father formally banned her from seeing him again. But she refuses to break and hides her relationship with Dylan.|$|E

She visits Mrs Acton and says a white lie – that her son {{has been talking about}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> – which comes across as a terrible faux-pas. Later, Mr Wentworth tells Felix that Clifford got {{suspended}} from Harvard owing to his drinking problem, and that he is improperly in love with Lizzie Acton – Felix suggests fixing him up with Eugenia instead. Later still, Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry Mr Brand, though she doesn't love him. Mr Brand then criticises Felix. Gertrude emotionally blackmails Charlotte into keeping him from talking to her, lest she tell him Charlotte likes him. Clifford then visits Eugenia. Robert Acton goes to the Wentworths' but Eugenia is not in their house; he goes into hers and asks her about the divorce note and going to see the Niagara Falls with him. Clifford comes out of his hiding place; the two men get back together.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duchess Olga was {{witty and}} had a strong personality. Her sharp tongue brought <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of trouble at the Russian court. She despised the morganatic wife of Alexander II and later she was {{particularly}} indignant at Alexander III's decision {{to limit the number}} of Grand Dukes, a title her own grandchildren would be deprived of. While her husband busied himself with his military and governmental career, Grand Duchess Olga ruled her family with an iron hand. She demanded complete obedience from her children. She was particularly close to her eldest son Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia, whose intellectual interests were like hers, but she remained aloof and cold towards the others. Her second son, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, who was not intellectually gifted (she called him a fool), was a constant source of disappointment for her. In 1879, Olga with Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna arranged the marriage between her only daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, with Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Maria Pavlovna's brother. Anastasia carried some bitterness about her upbringing and relationship with her mother - her daughter Cäcilie recounts that at a party to celebrate her engagement, when she committed some infraction she was sent to bed by Olga like a naughty child. There was also an incident involving an apricot tree, which belonged to Anastasia but whose fruit she was not allowed to eat.|$|E

500|$|Miss Rosa {{played a}} minor role {{throughout}} the first season. Rosenblat had {{admitted that she}} only appeared sporadically and did not get to portray much. But the actress was eager to return for the show's second season. But during the second season the role was expanded which surprised Rosenblat. The actress told a reporter from Indiewire, [...] "I learned where Miss Rosa is from I learned why she's in prison.

[...] "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what hip-hop means", she said. [...] "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." [...] She also noted that West showed <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans.

500|$|Breakaway {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on November 30, 2004 by RCA Records, 19 Recordings, and S Records, following {{an influx of}} releases by American Idol contestants Clay Aiken, Ruben Studdard, and Fantasia Barrino. The New York Times columnist Jeff Leeds noted that the releases could benefit from the holiday season, but [...] "it could also hinder their efforts to establish themselves as recording artists with distinctive personalities and the legitimacy needed for long careers." [...] Clive Davis reiterated that the release was intended to recede from their ties from American Idol, saying, [...] "I'm not interested in merely souvenir sales". The album was titled Breakaway {{to capitalize on the}} success of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement soundtrack single [...] "Breakaway", which was also reissued as the album's final single. Immediately before the album was released, Clarkson left 19 Management, dismissed Fuller as her manager, and quickly hired the managing services of Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm, though still contracted to 19 Recordings. A promotion plan was created for Clarkson for Breakaways release. Davis positioned her to be RCA's top global priority, and at the recommendation of The Firm, removed American Idol from her official biography. Rather than being booked on arenas for her tour, Kwatinetz booked Clarkson for smaller amphitheaters to hone her performance skills. He remarked, [...] "American Idol gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of exposure that allowed her to skip some steps in her development, and that's hazardous." [...] Breakaway was first released internationally on January 3, 2005 by the Bertelsmann Music Group (now Sony Music Entertainment), and was released in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2005 by RCA. In November 2005, a special edition CD+DVD was released, containing additional bonus tracks and music videos.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the album}} {{listening}} party, Spin described the album as having no ballads except [...] "Body Party" [...] whilst John Kennedy, writing for Vibe, described the album as [...] "feel-good midtempo" [...] songs akin to Ciara's Goodies era (circa 2004). In {{an interview with}} MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, [...] "I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope because I really respect her. She's done something in music {{that no one has}} done {{and when you look at}} her old references and just her references period, you wonder what the mind of that person is, and she's my friend, so I get to get a little bit more out of that mind, and it's really cool." ...|$|E

At the same time, John's sister, the Infanta Mariana Victoria, was married to the Infante Gabriel, also of the Spanish royal family. An assiduous correspondence between John and Mariana at that time reveals that the absence of his sister weighed upon him and, comparing her to his young wife, he wrote, [...] "She is very smart and has a lot of judgment, whereas you have rather little, and I like <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> but for all that I cannot love her equally." [...] John's young bride was little given to docility, requiring at times the correction of Queen Maria herself. Furthermore, the difference in their ages (John being 18 years old) made him uncomfortable and anxious. Because Carlota was so young, the marriage had not been consummated, and John wrote, [...] "Here's to the arrival of the time when I shall play a lot with the Infanta. The way these things go, I think six years from now. Better that she be a bit more grown up than when she came." [...] The consummation waited until [...] In 1793, Carlota gave birth to the first of nine children: Teresa, Princess of Beira.|$|E

2500|$|In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as {{megalomaniac}} who {{is after}} more than just Scottish Independence. Westminster's youngest MP, Mhairi Black assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: [...] "I like <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit. Ullman had impersonated Willcox back in the early 1980s. Sturgeon took to Twitter to comment on the impersonation: [...] "Great to see my fav Scottish designers @TottyRocksLtd featuring on @TraceyUllmanTV last night)" [...] Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying [...] "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. [...] "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've heard so much about it. I thought it was really funny."

Hassan {{explained that}} Lynsey takes a big risk in confiding in Doug but Lynsey trusts him to keep it a secret. Lynsey feels like she should not be bringing Doug in to the dangerous situation but she realises that she needs someone to help her. Her portrayer went on to add that Doug believes Lynsey and shows <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of kindness and friendship. Lynsey is given clues by Silas to help her identify his next victim, although they leave Lynsey feeling like she has no way of figuring the potential victim's identity out as the clues seem to fit everyone.

Silas kills a woman dressed as Catwoman, initially believing it to be Lynsey until he realises it is his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Lynsey soon after exposes Silas who is arrested. Hassan said that she had enjoyed seeing Lynsey show gumption during the storyline and hoped to see more of this side of her character. Reflecting on the storyline, Hassan said the storyline was amazing and added that she was enthusiastic to play the storyline. She said that previous to the storyline she had known she could show a feistier side and more depth to Lynsey which she was always aware existed.|$|E
