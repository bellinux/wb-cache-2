50|$|<b>Esmolol</b> {{is rapidly}} metabolized by {{hydrolysis}} of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of {{red blood cells}} and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase.

Esmolol's short duration of action is based on the ester-methyl side chain which allows for quick hydrolysis. Esmolol's structure is reflected in its name, es-molol as in ester-methyl. Plasma cholinesterases and red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase do not have any action. This metabolism results in the formation of a free acid and methanol.

50|$|The use of beta-blockers {{for cocaine}} {{cardiovascular}} toxicity has {{been subject to}} a relative contraindication by many clinicians for several years despite extremely limited evidence. The phenomenon of “unopposed alpha-stimulation,” in which blood pressure increases or coronary artery vasoconstriction worsens after blockade of beta-2 vasodilation in cocaine-abusing patients, is controversial. This rarely-encountered and unpredictable adverse effect has resulted in some clinicians advocating for an absolute contraindication {{of the use of}} all beta-blockers, including specific, non-specific, and mixed. Many clinicians have disregarded this dogma and administer beta-blockers for cocaine-related chest pain and acute coronary syndrome, especially when there is demand ischemia from uncontrolled tachycardia. Of the 1,744 total patients identified in the aforementioned systematic review, only 7 adverse events were from putative cases of “unopposed alpha-stimulation” due to propranolol (n=3), <b>esmolol</b> (n=3), and metoprolol (n=1). Some detractors of beta-blockers for cocaine-induced chest pain have cited minimal acute mortality and the short half-life of the drug, making it unnecessary to aggressively treat any associated tachycardia and hypertension. However, the long-term effect of cocaine use and development of heart failure, with early mortality, high morbidity, and tremendous demand on hospital utilization should be taken under consideration.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{previously}} {{showed that}} arrest with multidose infusions of high-dose (1 mmol/L) <b>esmolol</b> (an ultra-short-acting β-blocker) in oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (<b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia) provided complete myocardial protection after 40 minutes of normothermic (37 °C) global ischemia in isolated rat hearts. In {{this study we}} investigated the importance of oxygenation for protection with <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia, compared it with that of St Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia, and determined the protective efficacy of multidose <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia for extended ischemic durations. Methods: Isolated rat hearts (n = 6 /group) were perfused in the Langendorff mode at constant pressure (75 mm Hg) with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer at 37 °C. The {{first part of the}} first study had four groups: (i) multidose (every 15 minutes) oxygenated (95 % oxygen/ 5 % carbon dioxide) Krebs-Henseleit buffer during 60 minutes of global ischemia, (ii) multidose deoxygenated (95 % nitrogen/ 5 % carbon dioxide) Krebs-Henseleit buffer during 60 minutes of global ischemia, (iii) multidose oxygenated <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia during 60 minutes of global ischemia, and (iv) multidose deoxygenated <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia during 60 minutes of global ischemia. The second part of the first study had three groups: (v) multidose St Thomas' Hospital solution during 60 minutes of global ischemia, (vi) multidose oxygenated St Thomas' Hospital solution during 60 minutes of global ischemia, and (vii) multidose oxygenated <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia during 60 minutes of global ischemia. In the second study, hearts were randomly assigned to 60, 75, 90, or 120 minutes of global ischemia and at each ischemic duration were subjected to multidose oxygenated constant flow or constant pressure infusion of (i) Krebs-Henseleit buffer (constant flow), (ii) Krebs-Henseleit buffer (constant pressure), (iii) <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia (constant flow), or (iv) <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia (constant pressure). All hearts were reperfused for 60 minutes, and recovery of function was measured. Results: Multidose infusion of oxygenated <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia completely protected the hearts (97 % ± 5 %) after 60 minutes of 37 °C global ischemia. Deoxygenated <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia was significantly less protective (45 % ± 8 %). Oxygenation of St Thomas' Hospital solution did not alter its protective efficacy in this study (70 % ± 4 % vs 69 % ± 7 %). Infusion of <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia at constant pressure provided complete protection for 60, 75, and 90 minutes (104 % ± 5 %, 95 % ± 5 %, and 95 % ± 3 %, respectively), whereas protection with constant-flow <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegic infusion was significantly decreased at ischemic durations longer than 60 minutes. This decrease in efficacy of constant-flow <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia was associated with increasing coronary perfusion pressure leading to myocardial injury. Conclusions: Oxygenation of <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia (Krebs-Henseleit buffer plus 1. 0 mmol/L <b>esmolol)</b> was essential for optimal myocardial protection. Multidose infusion of oxygenated <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia provided good myocardial protection during extended periods of normothermic ischemia. <b>Esmolol</b> cardioplegia may provide an efficacious alternative to hyperkalemia.

40|$|Purpose. This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the effect of <b>esmolol</b> on tissue perfusion and the clinical {{prognosis of patients with}} severe sepsis. Materials and Methods. One hundred fifty-one patients with severe sepsis were selected and divided into the <b>esmolol</b> group (n= 75) or the control group (n= 76), who received conventional antiseptic shock treatment. The <b>esmolol</b> group received a continuous infusion of <b>esmolol</b> via a central venous catheter, and their heart rate (HR) was maintained at 70 – 100 [*]bpm over 72 hours. Results.

40|$|AbstractObjective: During {{myocardial}} revascularization, some surgeons (particularly in the United Kingdom) use intermittent crossclamping with fibrillation as {{an alternative}} to cardioplegia. We recently showed that intermittent crossclamping with fibrillation has an intrinsic protection equivalent to that of cardioplegia. In this study we hypothesized that arrest, rather than fibrillation, during intermittent crossclamping may be beneficial. Because <b>esmolol,</b> an ultra-short-acting β-blocker, is known to attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, we compared the protective effect of <b>esmolol</b> arrest with that of intermittent crossclamping with fibrillation and conventional cardioplegia (St Thomas' Hospital solution). Methods: Isolated rat hearts were Langendorff perfused at either constant flow (14 mL/min) or constant pressure (75 mm Hg) with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (37 °C), and left ventricular developed pressure was assessed. In study 1 (constant flow perfusion) 8 groups (n = 6 hearts per group) were studied: (1) 40 minutes of global ischemia; (2) 2 minutes of St Thomas' Hospital infusion and 40 minutes of ischemia; (3) multidose (every 10 minutes) infusions of St Thomas' Hospital solution during 40 minutes of ischemia; (4) 2 minutes of <b>esmolol</b> infusion and 40 minutes of ischemia; (5) multidose (every 10 minutes) <b>esmolol</b> infusions during 40 minutes of ischemia; (6) continuous infusion of <b>esmolol</b> for 40 minutes during coronary perfusion; (7) intermittent (4 × 10 minutes) ischemia with ventricular fibrillation; and (8) intermittent (4 × 10 minutes) ischemia preceded by intermittent <b>esmolol</b> administration. All protocols were followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Further experiments (study 2) examined the <b>esmolol</b> administration method in hearts perfused by constant pressure. Results: An optimal arresting dose of 1. 0 mmol/L <b>esmolol</b> was established. In study 1 recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (expressed as percentage of preischemic value) was 7 % ± 4 %, 28 % ± 8 %, 70 % ± 5 %, 8 % ± 1 %, 90 % ± 4 %, 65 % ± 3 %, 71 % ± 5 %, and 76 % ± 5 % in groups 1 to 8, respectively. Intermittent <b>esmolol</b> arrest with global ischemia provided equivalent myocardial protection to intermittent crossclamping with fibrillation, continuous <b>esmolol</b> perfusion, and multidose St Thomas' Hospital solution. Surprisingly, multidose <b>esmolol</b> infusion was more protective than all other treatments. In further experiments (study 2) optimal recovery was obtained with multiple <b>esmolol</b> infusions (by constant flow or constant pressure), but continuous <b>esmolol</b> infusion (at constant flow) was less effective than constant pressure infusion. Conclusions: Intermittent arrest with <b>esmolol</b> did not enhance protection of intermittent crossclamping with fibrillation; however, multiple <b>esmolol</b> infusions during global ischemia provided improved protection. Administration (constant flow or constant pressure) of arresting solutions influenced outcome only during continuous infusion. Multidose <b>esmolol</b> arrest may be a beneficial alternative to intermittent crossclamping with fibrillation or conventional cardioplegia. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 122 : 993 - 100...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Hypertension {{frequently}} {{occurs during}} the immediate postoperative period in children after repair of aortic coarctation {{but may also}} occur after repair of other congenital heart defects. Nitroprusside has often been used to control blood pressure in this setting. Because hypertension after coarctation repair is frequently associated with elevations in catecholamines, <b>esmolol,</b> a short-acting β-blocking agent, may be an effective alternative. Therefore we undertook the first systematic investigation to determine the efficacy and disposition of <b>esmolol</b> in pediatric patients with acute hypertension after cardiac operations. Methods: Twenty patients aged 1 month to 12 years (median 25. 6 months) with acute hypertension after cardiac operations received <b>esmolol</b> in an opened-labeled trial. <b>Esmolol</b> was titrated to a blood pressure {{less than or equal}} to the 90 th percentile for age. Results: Ten patients had coarctation repair and the remaining patients underwent repair of other congenital heart defects. On final <b>esmolol</b> dose (mean ± standard deviation dosage 700  ± 232 μg/kg/min) there was a significant percent decrease in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures from postoperative values. <b>Esmolol</b> dose was significantly associated with percent reduction in systolic blood pressure. Final <b>esmolol</b> dose and total body clearance were significantly higher in patients after coarctation repair. There were significant associations between <b>esmolol</b> dose and <b>esmolol</b> blood concentrations at steady state.

40|$|Background and Aims: Perioperative <b>esmolol</b> as an opioid {{alternative}} {{has been}} shown to reduce postoperative nausea vomiting using opioid sparing. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare <b>esmolol</b> and opioids on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), time spent in recovery, and analgesia in noncardiac surgeries. Material and Methods: OVID Medline (1980 –February 2014), OVID EMBASE, EBSCO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing <b>esmolol</b> and opioids on early postoperative recovery and pain intensity during general anesthesia in noncardiac surgeries. The primary outcomes were related to PONV and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge time, whereas secondary outcomes were related to early postoperative pain. Results: Eight trials were identified involving 439 patients, 228 of whom received <b>esmolol</b> while 211 received opioids. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that in comparison with opioids, <b>esmolol</b> led to a 69 % reduction in the incidence of PONV (odds ratio 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 13 – 0. 74, P = 0. 008, I 2 = 44. 1 %). An increase in the volatile anesthetic requirement was evident in the <b>esmolol</b> group compared with opioid (MD + 0. 67 % desflurane equivalent, 95 % CI 0. 27 – 1. 08, P = 0. 001, I 2 = 23. 5 %). There was no statistically significant difference between the <b>esmolol</b> and opioid groups in relation to PACU discharge time, early postoperative pain scores, opioid requirement, and cumulative opioid consumption. Significant heterogeneity was noted between studies. No significant adverse effects were noted. Conclusion: Compared with opioids, perioperative <b>esmolol</b> may reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea vomiting and increase the volatile anesthetic requirement. <b>Esmolol</b> administration may not improve the early postoperaive pain intensity. Nonetheless, these findings are limited by the absence of high-quality RCTs and the heterogeneity among studies. Further, large-scale studies are needed to explore these results...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neuroprotective {{effects of}} <b>esmolol</b> in {{laboratory}} and clinical settings have been reported. The {{present study was}} designed to quantitatively evaluate the neuroprotective effects of <b>esmolol</b> using logistic regression curves and extracellular potentials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 42 gerbils, bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries was performed for 3, 5, or 7 minutes (n= 7 in each group). In treated animals, <b>esmolol</b> (200 µg/kg/min) was administered for 90 minutes, 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia. Direct current potentials were measured in the bilateral CA 1 regions, in which histologic evaluation was performed 5 days later. Relations of neuronal damage with ischemic duration and duration of ischemic depolarization were determined using logistic regression curves. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference in}} onset time between the 2 groups (the control group vs. the <b>esmolol</b> group: 1. 65 ± 0. 46 vs. 1. 68 ± 0. 45 min, P= 0. 76), and significant differences in durations of ischemic depolarization were not observed with any ischemic duration. However, logistic regression curves indicated that <b>esmolol</b> has a neuroprotective effect from 2. 95 to 7. 66 minutes of ischemic depolarization (P< 0. 05), and <b>esmolol</b> prolonged the duration of ischemic depolarization causing 50 % neuronal damage from 4. 97 to 6. 34 minutes (P< 0. 05). Logistic regression curves also indicated that <b>esmolol</b> has a neuroprotective effect from 3. 77 to 7. 74 minutes of ischemic duration (P< 0. 05), and <b>esmolol</b> prolonged the ischemic duration causing 50 % neuronal damage from 4. 26 to 4. 91 minutes (P< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite recent {{advances}} in techniques of reperfusion for acute myocardial ischemia, myocardial salvage remains suboptimal. β-Blockers {{have been shown to}} limit infarct size during acute ischemia, but their negative inotropic properties have limited their use. Cardiopulmonary bypass is an attractive technique for cardiac resuscitation because it can stabilize a hemodynamically compromised patient and potentially reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. In an attempt to maximize myocardial salvage in the setting of acute ischemia, the combination of <b>esmolol,</b> an ultrashort-acting β-blocker, with percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass was evaluated. Four groups of instrumented dogs underwent 2 hours of myocardial ischemia induced by occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. Throughout the period of ischemia and reperfusion, <b>esmolol</b> plus percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass was compared with <b>esmolol</b> alone, percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass alone, and control conditions. After the reperfusion period, the extent of infarction of the left ventricle at risk was determined. Four animals had intractable arrhythmias: one in the <b>esmolol</b> plus bypass group, one in the <b>esmolol</b> group, and two in the control group. The extent of infarction of the left ventricle at risk was significantly reduced in the <b>esmolol</b> plus bypass group (30 %) compared with bypass alone (52 %), with <b>esmolol</b> alone (54 %), and with the control groups (59 %; p < 0. 05). We conclude that in this experimental model the combination of <b>esmolol</b> with bypass improves myocardial salvage after ischemia and reperfusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Current {{cardiac surgery}} {{patients}} are older, sicker, with more diffuse disease and hence a reduced tolerance to ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We previously demonstrated that <b>esmolol,</b> an ultra-short-acting β-blocker, {{can be used}} as an arresting agent at high (millimolar) concentrations, and that a crystalloid-based <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia afforded cardioprotection at least equivalent to hyperka-laemic (St Thomas ’ Hospital) cardioplegia. <b>Esmolol</b> is rapidly metabolized by blood esterases, so it was important to determine the feasibility of its use in blood-based solutions. This study compared the efficacy of blood-based <b>esmolol</b> cardioplegia with hyperkalaemic cardioplegia in a novel blood-perfused rat heart preparation. METHODS: Isolated rat hearts were Langendorff blood-perfused with a rat blood/buffer perfusate mixture (flow rate, 3. 0 ml/min) and pre-ischaemic baseline function (left ventricular developed pressure) assessed. All values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Three studies were conducted: (i) the efficacy of blood-based vs crystalloid-based <b>esmolol</b> or hyperkalaemic cardioplegia (40 min ischaemia) was evaluated (five groups; six hearts/group); (ii) the effect of the mode of cardioplegia delivery (constant flow/pressure), <b>esmolol</b> concen-tration and extended delivery interval (45 min ischaemia) was evaluated (four groups; six hearts/group); (iii) the efficacy of blood-based <b>esmolol</b> compared with hyperkalaemic cardioplegia over extended (60 min) ischaemia duration was evaluated (two groups; six hearts/ group). Hearts were reperfused (60 min) and recovery (percent of pre-ischaemic baseline function) measured at the end of reperfusion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundUpon {{recovery}} from anesthesia and during extubation, {{there will be}} mechanical stimulation of receptors in the respiratory tract that results in both respiratory and cardiovascular reflex responses. Heart rate plays {{a major determinant of}} myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac workload, so decreasing the heart rate will increase the ischemic threshold and improve the cardiac performance. ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of <b>esmolol</b> infusion on myocardial oxygen consumption during extubation and quality of recovery in elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia. MethodsHundred adult patients ASA I & II scheduled for elective open unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized, double-blindly into one of two parallel groups, <b>esmolol</b> group (E) (n= 50) and control group (C) (n= 50). In the <b>esmolol</b> group, 1 mg/kg <b>esmolol</b> was given as bolus over 30 s then followed by a continuous <b>esmolol</b> infusion of 100 μg/kg/min starting 10 min before end of surgery till 5 min after extubation. While patients in group C received normal saline bolus of the same volume followed by a continuous normal saline infusion of the same volume per hour as group E. Mean heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), rate pressure product (RPP), anesthesia time, recovery time, postoperative nausea & vomiting, number of doses of antiemetic agent and quality of extubation were recorded. ResultsThe results showed that patients in the <b>esmolol</b> group had lower values of (RPP) after <b>esmolol</b> infusion with statistically significant difference when compared with patients in the control group using unpaired t-test (P< 0. 05), this will decrease oxygen consumption in <b>esmolol</b> group. Also, there was statistically significant difference between both groups regarding values of HR (beat/min), SBP (mmHg), DBP (mmHg) and MBP (mmHg) starting 2 min after <b>esmolol</b> infusion and continued till 10 min after extubation using unpaired t-test (p< 0. 05). As regards PONV, there was lower incidence in <b>esmolol</b> group when compared to control group using unpaired t-test with statistically significant difference (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsEsmolol is a safe, effective and well-tolerated drug {{that can be used in}} elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia to reduce the myocardial oxygen consumption and improve the quality of recovery...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the study}} is to compare the {{efficacy}} of intravenous Bolus dose of <b>Esmolol</b> Hydrochloride and Lignocaine Hydrochloride to attenuate the Haemodynamic responses to Laryngoscopy and Endotracheal intubation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{preventive}} effects of <b>esmolol</b> and lidocaine {{on the increase}} in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) during endotracheal intubation in neurosurgery. STUDY DESIGN: Comparative, randomised, double-blind study. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients, physical status ASA I or II, undergoing neurosurgery, and randomised into two groups (<b>esmolol</b> group and lidocaine group). METHODS: After induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone, vecuronium, fentanyl and isoflurane, one group received iv <b>esmolol</b> 1. 5 mg. kg- 1 and the other iv lidocaine 1. 5 mg. kg- 1, 130 sec before endotracheal intubation. The MAP measured with a radial catheter, the ICP obtained with a lumbar subarachnoid catheter and the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP, calculated from MAP and ICP) were assessed before induction of anaesthesia, before <b>esmolol</b> or lidocaine injection, and before intubation, during the maximal change in MAP, as well as 2 and 5 minutes after intubation. RESULTS: The time course of MAP, ICP and CCP were similar throughout the study in the two groups, with a significant decrease (P &lt; 0. 05) of the CPP from 92 +/- 12 to 62 +/- 8 mmHg after <b>esmolol,</b> and from 96 +/- 12 to 68 +/- 15 mmHg after lidocaine. Following intubation, CPP increased significantly (P &lt; 0. 05) to 99 +/- 23 mmHg after <b>esmolol</b> and to 99 +/- 17 mmHg after lidocaine. The ICP increased also significantly (P &lt; 0. 05) after intubation from 11 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 10 mmHg in the <b>esmolol</b> group, and from 10 +/- 6 to 16 +/- 9 mmHg in the lidocaine group. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Esmolol</b> or lidocaine as an iv bolus of 1. 5 mg. kg- 1 before laryngoscopy and intubation do not completely prevent the increase in MAP and ICP...|$|E
40|$|Aspiration of gastric {{content and}} delayed or failed {{intubation}} {{are the leading}} causes of anesthesia-related mortality and morbidity. In the recovery period, airway obstruction with subsequent hypoxia is a relatively common cause of morbidity, and is highly associated {{to the amount of}} opioids administered, especially in obese patients. The overall aim of this thesis was to study these risk factors for airway complications and postoperative hypoxia in obese patients, and to evaluate possible strategies for their prevention. In Study I, intubation times and incidence of failed intubation in obese patients were compared between direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy with the Stortz® C-MAC™. In Studies II and III, the effect of <b>esmolol</b> vs. remifentanil on the esophageal junction, and the possible analgesic properties of low-dose <b>esmolol</b> vs. placebo were evaluated using high-resolution manometry and the cold pressor test, respectively. Finally, in Study IV, the possible opioid-sparing effect of <b>esmolol</b> after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery was evaluated. The use of videlaryngoscopy did not shorten intubation times, however appeared to reduce the incidence of failed intubation. Our results also show that <b>esmolol</b> has a favorable profile, compared to remifentanil, with regard to the protection against passive regurgitation and aspiration of gastric content. No analgesic effect of low-dose <b>esmolol</b> was however demonstrated. The intraoperative administration of <b>esmolol</b> instead of remifentanil also did not reduce the requirement of morphine for treatment of post-operative pain. The use of Stortz® C-MAC™ may be recommended for intubation of obese patients. Further studies are however required to clarify the possible role of <b>esmolol</b> in anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|<b>Esmolol</b> {{has been}} shown to improve {{postoperative}} pain and reduce opioid requirements. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of perioperative <b>esmolol</b> as an adjunct on early postoperative pain intensity, recovery profile, and anesthetic requirement. Databases were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the effects of <b>esmolol</b> during general anesthesia. Primary outcomes were related to early postoperative pain whereas secondary outcomes were related to emergence time, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and intraoperative anesthetic requirement. Nineteen trials were identified involving 936 patients (<b>esmolol</b> = 470, placebo = 466). In <b>esmolol</b> group, numeric pain scores at rest in the immediate postoperative period were reduced by 1. 16 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 97 – 0. 35, I 2 = 96. 7 %) out of 10. Opioid consumption was also decreased in the postanesthesia care unit compared with placebo, mean difference of 5. 1 mg (95 % CI: 7. 0 – 3. 2, I 2 = 96. 9 %) morphine IV equivalents; a 69 % reduction in opioid rescue dosing was noted (odds ratio [OR]: 0. 31, 95 % CI: 0. 16 – 0. 80, I 2 = 0. 0 %). A 61 % reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting was also evident (OR: 0. 39, 95 % CI: 0. 20 – 0. 75, I 2 = 60. 7 %). A reduction in propofol induction dose was noted in the <b>esmolol</b> group (mean difference: − 0. 53 mg/kg, 95 % CI: − 0. 63 –− 0. 44, I 2 = 0. 0 %). A decrease in end-tidal desflurane equivalent (mean difference: 1. 70 %, 95 % CI: − 2. 39 –− 1. 02, I 2 = 92. 0 %) and intraoperative opioid usage (fentanyl equivalent, mean difference: 440 μg, 95 % CI: − 637 –− 244, I 2 = 99. 6 %) was observed in <b>esmolol</b> group. <b>Esmolol</b> had no effect on the emergence time. Perioperative <b>esmolol</b> as an adjunct may reduce postoperative pain intensity, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea vomiting.
