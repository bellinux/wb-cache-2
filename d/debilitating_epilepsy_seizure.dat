About 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, and nearly two out of every three new cases are discovered in developing countries.

New-onset epilepsy in elderly people often has underlying etiology, including cerebrovascular diseases, primary neuron degenerative disorders, intracerebral tumors, and traumatic head injury. In addition, an acute symptomatic seizure cannot be called epilepsy, which manifests usually {{as a common}} symptom secondary to metabolic or toxicity factors in older people. In this review, we have mainly focused on the causes of new-onset <b>epilepsy</b> and <b>seizures</b> in elderly people. This knowledge will certainly help us to understand the reasons for high incidences of <b>epilepsy</b> and <b>seizures</b> in elderly people. We look forward to controlling epileptic seizures via the treatment of primary diseases in the future. Keywords: <b>epilepsy,</b> <b>seizures,</b> causes, elderl...|$|R

40|$|Epilepsy is a {{neurological}} disorder disease {{that affects the}} central nervous system of the human brain that can disrupt the activity of the nervous cells in the brain which will result in unusual behavior that can lead to loss of consciousness called epileptic seizure that can endanger the life of the patient. Therefore, automated <b>epilepsy</b> <b>seizure</b> detection is the solution to the limitation and time consuming of manual epilepsy monitoring and detection using EEG signals. Thus, using MATLAB R 2014 b, we developed a technique for <b>epilepsy</b> <b>seizure</b> detection using EEG signals, and we achieved an accuracy of 97 %. For our main contribution, we developed an Android-based smartphone application for monitoring epilepsy detection based on the classification results of the EEG signal.

Once the EEG signal is classified as epileptic, the App will display a visual notification indicating that Epileptic Seizure has been detected. Moreover, it will trigger an alarm and send a message notification to all associated phone numbers.

40|$|Background: An {{inpatient}} medication chart review at the Gold Coast Hospital identified shortcomings {{with the}} prescribing and monitoring of antiepileptic medications. Aim: To evaluate medication management {{of patients with}} <b>epilepsy,</b> <b>seizure</b> or convulsion; to map their transition through the health system; and to identify lifestyle behaviours {{that may lead to}} overt risks for seizure occurrence. Method: A retrospective observational audit of adult patients (16 years and over) admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of <b>epilepsy,</b> <b>seizure</b> or convulsion from 1 to 31 January 2012. Results: Majority of the 62 episodes of care investigated involved patients who were discharged directly from the ED (68 %). Only 30 % of all patients discharged from an inpatient unit received a discharge medication record from a pharmacist. Non-adherence with antiepileptic medications, alcohol and/ or recreational drug use and prescription medication misuse were identified as overt risks for seizure occurrence. Conclusion: Valuable insights were gained into the management of seizure patients. The role of the ED pharmacist was reviewed to focus on high-risk seizure patients. An increase in the provision of discharge medication records and patient education on the overt risks for seizure occurrence is needed. Full Tex...|$|R
