This construction can be used as an indirect speech mechanism, in many instances interchangeable with a complementary declarative clause introduced by [...] "ὅτι/"ὡς" [...] (or a supplementary participle [...] ). But with some verbs (normally with verbs of thinking, as , , , [...] etc., with the verb [...] "say, affirm, assert" [...] , with verbs denoting hope, oath or promise, such as [...] "hope", [...] "swear", [...] "promise", etc.) the infinitival construction is the rule in classical Greek. Yet it can be also in use with any infinitival use, no matter whether indirect speech is <b>involved</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> In the following examples the infinitival clause is put in square brackets : ...|$|E

Battle reliefs at Karnak from the reign of Seti I depict the king in combat with Libyan masses; however the text only describes the Libyans as being Tjehenu, one of the generic terms for [...] "Libyan" [...] in the Egyptian language, rather than a specific tribal designation. During the following reign, that of Ramesses II, the Egyptians constructed a series of coastal fortresses running west to the region of Marsa Matruh, including at al-Alamayn and Zawayat Umm al-Rakham. The presence of these fortresses indicate a serious threat from the west, and Ramesses does claim to have overthrown Libyans in various rhetorical texts.

Data are provided for representative organic reactions <b>involving</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> molecular catalysts and show that energy storage occurs only when a heavily strained structure is generated, and in that case only a minor part of photon energy is actually stored (ΔG up to 25 kcal·mol− 1).

5000|$|The {{custom of}} holding this festival came into {{prominence}} between 1697 and 1699 when statehood was achieved {{for the people}} of Ashante after the war of independence, the Battle of Feyiase, against the Denkyira. The festival was observed subsequently to the establishment of the Golden Stool (throne) in 1700. The festival was a time to consecrate the remains of the dead kings; those remains had been kept in a mausoleum at the sacred burial ground of Bantama, a royal suburb of Kumasi. Adae Kese brought a link and a level of faith and solidarity between the living and the ancestral spirits. In its early times, this festival also had implications of sacrifice, both human and animal. The main festival used to be held first at Hemmaa, close to the king’s palace near the location of the ancestral shrine of the kings. The second and more important part of the festival was performed at Bantama, which also was the last burial ground of the Asante kings, and was known as the “notorious Bantama ritual" [...] as the sacrifices involved were of large proportions. When the festival was announced, by beating of drums, people went into hiding for fear that they may be selected for the human sacrifice. As part of the ritual, sheep sacrifice was also involved.

In addition, the association between ectopic neurohypophysis and other cortical malformations, including bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria, has been documented. We describe a girl affected by focal epilepsy since the age of 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 11 and 22 years of age showed bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria, dysplasia of the left cerebellar hemisphere, and ectopic neurohypophysis. Genetic tests, including fluorescent in situ hybridization 22 q 11. 2 and array-comparative genomic hybridization, and pituitary hormones (at the age of 20 years) were normal. The patient is now 22 years old, and she is seizure free under therapy with lamotrigine and levetiracetam. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of this complex cerebral malformation. This finding confirms that bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria can be associated with other cerebral malformations; cerebellum and neurohypophysis must be carefully evaluated in patients with polymicrogyria...|$|R

40|$|The Von Kármán Sodium {{experiment}} {{yields a}} variety of dynamo regimes, when asymmetry is imparted to the flow by rotating impellers at different speed F 1 and F 2. We show that as the intensity of forcing, measured as F 1 +F 2, is increased, {{the transition to a}} self-sustained magnetic field is always observed via a supercritical bifurcation to a stationary state. For some values of the asymmetry parameter θ=(F 1 –F 2) /(F 1 +F 2), time dependent dynamo regimes develop. They are observed either when the forcing is increased for a given value of asymmetry, or when the amount of asymmetry is varied at sufficiently high forcing. Two qualitatively different transitions between oscillatory and stationary regimes are reported, <b>involving</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> a strong divergence of the period of oscillations. These transitions can be interpreted using a low dimensional model based on the interactions of two dynamo modes. Copyright EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010...|$|R
