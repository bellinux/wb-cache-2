2500|$|The BIS was {{originally}} intended to facilitate reparations imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, and to act as the trustee for the German Government International Loan (Young Loan) that was floated in 1930. The need to establish a dedicated institution for this purpose was suggested in 1929 by the Young Committee, and was agreed to in August of that year at a conference at The Hague. [...] A charter for the bank was drafted at the International Bankers Conference at Baden-Baden in November, and its charter was adopted at a second Hague Conference on January 20, 1930. According to the charter, shares in the bank could be held by individuals and non-governmental entities. [...] However, the rights of voting and representation at the Bank’s General Meeting were to be exercised exclusively by the central banks {{of the countries in}} which the shares had been initially subscribed. The BIS was constituted as having corporate existence in Switzerland on the basis of an agreement with Switzerland acting as <b>headquarters</b> <b>state</b> for the bank. It also enjoyed certain immunities in the contracting states (Brussels Protocol 1936).|$|E
