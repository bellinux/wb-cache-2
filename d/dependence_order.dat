40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{an approach}} to the ordering of dependence {{which is based on}} central regions. A d-variate probability distribution is described by a nested family of sets, called central regions. Those regions are a#ne equivariant, compact and starshaped and concentrate about a properly defined center. They can be seen as level sets of a depth function. Special cases are Mahalanobis, zonoid, and likelihood regions. A d-variate distribution is called more dependent than another one if the volume of each central region is smaller with the first distribution. This <b>dependence</b> <b>order</b> is characterized by an inequality between determinants of certain parameter matrices if either (i) F and G are arbitrary distributions and the central regions are Mahalanobis or (ii) F and G belong to an elliptical family of distributions and the central regions are arbitrary. If the regions are zonoid regions, the <b>dependence</b> <b>order</b> implies the ordering of lift zonoid volumes. Alternatively, the <b>dependence</b> <b>order</b> is applied to the copulae of the given distributions. Generalized correlation indices are proposed which are increasing with the dependence orders.

This paper introduces an ordering-free local dependence measure which is invariant to any permutation of the observations {{and can be used}} to express various notions of temporal and spatial weak dependence.

40|$|AbstractConsider {{a system}} that {{consists}} of several components. Shocks arrive according to a counting process (which may be non-homogeneous and with correlated interarrival times) and each shock may simultaneously destroy {{a subset of the}} components. Shock models of this type arise naturally in reliability modeling in dynamic environments. Due to correlated shock arrivals, individual component lifetimes are statistically dependent, which makes the explicit evaluation of the joint distribution intractable. To facilitate the development of easily computable tight bounds and good approximations, an analytic analysis of the dependence structure of the system is needed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a general framework for studying the correlation structure of shock models in the setup of a multivariate, correlated counting process and to systematically develop upper and lower bounds for its joint component lifetime distribution and survival functions. The thrust of the approach is the interplay between a newly developed notion, majorization with respect to weighted trees, and various stochastic <b>dependence</b> <b>orders,</b> especially orthant <b>dependence</b> <b>orders</b> of random vectors and orthant <b>dependence</b> <b>orders</b> of stochastic processes. It is shown that the dependence nature of the joint lifetime is inherited from spatial dependence and temporal dependence; that is, dependence among various components due to simultaneous arrivals and dependence over different time instants introduced by the shock arrival process. The two types of dependency are investigated separately and their joint impact on the performance of the system is analyzed. The results are used to develop computable bounds for the statistics of the joint component lifetimes, which are tighter than the product-form bounds under certain conditions. The shock model with a non-homogeneous Poisson arrival process is studied as an illustrative example. The result is also applicable to the cumulative damage model with multivariate shock arrival processes...|$|R
