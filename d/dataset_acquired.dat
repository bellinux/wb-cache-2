40|$|The LIDAR {{technique}} is an efficient tool for continuous monitoring {{of air pollution}} over urban areas, with high temporal and range resolution. The urban areas of Athens, Greece, exhibit high air pollution levels, especially those regarding suspended particulates, mainly linked with car traffic and industrial emissions. In this paper, we present the first mobile Greek LIDAR system, based on the LabVIEW code, now located at the Athens Technical University Campus, nearby the urban area of the city. The LIDAR <b>dataset</b> <b>acquired,</b> under various air pollution and meteorological conditions, gives specific indications of the diurnal variation of the backscattering coefficient and relative backscatter of the suspended particulates in the first 2500 - 3000 m ASL over the city of Athens.

40|$|In this PhD thesis, a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data {{classification}} workflow is proposed. This methodology {{is inspired by}} seismic exploration and includes three discrete stages. Each stage {{can be considered as}} a distinct step for GPR data interpretation. The first stage includes filtering, gain and migration. The second includes the calculation of instantaneous and geometrical attributes, a technique employed the past few decades, for the qualitative and quantitative interpretation of seismic data. The third stage includes attributes classification using multivariate statistics, neural networks and fuzzy logic. The main purpose of attributes classification is to organize data with similar multi-attribute response. The above mentioned methodology is applied on a <b>dataset</b> <b>acquired</b> over a controlled experiment, under the EU program HYGEIA (HYbrid Geophysical technology for the Evaluation of Insidious contaminated Areas) for buried pipe detection and a <b>dataset</b> <b>acquired</b> in the ancient city of Aptera in Chania, Crete, Greece.
