5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to}} be conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates is very similar to that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E

500|$|... "Underneath the Stars" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for Daydream. The song featured a [...] "'70s soul vibe" [...] as well as synthetic record scratches, in order to the give the song an authentic '70s sound. Carey felt the additions were simple steps taken to further display a contemporary R groove. Additionally, she felt the song paid homage to the style of Minnie Riperton, {{who was one of}} Carey's biggest vocal influences growing up. The song <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> sound, and had [...] " [...] of texture" [...] and bass, showing a more creative side to Carey.|$|E
500|$|Around 800 CE, Adi Shankara, {{the legendary}} sage and preceptor of the Advaita Vedanta system, implicitly {{recognized}} Shakta philosophy and Tantric liturgy {{as part of}} mainstream Hinduism in his powerful (and still hugely popular) hymn known as Saundaryalahari or [...] "Waves of Beauty". Shankara, while [...] "not a Shakta in the sectarian sense, [...] <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> corner for Shakta religion, perhaps due to its popularity among the masses." [...] Another important Shakta text often attributed to Shankara is the hypnotically exquisite Mahishasura Mardini Stotra, a 21-verse hymn derived from the Devi Mahatmya that constitutes [...] "one of the greatest works ever addressed to the supreme feminine power." ...|$|E

She {{was said to}} have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> face with strong features—a classic beauty contrasting with the king's preference for [...] "sultry" [...] women. Her personal speaking voice was soft and warm, but when conducting affairs of the state, she asserted her points with strength. Her public manner was formal, and she heavily adhered to court etiquette and traditional law. Underwood described the Empress in the following: ...|$|E

2500|$|Stalin <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> voice, {{and when}} {{speaking}} Russian {{he did so}} slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing. Although he avoided doing so in public, in private Stalin used coarse language. Described as a poor orator, according to Volkogonov, Stalin's speaking style was [...] "simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics". He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form. His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and conciseness.|$|E
2500|$|Although Takeuchi herself <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> {{spot for}} Mamoru, {{she has said}} that friends complained to her about Usagi being in love with [...] "such a useless guy." [...] He has been {{described}} as being both a [...] "dashing hero" [...] and a [...] "boy-damsel in distress" [...] by Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy. He has even been called a [...] "liability" [...] and a [...] "burden," [...] his relationship with Usagi being described as a child-mother relationship rather than that of a principality couple. Usagi is said to show him amae, or [...] "indulgent love." [...] When compared to male leads of male-targeted series, Mamoru, although unafraid of girls, seems uncomfortable with them. He also gives the impression of a [...] "character who never laughs or has fun": [...] "noble, passive and effectively totally ineffectual." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1994 to 2015, {{the team}} mascot was Ragnar (played by Joseph Juranitch) and {{was based on}} the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok. Juranitch admits to being {{somewhat}} of an eccentric—he holds the current world record for fastest time shaving a beard with an axe, but hasn't shaved his beard since he won the Ragnar job among 3,000 applicants. Ragnar drove onto the field {{at the beginning of a}} game dressed in Viking garb, on a motorcycle, while a cheerleader used to ride a snowmobile. Although never one to shy away from confrontations with opposing players, notably Chad [...] "Ochocinco" [...] Johnson, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> spot for Brett Favre while the quarterback started for the rival Green Bay Packers. In 2015, the Vikings announced that they were not able to reach a new contract agreement with Juranitch which he wanted $20,000 per game, and released him.|$|E
