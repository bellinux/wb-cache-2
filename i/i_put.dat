5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song <b>I</b> <b>put</b> myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E

5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When <b>I</b> <b>put</b> him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Simone biographical film were {{released}} {{at the end}} of 2005, to be based on Simone's autobiography <b>I</b> <b>Put</b> a Spell on You (1992) and to focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006; Simone's daughter, Simone Kelly, has since refuted the existence of a romantic relationship between Simone and Henderson on account of his homosexuality. Cynthia Mort, screenwriter of Will & Grace and Roseanne, has written the screenplay and directed the film, Nina, which stars Zoe Saldana in the title role. In May 2014, the film was shown to potential distributors at the Cannes Film Festival, but has, , not been seen by reviewers.|$|E

5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted.

25|$|The {{names of}} {{the streets of the}} three towns I {{surveyed}} were taken from Bishoprics and the way it was done was this; as soon as I completed the map I took it to Thomas who putting on his gold spectacles and opening his would read out a Bishop's name to hear if it sounded well.

25|$|A main {{target for}} {{expansion}} {{was the city}} Mari, which controlled the caravan route between Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The king of Mari, Iakhdunlim, was assassinated by his own servants, possibly on Shamshi-Adad I's orders. Shamshi-Adad I seized the opportunity and occupied Mari c. 1741 BC. Shamshi-Adad <b>I</b> <b>put</b> his second son, Yasmah-Adad on the throne in Mari, {{and then returned to}} Shubat-Enlil.

The Quinlan Company became the Harrison Frewin Company, which was acquired by the impresario H B Phillips in 1916 for £1,750. In October 1918 the Carl Rosa Company acquired the Phillips and Harrison Frewin companies.|$|E

The book sold 100,000 copies, more than any of his previous political works, and propelled Masuzoe into the national spotlight as an authority on the aging society in Japan.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, the Council held {{a conference}} with the New South Wales Rugby League, from which {{preliminary}} plans were drawn {{up for a}} hybrid between rugby league and Australian rules football known as universal football.
