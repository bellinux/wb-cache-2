40|$|A {{real-time}} emissions {{reporting system}} includes an instrument module adapted to be detachably {{connected to the}} exhaust pipe of a combustion engine to provide for flow of exhaust gas therethrough. The instrument module includes a differential pressure probe which allows for determination of flow rate of the exhaust gas and a gas sampling tube for continuously feeding {{a sample of the}} exhaust gas to a gas analyzer or a mounting location for a non-sampling gas analyzer. In addition to the module, the emissions reporting system also includes an <b>elastomeric</b> <b>boot</b> for detachably connecting the module to the exhaust pipe of the combustion engine, a gas analyzer for receiving and analyzing gases sampled within the module and a computer for calculating pollutant mass flow rates based on concentrations detected by the gas analyzer and the detected flowrate of the exhaust gas. The system may also include a particulate matter detector with a second gas sampling tube feeding same mounted within the instrument module...|$|E
40|$|The design, {{manufacture}} {{and testing of}} a prototype <b>elastomeric</b> equine <b>boot</b> is described in this thesis. Thoroughbred horses may suffer from a number of serious hoof disorders. These include stone bruising, navicular syndrome and hoof wall separation. Excessive concussion in the equine hoof is a major contributory factor in most of the problems horses experience in their lower limbs. Bandaging of a horses foot after injury is time consuming as well as being labour intensive. The proposed boot serves a number of purposes; by replacing bandages during poulticing it plays a part in faster healing of foot ailments. It can also provide temporary protection during light working on hard surfaces or at grass. Another unique feature of the boot is to enhance performance, through optimising shock absorption and eliminating the need for unsafe fastening devices that are typical of many designs currently available. The sides of the boot are made up of an elastic material while the sole of the boot will consist of a wear resilient compound. The {{manufacture and}} moulding of an initial prototype is described, along with a discussion on how computer simulated models of horse movement were generated. The measurement and digitising of a typical horses foot and its modelling using computer software is discussed. Thereafter, manufacture and moulding of an initial prototype is described along with a discussion on how computer simulated models of horse movement were generated. The manufacture of prototype boots culminated in a series of field tests. The field test procedures are discussed and the results of these are compared with a finite element analysis (FEA) model of the boot. Finally, conclusions identifying the significant elements of the design, production and evaluation of a novel equine boot are offered, followed by proposals and recommendations for further work...|$|R
