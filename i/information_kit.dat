40|$|This <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> {{developed}} {{by researchers at}} the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at UNSW provides a step by step guide to the evidence for medically assisted treatment for heroin dependence as well as answering commonly asked questions. Heroin or opioid dependence can be treated with medication and psychosocial support, also known as medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependence (MATOD). The most common medicines used for MATOD in Australia are methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. There is a strong body of research that underpins the use of these and other medicines, but NDARC’s Professor Kate Dolan says often people are uncertain about the role of MATOD in treating heroin or opioid use and dependence. “Heroin dependence can lead to serious health, social and economic consequences for users, their families and society,” said Professor Dolan. “The more information and easy to understand research evidence we can provide for affected people and for the wider community, the better outcomes for those seeking help. ” This <b>Information</b> <b>Kit</b> includes two booklets. The first booklet answers some of the most frequently asked questions about MATOD and addresses common misunderstandings, while the second booklet provides a review of evidence of MATOD...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} voluntary established neighbourhood groups in the dissemination of environmental educational material. It used a participatory case study approach to involve eight neighbourhood groups in an education program disseminating information about wood-smoke pollution and how smoke could be minimised through correct woodheater operation. A primary goal {{of the program was}} {{to determine whether or not}} an environmental issue such as wood-smoke pollution could be linked in and 'piggybacked' on established groups which have other principal interests. An <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> about the problems associated with wood-smoke and clear steps that can be taken to reduce wood-smoke was prepared and given to eight neighbourhood groups in Hobart and Launceston, Tasmania. The <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> comprised of overheads for a seminar, an information booklet, and a pamphlet. The groups were asked to disseminate the information in any way they thought fit. The researcher acted as a facilitator and was available to participate in education efforts and provided support to the groups. The neighbourhood groups were surveyed to see what initiatives they took to distribute and promote the wood-smoke educational material. Observations were also made about the group processes within neighbourhood groups involved in the case study. The outcomes of the case study indicated that a considerable multiplier effect can occur by using established neighbourhood groups and their existing communication networks and interpersonal channels. The education activities carried out by the neighbourhood groups included public seminars on the topic of wood-smoke pollution, a door knocking campaign with wood-smoke pamphlets from the <b>information</b> <b>kit,</b> and education information was published in numerous newsletters. Overall the findings from the thesis indicate that established neighbourhood groups are willing to take environmental issues 'on-board' that are outside their principal interest. Observations of the groups that became more fully involved in the education program were encouraging, and a range of group characteristics were identified which would be useful to target suitable neighbourhood groups for future studies. Assessment of the <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> showed that the pamphlet and seminar materials were of high quality. A telephone survey conducted as part of the assessment of the case study activities revealed that council newsletters may have limited success as a means of disseminating information. This thesis has revealed that there are neighbourhood groups in the wider community that have established infrastructure, communication networks and channels that can benefit the distribution of environmental information. Supplying information to these groups on urban environmental issues such as the wood-smoke issue may provide a double benefit. Environmental education could be spread in an interpersonal manner and public interest and support for neighbourhood groups may increase...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Child {{sexual abuse}} {{is a very}} {{sensitive}} issue that causes trauma and damage to the victims. This does not affect only the victims, but their families and the society at large. It is sometimes difficult for the society to support the victims of child sexual abuse. It then becomes a burden on the families because they lack {{information on how to}} deal with their sexually abused children. The families do not have knowledge of forensic social work and it becomes difficult for them to understand the process of forensic investigation. The <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> for families affected by child sexual abuse will empower the families with knowledge on the process of forensic investigation. This will also help to prepare both the children and their families for what will happen after the case has been reported to the Child Protection Unit. They will also be able to know their expectations when it comes to the court proceedings. An improved understanding will help the child prepare for testifying. Developing an <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> and reader–friendly guidelines will assist in relieving the stress on parents and strengthen them in giving their children the necessary support. Further research should be conducted on families’ understanding of forensic investigation and the court proceedings involved when a child has been sexually abused. Currently there is little data on forensic social work in South Africa, due to the fact that forensic social work is still quite a new field in our country. The researcher thus identified a need for conducting a qualitative study with the parents of sexually abused children whose cases had been reported to the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for forensic investigation at the time of the study. The aim of this study was to develop an <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> for families who were affected by child sexual abuse in order to give them a better understanding of forensic investigations in such cases. An interview schedule was developed with the purpose of confirming whether the families understood what they would be going through during the whole process. From the research it was evident that forensic social work was something new to the respondents as it was difficult for some of them to give detailed responses to the questions. It became clear that the families of sexually abused children are in need of relevant and clear information on forensic social work, the nature of forensic investigations and associated procedures.

In fact, during the past ten years, natural disasters have occurred more frequently than ever before, putting homes and the lives they shelter in the gravest danger. This means licensed childcare centres must take serious precautions if they’re going to be ready the next time nature lets loose. That’s why the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, whose mission is to protect families, homes and businesses from snowstorms, wildfires, floods, hailstorms and earthquakes, is pleased {{to provide you with}} the Protecting Our Kids from Disasters <b>information</b> <b>kit.</b> The Protecting Our Kids from Disasters program was first developed by the Institute for Business and Home Safety in the United States, where it has been used to make over 1400 childcare centres safer from natural disasters. ICLR has adapted this program to fit our Canadian context, and now you can use it to retrofit your child’s childcare centre and others, better preparing them to withstand natural disasters and improving day-to-day safety. The Protecting Our Kids from Disasters <b>information</b> <b>kit</b> supplies everything your volunteer team will need to perform a basic, nonstructural retrofit from start to finish, including: • A step-by-step checklist for project leaders; • Media strategy, including sample news releases; • An information video that shows examples of possible retrofits in childcare centres, and how to do them; • Text that puts the how-to information into handy, easy-to-use instructions. Once upon a time, we could only do so much to prepare for natural disasters. Now we can do much more for only a small investment. After all, British Colombia doesn’t get every earthquake.
