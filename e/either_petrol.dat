2500|$|Since 2012, ADAC {{performs}} regular {{pollutant emission}} tests [...] {{on a specific}} cycle in the laboratory duly representing a real driving environment and gives a global notation independent from the type of engine used (petrol, diesel, natural gas, LPG, hybrid, etc.). To get the maximum 50/50 note on this cycle, the car shall emit less than the minimum limit applicable to <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or diesel car, {{that is to say}} 100mg HC, 500mg CO, 60mg , 3mg PM and 6×1010 PN. Unlike ambient discourse dirty diesel versus clean petrol cars, the results are much more nuanced and subtle. Some Euro 6 diesel cars perform as well as the best hybrid petrol cars; some other recent Euro 6 petrol indirect injection cars perform as the worst Euro 5 diesel cars; finally some petrol hybrid cars are at the same level as the best Euro 5 diesel cars.|$|E
5000|$|Atco in {{more recent}} years have been {{producing}} rotary mowers powered by <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or electricity. Production of petrol-engined cylinder mowers continues with the [...] "Clipper" [...] range, in three sizes.|$|E
50|$|A {{flex fuel}} {{conversion}} kit is a kit {{that allows a}} conventional equipment manufactured vehicle to be altered to run on <b>either</b> <b>petrol,</b> E85 or any combination thereof. They're legal in every state except California, due to that state having its own clean air standards.|$|E
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of petrol engines during the 1950-1960s, the same model became {{available}} with <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> or diesel engine.|$|R
5|$|All entries {{had to run}} Shell fuel in <b>either</b> diesel or <b>petrol</b> form.|$|R
50|$|The Tomcar {{is made in}} two {{and four}} seat models, and is powered by <b>either</b> {{unleaded}} <b>petrol</b> or diesel engines and now in electric. It uses a CVT transmission system and a chain driven final drive system, giving the vehicles a ground clearance of 38 cm (15").|$|R
50|$|Modern AFVs have {{primarily}} used <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) or diesel piston engines. More recently {{gas turbines}} have been used. Most early AFVs used petrol engines, as {{they offer a}} good power-to-weight ratio. However, they fell out of favour during World War Two due to the flammability of the fuel.|$|E
50|$|These {{vehicles}} {{were available in}} rigid and tractor units, with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or diesel engines. The UK military were a huge customer for Bedford RLs using a 4.9-litre straight six petrol engine. Many RLs {{found their way into}} the armed forces of Commonwealth countries and later into civilian use.|$|E
50|$|The Milnes-Daimler {{motor bus}} of 1904 (based on the Cannstatt Daimler lorry), {{operated}} in London by Thomas Tilling, ran on <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or paraffin, but for starting the engine, or frequent stop-start work, petrol continuously was the preferable option. The airflow from the carburetter was heated by diverted exhaust gas.|$|E
50|$|Introduced for 1987, the British market {{received}} the new L300 with <b>either</b> the 1.6- <b>petrol</b> or 2.5-liter diesel engine. Both wheelbases were available.|$|R
50|$|Petrol engined cars {{which have}} not been fitted with LPG/autogas systems by the {{manufacturers}} can usually accept third party systems {{to enable them to}} use <b>either</b> LPG or <b>petrol.</b>|$|R
50|$|Advances in {{technology}} have allowed for portable hydraulic breakers. The jackhammer {{is connected with}} hydraulic hoses to a portable hydraulic powerpack: <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> or diesel engine driving a hydraulic pump; or a mini-excavator or skid-steer via a power take-off driveshaft to the machine's hydraulic system. Hydraulic power sources are more efficient than air compressors, making the kit smaller, cheaper or more powerful than a comparable pneumatic version.|$|R
50|$|A {{catalytic}} converter is an emissions control device that converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas to less toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction (an oxidation {{and a reduction}} reaction). Catalytic converters are used with internal combustion engines fueled by <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) or diesel—including lean-burn engines as well as kerosene heaters and stoves.|$|E
5000|$|The PSA TU {{engine is}} a family of small four-cylinder engines used in the Peugeot and Citroën range of cars. It was {{introduced}} in 1986 with the Citroën AX, replacing the X family, although it shared many components with its predecessor. The TU is available in <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or a non-turbo Diesel variants, the latter called TUD.|$|E
50|$|The Bedford TJ normal {{control light}} truck was {{introduced}} in 1958, available with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or diesel engines. Although never a big seller in the home market (with the exception of Post Office Telephones), {{it was a big}} export earner in developing countries, due to its basic layout and specification, and remained in production (for export markets only) until production of Bedford vehicles ceased.|$|E
50|$|This edition {{was only}} {{available}} in European markets from 2008 to 2010 with <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> or diesel V6 engine. It {{was available in}} either Brilliant Silver or Obsidian Black metallic paint, and featured a redesigned radiator grille, 18-inch alloy wheels, a chromed exhaust tailpipe, side skirts, and unique front and rear bumpers. The interior had pebble or anthracite coloured 'Twin' leather seats and a choice of grey or brown burr walnut wood accents.|$|R
5000|$|Originally all Indian Wagon Rs {{received}} Suzuki's 1.1 L F10D {{petrol engine}} producing [...] at 6,200 rpm and 84 Nm (62 lb·ft) of torque at 3,500 rpm. The newly launched Wagon Rs are {{powered by the}} company's well known K series engine. The aluminum K10B engine produces [...] at 6,200 rpm and 90 Nm at 3,200 rpm. Also, an LPG version is available F10D engined variants, which runs <b>either</b> on <b>petrol</b> or LPG. An automatic version of the Wagon R was released in late 2015.|$|R
50|$|Chainsaw {{engines are}} {{traditionally}} <b>either</b> two-stroke gasoline (<b>petrol)</b> {{internal combustion engine}} (usually with a cylinder volume of 30 to 120 cm3) or an electric motor driven by a battery or electric power cord. Combustion engines today (2016) are supplied through a traditional carburetor or an electronically adjustable carburetor.|$|R
50|$|The Thames Trader model range covered weights from 2 to 7 tons, {{powered by}} <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or diesel engines in four- or six-cylinder guises. The lower-weight {{vehicles}} were available with 118- and 138-inch wheelbases, the heavy weight vehicle with 138-, 152- and 160-inch wheelbases; {{there was also}} a 108-inch tipper wheelbase. In addition there was a low-frame chassis model - typically used for furniture van bodywork.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Holden {{introduced}} a right-hand-drive version of Suburban for the Australian and New Zealand markets with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or diesel motors. A modified dashboard from 1995 to 2005 RHD Chevrolet Blazer was used. Sealed beam headlights (from the 1988-93 C/K series) {{were used in}} place of the one-piece composite headlights sold in the USA and Canada. The models were withdrawn as a Holden brand because of low quality and sales.|$|E
5000|$|The engines, {{which may}} be of two or {{four-stroke}} design, are small in both physical dimensions and power output, relative to larger automobile engines. Power output ranges from less than 1 to about 15 horsepower. The smallest of all are used in handheld garden machinery, such as string trimmers and chainsaws, {{which may be}} as small as [...] piston displacement. The most common are four-stroke air-cooled single-cylinder engines running on <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or diesel.|$|E
50|$|From Jan 1, 2006, all new {{passenger}} cars with spark-ignition engines in Hong Kong must meet <b>either</b> Euro IV <b>petrol</b> standard, Japanese Heisei 17 standard or US EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard. For new {{passenger cars}} with compression-ignition engines, they must meet US EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard.|$|R
50|$|The main {{flexibility}} in the regulations comes {{in the choice of}} engine. From 2011 the trucks could be fitted with <b>either</b> a Vauxhall <b>Petrol</b> Injected 2 litre red top engine or a Ford Duratec engine, both of which are four cylinder engines with a 2 litre capacity and 16 valves.|$|R
50|$|First {{produced}} in 1993, {{the car was}} available with <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> 2.8 and 3.2-litre inline six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz M104 engine, a Mercedes-Benz M111 engine 2.3-litre inline four-cylinder petrol engine, or a 2.3-litre four-cylinder and 2.9-litre five-cylinder diesel engines (Mercedes-Benz OM601 and OM602) with natural aspiration or turbo intercooler (from 1997). The car was designed by Briton Ken Greenley and received the Auto Design Award from the Birmingham Auto Show hosted in 1994 and 1996. Also known for its off-road abilities, the vehicle won the Rallye des Pharaons for 4WD vehicles in October 1994. A facelifted version has been available since 1998.|$|R
50|$|The Marea petrol and JTD engines 1.6 L, 1.8 L and 2.0 L petrol and 1.9 L were sourced {{from the}} Brava and Bravo, and a 2.0 20v turbo option from the Fiat Coupé was also available. For {{a short time}} {{there was also a}} 2.4 {{turbodiesel}} available, dropped in 2001, which has become sought after. A BiPower 1.6 L dual fuel engine was later added to the range. It can run on <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or compressed natural gas.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2006, PrinceGas and Volkswagen {{launched}} the Sharan with a 2.0 L [...] flexible fuel engine, which {{could work with}} <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or autogas (liquified petroleum gas), providing an additional 450 km range over the regular 2.0L petrol engine. Both fuel tanks, the 70L (18 US gallon) petrol tank and the 60L liquid gas tank combined, give the Sharan enough fuel to cover 730 km between refuels at an average fuel consumption of 9.6 L/100 km.|$|E
50|$|Auto rickshaws play an {{important}} role of public transport in Mumbai. There are 246,458 black and yellow metered auto rickshaws, often simply called autos, in the Mumbai MMR as of 2008. Since 2002, all auto rickshaws have been required to use CNG as fuel. However, not all rickshaws comply. Mumbai MMRDA extends up to Alibag, Badlapur, Kaylan M.C. and Ulhasnagar M.C., and in these areas a CNG filling facility is not available, hence the fuel is <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or LPG.|$|E
50|$|The early cars (to 1995) had {{a choice}} of engines, with the LWB {{available}} with <b>either</b> a 2.4-liter <b>petrol</b> (C24NE) engine (developed in the Opel Manta i240) or the 2.3-liter diesel (23DTR) engine originally fitted in the Bedford CF van & Vauxhall Carlton. The Frontera sport (Isuzu Amigo) was available with the 2.0-liter petrol Vauxhall Cavalier engine (C20NE).|$|R
5000|$|In Brazil, until 2015, the Jetta {{was sold}} with the 2.0 L flex-fuel (marketed as [...] "Total Flex") engine in Trendline and Comfortline trims. It could run on <b>either</b> E100 or <b>Petrol.</b> From 2016 model year onwards, the 2.0 L flex-fuel was {{replaced}} by the 1.4 L TSI turbocharged engine from EA211 family, that runs exclusively on petrol.|$|R
50|$|The X90 Cresta {{was offered}} in 4 primary trim levels {{throughout}} its run (the SC, Suffire, Super Lucent and Tourer), each {{with their own}} options and even more specific trim categorizations. All cars shared common longitudinal layout architecture as well as certain options standard, like automatic climate control and side-impact bars, not to mention driver-side airbags in 1995. The base trim level SC had very little in terms of options; it was powered by <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> or diesel engine mated to a 4-speed automatic. The next level Suffire had the same options available (or lack thereof) as the SC plus an optional 5-speed manual.|$|R
50|$|LPG {{has a lower}} {{energy density}} per liter than <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or fuel-oil, so the {{equivalent}} fuel consumption is higher. Many governments impose less tax on LPG than on petrol or fuel-oil, which helps offset the greater consumption of LPG than of petrol or fuel-oil. However, in many European countries this tax break is often compensated by a much higher annual tax on cars using LPG than on cars using petrol or fuel-oil. Propane is the third most widely used motor fuel in the world. 2013 estimates are that over 24.9 million vehicles are fueled by propane gas worldwide. Over 25 million tonnes (over 9 billion US gallons) are used annually as a vehicle fuel.|$|E
50|$|LPG {{is popular}} in Australia, {{because it is}} less than half the price of petrol in urban areas (approx -0.75 per litre, as opposed to -1.35 per litre for {{unleaded}} fuel and -1.30 per litre for diesel, as of February 2010), and it is locally produced. The two major local manufacturers, (Ford and Holden), offer factory fitted autogas in some models of their locally made large cars and commercial vehicles. Mitsubishi Australia formerly manufactured factory-fitted autogas vehicles locally but ceased manufacturing in 2008. All factory autogas vehicles, {{with the exception of the}} E-Gas Ford Falcon model, are bi-fuel vehicles, meaning they have the capability to run on <b>either</b> <b>petrol,</b> autogas, or a combination.|$|E
5000|$|Rotavator: Unlike the Rototiller, the {{self-propelled}} Howard Rotavator {{is equipped}} with a gearbox and driven forward, or held back, by its wheels. The gearbox enables the forward speed to be adjusted while the rotational speed of the tines remains constant which enables the operator to easily regulate the extent to which soil is engaged. For a two-wheel tractor rotavator this greatly reduces the workload of the operator as compared to a rototiller. These rotavators are generally more heavy duty, come in higher power (4-18 horsepower or 3-13 kilowatts) with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> or diesel engines and can cover much more area per hour. The trademarked word [...] "Rotavator" [...] is one of the longest single-word palindromes in the English language.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2005, the Golf Mk5 GT was announced, which {{featured}} {{a choice of}} <b>either</b> 1.4 L <b>petrol</b> engine in twincharger (TSI) configuration, or a 2.0 litre TDI. Both are available as [...] versions; while the diesel also is available as a [...] variant in the UK. The [...] diesel has 350 Nm of torque, {{which is more than}} the range topping R32.|$|R
50|$|Napalm is a {{flammable}} liquid used in warfare. It {{is a mixture}} of a gelling agent and <b>either</b> gasoline (<b>petrol)</b> or a similar fuel. It was initially used as an incendiary device against buildings and later primarily as an anti-personnel weapon, as it sticks to skin and causes severe burns when on fire. Napalm was developed in 1942 in a secret laboratory at Harvard University, by a team led by chemist Louis Fieser. Its first recorded use was in the European theatre of war during World War II. It was used extensively by the US in incendiary attacks on Japanese cities in World War II as well as during the Korean War and Vietnam War.|$|R
50|$|The First Edition of the all-new Volvo XC90, 1,927 {{individually}} numbered cars {{only available}} for sale via digital commerce, {{sold out in}} 47 hours after orders opened on 3 September 2014. All 1,927 of the First Edition models, which could feature <b>either</b> the <b>Petrol</b> T6 or Diesel D5 engine, were finished in Onyx Black and feature 21-inch alloy wheels and include every available vehicle option. The limited production run number represents the year the Swedish brand was launched, with each model fitted with uniquely numbered tread plates and a distinctive rear mounted badge, with customers able to select their XC90 First Edition numbers. Number 1 was allocated to Carl XVI Gustav, the King of Sweden, with number 10 going to Zlatan Ibrahimović, Swedish professional footballer.|$|R
