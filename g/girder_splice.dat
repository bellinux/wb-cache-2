40|$|Traditionally, {{prestressed}} concrete girder bridges {{are limited to}} 150 ft span lengths in Texas due to restrictions on handling and transportation. An effective way of increasing span lengths of precast, {{prestressed concrete}} girder bridges is demonstrated using splicing technique. In <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> bridges, precast girder segments are transported in shorter segments for handling and transportation and then spliced together to form long-span continuous bridges. Different methods are explored for construction of <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> bridges. Two application examples are developed to demonstrate the design of continuous prestressed concrete <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> bridges for both shored and partially shored methods of construction. A three-span bridge having a span configuration of 190 - 240 - 190 ft is considered for both examples. Advantages and dis-advantages of each method of construction are discussed. Construction issues {{that should be considered}} in the design are highlighted. The results {{of this study indicate that}} span lengths up to 240 ft are achievable using standard Tx 70 girders with the help of splicing techniques. A parametric study is performed to further explore the design space of <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> bridges. The results of the parametric study, along with critical design issues that were identified, are highlighted and related recommendations are provided. The results of this study will be of significant interest to bridge engineers and researchers for guidance in implementing <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> bridges in Texas and other states...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} the finite element analysis of spliced continuous reinforced concrete <b>girders.</b> Five <b>spliced</b> continuous <b>girders</b> and one non-spliced continuous girder were analyzed using the ANSYS program. Each <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> consisted of three precast segments spliced at two cast-in-place joints at the inflection points, using splices of hooked dowels. Three <b>spliced</b> <b>girders</b> were strengthened using different schemes of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. The concrete was modeled using (SOLID 65) eight-node brick element and the steel reinforcement was modeled discretely using (LINK 8) spar element. The straight parts of the spliced bars were modeled using discrete representation with interface elements using (COMBIN 39) elements to represent the bond-slip behavior while the hooked part of each spliced bar was replaced by a single spring element. The CFRP laminates were modeled using (SHELL 41) shell element. The interfaces between the precast concrete segments and the joints were modeled using CONTAC 52 interface elements in conjunction with vertical spring elements to represent the dowel action of the steel bars that crossing the interfaces. The ANSYS model succeeded to an acceptable degree in predicting the structural behavior of the analyzed <b>spliced</b> <b>girders</b> with average of differences of about 6...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{behavior}} of spliced continuous reinforced concrete girders was experimentally investigated. The main objective {{was to examine the}} contribution of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates in strengthening the spliced continuous reinforced concrete girders. Eight models of continuous reinforced concrete girder were constructed and tested. The test variables were strengthening the splice joints by different schemes of CFRP laminates, presence of horizontal stirrups through the interfaces of the joints and using binder material at the interfaces of the joints. The results showed that strengthening the continuous <b>spliced</b> <b>girders</b> with 45 ° inclined CFRP laminates led to an increase in the ultimate load in a range of (47 to 74 %). Besides, strengthening the continuous <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> with horizontal CFRP laminates bonded at its lateral faces could increase the ultimate load by 70 %. Additionally, the ultimate load of the continuous <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> was increased by (30 %) due to presence of the horizontal steel stirrups through the interfaces of the joint...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{prestressed concrete}} bridge girder projects {{focus on the}} use of advanced materials including Aramid fiber reinforced polymers (AFRP) bars and self-consolidating concrete (SCC). One specimen is a precast, prestressed concrete bridge girder (TxDOT Type A) reinforced with AFRP that was tested to determine how the girder acts compositely with the bridge deck. The second specimen is a full-scale bridge girder (modified Tx 70) constructed using <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> technology with SCC precast, prestressed concrete girder segments. The major objectives of this research are: (1) to characterize the concrete and reinforcement materials for the AFRP girder, (2) to characterize the concrete materials for the <b>spliced</b> <b>girder,</b> and (3) to conduct a comparative analysis of the AFRP <b>girder</b> and the <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> concrete materials. AASHTO LRFD (2006), ACI 363 (1992) (revised by Al-Omaishi et al. 2009), ACI 318 (2008), CEB-FIP (2010), and Trejo et al (2008) prediction models were used to conduct a comparative analysis of the behavior of the material properties, such as modulus of elasticity, splitting tensile strength, and modulus of rupture, for both projects. It {{is important to note that}} the trends and models discussed in this thesis are limited to the behavior of the concrete tested for this research and the measured experimental data obtained. Further research into the behavior of SCC, curing conditions, and alternative test methods for mechanical properties of SCC would be beneficial for the future concrete industry. Information concerning the longevity of AFRP use in bridge girder as well as retrofitting existing girders using these construction materials is currently limited. Longer term tests of AFRP and SCC in bridge girders needs to be conducted to discern the behavior of the material after a number of years in service...|$|R
30|$|Krauss and Rogalla (1996) conducted, what is likely, {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} study to date. They surveyed 52 transportation agencies in the United States and Canada to evaluate early age transverse cracking. Over 100, 000 bridges {{were found to have}} developed early transverse cracks. Analytical studies were also performed using both theoretical and finite element analysis to evaluate the influence of several parameters on transverse cracking. The researchers determined that span type, concrete strength, and girder type were the most important design factors influencing transverse cracking. Material properties such as cement content, cement composition, early-age elastic modulus, creep, aggregate type, heat of hydration, and drying shrinkage also influenced deck cracking. Researchers conducted a field investigation of 72 bridge decks in Minnesota. The researchers determined that the most related design factors to transverse cracking were longitudinal restraint, deck thickness, and top transverse bar size. The material factors that affect transverse cracking the most were cement content, aggregate type and quantity, and air content. Researchers in Minnesota performed a parametric study considering bridges with steel and prestressed concrete girders. Among variables considered for steel girder bridges were end conditions, girder stiffness, locations of cross frames, <b>girder</b> <b>splices,</b> supplemental reinforcing bars, shrinkage properties, concrete modulus of elasticity, and temperature differential due to heat of hydration. Variables considered for prestressed girder bridges were the times casting in relation to the times of both strand release and deck casting and shrinkage properties of the deck and girders.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the current {{practices}} {{in the design and}} construction of spliced-girder bridges was conducted. Based on the results of this survey, the state-of-the-art of these bridges is reported here. The techniques used to field <b>splice</b> the <b>girder</b> segments to achieve a continuous multispan bridge are discussed. A number of example bridges are presented in some detail for illustrative purposes. The basic theory of time-dependent effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of steel is reviewed. The effect of temperature variation in segmental composite I-girder bridges is described. The development of the equations necessary for the analysis is given. ^ The analysis uses a step-by-step numerical procedure in which the service life of the structure is divided into time intervals. In each interval, time-dependent effects are evaluated, and external loads, if any, are applied. A stiffness analysis is then performed, and the resulting stress and strain increments are added to those obtained {{at the end of the}} previous interval. The incremental nature of this method is most suited for the sequential construction and loading schedules inherent to spliced-girder bridges. A computer based procedure for analysis of composite precast concrete girder bridges with cast-in-place topping is presented. <b>Girder</b> <b>splicing</b> with or without post-tensioning can be used to introduce continuity in the bridge superstructure. The method of analysis presented here is also applicable to other types of multi-stage construction and prestressing involving the use of temporary falsework. The computer program can be employed to evaluate stresses in concrete and steel at any cross section in a statically indeterminate composite beam or plane frame. It also gives the deflection at various stages of construction. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the hand calculations involved and compare the results to the computer solution. ...|$|R
40|$|Steel girder bridges often utilize {{continuity}} {{over the}} pier to reduce interior {{forces on the}} spans. In continuous structures with composite concrete decks, the location of maximum negative bending moment is over the interior supports. This moment produces tensile stresses in the concrete deck and compressive stress in the bottom flanges of the girders. The tensile stress in the deck leads to cracking which allow intrusion of moisture and road salt, causing corrosion of the reinforcement and supporting girders. Continued maintenance is required to forestall the deterioration; however, replacement of the deck is eventually required. ^ To overcome this problem, a 2 ̆ 2 self-stressing 2 ̆ 2 system was developed. The method induces a compressive force in the deck that is accomplished by raising the interior supports above their final elevation while the deck is cast or placement (precast panels). Once the concrete has cured the supports are lowered to their final elevation. Continuity of the steel member and the composite action with the deck produce a compressive stress in the concrete slab, which is balanced by tensile stresses {{in the bottom of}} the steel member. As a result, the cracking over interior support is diminished increasing durability and the need of <b>girder</b> <b>splices</b> may be eliminated making the overall bridge design more efficient and cheaper when compared to conventional design. ^ The experimental investigation was conducted to observe the behavior of the system. Time-dependent effects and behavior of the system under ultimate load were analyzed. Overall, the specimen performed as expected, shown good stability, delayed cracking, and sufficient amount of ductility. Based on the experimental program, the system appears to be a simple and viable alternative to more common method of post-tensioning the deck to obtain an initial compressive force in the concrete deck. As a result, a design guide was developed to aid bridge engineers with the implementation of the Self-stressing Method Design in practice. ...|$|R
40|$|The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is {{currently}} designing typical highway bridge structures as simply supported using standard precast, pretensioned girders. TxDOT {{is interested in}} developing additional economical design alternatives for longer span bridges, {{through the use of}} the continuous precast, pretensioned concrete bridge structures that use <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> technology. The objectives of this portion of the study are to evaluate the current state-of-the-art and practice relevant to continuous precast concrete girder bridges and recommend suitable continuity connections for use with typical Texas bridge girders. A wide variety of design and construction approaches are possible when making these precast concrete bridges continuous with longer spans. Continuity connection details used for precast, prestressed concrete girder bridges across the United States were investigated. Several methods were reviewed that have been used in the past to provide continuity and increase the span length of slab-on-girder prestressed concrete bridges. Construction issues that should be considered during the concept development and design stage are highlighted. Splice connections are categorize...|$|R
40|$|A precast {{prestressed}} concrete <b>girder</b> using in-span <b>splices</b> {{to extend the}} span length is constructed to investigate performance under service and ultimate load conditions. Continuity is provided through the splices {{by a combination of}} mild steel reinforcement plus post-tensioned prestress. The thesis focuses on the study of short and long term deformations in the test specimen between the time the pretensioned prestressed segments were first cast, through splicing, deck construction and curing, and then initial testing. To support these observations, three creep frames are set up and shrinkage readings are taken. Previous research is reviewed to determine what models should be used for the analysis of the experimental results. A time-dependent Matlab program based on AAASHTO recommendations is developed to predict the prestress losses due to the short and long-term deformations. Experimental observations from the test specimen are compared to those predictions. The predictions by most models available for assessing long-term deformations due to creep and shrinkage are overestimated when compared to the experimental observations. Unreliable predictions of prestress losses due to long-term deformations may have significant repercussions on a long-span structure; an over-estimation may lead to a design being too conservative, while an under-estimation may lead to cracking and thereby excessive deflections under service loading. It appears that the over-estimation is, in part, due to the girder units being constructed with self-consolidating concrete (SCC). It is concluded that improved estimates of deformations for such structures composed of SCC girders can be achieved if a correction factor of 0. 6 is applied to the AASHTO recommendations...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{prestressed}} concrete I-girder bridges {{built in the}} past several decades have demonstrated the ability of precast, prestressed <b>spliced</b> <b>girder</b> bridges to compete with structural steel plate girder bridges in the 120 ft– 300 ft span range. Some states limit the maximum transportable length of a member to 120 ft and the weight to 70 tons. Others, including Nebraska, have permitted lengths up to 175 ft and weights up to 100 tons. ^ When span lengths exceed the maximum shippable length or weight, however, girder segments must be spliced at intermediate locations in the girder away from the piers. ^ There are several other ways to extend the span capacity limits of standard products. These include using high strength concrete, establishing moment continuity for superimposed deck and live loading, and utilizing pier geometry to allow longer spans. Each of these methods is discussed and examples are provided. ^ This dissertation discusses the design and construction of spliced-girder bridges. Design theory, post-tensioning analysis and details, segment-to-segment joint details and examples of recently constructed spliced-girder bridges are given. ^ In recent years the trend towards increased span capacity of girder bridges has continued due to the need for improved safety and fast bridge replacement. Precast concrete members must now span further while minimizing the superstructure depth in order to compete favorably with a new breed of high performance structural steel I-beams. This dissertation presents four systems for creating continuous spliced concrete I-girders. ^ For continuous large span precast prestressed concrete spliced I-girder bridges, the optimum solution is often a haunched girder system. Because of the need to use standard sizes as repetitively as possible and to clear overhead obstructions during shipping, a separate precast haunch block attached to the girder bottom flange is used to form a deeper section for the negative moment zone. ^ This dissertation summarizes an extensive theoretical and experimental research into the feasibility of splicing a haunch block onto a standard I-girder to form an efficient negative moment zone. ...|$|R
