40|$|This study {{aimed at}} revisiting and divulging the {{existing}} empirical evidence regarding the informational efficiency and random walk in stock markets of developed and <b>emergent</b> <b>markets.</b> The {{critical analysis of}} statistical tools used {{is out of the}} purview of this study. Most of the empirical literature on the topic after the seminal work of Fama (1965 a) is based on the developed <b>markets.</b> However, <b>emergent</b> <b>markets</b> received greater attention of the researchers after the huge inflow of capital in these markets after financial liberalization. Review of literature reveals varied results for efficiency and random walk in case of developed and emerging markets. Developed markets empirically found to be more efficient than <b>emergent</b> <b>markets.</b> Highly contradictory results are observed for emerging markets depending on the size, influence of insider trader, market integration, liberalization, trading volume, trading process, and infrequent trading. Empirical evidence in favour or against efficiency is a major contribution towards the strategic trading adeptness of a portfolio manager and of a proficient investor...|$|R

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{algorithm is}} used here {{to study the}} stochastic and multifractal nature of nonlinear time series. A parameter can be defined to quantitatively measure the deviation of the time series from a Wiener process so that the stochasticity of different time series can be compared. The local volatility of the time series under study can be constructed using this algorithm and the multifractal structure of the time series can be analyzed by using this local volatility. As an example, we employ this method to analyze financial time series from different stock markets. The result shows that while developed markets evolve very much like an Ito process, the <b>emergent</b> <b>markets</b> are far from efficient. Differences about the multifractal structures and leverage effects between developed and <b>emergent</b> <b>markets</b> are discussed. The algorithm used here can be applied {{in a similar fashion}} to study time series of other complex systems. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} highly indebted countries {{from the point of}} view of their links with the international financial market. Although the more analytical parts of the paper do not refer specifically to Latin America (LA) it consider the regional <b>emergent</b> <b>markets</b> experiences as examples and historical background. Two reasons explain the focus: LA countries participated in the financial globalization process from the beginning, in the late sixties-early seventies and the most important cases of high indebtedness took place in the region. The paths followed by some countries in the globalization process led them to situations of segmented integration. Persistently high country risk premiums place the country in a sort of financial trap, with high interest rate and low growth, highly vulnerable to contagion and other sources of volatility and imposing narrow limits to the degrees of freedom of economic policy. The paper suggests that domestic policy implemented during the process of financial integration, account for most of the variation in the present situation of the different <b>emergent</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{phenomenon}} of consumer co-creation is often framed {{in terms of}} whether either economic market forces or socio-cultural non-market forces ultimately dominate. We propose an alternate model of consumer co-creation in terms of co-evolution between markets and non-markets. Our model is based on a recent ethnographic study of a massively multiplayer online game through its development, release and ultimate failure, and cast in terms of two explanatory models: multiple games and social network markets. We conclude that consumer co-creation is indeed complex, but in ways that relate to both <b>emergent</b> <b>market</b> expectations and the evolution of markets, not to the transcendence of markets...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{posits that}} tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge and hubris influence {{the decision-making process}} of managers when deciding to enter an emerging market. The literature on <b>emergent</b> <b>market</b> strategy and the decision-making process is abundant but tends {{to focus on the}} extant explicit information available. However, the prevalence of literature on the influence of tacit knowledge or experience needs to be further developed. Given the focus on Africa as an area for economic development and the complexity that comes with doing business in Africa, this study seeks to explore what homage is given to tacit knowledge and experience by strategy makers during the process of strategy development, how this knowledge is harboured and developed. The study also seeks to explore the transferability of the knowledge between countries, and if this knowledge can become an inhibitor in developing strategy. A review of the relevant literature is undertaken and a model is developed to map out this decision-making process. A qualitative tool is developed and eight interviews with managers responsible for <b>emergent</b> <b>market</b> strategy development are held to obtain an understanding of how tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge feature on the decision-making process. Key learnings from the study includes a disparity between literature on the importance of tacit knowledge and the growing tendency to formalise the country entry process; the prevalence of heuristics and hubris in the decision-making process, and absence of a review process to validate strategies and decision making.

40|$|In liquid markets the {{frequency}} or timing of settlement (marking-to-market) {{may not be}} expected to impact prices. However during illiquid periods with leveraged trading, settlement can {{have a significant impact on}} forced liquidations and price volatility. This paper presents an agent-based model of real time settlement in a leveraged market with zero-intelligent traders in an open-outcry double auction, stylized after a futures market. Initial simulations produce the <b>emergent</b> <b>market</b> phenomenon of volatility clustering in returns and serial correlation in prices, which is related to the degree of leverage among traders. These results suggest that mark-to-market real time settlement promotes overshooting in prices, as price changes lead to a cascade of deleveraging among market participants in an illiquid market. ...|$|R

Dialogue allows the identification and exploration of tensions and conflict in existing and competing market frames. This in turn generates new and innovative ways of framing markets for future action. Thus, situated dialogic market-sensing emerges as an effective way of unearthing and exploring competing market frames and as a mentoring, reflective and reflexive part of market-sensing practice...|$|R

If the tax burden on corporate gross incomes is increasing, the companies’ management can follow two reasons in deciding the dividend payout: to allocate more for investments, or to increase the dividend ratio. Each of these decisions can be argued based on Corporate Finance principles, depending on the management objectives.
