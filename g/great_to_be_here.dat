500|$|At {{the age of}} 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] That is what I am expected to do, so that I can change the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil (53.43 seconds) and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko (53.66 seconds) in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States (50.78 seconds). Farah finished 45th (and last) out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages. After the event she was appaulded by the crowd and said: [...] "It was <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> to participate in the Olympic Games and tell people Somalia is still here." ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{interest}} of time, I’ll {{just say something}} directly: this is an incredible book. Reading it, thinking it through, is extremely rewarding.

The book presents you with new ideas and connections and it forces you to see philosophy and its history in new ways, even if you (like me) had been quite attached to your old ways. The book got into my head. Now I find myself, in idle moments, arguing with Paul up there in my head; {{as if there is}} a little copy of him in there now, making the case for his versions of inferentialism and cognitive contextualism.

I will try to sketch the general line of thought I find so powerful. Then, I will try to take up my assigned role as critic. The most stimulating thing I can think of to do is to argue as follows: Paul’s arguments concerning Kant and Hegel are largely successful, but end up pushing us in directions that are not consistent with the general approach to philosophy, and the general approach to Kant and Hegel, from which Paul himself begins. So we should abandon that general approach. That is what I will try, at least, to argue...|$|E

While urban development legislation can come from any level of government, some of the most innovative legislative responses to the challenges faced by cities today are being crafted by local governments themselves. Everyone here can probably think of examples of urban development legislation from their own city, whether it’s Detroit addressing abandoned and vacant housing through a blight reduction plan; Seattle passing a living wage ordinance that will help accommodate the high cost of living in that city; San Francisco promoting community health through urban agriculture zoning; or New Orleans redeveloping public housing in the Treme by integrating subsidized and market-priced housing in a mixed-use development...|$|R

By contrast, regulatory policy has generally pursued significantly different ends: protecting the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and reducing systemi...|$|R
40|$|In this {{introduction}} to Cryptography, we start by giving some basic notions from elementary number theory {{and see how}} they can <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> send "secret" messages. After introducing congruence theory, Fermat's little theorem and the Euler-Fermat theorem, we examine, from a historical point of view, some classic cryptographic systems. Then we give the main properties of modern cryptographic systems and, in particular, we define public key cryptography. One of the most important public-key systems (which exploits the fact that in primality algorithms are much "faster" than factorization ones) is presented: the R. S. A. cryptosystem. We also present another public key system which exploits the discrete logarithm problem and which is also consistently used as an alternative to R. S. A. (for example the U.

Let me mention at the start of my exposition that nothing of what I will say can be interpreted in terms of the future monetary policy decision of the Governing Council next Thursday. My colleagues and myself are in our purdah period. During the financial crisis of the past three years, without ever forgetting their medium and long term goals of price stability, central bankers have often had to focus on very short-term developments. At times, we have had to ask what will happen in the next week; in the next day; or even in the next few hours. Now, as the dust settles somewhat and market conditions tend to improve, though not without occasional setbacks, it is appropriate – and necessary – to look again at the more fundamental challenges we face. The chosen topic for this conference – with its focus on “the decade ahead ” – is thus particularly timely. The financial crisis required prompt, decisive and innovative actions by central banks and governments around the world. We at the European Central Bank (ECB) have pursued what I have previously labelled at this symposium a policy of “credible alertness”: 1 solid anchorin...|$|R

In fact, this is my first opportunity to speak in a public forum about the economy and monetary policy since taking on this new role. For a central banker, communication is a critical part of the job. If we <b>are</b> <b>to</b> carry out our mission successfully, it’s essential that the public understands our actions and strategies. Chairman Bernanke’s press conference last Wednesday, the first ever by a Fed Chairman, was a major milestone in that respect. One of the most important policy questions we are grappling with at the Fed has to do with inflation. This subject is on the minds these days of Americans from all walks of life. As anybody who’s paying more than $ 4 a gallon for gas knows, the prices of energy, food, and many other commodities have soared in recent months. This is painful for all of us—especially those with lower incomes and stretched budgets. But, despite the recent upturn, I don’t think that inflation will remain stubbornly high.

I will argue in this talk that the same kind of reasoning, which led us to predict the opening of a new chapter in hadron physics, may shed some light on the existence of new physics at the as yet unexplored energy scales of LHC. The argument is based on the observation that precision measurements at a given energy scale allow us to make predictions concerning the next energy scale.

I hope the story that I will tell you will give you some idea what I {{have contributed to the}} area for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded this year. The story begins thirty two years ago in 1973, the year the Nobel Prize was shared by G. Wilkinson and E. O. Fischer. Wilkinson’s Nobel Lecture 1 con-cerned the nature of a single bond between a transition metal and a carbon atom in an alkyl group, and emphasized the fact that the metal-carbon bond is not inherently weak. E. O. Fischer in his Nobel Lecture 2 summarized the extensive chemistry of transition metal “carbene ” complexes 3, 4 that contain a metal-carbon double bond discovered by him and his group in 1964 (Fig 1). 5 He also reported new “carbyne ” complexes that contain a metal-carbon triple bond. 6 It was clear that metal-carbon single bonds were of great importance in the emerging area of homogeneous catalysis. However, no catalytic reac-tions involving species that contain metal-carbon double or triple bonds were known. When I went to the Central Research Department of E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company in 1972, transition metal organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis were of great interest as a consequence of their huge potential in organic chemistry and therefore in industry. In the early 1970 ’s inorganic chemists knew that many transition metal species containing a metal-carbon bond <b>are</b> subject <b>to</b> various modes of decom-position that are much more rapid than in a non-transition metal species such as Zn(CH 2 CH 3) 2 or Al(CH 2 CH 3) 3.

40|$|It <b>is</b> a <b>great</b> {{pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> today <b>to</b> {{share some}} thoughts {{with you on}} the challenges to the process of European economic integration {{in the aftermath of the}} global turmoil. The financial crisis has exposed widely-held views on large domestic and external imbalances as having several shortcomings, which has led to an overall reassessment of the associated risks. With regard to the process of European economic integration, the financial crisis has undermined the staunch belief in a “development model”, whereby low income countries in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe (CESEE) could achieve rapid growth simply by: (i) engaging in market-oriented reforms; (ii) liberalising trade; (iii) having access to foreign capital markets via debt flows and foreign direct investment (FDI); and (iv) allowing the entry of foreign banks. The associated growing imbalances were judged as temporary phenomena associated with the catching-up process. I will argue today that this development model should not be abandoned, but refined, as the push towards market reform has engendered significant benefits. However, the global crisis has shown that economic convergence in Europe should not be viewed as an automatic process. In fact, stability-oriented policies and careful risk management should accompany and support convergence efforts. With this in mind, I will focus on the following three aspects, which highlight the role of policy in ensuring a sustainable development model: 1.
