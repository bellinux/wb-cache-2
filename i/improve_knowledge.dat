5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead into Gold), but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing belief of the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly <b>improve</b> <b>knowledge</b> of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E

25|$|The vagina and vulva have evoked strong {{reactions}} in societies throughout history, including negative perceptions and language, cultural taboos, {{and their use}} as symbols for female sexuality, spirituality, or regeneration of life.

40|$|Successful {{knowledge}} transfer {{is an important}} process which requires continuous improvement in today’s knowledge-intensive economy. However, <b>improving</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer processes represents a challenge for construction practitioners due {{to the complexity of}} knowledge acquisition, codification and sharing. Although {{knowledge transfer}} is context based, understanding the critical success factors can lead to improvements in the transfer process. This paper seeks to identify and evaluate the most significant critical factors for <b>improving</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer processes in Public Private Partnerships/Private Finance Initiatives (PPP/PFI) projects. Drawing upon a questionnaire survey of 52 construction firms located in the UK, data is analysed using Severity Index (SI) and Coefficient of Variation (COV), to examine and identify these factors in PPP/PFI schemes. The findings suggest that a supportive leadership, participation/commitment from the relevant parties, and good communication between the relevant parties are crucial to <b>improving</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer processes in PFI schemes. Practitioners, managers and researchers can use the findings to efficiently design performance measures for analysing and <b>improving</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer processes. ...|$|R
25|$|In 2009, {{as part of}} the National Bat Monitoring Programme, BCT {{began the}} first {{systematic}} UK-wide survey of Nathusius’ pipistrelles in order to <b>improve</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the distribution of this species. Nathusius’ pipistrelle is considered to be rare in the UK but is widespread and may be under-recorded in some areas. As this species is often found at large water bodies, particularly during the autumn migration period, the survey involves surveying lakes twice during September, and making audio recordings from broadband bat detectors in order to verify Nathusius’ pipistrelle calls through sonogram analysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mosquito-borne {{diseases}} {{are a major}} public health threat in Sri Lanka. A 20 -week pilot education program to <b>improve</b> community <b>knowledge</b> and mosquito control with participatory and non-chemical approaches was developed, implemented, and evaluated using pre-educational and post-educational surveys in two intervention and two comparison villages. Correlates of baseline knowledge were sex, number of family members, ratio of family members with malaria history, school education level, and availability of electricity at the residence. Participation in the educational program led to <b>improved</b> <b>knowledge</b> of mosquito ecology and disease epidemiology, changes in agricultural practices, {{and an increase in}} environmentally sound measures for mosquito control and disease prevention. The variety of actions at the post-educational stage were determined by <b>improved</b> <b>knowledge,</b> but not by sociodemographic characteristics. Such community-based educational interventions are effective in increasing understanding and active involvement in mos-quito control and disease prevention in rice ecosystems regardless of sociodemographic characteristics...|$|R
