40|$|Alexander of Aphrodisias’s {{commentary}} (about AD 200) is {{the earliest}} extant commentary on Aristotle’s Metaphysics, {{and it is}} the most valuable <b>indirect</b> <b>witness</b> to the Metaphysics text and its transmission. Mirjam Kotwick’s study is a systematic investigation into the version of the Metaphysics that Alexander used when writing his commentary, and into the various ways his text, his commentary, and the texts transmitted through our manuscripts relate to one another.  Through a careful analysis of lemmata, quotations, and Alexander’s discussion of Aristotle’s argument Kotwick shows how to uncover and partly reconstruct a Metaphysics version from the second century AD. Kotwick then uses this version for improving the text that came down to us by the direct manuscript tradition and for finding solutions to some of the puzzles in this tradition. Through a side-by-side examination of Alexander’s text, his interpretation of Aristotle’s thought, and the directly transmitted versions of the Metaphysics, Kotwick reveals how Alexander’s commentary may have influenced the text of our manuscripts at different stages of the transmission process. This study is the first book-length examination of a commentary as a witness to an ancient philosophical text. This blend of textual criticism and philosophical analysis both expands on existing methodologies in classical scholarship and develops new ones...|$|E
40|$|All {{existing}} quantum gravity proposals {{share the}} same deep problem. Their predictions are extremely hard to test in practice. Quantum effects in the gravitational field are exceptionally small, unlike those in the electromagnetic field. The fundamental {{reason is that the}} gravitational coupling constant is about 43 orders of magnitude smaller than the fine structure constant, which governs light-matter interactions. For example, the detection of gravitons [...] the hypothetical quanta of energy of the gravitational field predicted by certain quantum-gravity proposals [...] is deemed to be practically impossible. In this letter we adopt a radically different, quantum-information-theoretic approach which circumvents the problem that quantum gravity is hard to test. We propose an experiment to witness quantum-like features in the gravitational field, by probing it with two masses each in a superposition of two locations. First, we prove the fact that any system (e. g. a field) capable of mediating entanglement between two quantum systems must itself be quantum. This argument is general and does not rely on any specific dynamics. Then, we propose an experiment to detect the entanglement generated between two masses via gravitational interaction. By our argument, the degree of entanglement between the masses is an <b>indirect</b> <b>witness</b> of the quantisation of the field mediating the interaction. Remarkably, this experiment does not require any quantum control over gravity itself. It is also closer to realisation than other proposals, such as detecting gravitons or detecting quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|The Greek text of lsaiah 26, 17 - 18, as {{it appears}} in the {{critical}} edition of Göttingen {{is not to be}} found in this form in any direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>witness</b> of the Septuagint. The sentence which the editor has mode negative, in accordance with the Hebrew, is on the contrary affirmative in the whole Septuagint tradition. A Christian addition which has passed into all the preserved manuscripts leads one to read the passage in question as a prophecy of the final resurrection of the confessors of the faith who thus triumph over their adversaries. This is what brought about the suppression of the negative or its transformation into a possessive pronoun {{as well as a number}} of other minor alterations. This Christian tradition of reading is very tenacious; even Jérôme 's version, the reception of which was late, was influenced by it. On the other hand, it is impossible to know how the Jewish Diaspora read this text which displays a number of ambiguities. This raises the question as to whether it is wise to edit a hypothetical text, the details of which are not assured and where it is not possible to indicate the exact meaning, rather than the canonical text which was actually transmitted by tradition.

40|$|This article {{begins by}} {{questioning}} {{the ubiquity of}} {{the use of the word}} ‘trauma’ in reference to the terrorist attacks of September 11. The experiences of the many millions of <b>indirect</b> <b>witnesses</b> of the attacks, via broadcast media and photography, could be said to involve a particular kind of trauma; one that presents fundamental problems for the existing field of trauma theory. This is an unprecedented kind of distanced or ‘by proxy’ trauma that would not have been possible under earlier technological conditions: explosive and shocking images were repeated again and again, with such arresting immediacy that normal processes of seeing and understanding were disrupted. As language struggled to keep up, many testified that words seemed inadequate to express or explain this event, while images somehow came closer. This has led to attempts to grasp and understand it by trying to see and see again; returning to photographs that might help navigate a path back through the tangled web of elusive visual memories and halting words. The work of both Freud and Lacan is used here as a basis to re-examine trauma’s structural nature, and the ways in which the apparent dichotomy between words and images affects the discussion of such an overwhelmingly visual event. It has been argued that the structure of traumatic experience is analogous to that of the production of a photograph. This article examines how useful this theory might be when applied to an event that, as well as being defined as traumatic, can also be called one of the most photographed events in history...|$|R
40|$|Long before Xenophon’s {{writings}} {{were printed}} in the original Greek, Italian humanists were already busy translating them into Latin. In this paper I will concentrate on the contribution of Francesco Filelfo (1398 - 1481), who {{as a young man}} translated two opuscula (Constitution of the Spartans and Agesilaus, 1430), and more than three decades later, for his last and most ambitious undertaking in the field, got back to Xenophon to translate the Cyropaedia (1467), engaging in an explicit polemic with the earlier abridged translation by his colleague Poggio Bracciolini. Filelfo was an excellent graecist – maybe the best in the West before Poliziano – and a keen manuscript collector, and his translations’ manuscripts are punctuated with philological, orthographical and translational marginalia in both Latin and Greek. It’s not a coincidence, then, that Filelfo’s translation still figures as an unequivocal <b>indirect</b> <b>witness</b> to the “original” text in the critical apparatus of most modern Greek Xenophon editions, but a study of Filelfo’s Greek sources reveals a more complicated picture – and so does the edition history of his translations. Both teach us not to take Filelfo’s received text at face value, although it was the standard version Europe read Xenophon in for more than a century: Filelfo’s Cyropaedia edition was printed as early as 1477, forty years before the Greek editio princeps (Giunta, 1516). Together with both opuscula and Xenophon translations by other humanists it was subsequently reprinted in most sixteenth century bilingual Greek-Latin and monolingual Latin Xenophon editions, up to and including Stephanus’ annotated ‘critical’ editions. status: publishe...|$|E

Sc. in Research Psychology) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 This study {{investigated}} (l) {{whether there will}} be a relationship between cumulative adversities and the quality of mental health, (2) {{whether there will be}} a relationship between exposure to violence during childhood and poor mental health and (3) whether there will be a significant difference between gender, cumulative adversities, and exposure to violence and mental health. Data were collected from five hundred participants that were randomly selected from three different hospitals in Gauteng Province. Age of participants ranged between 18 - 65 years. Males were 251 (50. 2 %) and females were 249 (49. 8 %). Mean age of employees was 33. 8 years (SO= 11. 03). Results showed that cumulative adversities (Family, childhood, personal) and exposure to violence (direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>witnessing</b> of violence in childhood) jointly and significantly predicted poor mental health of workers. The variables, family cumulative adversity, personal cumulative adversity, indirect exposure and direct exposure explained 59 % of the total variance on poor mental health. The Durbin-Watson result (1. 58) is less than 2 and therefore shows that the assumption of independent error is met for this model. Results for hypothesis three showed significant main effects for gender on two of the cumulative adversity measurements; family adversity and personal adversity. In addition, there was also {{a significant main effect for}} direct exposure to violence. There were no significant results for childhood cumulative adversity, indirect exposure and the four subscales of mental health-somatic complaints, anxiety, social dysfunctions and depression. Workplace programmes which promote positive health can improve the mental wellness of employees; hence several preventive recommendations were made in line with the findings of the study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{longitudinal}} {{study was conducted}} in order {{to assess the impact of}} the Ghislenghien disaster (July 30 th, 2004) on physical, mental and social health in the affected population. The present study explored the risk for the development of four types of mental health disturbances (MHD) due to exposure to different aspects of this technological disaster in comparison with data obtained from previous health surveys among the population of the same province. METHODS: Surveys were conducted 5 months (T 1) and 14 months (T 2) after the disaster. Potential adult victims (≥ 15 years) were included (n[*]=[*] 1027 and 579 at T 1 and T 2 respectively). The "Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised" (SCL- 90 -R) has been used in order to compute actual prevalence rates of somatization-, depression-, anxiety- and sleeping disturbances for three defined exposure categories: direct witnesses who have seen human damage (SHD), direct witnesses who have not seen human damage (NSHD) and <b>indirect</b> <b>witnesses</b> (IW). Those prevalence rates were compared with overall rates using the inhabitants of the province of Hainaut (n[*]=[*] 2308) as reference population. A mental health co-morbidity index was computed. Relative risks were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of the four MHD were much higher for the SHD than for the other exposure groups, at T 1 and T 2. Moreover, NSHD and IW had no increased risk to develop one of the 4 types of MHD compared to the reference population. The SHD had at T 1 and T 2 good 5 -times a higher risk for somatization, about 4 -times for depression and sleeping disorders, and 5 - to 6 -times for anxiety disorders respectively. Further, they suffered 13 times, respectively 17 times more from all mental disorders together. CONCLUSIONS: The present study calls attention to the fact that mental health problems disturbances are significantly more prevalent and long-lasting among survivors who have directly been exposed to human damage...|$|R
40|$|Multiplexed quantum {{memories}} {{capable of}} storing and processing entangled photons {{are essential for}} the development of quantum networks. In this context, we demonstrate and certify the simultaneous storage and retrieval of two entangled photons inside a solid-state quantum memory and measure a temporal multimode capacity of ten modes. This is achieved by producing two polarization-entangled pairs from parametric down-conversion and mapping one photon of each pair onto a rare-earth-ion-doped (REID) crystal using the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. We develop a concept of <b>indirect</b> entanglement <b>witnesses,</b> which can be used as Schmidt number witnesses, and we use it to experimentally certify the presence of more than one entangled pair retrieved from the quantum memory.

Using data from the National Survey of Adolescents, this study demonstrates that both <b>indirect</b> victimization, through <b>witnessing</b> violence, and sexual and physical assaults of students are pervasive problems at schools. Although a number of individual and structural characteristics predict the risk of becoming a victim at school, the most consistent predictor of violent victimization is the juvenile’s own deviant lifestyle.

40|$|Few {{longitudinal}} {{studies have examined}} the pathways through which family violence leads to dating aggression. In the current study the authors used 3 waves of data obtained from 8 th- and 9 th-grade adolescents (N = 1, 965) to examine the hypotheses that the prospective relationship between witnessing family violence and directly experiencing violence and physical dating aggression perpetration is mediated by 3 constructs: (a) normative beliefs about dating aggression (norms), (b) anger dysregulation, and (c) depression. Results from cross-lagged regression models suggest that the relationship between having been hit by an adult and dating aggression is mediated by changes in norms and anger dysregulation, but not depression. No evidence of <b>indirect</b> effects from <b>witnessing</b> family violence to dating aggression was found through any of the proposed mediators.

The <b>witness</b> depositions included in A Corpus of Early English Dialogues 1560 - 1760 will be studied to discover which lexical means are attested at the beginning of direct speech quotations to signal shifts in speech reporting, considering that punctuation was not consistently used to this end at this time. The analysis will first focus on the preface position in general in order to investigate how direct speech quotations are introduced in the corpus and to discover to what extent attestations in this position are explicitly associated with direct speech reporting (and potentially spoken language). Then, a closer look will be taken at the role pragmatic markers play in this position and how their structural and interpersonal functions may be linked to the change in speech presentation. The aim is to gain further insights into the linguistic means attested in preface position in direct speech quotations of Early Modern English witness depositions. © 2015 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston...|$|R

All direct and indirect reports of speech (direct discourse and indirect discourse) from Mr. Dean 2 ̆ 7 s written testimonial report and oral interactive testimonial discourse are analyzed quantitatively, stylistically, and functionally. Reports of speech with the matrix verbs TELL, ASK, and SAY are the foci of stylistc analyses, which suggest an association of genre with predominance of direct or indirect report and an association of cited report participant authority relations with matrix verb of report. Patterns of reported speech representation in written report and oral discourse are investigated. Reported speech pairs, triples, continuations, and elaborations are described in an analysis of text (monologic context) and discourse (dialogic context).
