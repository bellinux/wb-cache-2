50|$|There {{are three}} types of cokers used in oil refineries: <b>Delayed</b> <b>coker,</b> Fluid coker and Flexicoker. The one that {{is by far the}} most {{commonly}} used is the <b>delayed</b> <b>coker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The product coke from a <b>delayed</b> <b>coker</b> {{has many}} {{commercial}} uses and applications. The largest use is as a fuel.|$|E
50|$|In 1929, {{based on}} the Burton thermal {{cracking}} process, Standard Oil of Indiana built the first <b>delayed</b> <b>coker.</b> It required very arduous manual decoking.|$|E
50|$|For <b>delayed</b> <b>cokers,</b> the MCR of {{the feed}} {{correlates}} positively {{to the amount}} of coke that will be produced.|$|R
50|$|Coking units (<b>delayed</b> coking, fluid <b>coker,</b> and flexicoker) process {{very heavy}} {{residual}} oils into gasoline and diesel fuel, leaving petroleum coke as a residual product.|$|R
40|$|Delayed coking evolved {{steadily}} {{over the}} early to mid 1900 s to enable refiners to convert high boiling, residual petroleum fractions to light products such as gasoline. Pound for pound, coking is the most energy intensive of any operation in a modern refinery. Large amounts of energy are required to heat the thick, poor-quality petroleum residuum to the 900 to 950 degrees F required to crack the heavy hydrocarbon molecules into lighter, more valuable products. One common misconception of delayed coking is that the product coke is a disadvantage. Although coke is a low valued (near zero economic value) byproduct, compared to transportation fuels, {{there is a significant}} worldwide trade and demand for coke as it is an economical fuel. Coke production has increased steadily over the last ten years, with further increases forecast for the foreseeable future. Current domestic production is near 111, 000 tons per day. A major driving force behind this increase is the steady decline in crude quality available to refiners. Crude slates are expected to grow heavier with higher sulfur contents while environmental restrictions are expected to significantly reduce the demand for high-sulfur residual fuel oil. Light sweet crudes will continue to be available and in even greater demand than they are today. Refiners will be faced with the choice of purchasing light sweet crudes at a premium price, or adding bottom of the barrel upgrading capability, through additional new investments, to reduce the production of high-sulfur residual fuel oil and increase the production of low-sulfur distillate fuels. A second disadvantage is that liquid products from cokers frequently are unstable, i. e., they rapidly form gum and sediments. Because of intermediate investment and operating costs, delayed coking has increased in popularity among refiners worldwide. Based on the 2000 Worldwide Refining Survey published in the Oil and Gas, the delayed coking capacity for 101 refineries around the world is 2, 937, 439 barrels/calendar day. These cokers produce 154, 607 tons of coke per day and delayed coking accounts for 88 % of the world capacity. The delayed coking charge capacity in the United States is 1, 787, 860 b/cd. Despite its wide commercial use, only relatively few contractors and refiners are truly knowledgeable in delayed-coking design, so that this process carries with it a ''black art'' connotation. Until recently, the expected yield from cokers was determined by a simple laboratory test on the feedstock. As a result of Tulsa University's prior related research, a process model was developed that with additional work could be used to optimize existing <b>delayed</b> <b>cokers</b> over a wide range of potential feedstocks and operating conditions. The objectives of this research program are to: utilize the current micro, batch and pilot unit facilities at The University of Tulsa to enhance the understanding of the coking process; conduct additional micro and pilot unit tests with new and in-house resids and recycles to make current optimization models more robust; conduct focused kinetic experiments to enhance the furnace tube model and to enhance liquid production while minimizing sulfur in the products; conduct detailed foaming studies to optimize the process and minimize process upsets; quantify the parameters that affect coke morphology; and to utilize the knowledge gained from the experimental and modeling studies to enhance the computer programs developed in the previous JIP for optimization of the coking process. These refined computer models will then be tested against refinery data provided by the member companies. Novel concepts will also be explored for hydrogen sulfide removal of furnace gases as well as gas injection studies to reduce over-cracking. The following deliverables are scheduled from the two projects of the three-year JIP: (1) A novel method for enhancing liquid yields from <b>delayed</b> <b>cokers</b> and data that provide insight as to the optimum temperature to remove hydrogen sulfide from furnace gases. (2) An understanding of what causes foaming in coker drums and ways to minimize sulfur in the produced liquids. (3) An understanding of the HES impacts resulting from hot spots, poor drainage, and settling. (4) A screening model to quantify how other feedstocks and/or a combination of feedstocks will behave in a refinery, and kinetic/optimization models that can represent virtually any delayed coking unit across a wide range of process conditions and feedstocks. Primarily graduate students, post-Doctoral Research Associates and faculty members, will conduct the research in this project...|$|R

40|$|The {{maximum yield}} taken in an oil {{refinery}} can not exceed 70 % without including <b>Delayed</b> <b>Coker</b> Unit (DCU) {{as part of}} unit operations in the refinery. This implies naturally a big attraction on investing of such a unit for refiners. However, during the past decades, there were few refiners included Coker unit in the refinery, {{due to the fact}} of its large capital investment with a high marginal profitability. On the other hand the technologies developed to operate a coker unit, involve a series of process steps that require highly trained and well experienced operators with a state of art of design to overcome all the challenges with this unit operation. Safety, as a prime factor of design and operation requires much attention in the design of this unit. Among different safety consideration in the design and operation of Coker Unit, this project thesis focuses on the dynamic behaviour of Coke Drums PSV (Process Safety Valve) relief and its interaction with Blowdown section of the unit that leads also to the PSV relief of Blowdown section with change of temperature versus time during the first 15 minutes that is considered as the time required for operators intervention.

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 As {{part of a}} major California {{refinery}} expansion project, a <b>Delayed</b> <b>Coker</b> was engineered {{with two}} heater charge pumps. Unfortunately, during the initial operations, both pumps failed {{within a few days}} of each other, causing the plant to be shut down. The thrust bearing damage from each failure was very similar, pointing to a pump and/or system design problem. One pump was instrumented to measure internal pressure distribution so axial forces could be calculated. With this instrumentation, the thrust loads, during normal operation, were confirmed to be axially balanced. However, when the pump cavitated, the thrust direction changed and the loads increased significantly. Under normal loads, nondirected pure oil mist performed fine. However, at the elevated loads, oil mist could not provide adequate lubrication. The inadequate lubrication condition caused increasing operating temperatures that resulted in decreasing viscosity, causing thermal runaway and ultimately bearing failure...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program (KOKSOVN) {{has been developed}} for compositional steady-state simulation of a refinery <b>delayed</b> <b>coker</b> furnace. The main objective of this work has been to establish a tool for studying the effects that influence the deposition of coke on the inside walls of the tubes {{in order to maximize}} the time of operation (cycle time) between each cleaning of the tubes with a resulting stop in production. The program basically consists of a standard integration package which steps along the reactor (or pipeline) while solving the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) and estimating physical properties for each step. Using a modular approach in the development, the resulting {{computer program}} has some general features which make it a possible simulation tool for any non-adiabatic plug flow reactor with two-phase flow. Depending on the chemical system, the routines for thermophysical and transport properties, phase equilibria and chemical reaction may be replaced by other methods. The program may also be used to simulate a pipeline with one or two-phase flow. Since, however, the total composition in this case is constant, it would probably be more efficient to use tables based on the pressure values, instead of performing tedious VLE calculations along the pipeline as is done in the present program...|$|E
40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{introduction}} of heavy oil in a refinery as a first step. The first step will yield {{an increase in the}} production of the bottom products (vacuum residue, gas oil and diesel). It will also reduce the production of the light products (gases, LPG and naphtha) from ADU/VDU for oil with API above 20. However, we showed that if the heavy oil is below 20 API, the vacuum residue will be the only increasing product. This also reflects on the unit capital cost. The power and steam required by the refinery should also increase as crude oil becomes heavier due to the high amount of steam used in the <b>delayed</b> <b>coker</b> unit. Nevertheless, the fuel for the fire heaters does not show the expected change as compared to the model. The report goes to a further step by replacing bottom product processes with gasification and syngas routes. This step results to reduce the total production of fuel. Therefore, the fuel gasification paths MTG, DME (direct and indirect), and FT are more valuable than other gasification paths. All fuel paths showed a similar amount of fuel production, yielding extra production around 100, 000 lb/hr compared to the base case. Moreover, the direct path of DME provided the lowest estimated cost compared to other fuel gasification paths. The MTG path and indirect DME path have a similar cost. The final step is to investigate two challenges related to the gasification cases: water balance and fuel demand. The investigation shows that more than 95 % of used water can be recovered by recycling water (both direct and indirect recycling). Furthermore, the study shows that MTG and DME-indirect paths demand less fuel when compared to the base case...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the accomplishments toward project goals {{during the first}} six months of the third year of the project to assess the properties and performance of coal based products. These products are in the gasoline, diesel and fuel oil range and result from coal based jet fuel production from an Air Force funded program. Specific areas of progress include generation of coal based material that has been fractionated into the desired refinery cuts, acquisition and installation of a research gasoline engine, and modification of diesel engines for use in evaluating diesel produced in the project. Characterization of the gasoline fuel indicates a dominance of single ring alkylcycloalkanes that have a low octane rating; however, blends containing these compounds do not have a negative effect upon gasoline when blended in refinery gasoline streams. Characterization of the diesel fuel indicates a dominance of 3 -ring aromatics that have a low cetane value; however, these compounds do not have a negative effect upon diesel when blended in refinery diesel streams. The desulfurization of sulfur containing components of coal and petroleum is being studied so that effective conversion of blended coal and petroleum streams can be efficiently converted to useful refinery products. Equipment is now in place to begin fuel oil evaluations to assess the quality of coal based fuel oil. Combustion and characterization of fuel oil indicates that the fuel is somewhere in between a No. 4 and a No. 6 fuel oil. Emission testing indicates the fuel burns similarly to these two fuels, but trace metals for the coal-based material are different than petroleum-based fuel oils. Co-coking studies using cleaned coal are highly reproducible in the pilot-scale <b>delayed</b> <b>coker.</b> Evaluation of the coke by Alcoa, Inc. indicated that while the coke produced is of very good quality, the metals content of the carbon is still high in iron and silica.

40|$|LectureDelayed coking is a {{refining}} process {{that consists of}} the upgrading of petroleum residues into lighter and more valuable hydrocarbon fractions by promoting thermal cracking on the residue stream. Petroleum coke is a by-product of this process and depending on its morphology {{it can be used}} as fuel for steam generation, cement calcination or as feed stock for the manufacturing of aluminum and steel. Delayed cokers are very complex systems and require a considerable amount of hardware such as fired heaters, coke drums, a main fractionator and a hydraulic decoking system. In a typical <b>delayed</b> <b>coker</b> petroleum residues are passed through fired heaters before they are charged, in an alternating fashion, into large drums as boiling product. In the drums some of this effluent thermally cracks into lighter fractions (vapors) and these are removed from the drum overhead and returned to the coker fractionator before they are sent to a gas plant for further refining. The heavier product that stays behind slowly forms into coke and it is allowed to fill the drum over time. This time is takes to do this is usually referred to as the coking cycle. Once the drum is full and the feed is switched to start filling an empty drum, a series of activities such as sludging, quenching and steam-outs are performed on the full drum prior to removing the ocke. Very high pressure water is used to cut this solid coke out and after some preparations this drum is empty and ready for a new coking cycle to begin again. As stated above, delayed coking is thus a combination of a continuous process through the fractionation tower and furnace and a batch process in the drums. As a result of this configuration the high pressure decoking pump only needs to operate a portion of the total cycle time. Regardless of its ?part-time? operation the water jet coke cutting pump is still a very important component of the hydraulic decoking system because it not only provides the required cutting pressure necessary to cut the coke but also contributes to the quality of coke removed and the duration fo the decoking cycle. Recent history shows that the majority of new hydraulic decoking installations use electric motor drived with fixed speed operation. The pump generally requires on operating speed to produce the necessary pressure to cut the coke and its flow, pressurization, and depressurization duties are controlled by a decoking control valve. During noncutting cycles operators typically shut off the motor to minimize power consumption of the system or they keep the motor running (rarely done), depressurize the line and operate this valve on bypass to recirculate the water through a holding tank until the coke cutting is resumed. Both operating alternatives have their disadvantages with regard reliability (the first) and energy consumption (the second). This paper explores the use of a hydrodynamic variable speed drive (HVSD) with an electric motor-driven pump as a way to increase the flexibility and reliability of the hydraulic decoking system. The HVSD or variable speed coupling (VSC) is able to seamlessly vary the speed of the pump and accomplish the following: Keep the motor running and operate the pump at minimum idle speed during noncutting cycles, avoiding periodic motor shutdowns and start ups; Eliminate the need for soft starter or special motor design considerations to handle periodic start ups; Reduce work and extend life of the decoking control valve by helping with depressurization duties during noncutting cycles and cutting tool mode shifting; Efficiently adjust cutting pressures depending on feed stock quality to avoid coke pulverization. This paper also describes the function of the variable speed coupling and how its unique design features are suited for the start up and intermittent operation of the water jet coke cutting pump. Field data and operator experience from two existing installations are collected and evaluated and the advantages of variable speed operation over fixed speed operation of the decoking pump are highlighted...|$|E
