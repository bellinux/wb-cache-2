When the episode first aired, it was watched by 17.087million American viewers. Reviews were positive, praising the writing and the cliffhanger ending.|$|E
5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> police of The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E

5|$|Poetic form is more {{flexible}} in modernist and post-modernist poetry, {{and continues to}} be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.|$|E

25|$|Egypt {{from the}} Roman perspective: The Romans view the Egyptians {{essentially}} as improper.

25|$|A fast bowler {{can also}} employ intimidatory tactics to anger (or frustrate) a batsman into playing a rash shot, by {{directing}} {{the ball to}} strike the batsman. Intimidatory bowling plays a part in every fast bowler's attack to some degree, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> batsmen sometimes sustain serious injuries that can force them off the field {{and out of the}} game.

But Somerset cricket was rarely dull, and the club remained in business.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{contracting}} 'P. aeruginosa {{can be reduced}} by avoiding pools, hot tubs, and other bodies of standing water; regularly disinfecting and/or replacing equipment that regularly encounters moisture (such as contact lens equipment and solutions); and washing one's hands often (which is protective against many other pathogens as well). However, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> hygiene practices cannot totally protect an individual against P. aeruginosa, given how common 'P. aeruginosa is in the environment.|$|E

25|$|Unable {{to obtain}} the Norden, the RAF {{continued}} development of their own designs. Having moved to night bombing, where visual accuracy was difficult under <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> conditions, they introduced the much simpler Mark XIV bomb sight. This was designed not for accuracy above all, but ease of use in operational conditions. In testing in 1944, it was found to offer a CEP of , about what the Norden was offering at that time. This led to a debate within the RAF whether {{to use their own}} tachometric design, the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight, or use the Mk. XIV on future bombers. The Mk. XIV ultimately served into the 1960s while the SABS was removed from service almost immediately after the war.|$|E
25|$|Conversely to {{the case}} of olefins, {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of enamines has favoured diphosphine-type ligands; excellent results have been achieved with both iridium- and rhodium-based systems. However, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> systems often suffer from low ee's and a lack of generality. Certain pyrrolidine-derived enamines of aromatic ketones are amenable to asymmetrically hydrogenation with cationic rhodium(I) phosphonite systems, and I2 and acetic acid system with ee values usually above 90% and potentially as high as 99.9%. A similar system using iridium(I) and a very closely related phosphoramidite ligand is effective for the asymmetric hydrogenation of pyrrolidine-type enamines where the double bond was inside the ring: in other words, of dihydropyrroles. In both cases, the enantioselectivity dropped substantially when the ring size was increased from five to six.|$|E
25|$|For {{two centuries}} claims {{circulated}} {{of the discovery}} of unseen companions in orbit around nearby star systems that all were reportedly found using this method, culminating in the prominent 1996 announcement, of multiple planets orbiting the nearby star Lalande 21185 by George Gatewood. None of these claims survived scrutiny by other astronomers, and the technique fell into disrepute. Unfortunately, changes in stellar position are so small—and atmospheric and systematic distortions so large—that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> ground-based telescopes cannot produce precise enough measurements. All claims of a planetary companion of less than 0.1 solar mass, as the mass of the planet, made before 1996 using this method are likely spurious. In 2002, the Hubble Space Telescope did succeed in using astrometry to characterize a previously discovered planet around the star Gliese 876.|$|E

25|$|The {{terrain of}} Kashmir is mountainous and at high altitudes; <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> roads, such as National Highway 1D from Leh to Srinagar, {{are only two}} lanes. The rough terrain and narrow roads slowed down traffic, and the high altitude, which {{affected}} the ability of aircraft to carry loads, made control of NH 1D (the actual stretch of the highway which was under Pakistani fire) a priority for India. From their observation posts, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down indirect artillery fire on NH 1D, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians. This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was the main logistical and supply route. The Pakistani shelling of the arterial road posed the threat of Leh being cut off, though an alternative (and longer) road to Leh existed via Himachal Pradesh.|$|E
25|$|Clarendon Club, but was {{not taken}} up by the newly formed Yorkshire county club until 1865 under {{recommendation}} of George Parr. Freeman emerged after a few matches in 1865 and 1866 to jump straight {{to the top of the}} tree in 1867. He had tremendous “cut” from leg as well as pace, which was said by those who played against him to reflect a classic round-arm delivery and powerful twist extending as far up as his elbow. On the rough, even stony pitches that prevailed before the advent of the heavy roller George Freeman was a terror to <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> batsmen, with frequent shooters often being impossible for any batsman to stop. Between 1867 and 1871 Freeman took 269 wickets in a mere thirty-seven first-class matches for a phenomenal average of 8.94 runs per wicket. In these five seasons he conceded only 26.8 runs for every 100 balls he bowled and took one wicket every 33 balls he bowled.|$|E
25|$|Nobody, though, {{could have}} been {{prepared}} for the following year's cricket. Striking their form at the start, Hallam and Wass were so deadly on the treacherous pitches that they won match after match with almost no bowling changes - they took all but fifty of the 348 wickets falling to Nottinghamshire in nineteen County Championship matches, only {{one of which was}} played throughout on a pitch unaffected by rain. In almost all Nottinghamshire's matches, the soft turf took all the spin Hallam and Wass could get on the ball, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wet-wicket batsmen could never make a stand against them. It was thought Hallam should have played in the Test matches against South Africa, but he was chosen only for the third and declined due to a damaged hand which had prevented him participating in Nottinghamshire's game with the tourists. However, he did displace Schofield Haigh from his perennial position {{at the top of the}} bowling averages and was nominated as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.|$|E
