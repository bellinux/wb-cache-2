40|$|A {{monolingual}} Chinese-to-Chinese SMT {{model as}} well as a global optimization strategy are proposed in this paper to extract equivalent Chinese terms (such as“雷射”lae-ser and“激光”gi-guan for“laser”) which are used in different areas of the various Chinese-speaking communities. Preliminary evaluation shows that the synonymous traditional Chinese (TC) terms for simplified Chinese (SC) terms can be identified with an accuracy of 84 % on a small test set. On the other hand, the traditional-to-simplified Chinese term translation achieves 87 % accuracy. Furthermore, the global optimization strategy generally improves the performance by decreasing search errors. The main idea behind the model is to create “paralelleft/right contexts” out of non-parallel web pages for term alignment. The monolingual SMT model, by its very nature to <b>find</b> <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> can potentially be useful for finding synonym sets (synsets) for any generic monolingual lexicon. The potential for adapting such a model for mining large synsets from non-parallel corpora is therefore expectable...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{problems}} of legal translation from Polish into Spanish. It analyses selected terms related to contracts which are regulated in the Polish Civil Code and their possible translations into Spanish. In order to <b>find</b> adequate <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> the author applies {{the method of}} parametrisation of legal terms (along with the method of comparing parallel texts and the skopos theory). The parametrisation of legal terms helps to systematically characterise and compare them and thus to identify differences in the meanings of the source language and target language terms and to choose the best equivalents. It may also facilitate {{the selection of a}} technique of providing <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> for non-equivalent or partially equivalent terms. Parametrisation is understood as determining for each analysed term a set of properties it shows with respect to translationally relevant parameters – one property out of each parameter. A parameter is conceived of as a set of homogeneous properties...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the history of}} Latin maxims and expressions in English, Estonian and Polish legal languages {{and the influence of}} Latin on contemporary legal language and its translation. A number of maxims and expressions were examined by comparing their present meanings in those three legal systems. A selection of fifteen of them is presented in the article, namely: ab intestato, corpus iuris civilis, error iuris, fraus est celerem fraudem, ignorantia iuris neminem excusat, impossibilium nulla est obligatio, inter arma silent leges, ipso iure, lex non scripta, pacta sunt servanda, qui tacet – consentire videtur, restitutio in integrum,m sub iudice, and summum ius summa iniuria. The term Actio Pauliana which is used in the bankruptcy law is used here to show how translators may use Latin terms in order to <b>find</b> proper <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Finally, the authors point out the differences in pronunciation and spelling of Latin maxims and expressions in English, Estonian and Polish...|$|R
40|$|In {{translation}} practice, typological {{differences between}} languages can pose problems {{in such a}} way that the translator has to compensate a source language structure which does not exist in the target language. It is, however, not always easy to <b>find</b> an adequate <b>translation</b> <b>equivalent</b> for such a lacking structure. The aim of this paper is to show how a multiply annotated and aligned corpus can be used as a translation memory for such typologically driven problems, exploiting the linguistic enrichment of the corpus. It is discussed how an existing translation corpus with high-quality translation and alignment is converted into a database and how this database can be exploited as a large on-line resource displaying various translation options for lexico-grammatical problems. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a contrastive {{analysis of the}} English pragmatic markers now and well and their Czech <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents.</b> The overall material is based on 200 + 12 occurrences that were excerpted from the electronic parallel corpus InterCorp, with all the instances appearing in fictional dialogues. The contrastive study focuses {{on the role of}} translation as a means to understand better the nature of the two pragmatic markers. It analyzes specific marker-collocate sequences and the respective Czech <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents.</b> It demonstrates that certain marker-collocate sequences have a tendency to be translated by specific Czech <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> and that the role of other factors, such as position in discourse structure, prosody, and broader context, play in this respect an important role as well. All this and the finding that both now and well share certain Czech <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> add to the multifunctionality of both now and well and prove that a combination of other factors is needed to comprehend the use of the two pragmatic markers in English.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a web-based bilingual concordancer, DOMCAT 1, for domain-specific {{computer}} assisted translation.

40|$|The {{translation}} of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure into English, published in 2014, represents a way of explaining {{the functioning of the}} Italian criminal procedure to a wide English-speaking audience. Given the different varieties of English available, the translation team chose European English as the target language of the translation. After a brief overview of the central role played by English in the European supranational and international context, the paper presents a classification of <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> used for the {{translation of}} the Code and illustrates it by concrete examples. Such classification is based on two criteria, namely the availability of European English <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> in the reference corpus of European documents used by the translation team and the degree of embeddedness of the underlying concept in the national legal system. The resulting classification is threefold and comprises European English <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> for Italian terms designating legal concepts shared by both national and supranational/international legal systems, European English <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> for Italian terms designating legal concepts embedded in the national legal system only, and Italian terms designating legal concepts embedded in the national legal system with no European English <b>translation</b> <b>equivalent...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} extracting <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> from bilingual comparable corpora according to contextual similarity was developed. This method has two main features. First, a seed bilingual lexicon—which {{is used to}} bridge contexts in different languages—is adapted to the corpora from which <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> are to be extracted. Second, the contextual similarity is evaluated by {{using a combination of}} similarity measures defined in opposite directions. An experiment using Wall Street Journal and Nihon Keizai Shimbun corpora, together with the EDR bilingual dictionary, demonstrated that the method effectively improves the coverage of a bilingual lexicon; the accuracy of lists of candidate <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> for frequently occurring unknown words was around 30 %. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Byers‐Heinlein & Werker (2009) studied 48 17 and 18-month-old {{monolingual}} (English), bilingual, and trilingual (22 diverse languages) infants {{to compare}} their patterns on disambiguation. They studied infants {{at this age}} because this is when the heuristic {{has been shown to}} appear in monolingual infants. Additionally, they studied bilinguals from multiple diverse language backgrounds to show that the patterns were not language-specific but rather characteristic of bilingualism in general. they found that monolinguals showed disambiguation, bilinguals somewhat, and trilinguals did not. Byers‐Heinlein & Werker (2009) hypothesized that this was particularly an effect of <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> (knowing the name for something in more than one language), as [...] "they represent a departure from the one-to-one mapping between word and concept that is typical of monolingual vocabularies" [...] (p 820). Indeed, in a later study conducted by Byers-Heinlein & Werker (2013) in 17–18 month-old Chinese-English bilingual infants, results showed that disambiguation did not occur in the infants who [...] "understood the <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> {{for more than half of}} the words in their vocabularies" [...] (p.407), while disambiguation occurred in those who knew fewer <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents.</b> They also suggested that the reverse could be possible—that infants who employed the heuristic were the ones that did acquire the <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> because of the high level of one-to-one mapping. also say that disambiguation and language exposure are not correlated, but the presence or absence of <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> could be attributed by the amount of exposure in each language the child gets. Particularly, if children receive more exposure in both languages, they are likely to have both words for a given object or concept, but if they have less exposure in one language they will likely lack the appropriate amount of <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents,</b> thereby exhibiting disambiguation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper proposes an {{unsupervised}} {{method to}} extract <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> from parallel corpora. The strategy we use {{takes into account}} the context of words. Given a word of the source language and a particular context, we learn its word <b>translation</b> within an <b>equivalent</b> context. We first extract pairs of similar contexts and, then, we compare the similarity between words appearing in each pair. This allows us to use a very low threshold to identify correct <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Moreover, as polysemic words tend to have different senses in different context pairs, we are able to associate several <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> to the same polysemic word. The main contribution of this paper is precisely to learn the correct <b>translation</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a word in a specific context. On the other hand, we do not align texts by detecting sentences or other small linguistic units. We identify natural boundaries by detecting explicit parts or segments of the corpus. Most text corpora contain natural boundaries to explicitly separate basic parts such as chapters, articles, receipts, legal documents, letters, etc. We use these explicit and natural parts to align parallel corpora. To compute similarity within these large segments, we define a particular version of the Dice coefficient. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{ambiguous}} word learning situations, infants can use systematic {{strategies to}} determine the referent of a novel word. One such heuristic is disambiguation. By age 16 - 18 months, monolinguals infer that a novel noun refers to a novel object rather than a familiar one (Halberda, 2003), {{while at the same}} age bilinguals and trilinguals do not reliably show disambiguation (Byers-Heinlein & Werker, 2009; Houston-Price, Caloghiris, & Raviglione, 2010). It has been hypothesized that these results reflect a unique aspect of the bilingual lexicon: bilinguals often know many <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents,</b> cross-language synonyms such as English dog and Mandarin gǒu. We studied the role of vocabulary knowledge in the development of disambiguation by relating 17 - 18 month-old English-Chinese bilingual infants’ performance on a disambiguation task to the percentage of <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> in their comprehension vocabularies. Those bilingual infants who understood <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> for more than half the words in their vocabularies did not show disambiguation, while infants who knew a smaller proportion of <b>translation</b> <b>equivalents</b> showed disambiguation just as same-aged monolinguals do. These results demonstrate that the structure of the developing lexicon {{plays a key role in}} infants’ use of disambiguation...|$|R
