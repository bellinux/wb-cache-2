While {{they have made a}} substantial contribution to good information system management practice, it is believed that further segmentation of sample data and cross-country comparisons will help to identify patterns of behaviour more akin to many less average organizations in North America and elsewhere. This paper compares the Singapore maintenance scene with the reported North American experience. Comparisons are also made between: Government organizations, Singapore corporations and multinational corporations (MNCs); mainframe and minicomputer installations; and <b>fourth-generation</b> <b>language</b> (4 GL) and non- 4 GL computer installations. Study findings, while in many cases were similar to earlier US studies, do show the importance of Singapore's young application portfolio, the widespread usage of 4 GLs and the severe maintenance personnel problems. ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to design and implement a concrete interface generation system. The concrete interface generator is a software system which takes a formal specification as input and generates the specification part of an Ada implementation as output. Attribute grammars and <b>fourth-generation</b> <b>language</b> tools {{have been used in}} the implementation of this system. Spec, a formal language for writing black-box specifications for large software systems, was used as the input for the concrete interface generation system. Ada was chosen to be the computer language generated by the system. This thesis implements a subset of the Spec language, discusses the design methodology used in its implementation, and presents guidelines for the mapping of Spec to Ada. Included is a listing of the Spec grammar, the concrete interface generator systems source listing, a sample of input used to tet the system, and resulting output.

40|$|Function Point Analysis (FPA) is a {{synthetic}} software estimation metric used for computing {{the size and}} complexity of applications. It was first introduced by Allan. J. Albrecht during the mid-seventies, {{as a result of}} a lengthy research based on applications that were developed using COBOL and PL/ 1 programming languages. The purpose of this research· is to investigate the possibility, and the most effective method, of automatically performing a Function Point Analysis on Oracle applications that consist of Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports. The research revealed a seemingly lack of other researches on this topic. As FPA was invented a few years prior to the birth of Oracle, and consequently that of fourth-generation languages, it had to be tailored to suit the <b>fourth-generation</b> <b>language</b> Oracle tools used to develop the Oracle applications. This experiment provided a proof of concept and resulted in a software that achieved its objective of automatically calculating Oracle applications, consisting of Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports, in an a posteriori manner...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} and reported on in abundance at the RIVM. There {{is a lot of}} good software on the market for executing these analyses reliably. For good communication between statisticians and scientific researchers, who use statistical applications in their research, RIVM needs only a few standard packages. This also has financial advantages. For example, S-PLUS has been used since 1992 as the standard package in Division 5 and moreover in Division 2, as rapid development software combined with SAS. On 1 January of this year RIVM took out a completely new licence for S-PLUS, making the package available for Divisions 2, 3 / 4 and 5 at no extra costs, including the use of all the modules and the use of S-PLUS at home. This new situation {{was one of the reasons}} for preparing this document. The first three chapters, written for potential users and management, e. g. laboratory and department heads, IT heads in the Division 5 departments, and managers of interdepartmental projects like the Environmental Balance and Outlooks. These chapters deal with the broad application of S-PLUS as statistical and graphics package, and as a <b>fourth-generation</b> <b>language.</b> The overview of several S-PLUS applications within RIVM speaks for itself. The other chapters, providing a wealth of substantial information, are written especially for users. Included here are the installation instructions of S-PLUS for both home use and use at the RIVM. The report closes with four elaborate appendixes incorporating two introductory courses on the S-PLUS command language and the S-PLUS graphics user interface. This report is thus intended to promote the standard use of S-PLUS for good-quality, reproducible statistical analyses and optimal communication between researchers...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the 1990 s the capital investment, the standards of technology involved, the complexity of co-ordination, the quality requirements and the speed of construction projects in the world, have been substantially increased in {{both public and private}} sectors. These changes have forced contractors to increase their efficiency of management, not only to satisfy their business and commercial requirements but also for their survival in the industry due to the highly competitive environment. The continuing development of information technology has a great impact on all disciplines including construction management, and good information is increasingly important to construction managers. The research described in the thesis is based on the construction industry of Hong Kong, which is a magnet for all the best construction contractors and professionals in the world, due to the sale of the projects involved and the commercial systems provided. However, the principles generated by this research are of more general application in the management of construction projects. The main outcomes of the research are as follows: a) The existing practices and the impacts of the new developments in the construction projects of Hong Kong have been examined. b) A model of construction management practice in Hong Kong has been developed by taking into consideration previous researches, published literatures, current practices and new impacts. c) A comprehensive computer system using a <b>fourth-generation</b> <b>language</b> has been developed. The system involves two levels of operation including the management practices of head office and construction sites. The functions provided by the system include estimation and quality assurance at head office level. The site level systems provide the functions of information control, cost control, materials control and progress control. The integration of information flow among these functions is the main consideration {{in the development of the}} system. The system has been put into field tested using the construction projects of Hong Kong as described in the thesis, and has been found to be effective...|$|E

40|$|Piccola is a {{language}} for composing applications from software components. It {{has a small}} syntax and a minimal set of features needed for specifying different styles of software composition. The core features of Piccola are communicating agents, which perform computations, and forms, which are the communicated values. Forms are a special notion of extensible, immutable records. Forms and agents allow us to unify components, static and dynamic contexts and arguments for invoking services. Through a series of examples, we present a tour of Piccola, illustrating how forms and agents suffice to express a variety of compositional abstractions and styles. 1. Introduction Piccola {{is intended to be}} a general-purpose language for software composition.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical study analysing {{the relationship between}} a set of metrics for <b>Fourth–Generation</b> <b>Languages</b> (4 GL) programs and their maintainability. An analysis has been made using historical data of several industrial projects and three different approaches: the first one relates metrics and maintainability based on techniques of descriptive statistics, and the other two are based on Data Mining techniques. A discussion on the results obtained with the three techniques is also presented, as well as a set of equations and rules for predicting the maintenance effort in this kind of programs. Finally, we have done experiments about the prediction accuracy of these methods by using new unseen data, which were not used to build the knowledge model.
