Photomultipliers offer the best possible opportunity to exceed the Johnson noise for many configurations. The aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that, while small, nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons.|$|E

25|$|The Audion is an <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{device and}} was the forerunner of the triode, in which the current from the {{filament}} to the plate was controlled by a third element, the grid. A small amount of power applied to the grid could control a larger current from the filament to the plate, allowing the Audion both to detect radio signals and to provide amplification. The Audion tube was invented by Lee De Forest in 1906.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} received {{relatively little}} scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established {{the beginning of}} a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifier</b> during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of glass, with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb, creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb. The <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifier</b> detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|E

50|$|The gain {{available}} {{from a single}} stage is limited and low compared to <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Frequency response of a high-gain amplifier is limited to about one-tenth the excitation frequency, although this is often mitigated by exciting magnetic amplifiers with currents at higher than utility frequency. Solid-state <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> can be more compact and efficient than magnetic amplifiers. The bias and feedback windings are not unilateral and may couple energy back from the controlled circuit into the control circuit. This complicates the design of multistage amplifiers when compared with electronic devices.|$|R
2500|$|A negative-feedback {{amplifier}} (or feedback amplifier) is an <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifier</b> that subtracts {{a fraction of}} its output from its input, so that negative feedback opposes the original signal. [...] The applied negative feedback improves performance (gain stability, linearity, frequency response, step response) and reduces sensitivity to parameter variations due to manufacturing or environment. Because of these advantages, many amplifiers and control systems use negative feedback.|$|E
2500|$|An amplifier, <b>{{electronic}}</b> <b>amplifier</b> or (informally) amp is {{an electronic}} device that {{can increase the}} power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). An amplifier uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal. [...] The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain: the ratio of output to input. [...] An amplifier is a circuit that can give a power gain greater than one.|$|E
2500|$|However actual {{amplification}} by {{a vacuum}} tube only became practical with Lee De Forest's 1907 {{invention of the}} three-terminal [...] "audion" [...] tube, a crude form {{of what was to}} become the triode. Being essentially the first <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> such tubes were instrumental in long-distance telephony (such as the first coast-to-coast telephone line in the US) and public address systems, and introduced a far superior and versatile technology for use in radio transmitters and receivers. The electronics revolution of the 20th century arguably began with the invention of the triode vacuum tube.|$|E

2500|$|The {{negative}} {{electrostatic field}} {{created by the}} grid {{in the vicinity of}} the cathode would inhibit passage of emitted electrons and reduce the current to the plate. Thus, a few volt difference at the grid would make a large change in the plate current and could lead to a much larger voltage change at the plate; the result was voltage and power amplification. In 1908, De Forest was granted a patent (...) for such a three-electrode version of his original Audion for use as an <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifier</b> in radio communications. This eventually became known as the triode.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, the Stromberg-Voisinet {{firm was}} the first company to sell an {{electric}} stringed instrument and amplifier package. However, musicians found that the amps had an [...] "unsatisfactory tone and volume, [...] dependability problems", so the product did not sell well. Even though the Stromberg-Voisinet amp did not sell well, it still launched a new idea: a portable electric instrument amp with a speaker, all in an easily transported wooden cabinet. In 1929, Vega electrics launched a portable banjo amplifier. In 1932, Electro String Instruments and amplifier (this {{is not the same}} company as Stromberg Electro Instruments) introduced a guitar amp with [...] "high output" [...] and a [...] "string driven magnetic pickup". Electro set out the standard template for combo amps: a wooden cabinet with the <b>electronic</b> <b>amplifier</b> mounted inside, and a convenient carrying handle to facilitate transporting the cabinet. 1n 1933, Vivi-Tone amp set-ups were used for live performances and radio shows.
