40|$|A {{low voltage}} electroosmotic (eo) pump {{suitable}} for <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>integration</b> into microfabricated fluidic systems has been developed. The <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>integration</b> of the eo pump required a small footprint {{as well as}} a specific on-chip design to ventilate the electrolyzed gases emerging at the platinum (Pt) electrodes. For this purpose, a novel liquid–gas (lg) separator was invented. This lg-separator separated the gas bubbles from the liquid and guided them away from the eo pump. Its operational principle was solely based on the geometry of tapered sidewalls. An eo pump sandwiched by two lg separators (microchannels in the range of 10 lm, footprint of 100 lm 9 15 lm) was experimentally investigated. The lg-separator was able to reliably separate and ventilate an emerging gas flow of 2 pl s- 1. The eo pump achieved flow rates of 50 pl s- 1 at actuation voltages of 5 V.

40|$|Purpose – Ultra-thin chip {{packaging}} (UTCP) {{is one of}} the flexible assembly technologies, by which thinned dies are encapsulated inside spin-coated dielectric films. For sake of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> <b>integration</b> and bending stress suppression, two UTCPs can be stacked vertically.

Design/methodology/approach – In the new process, a central photosensitive polyimide film is introduced, in which a cavity is made for the embedded chip. The cavity is defined by lithography using the chip itself as a photo-mask. In this way, the cavity size and position is self-aligned to the chip. The chip thickness is compensated by the surrounding central layer, and a UTCP with flat topography (flat UTCP) is realized after top dielectric deposition.
