Just let us quote one passage: [...] "There is a suffering so painful that no hand is tender enough to touch it, and so deep that no heart is brave enough to fathom it. Dumbly we sink the head, as before something sacred. Never could he reproach her lying there before him, clad in the blue dress, of which every fold, so dear to him, cried 'forgive!'

I discuss causal links in both direc-tions between elements of social structure and phenomena in each of the nine other categories in my schema. This illustrates the validity of my schema, by showing that diverse causal links can be placed within it. I also illustrate the value of the schema as an organizing device for the study of social structure (or other phenomena). I draw several lessons for the future study of social structure. N <b>A</b> <b>RECENT</b> IIS PAPER (Szostak, 2000), I outlined a schema for unify-ing human science, consisting of a hierarchically organized list of the phe-nomena of interest to human scientists, and the causal links (influences) among these. I derived a list of hundreds of phenomena; discussed the five types of causation (influence); defined phenomena, influence, causal link, and hu-man science; related my efforts to previous attempts to unify human science whether schematically or theoretically; and provided philosophical justifica-tion. I argued that the schema could encourage a more balanced scholarly effort; protect against certain types of discovery since being forgotten; en-courage scholars and students to “see ” the big picture (instead of imagining that the links they study are the big picture); encourage more nuanced public policy advice; advise scholars from different disciplines when they are speak-ing of the same (or different) links; give students and scholars a map to guide them in integrating diverse materials; provide coherence to Liberal Arts cur-ricula; and help students cope with complexity, appreciate diverse viewpoints, and be skeptical of authority (see Szostak, 2002) ...|$|R
