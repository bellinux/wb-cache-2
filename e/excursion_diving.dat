40|$|To {{determine}} electroencephalographic {{changes during}} satura-tion <b>excursion</b> <b>diving</b> to a simulated water depth of 1000 feet. FINDINGS EEG records were obtained in two subjects during saturation excursion dives to 1000 ft depth. Subsequent computer analysis produced the following findings: During the compression to satura-tion depth of 800 feet {{at a rate}} of 3. 5 feet per minute, similar EEG changes were observed in both subjects, consisting of: (1) lowering of the mean frequency, (2) decreasing the percentage of fast waves (theta. activity), (3) increasing the percentage of 6 - 8 Hz waves (theta activity). During the subsequent saturation period at 800 ft, the EEG changes observed during the compression to 800 ft were reversed within 14 hours in subject CD., and 18 hours in subject D. F. It was concluded that the EEG changes found during the compressio...|$|E

40|$|It is {{desirable}} {{to know if}} astronauts produce venous gas emboli (VGE) {{as a result of}} their exposure to 4. 3 psia during space walks. The current prototype in-suit Doppler (ISD) ultrasound bubble detector provides an objective assessment of decompression stress by monitoring for VGE. The NOAA Aquarius habitat and NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) series of dives provided an opportunity to assess the ability of the prototype ISDs to record venous blood flow and possibly detect VGE in the pulmonary artery. From July 16 to 29, 2003, four aquanauts (two males and two females) donned the ISD for a 4 hr automated recording session, following <b>excursion</b> <b>dives</b> (up to 6 hrs and 29 MSW below storage depth) from air saturation at 17 MSW. Doppler recordings for 32 <b>excursion</b> <b>dives</b> were collected. The recordings consisted of approximately 150 digital wave files. Each wave file contained 24 sec of recording for each min. A 1 - 4 Doppler Quality Score (DQS) was assigned to each wave file in 17 of the 32 records evaluated to date. A DQS of 1 indicates a poor flow signal and a score of 4 indicates an optimum signal. Only 23 % of all wave files had DQSs considered adequate to detect low grade VGE (Spencer I-II). The distribution of DQS in 2, 356 wave files is as follows: DQS 1 - 56 %, DQS 2 - 21 %, DQS 3 - 18 % and DQS 4 - 5 %. Six of the 17 records had false positive VGE (Spencer I-IV) detected in one or more wave files per dive record. The false positive VGE recordings are attributable to air entrainment associated with drinking (verified by control tests), and this observation is important as astronauts drink water during space walks. The current ISD design provides quality recordings only over a narrow range of chest anatomy...|$|R

40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{anatomy of}} {{the eye of the}} Weddell seal was studied with various light and electronmicroscopic methods with aview to correlating morphological findings with the biology of this seal whichis adapted to the extremes of the Antarctic environment and to extreme <b>diving</b> <b>excursions</b> into the lightlessdepth of the sea. In the retina and area centralis was found but no fovea centralis. Thedensily packed photoreceptors consist exclusively of highly differenciated rods, which inprimates detect light at low intensity but have rather poor image discrimination. The ganglion cells are relatively scarce, suggesting a high degree of convergence of thelight-sensitive cells on the ganglion cells. The pigment epithelium is almost devoid ofpigment granules. The extensive tapetum lucidum is about 400 - 500 micrometer thickand is composed of about 30 layers of specialized cells. the cornea is 650 (center) to 800 - 900 (periphery) micrometer thick. Its structure and glucosaminoglycan histochemistrycorrespond to that of other mammals. The iridocorneal angle is unusually deep andpervaded by an elaborate trabecular meshwork, which together with a complex canalof Schlemm can be correlated with the ability to absorb large amounts of fluid. Theciliary muscle and its antagonist, the membrane of Bruch, are poorly developed., suggestingrelatively poor abilities of accomodation. The combination of a well-developed tapetumlucidum, and unpigmented pigment epithelium, well-developed rods, and a high number of rodconverging on only few ganglion cells is obviously an adaptation to an extreme lightsensitivity, enabling the animal {{to make use of the}} little light available in the deep sea...|$|R

These bubbles remain small due to the relatively small pressure ratio between storage and excursion pressure, and are generally resolved by the time the diver is back on shift, and residual bubbles do not accumulate over sequential shifts. However, any residual bubbles pose a risk of growth if decompression is started before they are fully eliminated. Ascent rate during excursions is limited, to minimize the risk and amount of bubble formation.|$|R
