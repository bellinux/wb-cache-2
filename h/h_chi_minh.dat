Đường Hồ <b>Chí</b> <b>Minh</b> Đông is a well-traveled road with many trucks, towns and restaurants along it. There are few steep hills on the Đường Hồ <b>Chí</b> <b>Minh</b> Đông, {{with the exception of}} the portion of the highway in Quảng Nam just before it merges with Đường Hồ <b>Chí</b> <b>Minh</b> Tây.

Many farmers allow their goats, buffalo and cows to graze along the roadside, and they frequently wander onto the road, so drivers must be careful on this stretch of the road.|$|R
