5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs.

Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
