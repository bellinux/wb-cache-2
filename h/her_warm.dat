500|$|As part of Charles' Grammy Award for Album of the Year-winning Genius Loves Company, {{the song}} {{proved to be}} the most popular and {{critically}} acclaimed on the album. Although the song had its early detractors, it received mostly favorable reviews. Several reviewers noted the complementarity of Jones and Charles. The Daily Vault Jason Warburg described the song as a [...] "jazzy, slinky pas de deux" [...] in which Charles matches Jones note for note." [...] JazzTimes Christopher Loudon said Charles [...] "blends seamlessly with Jones on a velvet-and-buckram" [...] performance. The song was described by the Orlando Sentinel Jim Abbott as a recreation of one of the gems from Charles' country music phase of the 1960s that produced the perfect [...] "combination of voices and instruments" [...] with Preston's accompanying role on Hammond B3. As opposed to other tracks on the album, when Charles' voice was understated, this song was said to represent his [...] "indomitable spirit", while Jones performed as [...] "an empathetic foil, [...] <b>her</b> <b>warm,</b> lazy vocals meshing convivially with his over a spare but funky arrangement". Author Mike Evans wrote that [...] "there's a mutual warmth of purpose in every breath [...] take" [...] on the song. Music Week staff noted the timeliness of the release with the biographical film Ray in theaters and described the song as soulful, that finely combines Charles' [...] "deep, honeyed growl with Jones's lighter timber", while noting Preston for his [...] "sweeping" [...] organ work.|$|E

Jon Pareles for The New York Times simply highlighted {{a line from the}} song, [...] "I never play the victim". Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] {{was one of the few}} songs on the album to retain the [...] "vaguest leftover hints of <b>her</b> <b>warm</b> Caribbean vocal flavouring". Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times was critical of Slash's inclusion on the song, and she described it as an [...] "afterthought". Powers wrote [...] "she can definitely get by without that ultimate rock phallic symbol", a reference to Slash. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombell felt that [...] "Rockstar 101, alike [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "The Last Song", were [...] "instantly-dated missteps from a bygone era when a Slash feature was cool". He further wrote that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] and [...] "G4L" [...] were [...] "harder to justify considering their mindless boasts and torpid production". The song was met with a negative review from The Guardians Alex Petridis, who wrote [...] "At one extreme, the resemblance of 'Umbrella's chorus to that of a stadium rock ballad seems to have encouraged Rihanna to cut out the middle-man and just start making stadium rock: cue the awful widdly-woo guitars of 'Rockstar 101' and 'Fire Bomb.|$|E

500|$|Laying {{starts at}} the end of April into early May. The eggs are whitish with very indistinct buff, grey or brown {{markings}} at the broad end. The eggs are [...] and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The clutch size in Europe is typically 9–11 eggs, but ranges from 6–13. The eggs are piled up in the nest and the female keeps the eggs warm with her brood patch and also by putting <b>her</b> <b>warm</b> legs {{into the middle of the}} pile between the eggs. Within a clutch the size of eggs increases gradually and the last laid egg may be 20% larger than the first egg. Second clutches, which are common, are laid usually while the first nest still has young. The male builds the second nest, then feeds the young in the first nest while the female is incubating in the second; when the first brood has fledged, he joins the female in feeding the second brood. The female goldcrest is not normally fed by her mate while incubating. She is a tight sitter, reluctant to leave the nest when disturbed, and has been recorded as continuing to attend the nest when it has been moved, or even when it is being held. The eggs are maintained at , the female regulating the temperature of the eggs by varying the time spent sitting. She leaves the nest more with increasing air temperature, and incubates more tightly when the light intensity is lower early and late in the day. The female incubates the eggs for 16 to 19 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which fledge in a further 17 to 22 days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young, and in very hot weather, the female has been noted as taking drops of water to her chicks in her bill. This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has an annual adult mortality of over 80 percent giving a life expectancy of around eight months, which is the shortest for any bird apart from a few Coturnix species. There are nonetheless records of an individual surviving to 4years 10months, and even a report of a bird ringed in Winchester in 1989 and found dead in Morocco 7 years 7 months later.|$|E

Silas decides to teach heavily pregnant Mercedes a lesson after she confesses to an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Silas's plan is to keep Mercedes alive until she has given birth and then murder her. Metcalfe called the plot [...] "brilliant" [...] and said it was [...] "quite flattering" [...] to be trusted with it. The actress explained that Mercedes thinks that she is going to die whilst being help captive. Mercedes also fears that her baby is going to die. Metcalfe said that it does not take long for Mercedes to realise that Silas is responsible for the recent murders. Silas wants to keep the baby alive, but not Mercedes. Therefore, Silas does the [...] "bare minimum" [...] for Mercedes, giving her water, a small amount of food and keeping <b>her</b> <b>warm.</b> Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opined that storyline sounds [...] "really dark" [...] and asked Metcalfe whether Hollyoaks are pushing the boundaries with it. Metcalfe revealed that [...] "they are a little bit", saying [...] "It's all shot in a very clever way, so it was fine when it came to compliance.
