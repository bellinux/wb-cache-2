40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} methodology is proposed for estimating <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> from bulk solids managing (storage, handling, and transport) {{activities in the}} ceramic industry. The methodology is based on analytical methods drawn from the AP- 42, US Environmental Protection Agency reports and the Emission Estimation Technique (EET) Manual for Mining from Environment Australia. The analytical methods were evaluated by means of experimental campaigns in open and closed bulk solids storage and managing facilities in ceramic plants. Dust concentrations and meteorological variables were recorded in experimental field studies in order to implement the experimental models: a method based on Reverse Dispersion Modelling (RDM) was applied in open facilities, and the Roof Monitor Method (RMM) was used to estimate <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> in closed facilities. The proposed methodology was applied to 13 ceramic plants with different technological scenarios. The methodology enabled the diffuse PM 10  emission factors associated with different dust abatement technologies to be determined. This methodology thus allows the Best Available Techniques (BATs) to be selected for reducing these emissions in ceramic and similar facilities.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce dust {{emissions}} during start-up (heat-up) of the Roasters, and during operation of the calcine preparation and transport equipment, a suction ventilation system was installed using a TWO stage filtration plant, consisting of a dedustable bag filter system followed by a nondedustable high efficiency sub-micron particulate airfilter. The adherence to a clean gas dust content of 1 mg/m 3 can be monitored by a continuous measurement Sigrist-Photometer, the data stored on computer and the plant condition evaluated. The chutes of the waste heat boilers, in the dust removel area, are lined with refractory bricks and also partly insulated in {{order to reduce}} thermal air currents. Through removal of hot areas and also the complete enclosure of the roasters, the <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> could be greatly reduced.

The MIR luminosities of star-forming galaxies are well correlated with their Hα, TIR and FUV luminosities, and we re-scaled the MIR-derived SFR formulae {{according to the above}} correlations with differences less than 15 %. We confirm the recent result by Calzetti et al.

Among all the L(MIR) -L(FIR) correlations for star-forming galaxies, the L(24 µm) vs. L(70 µm) and L(8 µm[dust]) vs. L(160 µm) are the tightest and also nearly linear.

The inner disk has a radius of ∼ 39 AU, a position angle consistent with north-up, an inclination of i ∼ 56 ^o, and has a center offset from the star.

In particular, the best-fit density power law for the dust suggests that the inner disk dust and gas (as probed by CO) are radially segregated, a feature consistent with the dust trapping mechanism inferred from observations of "canonical" transitional disks.

A chemical evolution code – including infall of primeval gas, thermal and gravitational energy balance, and a galactic wind- follows the SF rate, the gas fraction and the metallicity, basic ingredients for the stellar population synthesis. The latter is performed with a grid of integrated spectra for single stellar populations (SSP) of different ages and metallicities, in which the effects of dusty envelopes around AGB stellar are included. The residual fraction of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star forming molecular clouds and the diffuse medium. The relative amount is a model parameter. The molecular gas is sub-divided into clouds of given mass and radius: it is supposed that any SSP is borne within the cloud and progressively escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star forming molecular clouds is computed with a radiative transfer code.

We extract separate <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> components for the HII regions (plus their associated PDRs on pc scales) and for the <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> (on kpc scales). We analyse the full UV to FIR/submm SED of the galaxy using a radiation transfer model which self-consistently treats the <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from <b>diffuse</b> and SF complexes components, considering the illumination of <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> both by the distributed stellar populations, and by escaping light from the HII regions. While maintaining consistency with the framework of this model we additionally use a model that provides {{a detailed description of the}} <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from the HII regions and their surrounding PDRs on pc scales. Due to the large amount of available data and previous studies for NGC 4214 very few free parameters remained in the model fitting process. We achieve a satisfactory fit for the emission from HII+PDR regions on pc scales, with the exception of the emission at 8, which is underpredicted by the model. For the diffuse emission we achieve a good fit if we assume that about 30 - 70...|$|R
40|$|We make {{predictions}} for the diffuse far-infrared (FIR) <b>emission</b> from <b>dust</b> in the intracluster medium (ICM) of the Virgo cluster. The dust injection rate from known {{sources in the}} cluster is unlikely to {{give rise to a}} detectable diffuse FIR IC emission. However, the outer regions of dynamically young clusters have a further potential source of IC grains since they are still accreting freshly infalling spiral galaxies which are presumably contained in an accreting intergalactic medium (IGM). We show that cosmics ray driven winds from the infalling spirals can inject grains into a subvirial IGM that is external to the observed X-ray-emitting ICM. Predictions for the Virgo cluster are generalised to other clusters, and the possibility of detection of dynamically young clusters at cosmological distances is discussed. Although dominated by discrete source emission from galactic disks, it is possible that <b>diffuse</b> sub-mm <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from the ICM could be detected in experiments similar to those designed to map the sub-mm excess due to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in distant clusters. We further discuss the implications of our proposed scenario for the optical extinction in clusters, {{as well as for the}} properties and dust content of the IGM. Further implications for environmental effects on the chemical evolution of spiral galaxies are also considered...|$|R
40|$|Context. High-resolution {{data from}} Spitzer, Herschel, and Planck {{allow us to}} probe the entire {{spectral}} energy distribution (SED) of morphologically separated components of the <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from nearby galaxies and allow a more detailed comparison between data and models. Aims. We wish to establish the physical origin of <b>dust</b> heating and <b>emission</b> based on radiation transfer models, that self-consistently connect the <b>emission</b> components from <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> and the dust in massive star forming regions. Methods. NGC 4214 is a nearby dwarf galaxy with a large set of ancillary data, ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to radio, including maps from Spitzer and Herschel and detections from Planck. We mapped this galaxy with MAMBO at 1. 2 ???mm at the IRAM 30 ???m telescope. We extracted separate <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> components for the HII regions (plus their associated PDRs on pc scales) and for the <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> (on kpc scales). We analysed the full UV to FIR/submm SED of the galaxy using a radiation transfer model that self-consistently treats the <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from <b>diffuse</b> and star forming (SF) complexes components, considering the illumination of <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> both by the distributed stellar populations and by escaping light from the HII regions. While maintaining consistency {{within the framework of}} this model, we additionally used a model that provides {{a detailed description of the}} <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from the HII regions and their surrounding PDRs on pc scales. Thanks to the large amount of available data and many previous studies for NGC 4214, very few free parameters remained in the model fitting process. Results. We achieve a satisfactory fit for the emission from HII + PDR regions on pc scales, with the exception of the emission at 8 ??m, which is underpredicted by the model. For the diffuse emission we achieve a good fit if we assume that about 40 ??? 65 % of the emission escaping the HII + PDR regions is able to leave the galaxy without passing through a diffuse ISM, which is not an unlikely scenario for a dwarf galaxy that has recently undergone a nuclear starburst. We determine a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 350 ??? 470, which is close to the expected value based on the metallicity...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: I {{present the}} Monte Carlo {{radiative}} transfer code TRADING (Transfer of RAdiation through Dust In Galaxies). The code computes self-consistently {{the extinction of}} radiation in a dusty medium (including absorption and scattering) and the <b>dust</b> <b>emission.</b> METHODS: A binary-tree adaptive grid {{is used for the}} description of the dust distribution. Dust radiation is computed at thermal equilibrium or under stochastic heating condition, for a distribution of grains of different radii and materials. The code is applied to the case of a clumpy galactic disk, including both <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> and a distribution of spherical clouds modelled on the GMCs of local galaxies. Diffuse and localised sources of starlight are used, with independent spectra. RESULTS: A model is provided for the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. The SED of the galaxy from the UV to the submm/mm range can be well reproduced by: a bulge/disk configuration of old stars together with an extended dust disk, as suggested by the analysis of optical/near-infrared images; a clumpy dust distribution of the same mass as the <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> disk, together with a UV emitting component, half of which {{in the form of a}} diffuse disk and half in sources embedded in clouds. In total, it is found that about 35 % of the bolometric radiation is absorbed (and emitted) by dust; and that absorption of starlight from the old population contributes to about 60 % of the <b>dust</b> <b>emission.</b> A significant component of the <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> from clouds is due to absorption of diffuse radiation. Radial profiles of <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> in a clumpy disk are almost independent of the wavelength, with the exception of the wavelength range on the Wien side of the thermal equilibrium peak.

40|$|Aims. Archeops is a balloon-borne {{experiment}} {{inspired by}} the Planck satellite and its high frequency instrument (HFI). It is designed to measure {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) temperature anisotropies at high angular resolution (similar to 12 arcmin) over a large fraction of the sky (around 30 %) at 143, 217, 353, and 545 GHz. The Archeops 353 GHz channel consists of three pairs of polarized sensitive bolometers designed to detect the polarized <b>diffuse</b> <b>emission</b> of Galactic <b>dust.</b> Methods. In this paper we present an update of the instrumental setup, as well as the flight performance for the last Archeops flight campaign (February 2002 from Kiruna, Sweden). We also describe the processing and analysis of the Archeops time-ordered data for that campaign, which led to measurement of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum in the multipole range l = 10 - 700 and to the first measurements of both the polarized <b>emission</b> of <b>dust</b> at large angular scales and its power spectra in the multipole range l = 3 - 70 Results. We present maps covering approximately 30 % of the sky. These maps contain Galactic emission, including the Galactic plane, in the four Archeops channels at 143, 217, 353, and 545 GHz and CMB anisotropies at 143 and 217 GHz. These are one of the first sub-degree-resolution maps in the millimeter and submillimeter ranges of the large angular-scale <b>diffuse</b> Galactic <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and CMB temperature anisotropies, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the far-infrared {{emission}} from the nearby radio galaxy M 87 remains a matter of debate. Some studies find evidence of a far-infrared excess due to thermal <b>dust</b> <b>emission,</b> whereas others propose that the far-infrared emission {{can be explained by}} synchrotron emission without the need for an additional <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> component. We observed M 87 with PACS and SPIRE as part of the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS). We compare the new Herschel data with a synchrotron model based on infrared, submm and radio data to investigate the {{origin of the}} far-infrared emission. We find that both the integrated SED and the Herschel surface brightness maps are adequately explained by synchrotron emission. At odds with previous claims, we find no evidence of a <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> component in M 87. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, proceedings IAU Symposium 275 (Jets at all scales...|$|R
40|$|We are {{performing}} a uniform and unbiased imaging {{survey of the}} Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; ~ 7 ° × 7 °) using the IRAC (3. 6, 4. 5, 5. 8, and 8 μm) and MIPS (24, 70, and 160 μm) instruments on board the Spitzer Space Telescope in the Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) survey, these agents being the interstellar medium (ISM) and stars in the LMC. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the SAGE Legacy project, including observing strategy, data processing, and initial results. Three key science goals determined the coverage and depth of the survey. The detection of diffuse ISM with column densities > 1. 2 × 10 ^(21) H cm^(- 2) permits detailed studies of dust processes in the ISM. SAGE's point-source sensitivity enables a complete census of newly formed stars with masses > 3 M_☉ that will determine the current star formation rate in the LMC. SAGE's detection of evolved stars with mass-loss rates > 1 × 10 ^(- 8) M_☉ yr^(- 1) will quantify the rate at which evolved stars inject mass into the ISM of the LMC. The observing strategy includes two epochs in 2005, separated by 3 months, that both mitigate instrumental artifacts and constrain source variability. The SAGE data are nonproprietary. The data processing includes IRAC and MIPS pipelines and a database for mining the point-source catalogs, which will be released to the community in support of Spitzer proposal cycles 4 and 5. We present initial results on the epoch 1 data for a region near N 79 and N 83. The MIPS 70 and 160 μm images of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> of the N 79 /N 83 region reveal a similar distribution to the gas emissions, especially the H I 21 cm emission. The measured point-source sensitivity for the epoch 1 data is consistent with expectations for the survey. The point-source counts are highest for the IRAC 3. 6 μm band and decrease dramatically toward longer wavelengths, consistent with the fact that stars dominate the point-source catalogs and the dusty objects detected at the longer wavelengths are rare in comparison. The SAGE epoch 1 point-source catalog has ~ 4 × 10 ^ 6 sources, and more are anticipated when the epoch 1 and 2 data are combined. Using Milky Way (MW) templates as a guide, we adopt a simplified point-source classification to identify three candidate groups—stars without dust, dusty evolved stars, and young stellar objects—that offer a starting point for this work. We outline a strategy for identifying foreground MW stars, which may comprise as much as 18 % of the source list, and background galaxies, which may comprise ~ 12 % of the source list...|$|R
40|$|Aims. Identify {{the young}} protostellar {{counterparts}} associated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through new IR observations (H 2 narrow-band at 2. 12 µm and N broad band at 10. 4 µm) {{along with an}} investigation performed on the existing IR catalogues. Methods. The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues (IRAS, MSX, 2 MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral energy distributions. Results. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26 unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H 2 jets pointing back to embedded objects not (yet) detected or near-IR objects showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0 sources. Objects with far-IR colours {{similar to those of}} T-Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars seem to be very few. An additional population of young objects exists associated not with the mm-cores, but with both the <b>diffuse</b> warm <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> and the gas filaments. We remark the high detection rate (30 %) of H 2 jets driven by sources located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters, testifying the co-existence of both low- an...|$|R
40|$|The Planck {{satellite}} {{provides a}} set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from 30 [*]GHz to 857 [*]GHz. Planets, minor bodies, and <b>diffuse</b> interplanetary <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> (IPD) are all observed. The IPD can be separated from Galactic and other emissions because Planck views a given point on the celestial sphere multiple times, through different columns of IPD. We use the Planck data to investigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky at sub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. We fit the Planck data to find the emissivities of the various components of the COBE zodiacal model – a diffuse cloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an Earth-trailing feature. The emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasing wavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. The emissivities of the dust bands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that {{the properties of the}} grains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. We fit the small amount of Galactic emission seen through the telescope’s far sidelobes, and place limits on possible contamination of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) results from both zodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. When necessary, the results are used in the Planck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed. We show that the zodiacal correction to the CMB maps is small compared to the Planck CMB temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities for small solar system bodies.

40|$|We {{present a}} full-sky model of {{polarized}} Galactic microwave emission based on {{three years of}} observations by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) at frequencies from 23 to 94 GHz. The model compares maps of the Stokes Q and U components {{from each of the}} 5 WMAP frequency bands in order to separate synchrotron from <b>dust</b> <b>emission,</b> taking into account the spatial and frequency dependence of the synchrotron and dust components. This simple two-component model of the interstellar medium accounts for at least 97 % of the polarized emission in the WMAP maps of the microwave sky. Synchrotron emission dominates the polarized foregrounds at frequencies below 50 GHz, and is comparable to the dust contribution at 65 GHz. The spectral index of the synchrotron component, derived solely from polarization data, is - 3. 2 averaged over the full sky, with a modestly flatter index on the Galactic plane. The synchrotron emission has mean polarization fraction 2 [...] 4 % in the Galactic plane and rising to over 20 % at high latitude, with prominent features such as the North Galactic Spur more polarized than the <b>diffuse</b> component. Thermal <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> has polarization fraction 1 % near the Galactic center, rising to 6 % at the anti-center. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>emission</b> from high-latitude <b>dust</b> is also polarized with mean fractional polarization 0. 036 +/- 0. 011.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{alternative}} analysis of CMB time ordered data (TOD) using a wavelet-based {{representation of the}} data time-frequency plane. We demonstrate that the wavelet transform decorrelates $ 1 /f$-type Gaussian stationary noise and permits a simple and functional description of locally stationary processes. In particular, this makes possible the generalization of the classical algorithms of map making and CMB power spectrum estimation {{to the case of}} locally stationary 1 /f type noise. As an example, we present a wavelet based algorithm for the destriping of CMB-like maps. In addition, we describe a wavelet-based analysis of the Archeops data including time-frequency visualization, wavelet destriping and filtering of the TOD. These filtered data was used to produce polarized maps of Galactic <b>dust</b> <b>diffuse</b> <b>emission.</b> Finally, we describe the modeling of the non-stationarity on the Archeops noise for the estimation of the CMB power spectrum.
