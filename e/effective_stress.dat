25|$|This article {{describes}} the genesis and composition of soil, the distinction between pore water pressure and inter-granular <b>effective</b> <b>stress,</b> capillary action of fluids in the soil pore spaces, soil classification, seepage and permeability, time dependent change of volume due to squeezing water out of tiny pore spaces, also known as consolidation, shear strength and stiffness of soils. The shear strength of soils is primarily derived from friction between the particles and interlocking, which {{are very sensitive to}} the <b>effective</b> <b>stress.</b> The article concludes with some examples of applications of the principles of soil mechanics such as slope stability, lateral earth pressure on retaining walls, and bearing capacity of foundations.|$|E
25|$|The volume change {{behavior}} and interparticle friction {{depend on the}} density of the particles, the intergranular contact forces, and to a somewhat lesser extent, other factors such as the rate of shearing and the direction of the shear stress. The average normal intergranular contact force per unit area is called the <b>effective</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> of soil is reduced to {{essentially}} zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> is reduced.|$|E

25|$|Liquefaction is {{more likely}} to occur in loose to {{moderately}} saturated granular soils with poor drainage, such as silty sands or sands and gravels capped or containing seams of impermeable sediments. During wave loading, usually cyclic undrained loading, e.g. seismic loading, loose sands tend to decrease in volume, which produces an increase in their pore water pressures and consequently a decrease in shear strength, i.e. reduction in <b>effective</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 'flow failure' may {{initiate}} if {{the strength}} of the soil is reduced below the stresses required to maintain equilibrium of a slope or footing of a building for instance. This can occur due to monotonic loading or cyclic loading, and can be sudden and catastrophic. A historical example is the Aberfan disaster. Casagrande referred to this type of phenomena as 'flow liquefaction' although a state of zero <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> is not required for this to occur.|$|E
25|$|If {{water is}} not allowed to flow in or out of the soil, the stress path is called an {{undrained}} stress path. During undrained shear, if the particles are surrounded by a nearly incompressible fluid such as water, then the density of the particles cannot change without drainage, but the water pressure and <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> will change. On the other hand, if the fluids are allowed to freely drain out of the pores, then the pore pressures will remain constant and the test path is called a drained stress path. The soil is free to dilate or contract during shear if the soil is drained. In reality, soil is partially drained, somewhere between the perfectly undrained and drained idealized conditions.|$|E

25|$|The Hellenic Trench of the Hellenic arc {{system is}} unusual because this {{convergent}} margin subducts evaporites. The {{slope of the}} surface of the southern flank of the Mediterranean Ridge (its accretionary prism) is low, about 1°, indicating very low shear stress on the decollement {{at the base of the}} wedge. Evaporites control the shallow taper of the accretionary complex both because their mechanical properties differ from those of siliciclastic sediments, and because of their effect on fluid flow and fluid pressure, which in turn control <b>effective</b> <b>stress.</b> In the 1970s, the linear deeps of the Hellenic trench south of Crete were thought to be similar to trenches at other subduction zones. However, with the realization that the Mediterranean Ridge is an accretionary complex, it became apparent that the Hellenic trench is actually a starved forearc basin, and that the plate boundary lies south of the Mediterranean Ridge.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E

Although Toyoura sand and silica sand No. 7 mainly comprise quartz, silica sand No. 7 contains small amounts of feldspar.

2500|$|Seepage in {{an upward}} {{direction}} reduces the <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> within the soil. When the water pressure {{at a point}} in the soil is equal to the total vertical stress at that point, the <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> is zero and the soil has no frictional resistance to deformation. For a surface layer, the vertical <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> becomes zero within the layer when the upward hydraulic gradient is equal to the critical gradient. At zero <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> soil has very little strength and layers of relatively impermeable soil may heave up due to the underlying water pressures. [...] The loss in strength due to upward seepage is a common contributor to levee failures. The condition of zero <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> associated with upward seepage is also called liquefaction, quicksand, or a boiling condition. Quicksand was so named because the soil particles move around and appear to be 'alive' (the biblical meaning of 'quick' – as opposed to 'dead').

2500|$|When {{stress is}} removed from a {{consolidated}} soil, the soil will rebound, drawing water back into the pores and regaining some of the volume it had lost in the consolidation process. If the stress is reapplied, the soil will re-consolidate again along a recompression curve, defined by the recompression index. Soil that has been consolidated to a large pressure and has been subsequently unloaded {{is considered to be}} overconsolidated. The maximum past vertical <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> is termed the preconsolidation stress. A soil which is currently experiencing the maximum past vertical <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> is said to be normally consolidated. [...] The overconsolidation ratio, (OCR) is the ratio of the maximum past vertical <b>effective</b> <b>stress</b> to the current vertical <b>effective</b> <b>stress.</b> The OCR is significant for two reasons: firstly, because the compressibility of normally consolidated soil is significantly larger than that for overconsolidated soil, and secondly, the shear behavior and dilatancy of clayey soil are related to the OCR through critical state soil mechanics; highly overconsolidated clayey soils are dilatant, while normally consolidated soils tend to be contractive.|$|E
