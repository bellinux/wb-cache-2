5|$|Other yearly festivals are Paris-Plages, {{a festive}} event that lasts from mid-July to mid-August when the Right Bank of the Seine is {{converted}} into a temporary beach with sand, <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> and palm trees; Journées du Patrimoine, Fête de la Musique, Techno Parade, Nuit Blanche, Cinéma au clair de lune, Printemps des rues, Festival d'automne, and Fête des jardins. Carnaval de Paris, {{one of the oldest}} festivals in Paris, dates back to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} sandy beaches at both St Mildred's Bay and West Bay. The larger of the beaches is at St Mildred's Bay, {{where it is}} {{possible}} to hire beach huts, <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> and jet-skis. The beach is a short distance from tennis courts and a golf putting course. At West Bay, there are many small rock pools, which are popular with children. Each beach has nearby cafés, restaurants and public houses, and a European Blue Flag Award is shared between them due to their cleanliness and safety.|$|E

25|$|Marsh {{was also}} {{drawn to the}} ports of New York. In the 1930s the harbors were {{extremely}} busy with people and commerce due to the country's necessity for economic recovery. The Great Depression brought about a decline in raw materials and therefore the demand for those materials grew dramatically, resulting in bustling harbors in big cities such as New York. Marsh would sketch the seaports, focusing on the tugboats {{coming in and out}} of the harbor, and capturing the details of the boats such as the masts, the bells, the sirens, and the <b>deck</b> <b>chairs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leisure {{facilities}} were provided {{for all three}} classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing {{to inform the public}} which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} then dry-docked for her fitting out (at {{the moment of}} the launching, the ship was merely an empty shell, without machines, installations, or funnels). At first, only three funnels were planned to be installed. However, in order for her not to appear weaker than the Cunard's four-funnels duo, a fourth funnel was added. Its {{function}} was the ventilation of the kitchen and the storage of <b>deck</b> <b>chairs.</b> For her propulsion, Olympic was driven by three propellers. The two three-bladed side propellers were driven by two triple-expansion engines, while the four-bladed central propeller was driven by a turbine that utilised recovered steam escaping from the triple expansion engines. The utilisation of escaped steam was tested on the SS Laurentic two years before.|$|E

25|$|There were testimonies of {{sightings}} of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews {{stayed in the}} smoking room for some time, then continued assisting with the evacuation. At around 2:00a.m., he was seen back on the boat deck. The crowd had begun to stir, but there were still women reluctant to leave the ship. To be heard and {{to draw attention to}} himself, Andrews waved his arms and announced to them in a loud voice. Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> into the ocean for passengers to cling to in the water, though he may have been mistaken for chief baker Charles Joughin, who survived the sinking and reported doing the same thing. He then headed towards the bridge, perhaps in search of Captain Smith. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship in its final moments. His body was never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Launched {{concurrently}} with Boat 10, with 42 people aboard, {{the last}} of the wooden lifeboats was launched under the supervision of Lightoller at 1:50a.m. with Quartermaster Walter Perkis put in charge. It was actually one of the first lifeboats to be lowered on Captain Smith's suggestion that passengers should be loaded from the Promenade Deck rather than the Boat Deck. However, the captain had forgotten that– unlike on his previous command, Titanics sister ship Olympic– the forward half of the Promenade Deck was enclosed. Lightoller ordered that the windows on the Promenade Deck's enclosure were to be opened, and moved on to deal with the other lifeboats. The windows proved unexpectedly difficult to open and to add to the problems, the lifeboat got caught up on Titanics sounding spar, which projected from the hull immediately below the boat. The spar had to be chopped off to allow the lifeboat to progress. A stack of <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> was used as a makeshift staircase to allow passengers to climb up and through the windows and into the boat.|$|E
25|$|After medical {{treatment}} in Chichester and recuperation Carey was posted back to 43 Squadron {{but did not}} fly again for a month. The Squadron suffered increasing casualties as the battle wore on. Squadron Leader Badger baled out on 30 August wounded and later died on 30 June 1941. On 7 September 1940 Frank was lunching with other pilots at Tangmere's mess that afternoon while the Adjutant took pictures of the semi-formal gathering sitting in <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> and drinking from tankards. That same after noon, Caesar Hull and two other pilots were killed when the Luftwaffe began its first deliberate attack on London, initiating The Blitz. Morale sank and the squadron was sent north to Newcastle to rest on 8 September. Thomas Dalton-Morgan took command of 43 Squadron at Newcastle and Carey flew again {{for the first time}} on 23 September 1940 and was promoted to Flight commander, but the squadron remained in the north until the end of the Battle of Britain in October 1940. On 20 January 1941 Carey and another pilot (Pilot Officer Tufnell) chased a Ju 88 out over the North Sea and claimed it damaged before it escaped into cloud.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} {{section was}} opened in April 1924 by Lord Morris (1859–1935), {{member of the}} House of Lords and previous premier of Newfoundland. The southern frontage was opened on a Sunday shortly before Easter, 1932 by the High Sheriff of Kent Major Sir John Theodore Prestige. Callender's Cableworks Band (1898–1961) performed at the ceremony. Before the Bandstand was built, bands such as the 6th Dragoon Guards would give concerts around the flagstaff which is situated just {{to the west of}} the present bandstand. When first built, the Central Bandstand consisted only of what is now the north or seaward side, with stage, turreted side wings and an outdoor area to the north for the audience in deck chairs; the area was available for <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> until the 1970s. Visiting bands and school bands played there. For example, the Royal Warwickshire Band visited in 1925. In those days a red carpet would be laid for the conductor to walk across from the Connaught Hotel which was and is, as of 2013, directly opposite the Bandstand. The Reverend Daubeney at Herne used to arrange for his sermons to finish in time to allow the congregation to catch the bus to Herne Bay for the evening Bandstand concert. This venue was so popular in 1927 that queues could stretch as far as the Pier, and crowds were often turned away.|$|E
500|$|Other couples {{refused to}} be separated. Ida Straus, the wife of Macy's {{department}} store co-owner and {{former member of the}} United States House of Representatives Isidor Straus, told her husband: [...] "We have been living together for many years. Where you go, I go." [...] They sat down in a pair of <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> and waited for the end. The industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim changed out of his life vest and sweater into top hat and evening dress and declared his wish to go down with the ship like a gentleman.|$|E
500|$|Summit {{organizers}} {{established a}} media centre for international media personnel, journalists, and press {{reporters at the}} Direct Energy Centre at the Exhibition Place. [...] The Federal and Ontario governments constructed a [...] pavilion, called Experience Canada or Canadian Corridor in the media centre to promote Canadian tourism internationally. The pavilion included three life-sized government-funded displays: Cityscape, which showcased successful Canadian businesses and innovation; The Bridge, which included information kiosks for media personnel as well as large high-definition screens that televised the 2010 FIFA World Cup games; and Northern Ontario Oasis, an artificial lakefront based on Muskoka region's cottage country. The Northern Ontario Oasis included donated canoes, a shoreline with <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> for journalists to cool off, and a mobile phone recharging station. [...] The background was a large screen that portrayed various images of the Muskoka region. The cost of the international media centre, the Experience Canada pavilion, and artificial lake, which were , , and $57,000 respectively, {{was the target of}} controversies.|$|E
60|$|MacShaughnassy, on the contrary, was {{of opinion}} {{that we should}} work better on a houseboat. Speaking for himself, he said he never felt more like writing a really great work than when lying in a hammock among {{whispering}} leaves, with the deep blue sky above him, and a tumbler of iced claret cup within easy reach of his hand. Failing a hammock, he found a <b>deck</b> <b>chair</b> a great incentive to mental labour. In {{the interests of the}} novel, he strongly recommended me to take down with me at least one comfortable <b>deck</b> <b>chair,</b> and plenty of lemons.|$|R

500|$|Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews {{is portrayed}} as a very kind and {{pleasant}} man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, {{that it is a}} [...] "mathematical certainty" [...] that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this {{has become one of the}} most famous legends of the sinking of the Titanic, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat n. 15 at approximately 1:40a.m. There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation. Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> into the ocean for passengers to use as floating devices. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship at the last moment.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{response}} was positive. The Futon Critic, in a June 14, 2007 {{review of the}} pilot episode, declared [...] "it's actually far more ingrained into the Terminator mythology than you'd expect," [...] but stated [...] "this installment feels less like a 'pilot' and more like an excuse to rearrange the <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> on the 'Terminator' franchise to potentially have a TV show." [...] One negative report from La Lámina Corredora reported [...] "the pilot feels too much like a cheap remake of [...]" [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle derided the entire conceptualization and production of the series. Though limited to his viewing {{of the first two}} episodes, Goodman leveled criticism against Fox for having [...] "taken the wholly predictable course of putting a lot of money into explosions and regenerating cyborgs" [...] but not having [...] "paid much attention to plot, casting or writing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1974 Split Enz {{undertook}} {{a series of}} radio-sponsored [...] "Buck-A-Head" [...] ($1 per head entry) shows which played in theatres rather than in pubs or clubs. Taking advantage of this, Phil and Tim decided that, rather than slogging {{it out on the}} traditional pub circuit, they would now only perform in theatres and concert halls, which were better suited to the band's unique performance style and enabled them to stage a full theatrical presentation. Under Noel Crombie's guidance the band developed elaborate sets, costumes, hairstyles and makeup, [...] and performances were punctuated by odd happenings. At one concert, they brought Rayner's auntie on stage to perform an impromptu tap dance during one of the songs and this was a great success, but they realised that they couldn't really take her on tour with them, so it Crombie's spoon playing routine was substituted and soon became an essential part of each show. For an early NZ TV performance with a [...] "desert island" [...] theme they brought in a load of sand and created a miniature indoor beach, complete with palm trees and a wading pool, with band members dressed as hankie-hatted tourists, reclining on <b>deck</b> <b>chairs</b> and sipping drinks. For another now-legendary live performance of their live epic [...] "Stranger Than Fiction", a female friend was recruited to crawl across the stage during the song, under pulsing strobe lights, with a bloodied axe apparently embedded in her skull.|$|E
25|$|During {{the tour}} the giants were {{accompanied}} {{by a group of}} live musicians, and used a number of props, including the girl's boat, on which she sailed for part of her journey, her scooter, <b>deck</b> <b>chair,</b> bed, and radio.|$|R
