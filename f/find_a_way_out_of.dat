Mitchell said that during the phone conversation Hendrix agreed to join him around midnight at the Speakeasy Club for a previously arranged jam session, which included Sly Stone.|$|E

25|$|André Téchiné {{made his}} debut as {{director}} with: Paulina s'en va (Paulina is Leaving) (1969) {{in which the}} title character drifts aimlessly, struggling to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her disenchantment and find her calling in life. Initially conceived as a short, the film was shot in two periods, over one week in 1967 and two weeks in 1969. The film, shown at that year's Venice Film Festival, disconcerted audiences and was not actually released until 1975. In the meantime, Téchiné experimented with references to different genres and auteurs while providing screenplays for other directors, including Liliane de Kermadec's Aloïse.|$|E

25|$|In the mid 1520s, the Duke of Norfolk's niece, Anne Boleyn, {{had caught}} the eye of King Henry VIII, and Norfolk's {{political}} fortunes revived with his involvement in the King's attempt to have his marriage to Queen Catherine of Aragon annulled. By 1529, matters of state were being increasingly handled by Norfolk, the Duke of Suffolk, and the Boleyns, who pressed King Henry VIII to remove Cardinal Wolsey. In October, the King sent Norfolk and the Duke of Suffolk to obtain the great seal from the Cardinal. In November, Wolsey was arrested on a charge of treason, but died before trial. Norfolk benefited from Wolsey's fall, becoming the King's leading Councillor and applying himself energetically in the King's efforts to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his marriage to Queen Catherine. His loyalty and service to King Henry VIII brought him ample rewards. He received grants of monastic lands in Norfolk and Suffolk, was employed on diplomatic missions, and was created a knight of the French Order of St Michael in 1532 and Earl Marshal of England on 28 May 1533. In May 1536, when King Henry VIII arrested his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn, Norfolk presided at the trial of his niece as Lord High Steward.|$|E

500|$|When the Carter family {{begin to}} {{struggle}} financially, Babe decides to help by selling alcohol before the allocated hours, despite it breaching The Vic's licensing laws. Badland explained that Babe [...] "deals with {{things in the}} way that she knows how but it doesn't always work out the way that she wants it to". Badland described Babe's actions as [...] "instinctive", which makes her [...] "often [...] on impulse". She questioned whether Babe could be [...] "an optimist and doesn't fully consider the damage she can cause." [...] Kathy Beale (Taylforth) decides to tip the authorities and after a series of undercover investigations, the police arrest Babe, Mick and Shirley. In her interview, Babe blames Mick and tells the police she was [...] "only acting on instructions". Despite this, they all spend the night in police custody. Badland revealed that Babe [...] "was assuming she could <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it" [...] when blaming Mick because [...] "it's about staying alive in that moment." [...] She explained that Babe's actions stem from a fear of being arrested and said, [...] "For all she has ever been up to, she has never been in a prison cell so it was about her staying afloat in that precise moment." [...] Badland believed that Babe would be able to [...] "talk her way out of trouble with the Carters" [...] again and explained that [...] "the family have {{a lot to talk about}} – and a lot to find out about..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout filming Bogart {{was still}} torn between his new love and {{his sense of}} duty to his marriage. The mood on the set was tense, the actors both emotionally {{exhausted}} as Bogart tried to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his dilemma. The dialogue, especially in the newly shot scenes, was full of sexual innuendo supplied by Hawks, and Bogart proves convincing and enduring as private detective Philip Marlowe. In the end, the film was successful, though some critics found the plot confusing and overcomplicated. [...] Reportedly a bemused Chandler himself could not answer baffled screenwriters' question over who killed the limousine driver early in the story.|$|E

During the Novel sections, the player reads dialogue, occasionally inputting choices that change the course of the story. During the Escape sections, the player aims to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> rooms by exploring the room and solving puzzles. The player can move around during these sections, and can pick up and combine items in order to open locks or get access to new items. Each room also includes more complex puzzles, such as sliding puzzles and mini-games, which can not be solved without finding clues in the room.|$|E
2500|$|Schmeichel's {{decision}} to leave United after eight seasons prompted Ferguson to bring in replacements: Mark Bosnich from Aston Villa and Italian Massimo Taibi. The latter featured in four matches, the last of which a 5–0 defeat at Chelsea in October 1999; he was not selected again by Ferguson. United ended the 1999–2000 league season as champions, with just three defeats and a record points margin of 18. In December 1999, the club beat Palmeiras in Tokyo to win the Intercontinental Cup, but a month later exited at the group stage of the inaugural Club World Championship, although Ferguson insisted the tournament was [...] "fantastic". United failed to retain the Champions League, as they lost in the quarter-final stage to eventual winners Real Madrid. Ferguson sought to strengthen his squad and signed Fabien Barthez from Monaco for £7.8million. He also monitored the progress of Ruud van Nistelrooy, [...] "a striker of the highest calibre". He met the player and his agent in Manchester to discuss formalities and was informed of Van Nistelrooy's troubled right knee. Ferguson was not agitated by this; he recalled from experience a similar niggle that did not stop his playing career. Van Nistelrooy, however, failed his medical, but Ferguson reassured him that [...] "we might yet <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the nightmare". The deal was resurrected in April 2001 for a British record transfer fee of £19million.|$|E

2500|$|Both Citigroup and the Mets {{maintain}} that the naming rights deal is secure, despite Citigroup's economic troubles. This deal has been criticized {{in light of the}} late-2000s financial crisis and the $45 billion of taxpayer funds allocated to Citigroup by the U.S. federal government in two separate rescue packages, prompting New York City Council members Vincent Ignizio and James Oddo to suggest that the new ballpark be called [...] "Citi/Taxpayer Field." [...] Radio talk show host Brian Lehrer suggested the name [...] "Debits Field" [...] which combines baseball history with public outrage over the Citi bailout. [...] Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who serves on the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stated in regards to the Citi Field naming rights deal, [...] "This type of spending is indefensible and unacceptable to Citigroup's new partner and largest investor: the American taxpayer.... I strongly urge Citigroup to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this contract and instead spend that $400 million on retaining its employees and restoring confidence in its operations." [...] On January 29, 2009, congressmen Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Ted Poe of Texas sent a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner urging him to scrap Citigroup's $400 million naming rights deal. [...] "We request that you intervene and demand that Citigroup dissolve the agreement they have with the New York Mets," [...] reads the letter. [...] "Absent this outcome, we feel strongly that you should compel Citigroup to return immediately all federal monies received to date, as well as cancel all loan guarantees." [...] However, Geithner rejected congressional demands to cancel the naming rights deal.|$|E
