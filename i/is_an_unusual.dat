In 1991, farm workers {{in the state of}} Paraíba, Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa. A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated guava juice.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{half a mile}} to {{the north}} of the {{southbound}} services, the northbound services are set back from the motorway. The main building <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> design based on curves and circles. Unlike the southbound site, the cash machines are located outside and both the car and lorry parking is to the front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Shade of Pale' <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> pale-pink flowered form of T.speciosissima. It is less {{vigorous}} {{than the}} parent plant. It was initially promoted as 'Light Shade of Pale' but there {{can only be}} three words in a registered cultivar name.|$|E

5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> type {{of blood}} vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from}} the other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.|$|E
5|$|W. & L.E. Gurley Building: Fifth and Fulton streets. Built in {{just nine}} months after 1862 fire, this {{location}} has been home to Gurley Precision Instruments since 1845. The building, with Renaissance and classically inspired stylings, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> example of a commercial building extremely sympathetic to its neighboring residences.

5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, has serrated leaves and unusual red, pendent (hanging) inflorescences which are generally hidden in the foliage. First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> feature within the genus.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, {{it was named}} in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It {{is one of three}} or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{and is one of the}} easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Capella, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{multiple star}} system among the brightest {{stars in the}} night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E

5|$|Japan {{maintains}} one of {{the largest}} military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence force <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> military that has never fired shots outside Japan. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.|$|E
5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E
5|$|Storms began causing damage {{early in}} the morning on July 10, 1989. A tornado briefly touched down in Ogdensburg, New York at 5AM, {{injuring}} one person. Hail up to 1 in (25mm) wide, wind gusts over 50mph (60km/h), and many reports of wind damage were reported in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts before noon. Severe weather <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> occurrence in the morning, and the activity only increased in severity towards the middle of the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|The {{intersection}} of Route 14 with Via Princessa in Santa Clarita <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> design, with long flyover ramps for the connections. This {{is the result}} of a freeway revolt by the residents of Santa Clarita, that canceled plans for a freeway extension of Route 126. While the Via Princessa alignment of Route 126 was canceled, a different alignment is being constructed with proposed connections to Route 14.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{urbanisation}} of Gateshead {{around it}} has detracted from the panoramic views of western Gateshead {{that were once}} enjoyed by residents, at elevated positions views of Lobley Hill, Team Valley and Dunston Hill can be glimpsed. Although now a suburb of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the openness and greenspace prevalent in Low Fell means that the suburb continues to enjoy a rural feel, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> trait in the modern Gatshead conurbation.|$|E
5|$|With its rhythmic {{arrangement}} of large, traceried windows, pinnacles, battlements and buttresses, {{the exterior of}} Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> feature as England's cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity. Close examination reveals window tracery of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16thcentury. The richness of the 13th-century tracery is accentuated {{by the presence of}} ornate, crocketted drip-mouldings around the windows; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|On June 1, a {{tropical}} depression formed off western Cuba from an organized cloud system. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category1 hurricane, {{one of the}} earliest hurricanes of June, and the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto then quickly weakened into {{a tropical}} storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto {{is an example of a}} storm to enter the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating while never make landfall, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> event.|$|E
