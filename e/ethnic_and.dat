40|$|Ethnic {{broadcasting}} is {{a unique}} phenomenon of multiethnic countries that could reflect and influence a country's ethnic relations. This study examines the <b>ethnic</b> broadcasting policies <b>and</b> practices in Canada and China, to determine existing issues, and reflect on the countries' <b>ethnic</b> relations <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> policies. This thesis analyzes the ethnic broadcasting operations {{in the two countries}} comparatively through interpreting with critical lenses the data collected from government and university databases. This analysis is especially interested in the relationship between <b>ethnic</b> relations <b>and</b> the broadcasting media, between <b>ethnic</b> policies <b>and</b> broadcasting policies, <b>and</b> between <b>ethnic</b> politics <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> broadcasting content. Several issues in the two countries' <b>ethnic</b> policies <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> broadcasting operations are revealed through the comparative analysis, particularly the insufficiency of public broadcasting presence and governmental involvement in Canadian <b>ethnic</b> broadcasting, <b>and</b> the politicization of <b>ethnic</b> relations <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> broadcasting operations in China...|$|R

In this perspective, the chapter deals with some key topics of developmental social psychology, such as the theoretical explanations of children’s <b>ethnic</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> attitudes, the operationalisation and measurement of children’s <b>ethnic</b> identification <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> attitudes, the relations between <b>ethnic</b> identification <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> attitudes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the ethnic economic gap in Malaysia before the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1970 {{and after the}} end of the NEP in 1986. Specifically, this paper uses the Duncan Dissimilarity Index to estimate occupation segregation between <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> the <b>ethnic</b> Chinese; <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians; <b>and</b> the <b>ethnic</b> Chinese <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians before <b>and</b> after the policy. Next, the paper {{estimates the}} wage gap between the three ethnicities by using A Generalized Oaxaca Decomposition, both before and after the NEP. The data of this study is obtained from two principal sources. Data concerning wage and salary figures is obtained fromthe 1966 - 67 West Malaysian Family Survey; 1976 - 77 First Malaysian Family Life Survey; and the 1988 Second Malaysian Family Life Survey. The other sources of data variables are obtained from the 1970 Population Census of Peninsular Malaysia; the 1980 Population Census of Peninsular Malaysia; and the 1991 Population and Housing Census of Malaysia. The study finds that occupation segregation was reduced between all ethnicities by the end of the NEP. However, the wage gap between the <b>ethnic</b> Chinese <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Malays; <b>and</b> the <b>ethnic</b> Chinese <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians continued to rise after 1986. Additionally, while the wage gap decreased between <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians in some specific occupations, the wage gap increased between <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> the <b>ethnic</b> Chinese in all specific occupations during the same period...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the struggles between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> national integration {{in education and}} citizenship education for ethnic minorities in China. It argues that despite the Communist Party of China’s emphasis on ethnic pluralism, the state uses education and citizenship education for ethnic minorities as a hegemonic instrument to subordinate ethnic diversity into national unity and social stability <b>and</b> to assimilate <b>ethnic</b> minority cultures <b>and</b> identities into state-prescribed national ones. Social stability and national security concerns have long been used to balance <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> national integration in China, and they are important considerations in handling <b>ethnic</b> relations <b>and</b> affairs and in providing education and citizenship education for ethnic minority students. To maintain social stability and strengthen national integration, the Communist Party of China solicits <b>ethnic</b> solidarity <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority support by implementing preferential ethnic minority policies to protect <b>ethnic</b> minority rights <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> distinctiveness <b>and</b> to facilitate minority participation in Han-dominated mainstream society. When social stability, <b>ethnic</b> solidarity, <b>and</b> territorial integrity appear threatened, the state uses national security concerns, particularly the self-perceived threat of foreign aggression, to justify increased control over <b>ethnic</b> minority relations <b>and</b> the assimilation of ethnic minority groups into mainstream society...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between <b>ethnic</b> composition <b>and</b> both schooling outcomes and classroom behaviour, making the crucial distinction between the share of migrant-origin students <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> diversity. The current educational literature shows mixed results for the relationship between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> school performance and lacks information {{on the relationship between}} <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> student behaviour during lessons. The results shows hardly any negative relationships between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> school performance for native-origin students, mostly negative relationships between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> reading performance, and mixed findings for the relationship between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> math performance for migrant-origin students. The shortage of qualified teachers partly explains the positive relationship between the share of native-origin students and reading performance and the shortage of teaching materials partly explains the relationship between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> school performance, but not the relationship between the share of native-origin students and reading performance for migrant-origin students. Classroom disruption partly explains the negative relationship between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> reading performance for migrant-origin students The significant positive relationship between <b>ethnic</b> diversity <b>and</b> classroom disruption during reading lessons is weaker in countries with a more inclusive integration policy. Therefore, this thesis shows how inclusive integration policies relate to the everyday relations of both native- and migrant-origin students in ethnically diverse schools and to the goals of multiculturalism policies. Finally, inclusive integration policies indirectly provide students in ethnically diverse schools more opportunities to work on their reading performance through a decline of classroom disruption...|$|R
