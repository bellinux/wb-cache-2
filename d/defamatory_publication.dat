The law presumptions on all these are in the communication. No intent can make a <b>defamatory</b> <b>publication</b> good, nothing can make it have a good tendency; truth is not pleadable. Taken juridically, the foundation of these law presumptions is not unjust; taken constitutionally, they are ruinous, and tend to the total suppression of all publication. If juries are confined to the fact, no writing which censures, however justly or however temperately, the conduct of administration, can be unpunished. Therefore, if the intent and tendency {{be left to the}} judge, as legal conclusions growing from the fact, you may depend upon it you can have no public discussion of a public measure; which is a point which even those who are most offended with the licentiousness of the press (and it is very exorbitant, very provoking) will hardly contend for.|$|E

Later that year, slander lawsuits were filed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{determining}} {{responsibility for}} publication {{in the context of}} the law of defamation, it seems to me to be important to focus on what the person did, or failed to do, in the chain of communication. It is clear that the state of a defendant’s knowledge can be an important factor. If a person knowingly permits another to communicate information which is defamatory, when there would be an opportunity to prevent the publication, there would seem to be no reason in principle why liability should not accrue. So too, if the true position were that the applicants had been (in the claimant’s words) responsible for ‘corporate sponsorship and approval of their illegal activities’.I have little doubt, however, that to impose legal responsibility upon anyone under the common law for the publication of words it is essential to demonstrate a degree of awareness or at least an assumption of general responsibility, such as has long been recognized in the context of editorial responsibility...Of course, to be liable for a <b>defamatory</b> <b>publication</b> it is not always necessary to be aware of the defamatory content, still less of its legal significance. Editors and publishers are often fixed with responsibility notwithstanding such lack of knowledge. On the other hand, for a person to be held responsible there must be knowing involvement in the process of publication of the relevant words. It is not enough that a person merely plays a passive instrumental role in the process...|$|E

On 6 April 2017, Colin Craig filed a $240,000 lawsuit against former employee Jacqueline Stiekema regarding defamatory statements she had allegedly made on a Facebook page and other <b>defamatory</b> <b>publications</b> she had made to a third person..

500|$|The Court then discussed, on an obiter basis, the {{applicability}} of the Reynolds privilege to Singapore citizens. It held that the key question is whether or not, in the context of publication of matters of public interest, the rationale behind the Reynolds privilege ought to apply such that constitutional free speech is the rule and restrictions on this right are the exception. In considering the factors relevant to the key question, Chan C.J. stated that whilst the court has the power to dictate the direction of the common law of defamation as adopted upon the enactment of the Constitution, Parliament still has overriding powers to limit the freedom of speech and expression where <b>defamatory</b> <b>publications</b> and statements are made: ...|$|R

40|$|The truth defence is {{defamation}} law's oldest defence but {{it remains}} the least attractive defence to Australian media defendants because of its onerous threshold for success. The paper argues that the shackles on the truth defence are inconsistent with established freedom of speech ideals and the public interest in having a robust media. As a result society is constrained from enlightened participation in public affairs. This paper proposes reforms to alleviate the heavy demands of the defence so as to promote the discussion of matters of public concern and to strike a more contemporary balance between {{freedom of speech and}} the protection of reputation. These reforms employ defamation law's doctrinal calculus to reposition the protection of reputation/freedom of speech fulcrum. The cornerstone of the reform proposals considered here is one that advocates a reversal of burdens so that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving falsity of the <b>defamatory</b> <b>publication</b> where the complainant is a public figure; the matter complained about is a matter of public concern; and the legal action is against a media defendant...|$|E
40|$|In most of Australia juries {{are used}} in {{defamation}} trials to assess whether a publication is defamatory. One commonly used definition of a <b>defamatory</b> <b>publication</b> is that it tends to cause ordinary reasonable people to think less of the plaintiff. By dissecting {{the concept of the}} 2 ̆ 7 ordinary reasonable person 2 ̆ 7 as representative of the community, this paper explores two crucial issues. The first {{is the extent to which}} juries are permitted and encouraged to consider the views of sub-communities within wider society. The second is the accuracy with which jurors are likely to assess community attitudes, given the phenomenon known as the 2 ̆ 7 third person effect 2 ̆ 7, which hypothesises that jurors will consistently underestimate the tolerance of others. The paper explores the impact of minor, apparently insignificant modifications to the way juries are instructed and their broader ramifications for other forms of jury trials, as well as for freedom of expression in Australia. This paper presents research-in-progress of the National Defamation Research Project, an unprecedented examination of Australian social attitudes in relation to defamation law. Run by the Communications Law Centre at the University of New South Wales, the project uses quantitative and qualitative social research methodologies, supplemented by interviews with journalists, defamation lawyers and judges...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} upon {{defamation}} law in Australia and its struggles {{to adjust to}} the digital landscape, to illustrate the broader challenges involved in the governance and regulation of data associations. In many instances, online publication will be treated by the courts in a similar fashion to traditional forms of publication. What is more contentious is the question of who, if anyone, should bear the responsibility for digital forms of <b>defamatory</b> <b>publication</b> which result not from an individual author’s activity online but rather from algorithmic associations. This article seeks, in part, to analyse this question, by reference to the Australian case law and associated scholarship regarding search engine liability. Reflecting on the tensions involved here offers us a fresh perspective on defamation law through the conceptual lens of data associations. Here the focus of the article shifts to explore some wider questions posed for defamation law by big data. Defamation law may come to {{play a significant role in}} emerging frameworks for algorithmic accountability, but these developments also call into question many of its traditional concepts and assumptions. It may be time to think differently about defamation and to consider its interrelationship with privacy, speech and data protection more fully. As a result, I conclude that the courts and policymakers need to engage more deeply and explicitly with the rationale(s) for the protection of reputation and that more thought needs to be given to changing conceptions of reputation in the context of data associations...|$|E

40|$|Whether it be {{contact between}} local {{government}} officers themselves, or between officer and citizen, or between officer and news media, or between media and government itself, {{the potential for}} <b>defamatory</b> <b>publications</b> is awesome. Historically, therefore, in the defamation law of any state, {{a considerable number of}} the cases typically arise out of the local government process. Indeed, no less a case than New York Times v. Sullivan itself is but modern confirmation of a traditional setting for defamation controversy. Georgia local government law likewise contains its share of defamation disagreements. At an early date, many of the state 2 ̆ 7 s common law defamation principles were reduced to statutory codification; litigation then reconveyed those principles to the appellate courts for additional interpretation. In the course of that interpretation, the twains of local government and defamation have been further joined. The aim of this brief effort is primarily to survey and illustrate rather than to analyze. Generally, the chronological treatment within each of the indicated contexts is an attempt to sketch a backdrop against which future developments might be considered. The extent to which Georgia courts have alluded to current constitutional developments in thsoe contexts will be noted, but much in that regard yet remains for evolution. As on other occasions, therefore, the objective is an additional clearing in the forest of Georgia local government law...|$|R
40|$|Since its beginning, {{the actual}} malice test first {{announced}} in 1964 in New York Times v. Sullivan, {{has suffered from}} problems that are increasingly traceable to {{the changing face of}} journalism. Its demand that the mind of the reporter be proved 2 ̆ 2 with convincing clarity 2 ̆ 2 has adverse consequences for plaintiffs and news organizations alike. End runs around the subjective state of mind inquiry by plaintiffs have become more common. And the actual malice test 2 ̆ 7 s predictability, its capacity as a standard of liability to yield consistent and coherent results across a body of cases, remains a hollow promise. As Robert Sack famously put it, successful libel plaintiffs 2 ̆ 2 resemble the remnants of an army platoon caught in an enemy crossfire. 2 ̆ 2 Perhaps the central flaw in the subjective malice/recklessness test is its focus on individual rather than corporate conduct, a shortcoming so fundamental that, in our judgment, the test should be supplemented, in the press setting at least, with what we call an institutional reckless disregard standard. This would be a largely objective assessment of the corporate decisions that affect journalism when they manifest knowing indifference to the risk of defamatory falsehood that flow from the decisions. Why would such a standard be preferable? First, the actual malice/reckless disregard standard focuses on the state of mind of a reporter or editor instead of on the underlying factors that can give rise to <b>defamatory</b> <b>publication,</b> and over which writers and editors may have little or no control. Second, the actual malice/reckless disregard standard is blunt-edged. Third, while libel actions may be traumatic for journalists, the shift of financial liability to the business as a whole insulates journalists from responsibility for knowing and false misbehavior, thus in effect making them more indifferent to the risks their behavior imposes on others. Fourth, by exacting punishment based on conduct of journalists, not on organizational recklessness, the actual malice/recklessness inquiry frees news organizations to adopt risky practices without fear of consequences. At a time when market-based forces are placing great financial pressure on newsrooms and the publicly traded organizations that own most of them, a rule that frees journalistically dangerous corporate decisions from cost or consequence is likely, perversely, to facilitate the very choices that the law should discourage. For these reasons we propose a different method of liability for news organizations, one that rests liability on corporate decisions that are known to present a heightened risk of falsity and defamation because of the impact of such decisions on staffing, training, editorial oversight, copyediting and related factors that affect the reliability of the news product and that cannot be justified on grounds related to the quality or journalistic performance of the news organization. We believe that decisions that are knowingly, indeed often calculatedly, taken to increase profits or personal wealth at the cost of slipshod journalism should not be relieved, as they are now, from consideration in establishing liabilit...|$|E
500|$|In Jeyaratnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992), Justice L.P. Thean, when {{delivering}} {{the judgment of}} the court, held that [...] "ersons holding public office or politicians ... are equally entitled to have their reputations protected as those of any other persons". In this case, counsel for the appellant argued that [...] "qualified privilege attaches to <b>defamatory</b> <b>publications</b> concerning public officials (or candidates for a public office) relating to their official conduct or the performance of their public duties by those who have an honest and legitimate interest in the matter to those who have a corresponding and legitimate interest (whether as electors or as citizens potentially affected by the conduct of public officials)". The fact that the statements were made in a political rally during the run-up to elections meant that the requirement of a legitimate interest was met. Lingens v. Austria (1986) was relied upon in support of the premise that [...] "the limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual". In Lingens, the European Court of Human Rights was of the opinion that a politician [...] "inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance". The reasoning of the European Court was in line with the public figure doctrine enunciated in New York Times Co. v.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the way in}} which the common law determines whether a <b>publication</b> is <b>defamatory.</b> It also touches on some related matters, such as the assessment of damages for defamation. The law frames the test for defamation not in terms of the reactions to a publication of its actual recipients, but rather the imagined responses of a hypothetical audience, whose members the law often describes as &# 145;ordinary reasonable people&# 146;. Through an analysis of case law, the thesis concludes that the legal test for defamation is ambiguous, not least as to whether it should always reflect mainstream opinion, even when it is anticipated that most people would respond to a publication irrationally. In light of such uncertainties, the thesis explores the law&# 146;s practical application, reporting on interviews with eight judges and 28 defamation lawyers, assessing how they understand and apply the law. It concludes that the majority of lawyers understand the test for defamation as intended to reflect how most people think, both in terms of their values as well as how they interpret communications. With that in mind, the thesis presents empirical findings on whether defamation law achieves that end. By means of a phone survey of 3, 000 adults, selected to represent Australia&# 146;s resident population, as well as eight focus groups conducted among sections of the general community, plus student surveys, answers are sought as to how a number of potentially <b>defamatory</b> <b>publications</b> are received among the public. A disconnect emerges between, on the one hand, the outcome of defamation trials and the views of judges and lawyers as to what is defamatory and, on the other, {{the way in which}} people actually respond to publications. Through further empirical research, the thesis accounts for this disparity by reference to a phenomenon identified in communications studies as the &# 145;third-person effect&# 146;: the tendency for individuals to perceive the negative impact of media messages as greater on others than on themselves. The thesis concludes that the law&# 146;s reliance on imagined, as opposed to real responses to potentially defamatory material distorts defamation law, unfairly benefiting plaintiffs at the expense of defendants, thus exacerbating the law&# 146;s chilling effect on free speech...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 1999 Dr. Matthew CollinsThe Internet is a unique and revolutionary medium of communication. The objective of this dissertation is to identify whether there are areas in which reform {{of the rules of}} Australian civil defamation law needs to be undertaken to meet the challenges posed by this new medium and, if so, to advocate desirable reforms. The methodology by which the dissertation sets out to achieve its objective is a systematic analysis of how the defamation cause of action, defences and remedies, as well as relevant jurisdiction and choice of law rules, apply, or are likely to apply, to material published via the Internet. It is possible to distil five features of communication via the Internet which are of relevance to the operation of the rules of civil defamation law: - Internet communications do not respect geographical boundaries: they involve the transfer of signals from computers in indeterminate locations, to other computers in indeterminate locations, via routes which are indeterminate; - intermediaries, in the form of Internet service providers and network operators, {{play a central role in}} all Internet communications; - material published via the Internet can be republished to a wide and geographically diverse audience more easily than material published via other means; - material on the Internet is organised through the use of hyperlinks which blur the distinction between where one publication ends and the next begins; - the Internet can be used in a wide variety of ways, to resemble almost any other medium, including the telephone, the postal service, radio, television, newspapers or libraries. Once the way in which the Internet works and is used is understood, it is possible to predict how most of the rules of defamation law would apply to material published via the Internet. The outcome of the research undertaken in this dissertation is that most of those rules are capable of being applied without the need for reform. In other areas, however, the existing rules give rise to uncertainty, or undesirable outcomes, when applied to Internet publications. In those areas, reform is desirable. Ultimately, four areas of reform of the existing rules of defamation law are identified, and desirable reforms suggested: 1 Reform to clarify whether different types of Internet publication are libel or slander. 2 Reform to ensure that intermediaries of Internet publications are only liable for civil defamation where their conduct is sufficiently culpable to warrant the attribution of liability. 3 Expansion of the remedies available in civil defamation law to provide successful plaintiffs with more effective means of vindicating their reputations where they have been damaged by <b>defamatory</b> Internet <b>publications.</b> 4 Reform of the choice of law rules applicable to intra-Australian publications, by adoption of a rule that substantive rights and liabilities are determined by applying solely the law of the place (or places) of publication, regardless of the place in which proceedings are brought and determined.
