SO 4 concentration should be less than approximately 100 mg-SO 4 /L in order to suppress H 2 S generation to below 2000 ppm. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentration should be less than approximately 200 mg-C/L assuming a high SO 4 concentration.

The amount of Ce 2 (SO 4) 3 × 8 H 2 O corresponding to 0. 1; 0. 5 and 1  % of Ce 2 O 3 from the mass of dry materials (gypsum) was added to solution. Maleic anhydride (C 4 H 2 O 3) was used as crystal modifier and 0. 1  % of C 4 H 2 O 3 from the mass of dry materials (gypsum) was added to solution. Water/gypsum of the suspension was equal to 2. The system was processed under hydrothermal conditions at 128 °C ± 2 °C and 138 °C ± 2 °C temperature; the duration of isothermal curing was 3 hours.

The phosphogypsum-slag-based binding material was prepared by mixing 45 % phosphogypsum, 48 % slag, 7 % cement clinker and chemical activator at 1 % relative to the binder.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the hydration, and {{associated}} microstructure development, of b-hemihydrate to <b>dihydrate</b> (<b>gypsum).</b> The sound velocity is used to quantify {{the composition of the}} fresh slurry as well as the hardening and hardened—porous—material. Furthermore, an overview of available hydration kinetic and volumetric models for gypsum is addressed. The presented models predict the sound velocity through slurries and hardened products. These states correspond to the starting and ending times of the hydration process. The present research shows that a linear relation between the amount of hydrationproduct (gypsum) formed and sound velocity (Smith et al., J Eur Ceram Soc 22 (12) : 1947, 2002) can be used to describe this process. To this end, the amount of hydrationproduct formed is determined using the equations of Schiller (J Appl Chem Biotechnol 24 (7) : 379, 1974) for the hydration process and of Brouwers (A hydration model of Portland cement using the work of Powers and Brownyard, 2011) for the volume fractions of binder, water and hydration products during the hydration proces...|$|R
40|$|The WMC Fertilizers {{operation}} at Phosphate Hill, north-west Queensland, began production of ammonium phosphate fertilizer in late 1999. In the production process, Cambrian marine phosphorites are crushed and dissolved (acidulated) in sulphuric and phosphoric acid to produce stronger phosphoric acid and, as a by-product, phosphogypsum (PG). The phosphoric acid is used, with ammonia, for fertilizer production while the PG is permanently stored on-site in gypsum stacking facilities. In common with other fertilizer plants, {{the volume of}} PG in storage at Phosphate Hill has increased rapidly. Eventually {{tens of millions of}} tonnes of the material will need to be maintained in permanent facilities. Above-ground stacks, such as those currently used, will be subject to erosion, potentially forming sources of pollutants for the surrounding pastoral country. An alternative option is to store the PG in the voids left after mining of the phosphorite ore body. This would immediately negate most opportunities for erosion of, and contamination from, the storage facilities. This study was instigated to assess the likely impact of in-pit disposal. Very little work had been done on characterizing the PG produced at Phosphate Hill. A single initial set of analyses taken from samples obtained during the commissioning period identified the major components and subjected the material to rigorous mechanical testing. By contrast, this study has focussed on fully identifying the mineralogy, chemistry, radiochemistry and physical characteristics of the PG in its two main species: the hemihydrate (bassanite - CaSO 4. 0. 5 H 2 O) as it is produced from the phosphoric acid plant and the <b>dihydrate</b> (<b>gypsum</b> - CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) that is transported from the re-slurry tank into the gypsum stack for storage. In addition, the liquid component of the PG slurry, derived from acid process water that is recirculated through the stacking system, has also been analysed. The results show that the four species of calcium sulphate {{can be found in the}} PG. Bassanite (CaSO 4. 0. 5 H 2 O) is dominant in the hemihydrate filter cake but also remains in the stack material. <b>Dihydrate</b> <b>gypsum</b> (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O), including species with extra H 2 O molecules (identified as *. 0. 5 H 2 O), dominates the stack gypsum but also occurs at low levels in the hemihydrate filter cake.

In general, Japanese Kampo or Chinese medical doctors have made allowance for the amount of gypsum according to symptom complex of patients when they make decoctions of some formulations such as Byakko-ka-ninjin-to. However, the dissolution rate of gypsum with increasing amount was not clear. We extracted gypsum with hot water to measure the concentration of calcium using the atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that the calcium concentration was approximately 200 ppm when 10 g of block form of gypsum was used for one hour extraction and the dissolution rate was increased depending on the amount of gypsum and the length of extraction time. However, {{in the case of the}} powder form of gypsum, the calcium concentration was approximately 550 ppm for 15 min extraction and the dissolution rate was almost constant, independent of the amount of gypsum and extraction time. Thus, the block form of gypsum is better to use in order to be able to control the dissolution rate. Moreover, according to X-ray diffraction method and fluorescent X-ray analysis, the crystal structures and the contents of inorganic compounds were not changed before and after extraction, suggesting that the block form of gypsum has the possibility to be used several times. 「石膏」は『神農本草経』の上品に「石膏味辛微寒主中風寒熱心下逆気驚喘口乾舌焦不能息腹中堅痛除邪鬼産乳金瘡」と記載されている漢薬で, 古来, 清熱, 止渇, 鎮咳薬として白虎加人参湯, 麻杏甘石湯, 釣藤散などの処方に配合される。石膏の基源にっいては日本及び中国で, 天然の含水硫酸カルシウム(CaSO_ 4 ・ 2 H_ 20) であると規定されている。漢方医学において石膏は, 大黄, 附子と共にしばしば"さじ加減"して用いられる代表的な生薬の一つで, 漢方処方では通常 5 ～ 10 gを配合すると記載されているが, 実際の臨床では, 患者の熱感や口渇の程度を指標として使用量を増減することが多い。塩谷らは加減一陰煎加亀板膠に, 新たに石膏を 5 ～ 20 g加えることにより, 成人型アトピー性皮膚炎において著効が得られたことを報告している。 一方, これまで石膏は水に対して難溶であることから, その薬理効果が疑問視されてきた。石膏の水への溶解性に関してはこれまで, 硫酸イオンを指標とした研究 5) や, ICP発光分析による無機成分の溶出挙動に関する研究が報告されている。Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University : 21 st Century COE Progra...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Gypsum</b> (calcium sulphate <b>dihydrate)</b> is of great industrial importance with over 95, 000 ktonnes {{being used in the}} world per annum. The greatest use of gypsum is in the production of plaster (calcium sulphate hemihydrate) for use as an interior finisher. Plaster is produced by the calcination (thermal decomposition) of gypsum. The most popular design is a continuous calciner where gypsum is fed continuously and is directly heated by hot air. There are a number of different phenomena occurring within a calciner, including heat transfer, mass transfer, particle and gas mixing, elutriation and the dehydration reaction itself. All these processes interact with each other. Although a lot of research has been carried out in these areas already, the literature has been found to contain significant discrepancies. This study contains experimental work which has been carried out in order to better understand the physical processes occurring within a gypsum calciner. The rate of dehydration of gypsum (35 - 67 μm in diameter) has been studied in a fluidised bed reactor. Experiments were carried out at bed temperatures of 100 to 170 °C. The fluidising gas was air with water vapour pressures of 0. 001 to 0. 30 atm. The dehydrations were under differential conditions. The results show that the dehydration under these conditions can be successfully modelled using the two dimensional Avrami-Er'ovev expression. A study of the fluidisation and elutriation properties of gypsum in batch vessels (cylindrical and conical) has been carried out. The mechanics of elutriation has been investigated and modelled for various freeboards, superficial gas velocities and air humidities. Tracer tests have also been carried out on a laboratory scale continuous conical kettle. Sodium carbonate was used as the inert tracer material. Runs were carried out at different air and gas flowrates and different bed temperatures. Residence time distributions were elucidated. Finally, the above experimental data and component models have been investigated for their applicability to producing a model of the laboratory scale gypsum calciner...|$|R
