5000|$|The Quietus Joe Kennedy compares 50 Words for Snow to {{the work}} of such artists as Michael Nyman, Brian Eno and Scott Walker, writing [...] "Snow brings about a state of {{exception}} in which theres no pressure to exert ourselves on the outside world: instead, it invites contemplativeness and the prioritisation of personal and domestic relationships over professional ones. Bushs habitual provocations to abandon day-to-day concerns while cultivating romantic, internal landscapes have always felt slightly like the work of someone gazing from a window into a blizzard. This, one senses, is her natural territory...Where her past work has often been heavily-layered and breathless, 50 Words for Snow uses negative space to impressive effect; much of the album features little more than voice and flurrying passages of piano which gust across the stave, changing pace and melodic direction as <b>if</b> <b>theyre</b> suddenly hitting updrafts." [...] Other critics take exception to some of Bushs choices, greeting the album with skepticism. Ludovic Hunter-Tilsley in The Financial Times warns that despite [...] "slow eddies of piano chords and gentle percussion … wintry piano, atmospheric orchestral arrangements and an intimate, torch-lit vocal from Bush, who, at 53, has acquired a warm huskiness to her voice … the album wobbles with the hammy Elton John duet [...] "Snowed In at Wheeler St", and topples over on the title track in which Bush invites Stephen Fry to dream up 50 terms for snow … 50 Words for Snow elucidates its wintry theme with flashes of brilliance but the odd treacherous icy patch too"; Vivascenes Marin Nelson has trouble with the songs long running times and Bushs [...] "forced whimsicality"; she declares that [...] "Bush was going for snowy surrealism, but we’re left feeling cold." ...|$|E

She immediately rejects Rickys request by telling him he is a bad influence and tells him to stay away from him. However, Ricky finds a way to meet later that night outside with Mike, ignoring his mothers statements. Ricky then asks Mike if hes still going to the show, so that they can support their other friend in the neighborhood, Bobby Brown (played as a youth by Tyler Marcel Williams), who is supposed to perform. They later head to the local talent show and are influenced by the sound of a vocal group called [...] "The Untouchables". Bobby is called on stage to perform and has stage fright within the first few seconds he appeared on stage. The next day, Bobby tells them that he wants to try again. However, they should get on stage with Bobby instead, which was his secret silent plot to get rid of his stage fright.

40|$|In a {{knowledge}} society, what?s needed {{is an open}} innovation network, argues JOHN HARTLEY THERE has been much comment recently on Kevin Rudd?s proposal to fast-track broadband infrastructure in Australia. Even the government thinks {{this is a good}} idea. The only difference between the parties is whether it should be supported with public as well as private finance. Not much of the debate has been concerned with what Australians might do with their digital capability once they?ve got it. Even less thought seems to have gone into how they ? or rather we ? will acquire the skills and motivations required to benefit fully from this new toy. Political attention is focused on publishers and providers not consumers and users. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries were notable for massive and sustained public investment in schools and (later on) universities ? the infrastructure needed to deliver near-universal print-literacy at low cost to the user. Right around the world the cost was justified in order to produce modern citizens and a disciplined, skilled workforce for industrialisation. That effort has not been matched in the digital era. The physical ICT infrastructure that has developed since the 1990 s has not been matched by a concomitant investment in education ? public or private ? to promote creative uptake of digital technologies by entire populations. Usage across different demographics is patchy to say the least, continuing to reproduce the class and demographic divides inherited from the industrial era. The scaling up of digital literacy is left largely to entertainment providers and those who want users for their proprietary software applications. In other words, the market. But what about the intended beneficiaries of party-political competition and education policy; young people especially? If we?re to believe what we read about Generation Y and ?digital natives,? they are already in evolutionary mid-step. Today?s 13 -year-olds ? those who?ll be retiring from work around the year 2060 ? seem almost a different species from modernists reared in the image of industry. Teens evidently don?t see computers as technology. It?s as <b>if</b> <b>they?re</b> born with an innate ability for text-messaging and gaming. And while {{they may not be able}} to spell they can tell you their life story on MySpace, entertain you on YouTube, muse philosophically in the blogosphere, contribute to knowledge on Wikipedia, create cutting-edge art on Flickr. <b>If</b> <b>they?re</b> anything like my daughter they can do most of these things at once, and then submit their efforts to an online ethic of collective intelligence (via msn, SMS) and iterative improvability that is surely scientific in mode. But they learn very little of this in school. For the most part the education system has responded to the digital era by prohibiting school-based access to digital environments, apart from walled gardens under strict teacher control. From this, kids also learn that formal education?s top priority is not to make them digitally literate but to ?protect? them from ?inappropriate? content and online predators. So a good many of them switch off, and devote their energies to daydreaming and making mischief. And there?s the rub. Daydreaming is just another word for identity-formation using individual imagination. Mischief is no more than experimental engagement with peer-groups and places. Teenage daydreaming and mischief have been the wellspring of the entertainment industry from time immemorial, supplying the characters, actions and plots of fantasy fiction from A Midsummer Night?s Dream to I Know What You Did Last Summer. Popular culture has prospered by capturing the attention, mood, time, activities and culture of young people in their leisure moments, just beyond the institutional grasp of family, school or work. So while schools and universities keep their distance, purposeless entertainment has nurtured demand for creative self-expression and communication among the young. Until recently, that demand has been provided on a take-it-or-leave-it basis by experts and corporations with little input (apart from cash) by the consumers themselves. But now, with digital online media, there?s almost infinite scope for DIY (do-it-yourself) creative content produced by and for consumers and users, without the need for institutional filtering or control bureaucracies. The so-called ?long tail? of self-made content is accessible to anyone near a computer terminal. Everyone is a potential publisher. Instead of needing to rely on the expertise of others, young people navigate themselves through this universe of information. Although schools and universities certainly teach ?ICT skills? and even ?creative practice,? so far they have not proven to be adept at enabling demand-driven and distributed learning networks for imaginative rather than instrumental purposes. Here is where creative innovation must be nurtured. But it needn?t stop there. There are already loftier ambitions for scientific, intellectual and public uses of the net, but this time such initiatives can include everyone, not just expert elites, which is why ?everyone? needs to be emancipated into digital citizenship. Recently both business and public-service thinking have stressed the need for organisations, governments and communities to evolve models of innovation that go beyond the closed expert process of the industrial era. In {{a knowledge}} society, what?s needed is an open innovation network. At the same time, the intuitive and imaginative skills of entrepreneurs have been compared with those of artists. The need for creativity in all aspects of economic and political life has been recognised. Creative talent now commands economic as well as symbolic value. But an open innovation network ? and therefore an internationally competitive Australian innovation system ? would benefit from harnessing the creative energies of the whole population, not just those of isolated expert elites. ?
