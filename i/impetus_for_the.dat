5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the {{hermeneutic}} style was cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. The <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of {{bacteria in the}} laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine, where the correct treatment {{is determined by the}} bacterial species causing an infection.

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... was {{developed}} as a change from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles, focusing on a small-scale environment and threat rather than a large-scale environment as in previous titles. Upon release, If... received a positive reception from critics and fans, and inspired multiple tie-in print adaptations and a mobile prequel. Its well-received high school setting was the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> creation of the spin-off Persona series.|$|E
5|$|The {{adventure}} {{begins when}} the player characters hear reports of bandits waylaying and attacking caravans in a jungle region. Most of the ambushed merchants and guards have been killed, but {{the few who}} have returned alive tell fantastic stories about deformed plants and deadly beasts in the jungle. The stolen goods taken from the caravans provide an <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> characters to enter the jungles in search of this lost treasure.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry of Horus and Set {{is portrayed}} in two {{contrasting}} ways. Both perspectives appear {{as early as}} the Pyramid Texts, the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.|$|E

5|$|This {{population}} {{issue was}} {{a significant part of}} the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> recent merger of Old Ikata with Seto and Misaki. While Old Ikata is geographically more accessible, and has enjoyed the economic benefits of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, Seto and Misaki have experienced even more severe aging and decline of their populations. In 2000, Seto's working-age population dipped below 50% of its total.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|One of <b>the</b> primary <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{exploration}} of artificial creation {{comes from the}} realization in the artificial life and evolutionary computing fields that some basic assumptions common in these fields represent subtle mischaracterizations of natural evolution. These fall into two general classes: 1) there are fundamental problems {{with the use of}} fitness functions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> primary synthesis of complex systems, and 2) the process of self-replication used in almost all artificial life research is not a fundamental property of self-organizing systems.|$|R

5|$|The {{immediate}} <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvanian was the discontinuance of the National Limited, a New YorkKansas City train {{which had}} provided service over the corridor. The Pennsylvanian began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York via the Philadelphian (a Clocker) westbound and the Montrealer eastbound. At {{the time the}} Pennsylvanian was inaugurated, the Broadway Limited was departing Pittsburgh at an inconvenient early morning hour. The new train ran with Amfleet equipment, including a cafe car. Pennsylvania agreed to pay 20% of the train's costs for the first year, or $580,000, with the state and Amtrak eventually splitting the costs 50/50 by the third year.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was diametrically opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Centre <b>for</b> Christian Studies is {{historically}} {{rooted in the}} diaconal training schools of the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches established in Canada {{in the late nineteenth}} century. The Social Gospel Movement combined with the influence of early femenism, which was fighting for more vocational opportunities for women, as well as the increading need of churches to fill overseas missionary sites were <b>the</b> major <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> formation of these schools. In 1893, the Methodist National Training Centre was opened and the Presbyterian Missionary and Deaconess Training Home followed in 1897.|$|R

5|$|On 8 December 1970, in {{response}} to a request from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a highly secret meeting was held at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam's (MACV) Saigon headquarters to discuss the possibility of an ARVN cross-border attack into southeastern Laos. According to General Creighton W. Abrams, the American commander in Vietnam, the main <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> offensive came from Colonel Alexander M. Haig, an aide to National Security Advisor Dr. Henry Kissinger. MACV had been disturbed by intelligence of a PAVN logistical build-up in southeastern Laos but was reluctant to let the ARVN go it alone against the North Vietnamese. The group's findings were then sent on to the Joint Chiefs in Washington, D.C. By mid-December, President Richard M. Nixon had also become intrigued by possible offensive actions in Laos and had begun efforts to convince both General Abrams and the members of his cabinet of the efficacy of a cross-border attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of the unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius, Lactantius, and Constantine each {{allege that}} Galerius was the prime <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} purge, and its prime beneficiary. Diocletian, {{for all his}} religious conservatism, still had tendencies towards religious tolerance. Galerius, by contrast, was a devoted and passionate pagan. According to Christian sources, he was consistently the main advocate of such persecution. He was also eager to exploit this position to his own political advantage. As the lowest-ranking emperor, Galerius was always listed last in imperial documents. Until {{the end of the}} Persian war in 299, he had not even had a major palace. Lactantius states that Galerius hungered for a higher position in the imperial hierarchy. Galerius's mother, Romula, was bitterly anti-Christian, for she had been a pagan priestess in Dacia, and loathed the Christians for avoiding her festivals. Newly prestigious and influential after his victories in the Persian war, Galerius might have wished to compensate for a previous humiliation at Antioch, when Diocletian had forced him to walk {{at the front of the}} imperial caravan, rather than inside it. His resentment fed his discontent with official policies of tolerance; from 302 on, he probably urged Diocletian to enact a general law against the Christians. Since Diocletian was already surrounded by an anti-Christian clique of counsellors, these suggestions must have carried great force.|$|E
50|$|CommonBond {{was founded}} in November 2012 by David Klein, Michael Taormina, and Jessup Shean, who met at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School MBA program. <b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> {{initiating}} <b>the</b> company was the founders' frustration {{with the lack of}} affordable loan options to fund their own graduate school education.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> naming <b>the</b> {{school may}} have come from its close {{proximity}} to the former village of Port Nelson, which was incorporated into the City of Burlington in 1874.
