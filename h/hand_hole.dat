40|$|Corrugated {{packaging}} is used {{to package}} approximately 90 % of all products that reach retail store shelves and aisles in the United States. A large number of these corrugated shippers are used to ship fresh produce and perishables through the cold-chain environment that requires these boxes to have venting to permit air circulation. In addition, corrugated boxes for that are large in size and contain heavier products, may have <b>hand</b> <b>holes</b> to facilitate manual handling. The presence of ventilation and <b>hand</b> <b>holes</b> both cause a loss of material in two or more faces of the box. As a result the compression strength required for shipping and stacking is compromised and can result in damageto contents. <b>Hand</b> <b>holes</b> that do not meetthe appropriate strength requirements can be a safety issue in manual handling if the contents are released when handling. This study was initiated to understand the loss of compression strength in corrugated containers {{as a function of}} size, shape and location of ventilation and <b>hand</b> <b>holes</b> used for handling ergonomics and extending shelf life for perishables with good air flow. Based on experimental data, results show that the loss in strength can range between 10 to 40 % and is significantly larger than previously reported...|$|R

The third, fourth, fifth and sixth notes of the scale are played with the backs of the four fingers, stopping the a string.

50|$|The jouhikko is {{a member}} of a family of bowed lyre type {{instruments}} that stretches from Russia in the east, through Scandinavia, to Britain and Ireland. Most of these regions have only very sketchy evidence about their extinct bowed lyre traditions. The four-stringed Estonian talharpa and hiiu kannel have a wider <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> and can play a wider range and shifting drones. The Welsh crwth is the most developed of this family to survive, with six strings, a fingerboard, and a complex playing style. Extinct or obscure variants include the Shetland gue and the English crowd. Other instruments are perhaps less closely related, including the bowed zithers such as the Finnish harppu, Icelandic fiðla, and the North American Inuit tautirut.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{compression}} strength of the corrugated shipping containers having the conventional purpose hand holes and the arc top hand holes. Generally, the arc top <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> has stronger tear strength than the conventional purpose <b>hand</b> <b>hole,</b> but the arc top <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> has a larger opening area than the conventional purpose <b>hand</b> <b>hole,</b> and the larger opening area needs more space of a dispersion of compression stress to increase compression resistance. However, when a <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> has enough space to distribute compression stress, the only one variable is the width of the opening area in shipping containers if the containers have the same dimensions. In this study, two designs of the <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> have the same width of opening area and are located to have enough space to distribute compression stress. As a result, the resistance forces of containers are the same in each different environment...|$|E

40|$|Alloy steel {{materials}} are predominantly {{used in the}} manufacturing of headers in thermal power plant boilers. Generally the <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> pipe and dish end component are provided in the header for the inspecting the inner surface of the header. Conventionally the welding of dish end with <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> pipe of the header is carried out using manual GTAW welding process for root pass and manual SAW welding process for filler passes which is a time consuming process. Thus it is substituted with a semi-automatic welding process i. e., STT- root pass followed by the pulsed GMAW for filler passes through a newly designed welding positioner. This semi-automatic welding process optimizes the cycle time and increases the productivity rate. Also the new welding process – STT and P-GMAW is established by following optimization technique of Taguchi’s orthogonal array method and ensuring the weld quality performance through X-Radiography, mechanical tests impact test and hardness test.

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{comparative}} study of transfer doping of hydrogenated single crystal diamond surface by insulators featured by high electron affinity, such as Nb 2 O 5, WO 3, V 2 O 5, and MoO 3. The low electron affinity Al 2 O 3 was also investigated for comparison. Hole transport properties were evaluated in the passivated hydrogenated diamond films by Hall effect measurements, and were compared to un-passivated diamond films (air-induced doping). A drastic improvement was observed in passivated samples in terms of conductivity, stability with time, and resistance to high temperatures. The efficiency of the investigated insulators, as electron accepting materials in hydrogenated diamond surface, is consistent with their electronic structure. These surface acceptor materials generate a higher hole sheet concentration, up to 6. 5 x 1013 cm 2, and a lower sheet resistance, down to 2. 6 kX/sq, {{in comparison to the}} atmosphere-induced values of about 1 x 1013 cm 2 and 10 kX/sq, respectively. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>hole</b> mobilities were reduced by using high electron affinity insulator dopants. Hole mobility as a function of hole concentration in a hydrogenated diamond layer was also investigated, showing a well-defined monotonically decreasing trend...|$|E

40|$|As {{the use of}} fibre {{reinforced}} {{polymer materials}} in bridge construction is becoming more popular, appropriate joining techniques, particularly for field joints, are necessary. Bolted joints are a common method for joining fibre reinforced polymer structures. The main advantage of bolted joints is their detachability, {{but they have a}} number of shortcomings. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>hole</b> clearances, which are needed to facilitate on-site assembly, reduce the stiffness and joint efficiency. On the other hand, {{it is not possible to}} rely on the beneficial effects of bolt pre-defined tension loads, i. e. load transfer in friction, due to the considerable losses of bolt tension caused by the creep deformation in the composite material. To tackle these problems, a solution utilising metallic inserts in the hole is proposed in this paper. A series of experimental tests have been conducted to investigate the effect of inserts on the bolt-tension relaxation, the stiffness and the load-bearing behaviour of joints. Finite element analyses were also employed. The study demonstrates several benefits of the inserts: the bolt tension relaxation is minimised, the load transfer by friction may be feasible to be utilised in the bridge service state and the joint efficiency is increased in terms of stiffness and strength...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{unprecedented}} interest in organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells, quantitative {{information on the}} charge transfer dynamics into selective electrodes is still lacking. In this paper, we report the time scales and mechanisms of electron and hole injection and recombination dynamics at organic PCBM and Spiro-OMeTAD electrode interfaces. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>hole</b> transfer is complete on the subpicosecond time scale in MAPbI 3 /Spiro-OMeTAD, and its recombination rate {{is similar to that}} in neat MAPbI 3. This was found to be due to a high concentration of dark charges, i. e., holes brought about by unintentional p-type doping of MAPbI 3. Hence, the total concentration of holes in the perovskite is hardly affected by optical excitation, which manifested as similar decay kinetics. On the other hand, the decay of the photoinduced conductivity in MAPbI 3 /PCBM is on the time scale of hundreds of picoseconds to several nanoseconds, due to electron injection into PCBM and electron-hole recombination at the interface occurring at similar rates. These results highlight the importance of understanding the role of dark carriers in deconvoluting the complex photophysical processes in these materials. Moreover, optimizing the preparation processes wherein undesired doping is minimized could prompt the use of organic molecules as a more viable electrode substitute for perovskite solar cell devices...|$|E
40|$|Safety and {{reliability}} of liquid ammonia storage tank is very important. The stress of manhole is high and complex, so {{it is necessary to}} analyse welding stress of manhole of liquid ammonia storage tank. This paper ignored the complex process in the weld pool, simulated complex thermal process in weld pool by continuous conductive welding heat source, deduced the calculation formula of maximum stress by establishing Gaussian heat source model of carbon dioxide welding, and modified stress exponent k of cylindrical pressure vessel. This new method has a positive meaning for welding stress analysis of pressure vessel. Storage Tank in the petrochemical industry is widely applied, but in recent years with the improvement of manufacturing process, its volume has a gradually increasing trend. As the volume increases, the safety {{and reliability}} of the storage tank becomes extremely important. In order to facilitate testing and maintenance, liquid ammonia storage tank need to install the pressure gauge, level gauge, safety valve, manhole or <b>hand</b> <b>hole,</b> etc., which needs openings in vessels. The stress situation of the opening region is very complex, nozzle and shell are connected together by welding. The opening may lead to structural discontinuity and form local structural discontinuous stress. Because of asymmetry welding temperature fields and local plasti...|$|E

40|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) based on nanocrystalline {{semiconductors}} such as TiO 2 are {{of great interest}} {{as an alternative to}} the conventional solar cells because of their high performance, low-cost production, and environmental advantages. The DSSCs consist of dye molecule coated wide bandgap semiconductor layer, electrolyte, and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) film. When the DSSCs are exposed to solar light, an incident photon creates a bound electron-hole pair in dye sensitizers. Electrons then flow into the oxide nanoparticle anode due to a difference in the energy levels. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>holes</b> move to the counter electrode through sequential redox reactions in the electrolyte. Therefore, the cell performance is influenced by parameters such as the morphology and optical properties of nanocrystalline oxide films, the electrochemical characteristics of redox electrolytes, and the photochemical properties of molecular sensitizers. In this article, we review the major components of DSSCs such as the oxide semiconductor film, sensitizing dyes, electrolytes, and TCO and discuss their progress to maximize light harvesting and charge injection efficacy. Their electrical, optical, and chemical properties are well correlated to optimize the light harvesting and charge injection of DSSCs. We have also shown recent efforts to improve the energy conversion efficiency, long term stability, sustainability and affordability by modifying or revolutionizing the components of DSSCs. This includes a prospect on the potential commercialization of DSSCs. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
