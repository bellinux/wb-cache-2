25|$|Forbidding {{employers}} to pay {{less than a}} legal minimum is equivalent to forbidding workers to sell their labor {{for less than the}} minimum wage.

25|$|A {{father had}} {{control over his}} {{children}} until their marriage. He {{had a right to}} their labor in return for their keep. He might <b>hire</b> <b>them</b> out and receive their wages, pledge them for debt, or even sell them outright. Mothers had the same rights {{in the absence of the}} father; elder brothers, when both parents were dead. A father had no claim on his married children for support, but they retained the right to inherit on his death.|$|E
25|$|Such is the {{popularity}} of football that some players become better known for their 'off-the-pitch' activities. The celebrity status is such that advertisers and sports goods manufacturers <b>hire</b> <b>them</b> to sponsor their products. The Brazilian footballer Pelé is such a player. He was so admired as a player during his time that {{he went on to}} become a UNICEF ambassador, as well as being a spokesman in advertisements for many different companies. He also spent some time in politics in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In the Republic of Congo, Chinese {{contracts}} {{are said to}} be 30% cheaper than Western ones. African workers, however complain of worsening conditions: Chinese firms <b>hire</b> <b>them</b> on a day-to-day basis, with lower wages than they received from Westerner firms, are insulting or even racist, and enforce strict working conditions. African businessmen have long complained of an increase in Chinese businesses, especially in Senegal. Some Angolans had complained that along with the shipment of machinery and cement, China also imports many of its own nationals to work on these reconstruction projects, leaving little employment for locals, and not allowing for cooperative working relations or the transfer of knowledge and skills.|$|E

25|$|As street {{children}} must provide for themselves, {{work is a}} very important aspect of their lives. Unfortunately, working conditions for {{street children}} are often very poor because they are confined to working in the informal sector, which is unregulated by the government. In Bombay, 50,000 children are illegally employed by 11,750 hotels, restaurants, canteens, tea shops, and eating places. Because of street children's lack of protection from a family and the law, employers often exploit them, making them virtual prisoners, sometimes withholding pay, and abusing them. Employers that would not mistreat the children often will not <b>hire</b> <b>them</b> because they are seen as too great of a risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{treaty was}} officially signed on 19 July 1463 in Wiener Neustadt. The {{aforementioned}} western territories were mortgaged to the Holy Roman Empire {{until the year}} 1647 but also had an option for the actual Hungarian ruler to redeem the cities of Fraknó and Kabold for 40.000 golden florins after Frederick's death. (The number of redeemable cities for this price is lowered to 2 from the 5 in the pre-contract in Graz). The Hungarian crown {{and the city of}} Sopron were retrieved in exchange for an immediate 80.000 florins. Furthermore, it was settled that if Matthias died without a legitimate son, his Kingdom would pass to Frederick and Maximilian. In the secret clause of the treaty, Frederick lost control of John Jiskra and his army, which allowed Matthias to <b>hire</b> <b>them</b> into his service, which would form the core of the later Black Army and the spearhead of Hungarian conquests to come. It also implemented new Hussite warfare, which led to victories in upcoming battles.|$|E
25|$|On 3 December 1906 Alfred Richardson, {{was given}} {{permission}} {{to join the}} General and Finance Committee of the Northern Police Orphanage and Convalescent Home in Halifax. Chief Constables were encouraged to add their patronage. He wrote a booklet for his men which was an extract from a Council meeting held on 7 May 1906. It was written so that {{all members of the}} Force could know the regulations to which it was their duty to confirm. In 1907 there were several disturbances in Commercial Road, Halifax, during the tram drivers strike, causing much extra work for the police. The local press praised the constabulary for their restraints in handling this situation. By this time Richardson had increased further the reputation of the force as one with a strict sense of discipline and generally having a smart turn out, a sentiment reflected in the local newspapers. Richardson was known to have a love of horses, even to wearing spurs in his office at Harrison Road. Halifax was soon to have its own horses and stables, rather than <b>hire</b> <b>them.</b> Horses were increasingly seen as effective in crowd control. In the annual inspection by His Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Sir Llewelyn Atcherley in 1930, the Borough Mounted Police in full dress uniform were presented by Richardson to the Inspector.|$|E

500|$|Jones {{increased}} scheduled passenger journeys {{from two}} to three each day in each direction. With locomotives generally occupied with goods, many passenger services were drawn by horse. While the increased passenger journeys boosted revenues, the Tramway no longer owned enough horses and had to <b>hire</b> <b>them.</b> By 1881 the passenger service was losing £11(about £ in [...] ) a month, although reduced use of locomotives lowered maintenance costs. Although reliability had improved, services were still slow. Horse-drawn passenger services took 60–70 minutes to travel [...] between Quainton Road and Brill. The locomotive-hauled mixed trains, with frequent stops to load and unload, were timetabled at 1 to 2 hours {{to make the same}} journey, slower than walking.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire sharpened in 894, because Emperor Leo the Wise forced the Bulgarian merchants to leave Constantinople and settle in Thessaloniki. Subsequently, Tzar Simeon I of Bulgaria invaded Byzantine territories and defeated a small imperial troop. The Byzantines approached the Hungarians to <b>hire</b> <b>them</b> {{to fight the}} Bulgarians. Nicetas Sclerus, the Byzantine envoy, concluded a treaty with their leaders, Árpád and Kurszán (Kusan) and Byzantine ships transferred Hungarian warriors across the Lower Danube. The Hungarians invaded Bulgaria, forced Tzar Simeon to flee to the fortress of Dristra (now Silistra, Bulgaria) and plundered Preslav. An interpolation in Porphyrogenitus's work states that the Hungarians had a prince named [...] "Liountikas, son of Arpad" [...] at that time, which suggests {{that he was the}} commander of the army, but he might have been mentioned in the war context by chance.|$|E
500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein had disliked Landon's {{novel as}} a basis for a musical when it was published, and their views still held. [...] It {{consists}} of vignettes of life at the Siamese court, interspersed with descriptions of historical events unconnected with each other, except that the King creates most of the difficulties in the episodes, and Anna tries to resolve them. Rodgers and Hammerstein could see no coherent story from which a musical could be made until they saw the 1946 film adaptation, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, and how the screenplay united the episodes in the novel. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about writing a star vehicle. [...] They had preferred to make stars rather than <b>hire</b> <b>them,</b> and engaging the legendary Gertrude Lawrence would be expensive. [...] Lawrence's voice was also a worry: her limited vocal range was diminishing with the years, while her tendency to sing flat was increasing. [...] Lawrence's temperament was another concern: though she could not sing like one, the star was known to be capable of diva-like behavior. [...] In spite of this, they admired her acting – what Hammerstein called her [...] "magic light", [...] a compelling presence on stage – and agreed to write the show. [...] For her part, Lawrence committed to remaining in the show until June 1, 1953, and waived the star's usual veto rights over cast and director, leaving control {{in the hands of the}} two authors.|$|E
