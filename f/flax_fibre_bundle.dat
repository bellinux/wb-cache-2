40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} factors impede the direct {{translation}} of fibre properties from plant crop species to natural fibre composites. Commercially available fibre extraction processes introduce defects and degrade the mechanical properties of fibres. This study reports on a novel image based approach for investigating the effect of fibre extraction processes on <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> strength. X-ray micro Computed Tomography (μCT) was coupled with uniaxial tensile testing to measure the in-situ fibre bundle cross-section area and tensile strength in flax plant stems. The mean tensile strength result was 50 % {{higher than that of}} the fibres extracted through the standard commercial process. To minimize fibre damage during fibre extraction, a pre-treatment was proposed via saturating flax plant stems in 35 % aqueous ammonia solution. By environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), it was evident that ammonia treatment significantly reduced the extent of damage in flax fibre knots and the optimum treatment parameter was identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of water on}} the mechanical properties of wood has been investigated in situ using X-ray microdiffraction on tangential cuts and single fibres of pine earlywood. Simultaneously, the orientation and elongation of the cellulose crystallites inside the composite material has been monitored during tensile stretching experiments. The softening {{in the beginning of the}} macroscopic stress-strain curve of the samples with a moisture content above the fibre saturation point has been localised in the matrix surrounding the microfibrils, lining up along the direction of the external tension force. Interestingly, the strain-hardening close to rupture has been independent on water content, possibly due to the strong bonds, apparently unaffected by the water molecules, along the polymer chains. Additionally, the local dynamics of a <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> in wet and dry state have been studied by means of inelastic neutron scattering showing a clear anisotropy for motions between 2 and 7 meV at 300 and 180 K originating from the changes in the less ordered regions accessible for water...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study on the}} {{measurement}} of <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> cross section and its variability in <b>flax</b> and sisal <b>fibres</b> are presented. Cross section values obtained from “diameter” measurements were more than double the values obtained from actual observation of cross sections of the same individual <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles.</b> The overall conclusion is that “diameter” measurement is not an attractive method for accurate estimation of cross sectional area of these natural <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles.</b> This conclusion is significant for researchers engaged in micromechanical investigation of natural fibre composites since differences in fibre cross section translate directly into differences of the same magnitude in the values obtained for the fibre modulus and strength. The error in <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> cross section introduced by the “diameter” method scales with the average <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> “diameter” which may also result in erroneous observations of fibre modulus and strength which scale inversely with natural <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> “diameter”. The difference in average cross section observed from <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> to <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> was significantly greater than the variation along the length of each individual <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle.</b> The minimum to maximum cross section variability of individual <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> was found to be approximately twice that observed for sisal <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles.</b> A simple model based on a non-circular <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> cross section is introduced and shown to explain these observations...|$|R

To assess {{the potential of the}} flax tow architecture for composites manufacturing, the flax tow was characterised in tension under various conditions. The effect of the gauge length and the strain rate were studied on the dry reinforcement. It has been found that the mechanical properties can vary significantly depending on the loaded length. A characteristic length from which the mechanical properties are stable has been identified. At this characteristic length, the effect of the strain rate on the tensile properties was measured. The evolutions of the mechanical properties are discussed in relation to the distribution of elementary fibres within the tow.

40|$|The {{influence}} of compounding and injection moulding {{on the initial}} variability and morphology of short straw <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> is determined and the mechanical properties for the injection moulded fibre reinforced composites are measured. It is found that {{the composition of the}} straw <b>flax,</b> <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> and woody parts, together with the cutting process strongly affects the initial fibre morphology and its variability. In the initial fibres, small particles as well as long fibres with large width were found. A filter was used to reject the fibres with an aspect ratio below 15 before calculating statistics because these fibres have a negligible contribution to the composite reinforcement. After processing, the initial fibre length and width decrease strongly (− 38 % to − 66 % for length and − 22 % to − 72 % for width). Also, the variability is affected resulting in a standard deviation shifted towards lower fibre lengths and widths (− 55 % for length and − 71 % for width). The improvement of mechanical properties of the flax compound compared to the pure matrix material for the injection-moulded samples is found to be similar to the results for compounds with further processed <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> such as scutched and hackled fibres. An increase of tensile strength by 20 % was found, for stiffness the increase is in the order of 50 – 70 %. This indicates that despite the very large variability of the initial straw <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> and the strong changes of the variability in each processing step, a compound is obtained with improved mechanical properties. status: accepte...|$|R

The compressive strength of elementary <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> as measured with a loop test lies around 1200 MPa. However, the compressive strength can be lowered severely by the decortication process. The standard decortication process induces kink bands in the fibres.

Indeed {{most of the}} materials used today are petro-based and cannot offer viable end of life treatment. Fully biodegradable natural fibre reinforced biopolymers are being increasingly studied as they offer high specific stiffness and low environmental footprint. However, their ageing mechanisms are still not well understood. The present article gives information on 2 years natural seawater aging effect on injection-molded Flax/PLA biocomposite. Biocomposites suffer from relatively high moisture absorption which {{is controlled by the}} vegetal fibres. Simple rules of mixtures allow the determination of weight gain for <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> which is around 12 %. <b>Bundles</b> of <b>fibres</b> and especially middle lamellae influence water uptake. Water alters <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> and their biocomposites, since their mechanical properties (Young’s modulus and tensile strength) are reduced with aging. A linear relationship is observed between water uptake and loss of mechanical properties. Load–unload cycles highlight damage occuring earlier than unaged biocomposites. This damage can be induced by fibre degradation and washing out of soluble components especially the <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> cement, and by debonding of <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> linked to their swelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of biocomposites in engineering applications {{is demonstrated by}} using aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites as a materials model system. The failure stress of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> is measured by tensile testing of single <b>fibres</b> and <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles.</b> For both <b>fibre</b> configurations, {{it is found that}} failure stress is decreased by increasing the tested fibre volume. Based on two types of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> preforms: carded sliver and uniaxial non-crimp fabric, aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites were fabricated with variable fibre content. The volumetric composition and tensile properties of the composite were measured. For composites with a fibre content of 37 % by volume, stiffness is about 20 GPa and failure stress is about 180 MPa. The tensile properties of the composites are analysed with a modified rule of mixtures model, which includes the effect of porosity. The experimental results are well predicted by the model. The back-calculated effective stiffness and failure stress of the <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> are in the ranges 56 - 60 GPa and 515 - 730 MPa, respectively. Finally, model predictions are used to present overall guidelines for the comparisons between tensile performance of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> composites and traditional fibre composites (exemplified by glass fibre composites).

40|$|As the {{environmental}} concern grows, researchers {{try to find}} material which can be environmental friendly and biodegradable to some extent. At present, <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> cannot fully replace glass fibre. Some {{attempts have been made}} to replace the glass fibre. Studies show the physical and mechanical properties of natural fibres are comparable with glass fibre, so it can replace glass fibre in the process of making biocomposites. The properties of biocomposites depend on the fibre used. Research shows that to get a better biocomposite, the fibre has to be chemically treated to improve adhesion between fibre and polymer matrix. After the chemical treatment, the fibre has to be dried to minimum moisture content so the drying of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> is essential in the process of making biocomposites. In this research, oilseed <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> is dried and drying characteristics were investigated. After drying, the physical properties of the fibre were tested and analysed. The fibre was dried using three different drying methods, namely, microwave, microwave-convection, and microwave-vacuum environments. Curve fitting with four empirical methods has been carried out to determine the drying constant, coefficient of determination and standard error values. The results showed that microwave-vacuum drying method is more efficient (in terms of final moisture content) than microwave and microwave-convection drying. Although microwave-vacuum drying took the most time and did not result in promising colour values, the maximum moisture removal is achieved because fibres can be dried for a longer period of time with a comparatively low temperature. The results of physical properties were analysed for untreated and treated and dried <b>flax</b> <b>fibre.</b> The tensile strength and elastic modulus of untreated and treated fibre did not show any significant change. Because the diameter of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> cannot be consistent, a range of values can be obtained. The diameter range of <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> 30 - 300 µm was examined for these tests. The tensile strength obtained from these <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> ranged between 16 to 667 MPa and elastic modulus values were 2 GPa up to 63 GPa. The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) was also analysed for untreated and treated-dried fibre. The fibre which was dried with high power or longer period of time showed black spots, probably due to local heating. The fibre dried with microwave-vacuum developed some black spots which were clearly seen in the SEM. Differential scanning calorimetric data showed a shift in temperature of degradation. In this research, degradation temperature of cellulose was found 350 (+/- 10) °C for the treated and dried <b>flax</b> <b>fibre.</b> In conclusion, the <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> has a potential to be used in biocomposite production. The microwave-vacuum works best for drying where the fibre can be dried up to a less than 1 % of moisture content...|$|R

In this study, numerical methods to generate and simulate mechanical properties of flax short fibre-reinforced and <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> fabric-reinforced polymer composites are proposed. The microstructures of short <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> with different fibre length-to-diameter ratios are generated by algorithm taking fiber defects (e. g. kink band) and fiber bundles into account. Bidirectional flax fabric is generated and discretized by tetrahedron 4 -node finite elements.

The effect of this novel <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> treatment on the environmental behaviour of natural-fibre-mat-reinforced thermoplastics (NMTs) is investigated by monitoring the moisture absorption and swelling, and measuring the residual mechanical properties of the flax/polypropylene composites at different moisture levels.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the physical structure of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> on the mechanical properties of polypropylene (PP) composites. Due to their composite-like structure, <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> have relatively weak lateral bonds which are in particular present in <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> that are often used in natural fibre mat reinforced thermoplastics (NMT). These weak bonds can be partly removed by combing the fibres. In order to study {{the influence of}} the physical structure of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> on NMT tensile and flexural properties, uncombed and combed <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PP composites were manufactured via a wet laid process.

Results indicated that the flax physical structure has a significant effect on flax-PP composite properties and that the <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PP properties are similar to values predicted with existing micromechanical models. The tensile modulus of flax-PP composites can fairly compete with commercial glass mat reinforced thermoplastic (GMT) modulus, the strength, however, both tensile and flexural, can not. In order to rise the strength of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PP composites to the level of GMT strength, the <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> have to be further isolated to elementary <b>flax</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R

It appears that the cellulose coating provides an efficient physical protection, preventing access of these enzymes to their fibrous substrate. Then, the possibility of conferring antibacterial properties on the cellulose coating by chelating phytoalexin molecules such as gramine on it was assayed and proven to be effective against soil cellulolytic bacteria such as Cellvibrio fulvus and Cellvibrio vulgaris. This study therefore establishes that coating flax yarns with cellulose associated with antibacterial molecules could contribute to obtaining a longer service life in soil for geotextiles manufactured from <b>flax</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Natural fibres {{are partly}} {{replacing}} currently used synthetic fibres as reinforcement for polymer composites. Jute <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> were high-cellulose-content modified by alkali treatment, while the bagasse <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> were modified by creating quinones in the lignin portions of fibre surfaces and reacting them with furfuryl alcohol (FA) {{to increase their}} adhesiveness. The effects of different <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> loading and modification of bagasse fibre surfaces in hybrid fibre reinforced epoxy composites have been studied. The role of fibre/matrix interactions in chemically modified hybrid composites were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimeter, Differential Thermo Gravimetry, and a Universal Tensile Machine and {{compared with those of}} unmodified bagasse <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> incorporated with modified jute <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> reinforced hybrid composites. Fibre surface modification reduced the hydrophilicity of <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles,</b> and significantly increased mechanical properties of hybrid composites were observed in conjunction with SEM images. The SEM analysis of the fibre and the composite fractured surfaces have confirmed the FA grafting and shown a better compatibility at the interface between chemically modified <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> and epoxy resin. This paper incorporates interesting results of thermomechanical properties and evaluation of fibre/matrix interactions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Flax</b> <b>fibres</b> {{are being}} {{considered}} as an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic fibres in fibre-reinforced polymer composites {{due to their}} low density, biodegradability, and high mechanical strength. Previous work {{has found that the}} surface properties of natural fibres can be modified by chemical treatment and other treatment methods. This study focused on the effect of different treatments using alkaline, enzyme, and steam-heat, respectively, on some surface characteristics of <b>flax</b> <b>fibre,</b> e. g. physical, chemical, and thermal stability. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), treated fibres were observed to have smoother surfaces than untreated fibres. Chemical composition of fibres was found to be modified after treatment as characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The crystallinity index and thermal stability of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> were increased after certain treatments as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The wettability of treated fibre by water was improved compared to the untreated sample...|$|R

50|$|In this way, a {{principal}} G-bundle {{equipped with a}} right action is often thought of {{as part of the}} data specifying a <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> with structure group G, since to a <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> one may construct the principal bundle via the associated bundle construction. One may then, as in the next section, go the other way around and derive any <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> by using a fibre product.|$|R
40|$|A new {{quantitative}} and visual analysis technique is developed {{to study the}} white matter integrity along <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography. Our approach takes advantages of DTI tractography and geodesic path mapping, which establishes group-wise correspondences to allow direct cross-subject evaluation of diffusion properties. The 3 D volumetric <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> is approximated by streamlines reconstructed using DTI. We present the <b>fibre</b> <b>bundle</b> mask strategy to measure thin <b>fibre</b> <b>bundles</b> in group analysis. A novel isonode visualisation method is developed to facilitate the visual inspection of local white matter alterations within a neural pathway...|$|R
