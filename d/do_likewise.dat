5|$|Rejecting Johnson's {{vision for}} quick {{reconciliation}} with former Confederates, Congress passed three Reconstruction Acts over Johnson's vetoes, which divided {{the southern states}} into five military districts to protect the African Americans elected to political office and freedmen's rights generally. Republicans gained majorities in all 11 states, and African Americans were elected to Congress and high state offices. Military governors were to lead transitional state governments in each district.

The Army conducted new elections for constitutional conventions in the ex-Confederate states. They registered blacks to vote and in many places prevented from voting white men who had supported the Confederacy, as set out in the disenfranchisement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
