5|$|As {{integration}} of the delta function results in the Heaviside step function, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> static deflection of a slender beam subject to multiple point loads is described {{by a set of}} piecewise polynomials.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> choice was a correct one {{that leads to a}} satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
50|$|Chancellor Allen held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{takeover}} defenses were proportionate to {{the threat}} posed {{to the culture of}} <b>the</b> company. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> board had not breached its duties.|$|R

50|$|The court held, further, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{first ground}} {{on which the}} {{plaintiff}} relied for her right to cancel, namely that she in May 1993 had accepted the alleged repudiation of the contract by the first defendant, was bad.|$|R
5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E

50|$|A {{covenant}} {{made with}} the owner of land is {{for the benefit of}} <b>the</b> land. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> covenant can be enforced against the covenantor whether or no he owned any estate in the land, and also against successors in title.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} was rendered pressing when, where, and how Mr Sparkler should {{be married to}} the foremost girl in all this world with no nonsense about her. Its solution, after some little mystery and secrecy, Miss Fanny herself announced to her sister.|$|R
50|$|From this <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> Qis are i.i.d.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gaussian rationals form {{a number}} field which is {{two-dimensional}} as a vector space over Q.|$|E
25|$|The element (1,–1) acts as {{multiplication}} by –1 on L2(R), {{from which}} <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cocycle on SL(2,R) takes only values ±1.|$|E
25|$|A {{covering}} {{space is}} a fiber bundle {{such that the}} bundle projection is a local homeomorphism. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fiber is a discrete space.|$|E
50|$|It {{could not}} be gainsaid, <b>the</b> court held, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> person being dealt with in terms of section 72(4) was an accused person as {{contemplated}} in section 35(3) of the Constitution. From this <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> provisions of section 35(3) were applicable to the enquiry.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> issuing of the warrants, {{as well as}} the {{searches}} themselves, were unlawful. In addition, {{the material}} seized at the applicants' offices was not authorized by the warrant. The warrants, therefore, were declared invalid, and the respondents were directed to return the material seized.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{statement}} did {{not become}} a term because a reasonable man (objective test) {{in the position of}} the car dealer (Oscar Chess Ltd) would not have thought that a person with no experience in the car market would have guaranteed the truth of the statement.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{generating}} function by {{weight of the}} points fixed by g {{is the product of}} the above term over all cycles of g, i.e.|$|E
25|$|Homology is a topological invariant, and {{moreover}} a homotopy invariant: Two topological spaces that are homotopy equivalent have isomorphic homology groups. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Euler characteristic {{is also a}} homotopy invariant.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{invariant}} complex antilinear map j: S → S with j2 = idS. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> triple i, j and k:=ij make S into a quaternionic {{vector space}} SH. This {{is called a}} quaternionic structure.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Crown could {{impose a}} duty on {{imported}} currants {{if this was}} done to regulate foreign trade, and not simply to raise revenue. Sir Richard Lane's Reports {{in the court of}} exchequer, published posthumously in 1657, contained an important report of Sir Thomas Fleming's opinion in this case.|$|R

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{identity}} element, e, is unique, {{and that}} every element of Q has a unique left and right inverse. Since {{the presence of an}} identity element is essential, a loop cannot be empty.|$|E
25|$|The {{adiabatic}} {{potential energy}} surfaces (APES) are then obtained as the eigenvalues of this matrix.

25|$|Alcoholic {{fermentation}} is {{not completely}} finished when the wine is bottled. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> carbon dioxide is produced by the fermenting yeasts, and where malolactic fermentation has not yet taken place. Unlike the traditional method there is no disgorging and dosage, but the wine is normally filtered. To accomplish this the bottles are emptied, then cleaned and refilled.|$|E

25|$|The proof {{proceeds}} as follows: As before, let {{the triangle}} be ABC with AB=AC. Construct the angle bisector of angle BAC and extend it to meet BC at X. AB=AC and AX {{is equal to}} itself. Furthermore angle BAX = angle CAX, so, applying side-angle-side, BAX and CAX are congruent. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> angles at B and C are equal.|$|E
25|$|Since dU is {{an exact}} differential, its {{integral}} over any closed loop is zero and <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area inside the loop on a T-S diagram {{is equal to}} the total work performed if the loop is traversed in a clockwise direction, and {{is equal to the}} total work done on the system as the loop is traversed in a counterclockwise direction.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>follows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heat {{capacity}} of the gas is (3/2)NkB and hence, in particular, the {{heat capacity}} of a mole of such gas particles is (3/2)NAkB= (3/2)R, where NA is the Avogadro constant and R is the gas constant. Since R ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K), equipartition predicts that the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is roughly 3cal/(mol·K). This prediction is confirmed by experiment.|$|E
