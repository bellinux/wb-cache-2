6000|$|MY DEAR HARRY,--It really {{seems more}} than an age since I saw you. [...] Your last epistle, written in the {{perturbation}} of mind consequent upon [...] being doomed to spend another winter at York Fort, reached me only a [...] few days ago, and filled me with pleasant recollections of other days. [...] Oh! man, how much I wish that you were with me in this beautiful [...] country! You are aware that I have been what they call [...] "roughing it" [...] since you and I parted {{on the shores of}} Lake Winnipeg; but, my dear [...] fellow, the idea that most people have of what that phrase means is a [...] very erroneous one indeed. [...] "Roughing it" [...] I certainly have been, [...] inasmuch as I have been living on rough fare, associating with rough [...] men, and sleeping on rough beds under the starry sky; but I assure you [...] that all this is not half so rough upon the constitution as what they [...] call leading an easy life, which is simply a life that makes a poor [...] fellow stagnate, body and spirit, till the one comes to be unable to [...] digest its food, and the other incompetent to jump at so much as half [...] an idea. Anything but an easy life, to my mind. Ah! there's nothing [...] like roughing it, Harry, my boy. Why, I am thriving on it--growing [...] like a young walrus, eating like a Canadian voyageur, and sleeping [...] like a top! This is a splendid country for sport, and as our [...] bourgeois [the gentleman in charge of an establishment is always [...] designated the bourgeois] has taken it into his head that I am a good [...] hand at making friends with the Indians, he has sent me out on several [...] expeditions, and afforded me some famous opportunities of seeing life [...] among the redskins. There is a talk just now of establishing a new [...] outpost in this district, so if I succeed in persuading the governor [...] to let me accompany the party, I shall have something interesting to [...] write about in my next letter. By the way, I wrote to you a month [...] ago, by two Indians who {{said they were going to}} the missionary station [...] at Norway House. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> it? There is a hunter here just [...] now who goes by the name of Jacques Caradoc. He is a first-rater--can [...] do anything, in a wild way, that lies within the power of mortal man, [...] and is an inexhaustible anecdote-teller, in a quiet way. He and I [...] have been out buffalo-hunting two or three times, and it would have [...] done your heart good, Harry, my dear boy, to have seen us scouring [...] over the prairie together on two big-boned Indian horses--regular [...] trained buffalo-runners, that didn't need the spur to urge, nor the [...] rein to guide them, when once they caught sight of the black cattle, [...] and kept a sharp look-out for badger-holes, just as if they had been [...] reasonable creatures. The first time I went out I had several rather [...] ugly falls, owing to my inexperience. The fact is, that if a man has [...] never run buffaloes before, he's sure to get one or two upsets, no [...] matter how good a horseman he may be. And that monster Jacques, [...] although he's the best fellow I ever met with for a hunting companion, [...] always took occasion to grin at my mishaps, and gravely to read me a [...] lecture to the effect that they were all owing to my own clumsiness or [...] stupidity; which, you will acknowledge, was not calculated to restore [...] my equanimity.|$|E

40|$|Introduction and aim: Tinnitus is {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting approximately 20 % of the older population. There is increasing evidence that changes in the central auditory system following cochlear malfunctioning are responsible for tinnitus. To date, few investigators have studied the influence of genetic factors on tinnitus. The present report investigates {{the presence of a}} familial effect in tinnitus subjects. Methods: In a European multicentre study, 198 families were recruited in seven European countries. Each family had at least 3 siblings. Subjects were screened for causes of hearing loss other than presbyacusis by clinical examination and a questionnaire. The presence of tinnitus was evaluated with the question "Nowadays, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> noises in your head or ear (tinnitus) which usually last longer than five minutes". Familial aggregation was tested using three methods: a mixed model approach, calculating familial correlations, and estimating the risk of a subject having tinnitus if the disorder is present in another family member. Results: All methods demonstrated a significant familial effect for tinnitus. The effect persisted after correction for the effect of other risk factors such as hearing loss, gender and age. The size of the familial effect is smaller than that for age-related hearing impairment, with a familial correlation of 0. 15. Conclusion: The presence of a familial effect for tinnitus opens the door to specific studies that can determine whether this effect is due to a shared familial environment or the involvement of genetic factors. Subsequent association studies may result in the identification of the factors responsible. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on the effect of role models in the treatment of tinnitus...|$|R

5000|$|It {{has always}} been assumed that our pairing was based on his (Nitzsches) Spector accomplishments, but to me that was secondary. In the {{beginning}} I saw Mink DeVille as a hard-edged rock and roll band, and I wanted the Nitzsche whod produced [...] "Memo from Turner" [...] (off the Performance soundtrack) and the great first Crazy Horse album... How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> Jack Nitzsche? Elliott Murphy later asked me incredulously. I {{tried to get him}} for years. The sad truth is that it took one phone call, and even that was sheer luck - or maybe divine providence. I mentioned my mission while chatting with friend and Del Shannon manager Dan Bourgoise, who responded Jack? I can put you in touch with him. Two days later the elusive producer was sitting in my office. I put on a live recording and after the first song, the bands version of Otis Reddings These Arms of Mine, Nitzsche motioned for me to stop the tape. When do we start? he said. They had him. And that was the whole of it, plain and simple. I didnt get Jack Nitzsche. The voice of Willy DeVille did.|$|E

40|$|Translation begins] Saturday My Darling, How are you, honey. I’m so lonesome. Gee- {{every single}} day I miss you more and more. Well, in fifteen more days, we’ll be married, honey. Golly, two weeks from tomorrow. Times getting closer. Well, honey it’s about two hours since I began writing this. Since then I’ve washed my hair and just wasted time in general. Just think 15 more days! Golly, it isn’t very long but it seems years. Tomorrow Gilly + I {{are going to the}} ice show. Oh before I forget- I finally found a negligee. It’s white + half sorta see throughish. Hope you like it, honey. Gee, I haven’t done a thing. Should be rushing around getting things all ready so that I can take it easy the last few days but I just can’t do that. Have to leave almost {{everything}} til the last minute and then rush madly around. That’s a very bad habit of mine. One of many. You should be very thankful that you’re not a girl, honey. Everything happens to us. Oh, honey, every place I go they try to sell me nightgowns. It’s very discouraging. I keep telling them I want pajamas + they smile or rather smurk [sic] knowingly and say you’ll change your mind. Just wait and see- I’ll show ‘em. Everytime I go to New York + plan to get loads of things I come home with one small purchase. How many more trips can I make. Let’s see, what was there I meant to tell you. Oh, yes- got two letters from you today. You’re so sweet, darling. Where are they, oh, yes just a sec- I’ll answer the first one first. Oh, you reminded me. The sunny south musn’t [sic] forget my rain coat. Must also remember to see “Tonight And Every Night”. Haven’t heard anything about it but if you say it’s hot, it sure must be! I like it to rain because then you can write. Golly, probably after we’re married I’ll turn into a regular rain worshipper. Pray for it everyday. I say old top, some British joker could get away with that technique but it’s not your type. What kind of results are you trying to get? Huh? I kinda like the old way better. I’m half asleep, too, honey so if this sounds extra dippy that’s why. When did this “twenty –mission” rush come in? I always thought it was “fifty-mission” rush. Why didn’t you try jumping on them honey? Oh, you saw “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”, didn’t you? Well, do you wear those leather jackets often? I like them- you’d look real sharp in one. Gee, honey, I love you- only 15 more days. That sounds so long in a way but not long at all in another way. I hope that you finish flying soon, darling. What will happen if you finish sooner? Will they give you Friday and Saturday off, do you think? I hope we can be together for a while before we’re married. Mother said to send her love! Golly, Bobbie is probably in Texas now. I wish I were down in Moultrie now with you. How are instruments, honey? Hope they’re not too hard. They sound awful! You have 10 : 15 more hours, don’t you. I’ll be glad when you’re through. You should be calling me any day now. In about five more days to let me know what you’ll be. Gee, Oh- I almost forgot, honey- Hilda is going to bring a movie camera down and take movies of the wedding. Won’t that be wonderful! I’m so happy. I’ve always wanted to have movies taken of my wedding. You’ll look marvelous in movies. I love you so much. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> so handsome, darling? You’re too good looking for one man. (not for a woman, though). Gee, it will be marvelous to see you again. Well, darling, this wasn’t very long but I’ve been interrupted more times. It’s taken six hours to write this. I’ll write again tomorrow, honey. I love you more than anything else in the world. Can hardly wait to see you again. I love you so.

40|$|Translation begins] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Friday 2030 My Darling, What a day, what a weatherman. I {{told you}} it would be clear today gosh I was right for once, I can’t get over it. Well at last, honey, I got in two hours of {{instruments}} today. Two solid hours or gazin’ at the gages but now I have 4 : 45 of instruments, 7 : 15 to go! I ought to get my check around the ninth hour. It was a beautiful day today. One of those days when there’s not a cloud in the sky that’s as blue as your eyes baby. I’m so glad you quit that damn job honey. Not only because of you, but now you can write more often as you said. Selfish ain’t I? But it’s so good to hear from you, especially when we don’t fly and we’re all sitting around jumping down each other’s throats. We’ve been {{like a bunch of}} doomed men this week. I guess no matter how soft or hard we pilots pretend to be, we love one thing way down deep, the air- flying. We’re all like a bunch of fish out of water when we’re weathered in. Especially me. Yeah, waddya know about that, the gin mills closing at 12. Gosh I’ll have to do some concentrated guzzling now. But as far as the jovial places of entertainment around here one concerned, they shouldn’t even bother to open them. Say honey, find out what tube you need for your radio, the number of it and type. I {{might be able to get}} it for you through A. C. S. (Air Corps Supply). You can get everything from Brassieres to B- 29 ’s through that outfit! Well how did you like “The Ideal Marriage”? Learn anything new? Honey, a bottle of scotch and you is all I want for graduation. You’re very sweet to want to give me an identification bracelet darling. I will have to have a now one anyhow because mine now has my serial number on it, and I get a new one when I graduate, (a new serial number). <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> your bracelet engraved? If so how much was it and what did you have put on it? I think you’ve already told me, but I must have forgotten. Sarong like pajamas man that sounds terrific! Gosh baby, time sure is draggin! I’d like to see you trying to buy that night gown with the buttons down the front. I’ll bet you get some queer looks. I like pajamas though, believe it or not! What do you mean you take a lousey [sic] picture. The only ones of you that aren’t good are ones where you’re not smiling, because you were meant to smile darling. Don’t ask me why my address was changed. This whole filed is screwed up. Everytime we go to the line we’re a new squadron. Today were 4 -G, tomorrow God only knows. I fly tomorrow, shoot skeet in the afternoon, and will probably be up half the night, as Base Operations has got something planned for then. No open Post, as usual. I plan to get a special pass next week to get the rings. Honey if I knew how they picked 2 nd Lieutenants out of these mad cadets I’d be a millionaire, or a General. They’re alot [sic] of surprises when that list goes up. Sometimes it seems like they pull the names out of a fish bowl. As for me, I don’t care all I want are the wings. I haven’t seen “To Have and Have Not” yet. But I plan to as soon as it gets here. It looks terrific so does Lauren Bacall. Gee it’s wonderful to be in love. For the first time I know that it’s real. Darling, I’ll go on loving you always, with all my heart and soul. Goodnight angel, fifteen more days and I’ll be able to kiss you goodnight. But until then darling, I think of you every minute. I love you, so deeply that sometimes it hurts. You have all my love and devotion- Always Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
