500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E

If he could have O'Connor Power at his elbow continually {{it would be a good}} thing, as Power understands the necessities of agitation, and Parnell doesn't. I hope he will make a good fist of his answer to Butt, though I have never been persuaded that he shines as a letter-writer. Dan Crilly told me Parnell's first contribution to the Liverpool Argus (mentioned in my London letter) was not worth much, and though he promised to insert it, he has failed me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Angus {{returned}} to Australia while Julia {{spent the rest}} of a year travelling. Julia later recalled, [...] " [...] was writing amazing songs ... had shown me how to play guitar in Bolivia, and those songs had gotten me through that year". She elaborated [...] "At that time the guitar was a new thing for me. I'd just bought it because I wanted to start learning. So we're {{in the middle of the}} jungle in Chalalan with this guitar and Angus was playing us these songs he'd been writing. I hadn't really been around him that much for the last couple of years – once I finished school <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> with my boyfriend and Angus was off surfing and skating – and all of a sudden we're in the middle of the jungle and he's singing these songs that are so beautiful so I asked him to teach me some songs and that was the start of learning guitar and our friendship, I suppose, and the start of us having this amazing experience".|$|E

60|$|But metaphor, however poetic, never slaked a dry throat. To enjoy Caprona's romantic {{suggestions}} we {{must have}} water, and so we came in close, always sounding, and skirted the shore.

We had not as yet really commenced to suffer for lack of water; but I {{knew that it would}} not be long before we did, and so at the first streak of dawn <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> again and once more took up the hopeless survey of the forbidding coast.|$|E

Next year quite a little squad o' truck farmers moved into the bend just below, an' we got together and talked it over and agreed to stand by. We planted two more o' them, and they got one on us.

60|$|I {{have not}} often enjoyed a place more deeply. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> an {{atmosphere}} of pleasure, and felt light and quiet and content. But perhaps {{it was not the}} place alone that so disposed my spirit. Perhaps some one was thinking of me in another country; or perhaps some thought of my own had come and gone unnoticed, and yet done me good. For some thoughts, which sure would be the most beautiful, vanish before we can rightly scan their features; as though a god, travelling by our green highways, should but ope the door, give one smiling look into the house, and go again for ever. Was it Apollo, or Mercury, or Love with folded wings? Who shall say? But we go the lighter about our business, and feel peace and pleasure in our hearts.|$|E
6000|$|The {{night was}} not so {{pleasant}} as the evening, for it got chilly; and being put between two gentlemen (the rough-faced one and another) to prevent my tumbling off the coach, I was nearly smothered by their falling asleep, and completely blocking me up. They squeezed me so hard sometimes, that I could not help crying out, 'Oh! If you please!'--which they didn't like at all, because it woke them. Opposite me was an elderly lady in a great fur cloak, who looked in the dark more like a haystack than a lady, she was wrapped up to such a degree. This lady had a basket with her, and she hadn't known {{what to do with}} it, for a long time, until she found that on account of my legs being short, it could go underneath me. It cramped and hurt me so, that it made me perfectly miserable; but if <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the least, and made a glass that was in the basket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave me the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, 'Come, don't YOU fidget. YOUR bones are young enough, I'm sure!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Shall I {{make up the}} fire?” [...] . I waited. “Do {{you hear}} me?” She made no sound and {{with the tip of}} my finger I touched her bare shoulder. But for its {{elasticity}} it might have been frozen. At once I looked round for the fur coat; {{it seemed to me that}} there was not a moment to lose if she was to be saved, as though we had been lost on an Arctic plain. I had to put her arms into the sleeves, myself, one after another. They were cold, lifeless, but flexible. Then <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> front of her and buttoned the thing close round her throat. To do that I had actually to raise her chin with my finger, and it sank slowly down again. I buttoned all the other buttons right down to the ground. It was a very long and splendid fur. Before rising from my kneeling position I felt her feet. Mere ice. The intimacy of this sort of attendance helped the growth of my authority. “Lie down,” I murmured, “I shall pile on you every blanket I can find here,” but she only shook her head.|$|E

60|$|The Bricklayer's bunk {{was better}} than mine. Less sea water leaked down through the deck into it, and the light was better for lying in bed and reading. Partly for this reason I {{proceeded}} to move into his bunk. My other reason was pride. I saw the sailors were superstitious, and by this act I determined to show that I was braver than they. I would cap my proved equality by a deed that would compel their recognition of my superiority. Oh, the arrogance of youth! But let that pass. The sailors were appalled by my intention. One and all, they warned me that {{in the history of}} the sea no man had taken a dead man's bunk and lived to the end of the voyage. They instanced case after case in their personal experience. I was obdurate. Then they begged and pleaded with me, and my pride was tickled in that they showed they really liked me and were concerned about me. This but served to confirm me in my madness. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in,</b> and, lying in the dead man's bunk, all afternoon and evening listened to dire prophecies of my future. Also were told stories of awful deaths and gruesome ghosts that secretly shivered the hearts of all of us. Saturated with this, yet scoffing at it, I rolled over at the end of the second dog-watch and went to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "To confess repentance," [...] he said slowly, [...] "would be {{to confess}} to a monstrous crime. Don't you see that? Oh, monsieur, have {{patience}} with me; let me explain myself a little. You say that I am in part responsible for something of all this that has happened. My exhortations {{of the people at}} Rennes and twice afterwards at Nantes are said to have had their share in what followed there. It may be so. It would be beyond my power positively to deny it. Revolution followed and bloodshed. More may yet come. To repent implies a recognition that I have done wrong. How shall I say that I have done wrong, and thus take a share of the responsibility for all that blood upon my soul? I will be quite frank with you to show you how far, indeed, I am from repentance. What I did, I actually did against all my convictions at the time. Because there was no justice in France to move against the murderer of Philippe de Vilmorin, <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the only way that I imagined could make the evil done recoil upon the hand that did it, and those other hands that had the power but not the spirit to punish. Since then I have come to see that I was wrong, and that Philippe de Vilmorin and those who thought with him were in the right.|$|E
60|$|Long {{before getting}} your most {{excellent}} letter of Feb. 21st I had been pricked with shame and remorse at my long silence; you may imagine then how this pang sharpened when, {{three or four}} days ago, that letter arrived. There were all sorts of reasons for my silence which I won't take up time now with narrating--further than to say that they were not reasons of misfortune or discomfort--but only of other-engagement-and-occupation pressure--connected with arrears of writing, consumption of time in furnishing and preparing my new habitation, and the constant old story of London interruptions and distractions. Thank God I am out of them far more now than I have ever been before--in my chaste and secluded Kensington quatrième. <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> here definitely only three days ago, and am still rather upside down. The place is excellent in every respect, improves on acquaintance every hour and is, in particular, flooded with light like a photographer's studio. I commune with the unobstructed sky and have an immense bird's-eye view of housetops and streets. My rooms are very pretty as well as very convenient, and will be more so when little by little I have got more things. When I have time I will make you a diagram, and later, when the drawing-room (or library: meantime I have a smaller sitting-room in order) is furnished (I have nothing for it yet), I shall have the place photographed. I shall do far better work here than I have ever done before.|$|E
