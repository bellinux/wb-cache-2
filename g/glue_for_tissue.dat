40|$|Background: Due to {{technological}} improvements, {{the use of}} <b>tissue</b> adhesives and <b>glues</b> <b>for</b> <b>tissue</b> approximation and hemostasis {{in surgery}} has increased. We report our preliminary experience with thistechnol ogy in pediatric endosurgery. Methods: Between 1997 and 2000, we employed tissue adhesives in 48 pediatric patients during laparoscopic procedures. In 25 patients, the <b>glue</b> was adopted <b>for</b> the hemostasis of parenchimal organs (liver in 24 cases and spleen in one). In three cases, the glue was used to repair organ perforation, in 19 {{it was used to}} close the distal part of a patent processus vaginalis in case of congenital inguinal hernia. In the final case, the glue was adopted to achieve optimal airtightness in case of pulmonary biopsy. The glue was injected {{with the aid of a}} needle positioned transparietally. Results: The procedure was easy and rapid in all cases, and there were no problemsor complications related to glue positioning at a mean follow up of 51 months. Conclusion: Tissue adhesives are a very versatile product for use in pediatric laparoscopic surgery. It is likely that their usage will increase as the technology improves and more effective productsare developed...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the {{development}} of novel adhesives <b>for</b> biological soft <b>tissue</b> adhesion has gained significant interest. Such adhesives should be non-toxic and biocompatible. In this study, we synthesized a novel solid adhesive using nanostructured hydroxyapatite (HAp) and evaluated its physical adhesion properties through in vitro testing with synthetic hydrogels and mouse soft tissues. The results revealed that HAp-nanoparticle dispersions and HAp-nanoparticle-assembled nanoporous plates showed efficient adhesion to hydrogels. Interestingly, the HAp plates showed different adhesive properties depending upon the shape of their nanoparticles. The HAp plate made up of 17 nm-sized nanoparticles showed an adhesive strength 2. 2 times {{higher than that of}} the conventional fibrin <b>glue</b> <b>for</b> mouse skin <b>tissues...</b>|$|R
30|$|The use of {{biomaterials}} dates {{far back}} to ancient civilizations. Artificial eyes, ears, teeth, and noses {{were found on}} Egyptian mummies [1, 2]. Waxes, <b>glues,</b> and <b>tissues</b> <b>for</b> {{the restoration of the}} missing or malfunctioning parts of the body were used by the Chinese and Indians. Over the centuries, developments in synthetic materials, surgical techniques, and sterilization methods have permitted the use of biomaterials in many ways [2, 3]. Nowadays, a large number of devices and implants are used as a medical practice. Biomaterials in the form of implants (ligaments, vascular grafts, heart valves, intraocular lenses, dental implants, etc.) and medical devices (pacemakers, biosensors, artificial hearts, etc.) are extensively used to replace and/or restore the function of disturbed or deteriorated tissues or organs, and thus {{improve the quality of life}} of the patients.|$|R
40|$|Menisci {{are crucial}} {{structures}} in the knee joint as they play important functions in load transfer, maintaining joint stability and in homeostasis of articular cartilage. Unfortunately, ones {{of the most frequently}} occurring knee injuries are meniscal tears. Particularly tears in the avascular zone of the meniscus usually do not heal spontaneously and lead to pain, swelling and locking of the knee joint. Eventually, after a (partial) meniscectomy, they will lead to osteoarthritis. Current treatment modalities to repair tears and by that restore the integrity of the native meniscus still carry their drawbacks and a new robust solution is desired. A strong tissue adhesive could provide such a solution and could potentially improve on sutures, which are the current gold standard. Moreover, a glue could serve as a carrier for biological compounds known to enhance tissue healing. Only few tissue adhesives, e. g., Dermabond (R) and fibrin glue, are already successfully used in clinical practice for other applications, but are not considered suitable <b>for</b> <b>gluing</b> meniscus <b>tissue</b> due to their suboptimal mechanical properties or toxicity. There is a growing interest and research field focusing on the development of novel polymer-based tissue adhesives, but up to now, there is no material specially designed for the repair of meniscal tears. In this review, we discuss the current clinical gold standard treatment of meniscal tears and present an overview of new developments in this field. Moreover, we discuss the properties of different <b>tissue</b> adhesives <b>for</b> their potential use in meniscal tear repair. Finally, we formulate recommendations regarding the design criteria of material properties and adhesive strength <b>for</b> clinically applicable <b>glues</b> <b>for</b> meniscal tears...|$|R
