5|$|Prior to {{announcing his}} {{campaign}} for governor, Wolf submitted an inquiry to the Massachusetts Ethics Commission as a precaution {{there would be no}} conflict of interest. However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of the company did create a conflict because Cape Air had ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign from the Senate and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel all contracts between Cape Air and MassPort. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> supporters, explaining that departing his company or canceling contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign from the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Nineteenth-century sources {{refer to}} Palestine as {{extending}} from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley. Others {{refer to it as}} {{extending from the}} sea to the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem.

5|$|When the Cuban Missile Crisis {{erupted in}} October 1962, Kennedy {{chose not to}} consult with Diefenbaker before making {{decisions}} on what actions to take. The US President sent former Ambassador Merchant to Ottawa to inform the Prime Minister as {{to the content of}} the speech that Kennedy was to make on television. Diefenbaker was upset at both the lack of consultation {{and the fact that he}} was given less than two hours advance word. He was angered again when the US government released a statement stating that it had Canada's full support. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> the Commons, Diefenbaker proposed sending representatives of neutral nations to Cuba to verify the American allegations, which Washington took to mean that he was questioning Kennedy's word. When American forces went to a heightened alert, DEFCON 3, Diefenbaker was slow to order Canadian forces to match it. Harkness and the Chiefs of Staff had Canadian forces clandestinely go to that alert status anyway, and Diefenbaker eventually authorized it. The crisis ended without war, and polls found that Kennedy's actions were widely supported by Canadians. Diefenbaker was severely criticized in the media.|$|E

25|$|The Russian {{government}} initially issued categorical denials of {{any involvement}} in the U.S. presidential election.

When a new intelligence report surfaced in December 2016, Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Minister of Russia, rejected the accusations again. When ABC News wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin was {{directly involved in the}} covert operation, Peskov called this report garbage. On December 16, 2016, Peskov called on the U.S. government to cease discussion of the topic unless they provide evidence to back up their assertions. According to The New Yorker, a pro-Kremlin MP justified the Russian attacks as a possible counterpunch to U.S. interference in foreign elections via color revolutions.|$|E

In the report, he mentioned Unomásuno, Diario Amanecer, and Aerolineas Amanecer, but gave no mention to his investment group Valgo Grupo de Inversión. He stated that it was likely that Mexican officials wanted to censor Unomásunos anti-organized crime publications by providing U.S. officials with false information to link them to drug trafficking and thereby discredit their information. He concluded his statement by saying that he was open to sharing information on his businesses because the accusations affected his integrity.|$|E

25|$|Fr. Giovanni Zucca from Murialdo, who {{was then}} the {{chaplain}} at Murialdo when Dominic was five years old, notes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> John Bosco that he came to notice Dominic due to his regular church attendance with his mother, and his habit of kneeling down outside the church to pray (even in the mud or snow) if he happened to come to Church before it had been unlocked in the morning. The chaplain also notes that Savio made good progress at the village school not merely due to his cleverness, but also by working hard. He would not join the other boys in doing something that he believed to be morally wrong and would explain why he thought a particular deed was wrong. At the age of five, he learned to serve Mass, and would try to participate at Mass every day as well as go regularly to Confession. Having been permitted to make his First Communion at an early age, he had much reverence for the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|South East Asian LCC AirAsia {{plans to}} {{establish}} a new budget airline in Vietnam in a joint venture with Vietnamese partners, AirAsia announced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> <b>to</b> the Malaysia Stock Exchange on 31 March 2017. The new Vietnamese LCC is expected to commence its operations by early 2018. The company said that the new joint venture has been signed by its wholly owned subsidiary AirAsia Investment Limited (AAIL) with Vietnam’s Gumin Company Limited (Gumin), a businessman Tran Trong Kien and Hai Au Aviation Joint Stock Company (JV Co) on 30 March 2017. Gumin will own around 69.99% of the new LCC, AirAsia will have 30% and Tran will own the rest. According to AirAsia, the new venture will need investments of VND 1 trillion ($44 million), and the Kuala Lumpur-based company will contribute 30% of that after raising internal funding. AirAsia said that Vietnam’s geographical location provides the foundation and support for the joint venture’s plans to operate domestic and international underserved routes focusing primarily in providing connectivity domestically into key cities in Vietnam as well as internationally to ASEAN, China, Korea and Japan from 3 major hubs namely Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi and Da Nang. Vietnam is also the 5th largest aviation market in South East Asia after Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. It was the fastest growing aviation market both in the world and in South East Asia in 2015 and 2016. In terms of passenger carriage (domestic and international), Vietnam’s air travel passenger carriage in 2016 was 52 million, with its growth dwarfing its ASEAN peers’, charting approximately 28% year-over-year growth in 2016 vis-à-vis its ASEAN peer’s average growth of approximately 10%. Vietnam’s domestic and international market has also doubled in size since 2013 and 2011 respectively. Domestic passenger growth in 2016 was approximately 25% while international growth was over 30%. With the plan, AirAsia will enter the competitive market of airlines’ industry in Vietnam and challenge the current LCC players – VietJet and Jetstar Pacific.|$|E
