25|$|However, {{hydraulic}} oils {{and the majority}} of oils that have degraded to any extent will also have a soluble or <b>emulsified</b> component that will require further treatment to eliminate. Dissolving or emulsifying oil using surfactants or solvents usually exacerbates the problem rather than solving it, producing wastewater that is more difficult to treat.|$|E

25|$|Egg {{emulsion}} sauces include mayonnaise, Hollandaise and Béarnaise. For hollandaise sauce, {{egg yolks}} and water, lemon juice or vinegar are <b>emulsified.</b> Unlike custard, the egg does not coagulate. An emulsion {{is a mixture}} of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Droplets of the butter become suspended in the water and lemon juice once emulsion occurs. While emulsions can be either stable or unstable, hollandaise is made stable by the addition of eggs which contain lecithin, combining with the oil and water, holding it together.|$|E
25|$|Sonication is an {{efficient}} {{tool for the}} synthesis of polymers. The cavitational shear forces, which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the molecular weight and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and <b>emulsified,</b> so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that ultrasound increases the rate of polymerisation over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. Ormosils (organically modified silicate) are obtained when silane is added to gel-derived silica during sol-gel process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher density than classic gels {{as well as an}} improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased degree of polymerization.|$|E

Nanodispersion of polymeric particles prepared by the emulsion-solvent distribution method was concentrated by using a novel method of facilitated dialysis. The concentration of dispersion by this method {{is influenced by the}} selection of <b>emulsifying</b> agent and stabilizer, its concentration, and by the quantity of superabsorption polyacrylate copolymer and its arrangement in the dialysis tubings.

A turbidimetric technique was used and the absorbance value at 500 nm was then directly used as the <b>emulsifying</b> activity index. The results obtained con"rmed the good <b>emulsifying</b> activity of this protein fraction of the whey and demonstrated the considerable in#uence of the concentration on the capacity of the proteose-peptones to stabilize a model oil-in-water emulsion.

25|$|For {{large-scale}} {{preparation of}} mayonnaise where mixing equipment is being employed, the process typically {{begins with the}} dispersal of eggs, either powdered or liquid, into water. Once <b>emulsified,</b> the remaining ingredients are then added and vigorously mixed until completely hydrated and evenly dispersed. Oil is then added as rapidly {{as it can be}} absorbed. Though {{only a small part of}} the total, ingredients other than the oil are critical to proper formulation. These must be totally hydrated and dispersed within a small liquid volume, which can cause difficulties including emulsion breakdown during the oil-adding phase. Often, a long agitation process is required to achieve proper dispersal/emulsification, presenting one of the trickiest phases of the production process. Though, as technology in the food industry advances, processing has been shortened drastically, allowing roughly 1000 liters to be produced in 10 minutes.|$|E

40|$|The {{mannoprotein}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, baker's yeast, is an <b>emulsifying</b> agent {{which could}} be used in foods and cosmetics. This glycoprotein emulsifier can be extracted simply with very good yield by autoclaving yeast cells in neutral buffer.

Components of the heat extracted material with greatest <b>emulsifying</b> activity included a high molecular weight fraction ($>$ 200 kDa) which provided viscous and durable emulsions, and a low molecular weight fraction ($<$ 14 kDA) which was very surface active and readily generated nonviscous emulsions. Mannoprotein and the small molecule surfactants lecithin and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide interacted synergistically to increase <b>emulsifying</b> activity at a weight ratio of 100 : 1 mannoprotein to surfactant.
