5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage <b>is</b> <b>fresh,</b> the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E

25|$|The fish lacks scale, has {{few small}} bones, and the spine {{separates}} easily from the flesh, {{so that they}} are usually poached or broiled whole, or just with the head off.

25|$|White ginseng <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> ginseng {{which has}} been dried without being heated. It is peeled and dried to reduce the water content to 12% or less.

Drying in the sun bleaches the root to a yellowish-white color.|$|E
25|$|Utricularia {{can survive}} almost {{anywhere}} where there <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> water {{for at least}} part of the year; only Antarctica and some oceanic islands have no native species. The greatest species diversity for the genus is seen in South America, with Australia coming a close second. In common with most carnivorous plants, they grow in moist soils which are poor in dissolved minerals, where their carnivorous nature gives them a competitive advantage; terrestrial varieties of Utricularia can frequently be found alongside representatives of the carnivorous generaSarracenia, Drosera and othersin very wet areas where continuously moving water removes most soluble minerals from the soil.|$|E

25|$|Umlikaaq (or Umlikaq ~ Umlikqaq) or Ungllekaq (ungllik'ar in Nunivak Cup'ig) <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> boiled fish. All {{parts of}} the fish except for the {{entrails}} are used to prepare umlikqaq. Fresh fish that have been dead {{for less than a}} day make the best umlikqaq because the meat is still firm. If a freshwater fish is caught with a hook, it is best to kill the fish by hitting its head soon after capture so the meat will stay firm for cooking. The main ingredients of umlikqaq are cut-up fish, water, and salt which are boiled for about 29 minutes. This is a preferred food for elders because it easy to make and is not strongly seasoned. First heads are good prepared as umlikqaq. Also, Ungelkaaq is fish steak cut transversely.|$|E
25|$|Assaliaq (assaliq; lit. «fried thing»; also, pancake; other fried food; fry bread) <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> fried fish. All {{parts of}} the fish except the {{entrails}} are used to prepare this dish, although often the heads are removed as well. The fish is filleted, dipped in seasoned flour, or just seasoned with salt, and fried in oil. If households enjoy picking and sucking backbones or only a few fish are available, the backbone will be fried along with the filleted pieces. Heads are sometimes fried for the same reasons. Boiled rice is the favorite side dish with this meal. Middle aged and younger people enjoy this meal for the flavor. The verb assali- (to fry; to make pancakes or griddlecakes) is derived from Russian жа́рить (zhárit’) ‘to roast, fry, broil, grill’.|$|E
25|$|The Ambaji Fair {{is held in}} the Hindu {{month of}} Bhadrapad (around August–September) at Ambaji, during a time which is {{particularly}} suitable for farmers, when the busy monsoon season is about to end. The Bhadrapad fair is held at Ambaji {{which is in the}} Danta Taluka of Banaskantha district, near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway. Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45km away), Palanpur (65km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air <b>is</b> <b>fresh.</b> About 1.5million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, whilst some Muslims attend the fair for trade.|$|E

25|$|The {{volume of}} air that moves {{in or out}} (at the nose or mouth) during a single {{breathing}} cycle is called the tidal volume. In a resting adult human it is about 500ml per breath. At the end of exhalation the airways contain about 150ml of alveolar air {{which is the first}} air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation. This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350ml (500ml - 150ml = 350ml) <b>is</b> <b>fresh</b> warm and moistened air. Since this 350ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after normal exhalation (i.e. the functional residual capacity of about 2.5–3.0liters), {{it is clear that the}} composition of the alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14kPa (about 100mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21kPa (or 160mmHg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04kPa (or 0.3mmHg).|$|E
