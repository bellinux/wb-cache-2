5|$|The 2012 {{national}} {{report of}} the First Nations Regional Health Study found that of respondents who attended residential schools {{were more likely than}} those who did not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with at least one chronic medical condition. A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with posttraumatic stress disorder; 21% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with major depression; 7% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with anxiety disorder; and 7% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with borderline personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{risk factor}} for pancreatic cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset diabetes may also be an early sign of the disease. People who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with Type2 diabetes for longer than ten years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with non-diabetics.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance}} of getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

25|$|Descriptive {{experience}} sampling (DES), {{developed by}} psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an idiographic method {{that is used}} to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with common psychiatric diseases.|$|E

30|$|Other {{gynecologic}} problems <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{during both}} procedures.

Pelvic adhesions, affecting the free mobility of both tubes and ovaries, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> managed in seven women during OMLOD and in ten during LOD. Abnormally situated ovaries with disturbed tubo-ovarian relationship <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in two cases during OMLOD and in three women during LOD. All the gynecologic problems <b>had</b> <b>been</b> laparoscopically managed without {{a difference between}} the two procedures.

25|$|At {{this point}} in time, ESCO2 is the only known gene to cause Roberts {{syndrome}} mutations. Also, all individuals that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with Roberts syndrome by cytogenetic techniques have also had ESCO2 mutations.

25|$|Small {{intestinal}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} occurs with greater frequency {{in patients who}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with IBS compared to healthy controls. SIBO is most common in diarrhea-predominate IBS but also occurs in constipation-predominant IBS more frequently than healthy controls. Symptoms of SIBO include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation among others. IBS {{may be the result}} of the immune system interacting abnormally with gut microbiota resulting in an abnormal cytokine signalling profile.|$|E
25|$|The facial {{features}} of 1p36 deletion syndrome {{have been considered}} to be characteristic, although few patients <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{solely on the basis}} of facial appearance.

Distinguishing features in another study were a large or late-closing anterior fontanelle (up to 85% of patients) and facial asymmetry.|$|E
