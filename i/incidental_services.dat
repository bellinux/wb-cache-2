40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In fiscal year 2005, prime vendor sales accounted for approximately $ 9 billion of the Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) total sales and service of $ 32 billion. Under the prime vendor concept, the Department of Defense (DOD) relies on a distributor of a commercial product line, who provides that product line and <b>incidental</b> <b>services</b> to customers in an assigned region or area of responsibility. Products or services are to be delivered within a specified period of time after order placement. Since 1991, we have identified the use of prime vendors as a best commercial practice for inventory management. Nonetheless, media reports in October 2005, and a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee on November 9, 2005, raised concerns {{about the use of}} the prime vendor concept and the prices that DLA was paying for items acquired through a prime vendor. The use of prime vendor contracts is governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. DLA manages the program and the Director of DLA reports to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics through the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness. The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), a field activity of DLA, is the lead center for managing four major commodities: medical materiel; subsistence/garrison feeding; construction and equipment; and clothing and textiles. It is also responsible for managing DOD's prime vendor contracts within those commodities. In 1992, we identified DOD's contract management as one of our high-risk areas, and it remains so today. One of the key reasons the area is high risk is because DOD does not provide adequate oversight over defense contracts. One aspect of oversight is to ensure that the government is obtaining fair and reasonable contract prices through such means as conducting price reviews. In addition, management oversight can also assure that steps are taken to determine that prices agreed to at contract award are fair and reasonable. For the purposes of this report, we are defining a pricing review as either a determination of price reasonableness for items added after the initial contract award, or a postaward verification that any invoiced price is not in excess of the price stipulated in the contract. Under the authority of the Comptroller General, we initiated a review of DOD's prime vendor concept to determine (1) the extent to which DLA has conducted pricing reviews for items purchased through a prime vendor, and (2) the extent to which DLA has addressed the pricing issues identified at the November 2005 hearing. Under the authority of the Comptroller General, we initiated a review of DOD's prime vendor concept to determine (1) the extent to which DLA has conducted pricing reviews for items purchased through a prime vendor, and (2) the extent to which DLA has addressed the pricing issues identified at the November 2005 hearing. ...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) operates a worldwide supply system, with {{the vast majority of}} the items being managed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Media reports in October 2005 raised concerns about the use of the prime vendor concept and the prices that DLA was paying for items acquired through a prime vendor, and the House Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the matter on November 9, 2005. As a result of the hearing, DLA officials recognized the need to improve management oversight and internal controls over the program, and they proposed a series of corrective actions. Under the prime vendor concept, DOD relies on a distributor of a commercial product line, who provides that product line and <b>incidental</b> <b>services</b> to customers in an assigned region or area of responsibility. Products or services are to be delivered within a specified period of time after order placement. The prime vendor provides the product either at the cost paid to obtain it or at a price agreed upon in advance with DLA plus a handling fee. The use of prime vendor contracts is governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. DLA manages the program and the Director of DLA reports to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics through the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness. The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), a field activity of DLA, is the lead center for managing prime vendor contracts for three major supply chains: medical materiel, subsistence/garrison feeding, and construction and equipment. In June 2006, we summarized the main findings of DLA internal reviews, and an external review conducted by the Defense Contract Management Agency at DLA's request, of DLA's prime vendor programs. The findings highlighted five deficiencies, as follows: (1) management metrics that were too narrowly focused on sales; (2) a prime vendor concept that was not suitable for all commodities; (3) a lack of management oversight; (4) inadequate pricing reviews; (5) a lack of knowledge or skills in the workforce. We also reported that DLA had experienced persistent problems in overseeing prime vendor contracts, despite the existence of oversight policies and procedures and the identification of corrective actions prior to November 2005. Those problems persisted because DLA and DSCP management had not provided the oversight needed to ensure that the policies, procedures, and corrective actions were implemented. We therefore recommended that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the Director of the DLA provide continual management oversight of the corrective actions DLA was taking to address the problems in its prime vendor program. A House Armed Services Committee report accompanying the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization bill directed GAO to review DLA's actions and submit a report to the defense committees no later than March 1, 2007. Our objective was to determine the extent to which DLA's corrective actions have addressed the main deficiencies in the prime vendor program. ...|$|E
5000|$|How {{faithful}} the Motor Corps was {{in maintaining}} its interest and activity {{to the very}} end of the war was evident from the figures for the months of March, April, May and June 1919, in which 249,568 service hours, and 759,071 service miles, were operated. Over 3,370 workers, of whom 3,240 were actively in the field, were engaged in the work, employing 2,603 passenger cars, 71 ambulances, 44 trucks and 146 other vehicles. Out of 190 active Corps, only 83, or less than half, reported statistics for this compilation, and the real total of services done was actually far greater. Except for <b>incidental</b> <b>service</b> which was rendered in connection with entertainment and recreation under Red Cross auspices at the remaining military hospitals, and for the active Home Service and Nursing Service work in the civilian field, in time of disaster or epidemic, by December 1920, the Motor Corps was mostly demobilized, retaining primarily a reserve organization to meet peace-time emergencies of civilian as well as military character.|$|R

40|$|In recent {{research}} on service quality {{it has been}} argued that the construct of behavioural intentions and its relationship with other constructs are issues which require conceptual and empirical elaboration. In this paper, we focus on the development and refinement of a scale for measuring behavioural intentions and the influence of critical service incidents on these behavioural intentions of service customers. Moreover, we seek to provide evidence for differences across service industries with regard to dimensions of service quality that customers evaluate during a critical incident. The results of an empirical study of a large sample of customers from six different service industries suggest that there exist significant cross-sectional differences in critical dimensions of service quality, thereby supporting the notion that there are service industry-specific determinants of quality. Furthermore, we identified three dimensions of behavioural intentions: customer loyalty; price tolerance; and dissatisfaction response. It was found that the influence of incident-based quality, expressed as positive or negative, on behavioural intentions does not vary significantly from industry to industry, except for the public transportation industry. Service quality is positively related to customer loyalty and price tolerance and negatively related to dissatisfaction responses of customers. However, this <b>incidental</b> <b>service</b> quality does have a moderating effect on the general perceived quality-behavioural intentions relationship: higher general quality results in higher price tolerance and a lower dissatisfaction response for positive incidents than for negative encounters. With regard to customer loyalty, this difference is not convincing...|$|R

40|$|The {{business}} logic {{in the manufacturing}} industry {{has changed in the}} 21 st century. In the current industrial market, manufacturers are driven to provide more comprehensive offerings that go beyond the traditional product-orientation by providing capacity and availability for their customers. From <b>incidental</b> merchandise, <b>services</b> have become the core of manufacturers’ offerings with long-lasting service agreements over the life-cycles of their products. This change is driven both by the need of providers to grow and gain competitive advantage and by increased customer demand caused by customers’ outsourcing trends. The three key drivers for manufacturers’ service strategies are outsourcing trends, saturation of the installed base, and commoditization in product markets. Thus, manufacturers focus on providing industrial solutions which are delivered through relational processes with customers by using solution-driven business models. In the management of marketing activities, this can be regarded as closer customer relationships, service-dominant {{business logic}}, and collaboration in solving customers’ problems. However, there are few studies on comprehensive conceptualizations of a solution offering that include different elements and their roles, especially in the context of capital goods industry. Also the transition process needs further studies in a real life context. This study explores the transition process of an industrial company from product to solution business and, as an aid to managing the solution business, explicates the structure and management of an industrial solution offering. There are two themes, the industrial transition process and industrial solution offering. Regarding the industrial transition process, the aim is to understand the supplier view on the process and its execution and to determine the challenges related to the transition process. The industrial solution offering is discussed by its elements and characteristics, as well as management. Furthermore, a special type of build-own-operate-transfer business model is presented and its suitability in the industrial context analyzed. The study includes findings achieved by qualitative methods and from four case companies. Based on the results, it is tentatively suggested that in the industrial solution business, the transition from product to solution business is not a linear project but an evolving process that varies according to customer needs, which suggests that companies need to possess an ability to develop new business models for different customer needs. The industrial solution offering is dynamic as it evolves in collaboration according to the prevailing and latent customer needs, which suggest restructuring of the organization from a product-centric to a customer-centric one. Furthermore, based on the findings, the concept of industrial solutions is defined as an ongoing relational process to satisfy a customer’s particular business or operational requirements, and the concept of industrial solution offering as an entity comprising the customized goods, services, collaboration, and finance needed to fulfill the industrial solution. Finally, the study offers several managerial implications for industrial managers involved in the transition and management of the solution business and its offering...|$|R
5000|$|The common fact {{underlying}} the three cases {{is that each}} claimant, while on active duty and not on furlough, sustained injury due to negligence {{of others in the}} armed forces. The only issue of law raised is whether the Tort Claims Act extends its remedy to one sustaining [...] "incident to the service" [...] what under other circumstances would be an actionable wrong. This is the [...] "wholly different case" [...] reserved from our decision in Brooks v. United States. There are few guiding materials for our task of statutory construction. No committee reports or floor debates disclose what effect the statute was designed to have on the problem before us, or that it even was in mind. Under these circumstances, no conclusion can be above challenge, but if we misinterpret the Act, at least Congress possesses a ready remedy. We do not overlook considerations persuasive of liability in these cases. The Act does confer district court jurisdiction generally over claims for money damages against the United States founded on negligence. [...] It does contemplate that the Government will sometimes respond for negligence of military personnel, for it defines [...] "employee of the Government" [...] to include [...] "members of the military or naval forces of the United States," [...] and provides that [...] " [...] `acting within the scope of his office or employment', {{in the case of a}} member of the military or naval forces of the United States, means acting in line of duty." [...] Its exceptions might also imply inclusion of claims such as we have here. [...] statute excepts [...] "any claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war", from which it is said we should infer allowance of claims arising from noncombat activities in peace. Section 2680 (k) excludes [...] "any claim arising in a foreign country." [...] Significance also has been attributed in these cases, as in the Brooks case, to the fact that eighteen tort claims bills were introduced in Congress between 1925 and 1935 and all but two expressly denied recovery to members of the armed forces; but the bill enacted as the present Tort Claims Act from its introduction made no exception. We also are reminded that the Brooks case, in spite of its reservation of service-connected injuries, interprets the Act to cover claims not <b>incidental</b> to <b>service,</b> and it is argued that much of its reasoning is as apt to impose liability in favor of a man on duty as in favor of one on leave. These considerations, it is said, should persuade us to cast upon Congress, as author of the confusion, the task of qualifying and clarifying its language if the liability here asserted should prove so depleting of the public treasury as the Government fears.|$|R
