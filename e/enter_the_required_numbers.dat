40|$|Six pigeons {{were trained}} on two-key {{concurrent}} variable-interval schedules in which <b>the</b> <b>required</b> response was <b>the</b> {{completion of a}} fixed number of key pecks. When <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of pecks was equal on the two keys, response- and time-allocation ratios under-matched obtained reinforcement rate ratios. A similar result was found when <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of pecks was unequal, except that performance, measured in response terms, was biased to <b>the</b> shorter <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of pecks and was less sensitive to reinforcement-rate changes. No such {{differences were found in}} the data on time spent responding. When the variable-interval schedules were kept constant and <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>numbers</b> of pecks were systematically varied, response ratios changed inversely with the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of pecks, but time-allocation ratios varied directly with the same independent variable. Thus, on response measures, pigeons “prefer” the schedule with the smaller peck requirement, but on time measures they “prefer” the schedule with the larger peck requirement. This finding is inconsistent with a commonsense notion of choice, which sees response and time-allocation measures as equivalent...|$|R
50|$|If the {{defenders}} do not win <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of tricks {{and there is}} only a single whister, then the whister loses the value of the contract in dump points (×10) for each undertrick. If this happens when there are two whisters, then the penalty is distributed fairly among them according to the principle that each whister is only responsible for his or her own undertricks with respect to half <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of tricks. However, if <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of tricks was 1, then it cannot be divided by 2 and the second whister is deemed responsible.|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic source {{analysis}} yields {{estimates of}} the sources of the Electro- and/or MagnetoEncephaloGram (EEG/MEG) and thus generates a functional description of the human brain. The standard errors of the source estimates are influenced by the number and position of EEG/MEG is measured. Therefore, optimal design theory is applied to determine <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> and position of sensors, <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of samples, and <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of trials. To that end, the Fedorov exchange algorithm is extended to incorporate multi-response models.

40|$|Abstract — Integrated {{circuit designs}} {{need to be}} {{verified}} in simulation over {{a large number of}} process corners that represent the expected range of transistor properties, supply voltages, and die temperatures. Each process corner can require substantial simulation time. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of corners has been growing rapidly in the latest semiconductor technologies. We consider the problem of minimizing <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of process corner simulations by iteratively learning a model of the output functions in order to confidently estimate key maximum and/or minimum properties of those functions. Depending on the output function, <b>the</b> <b>required</b> <b>number</b> of corner simulations can be reduced by factors of up to 95 %.
