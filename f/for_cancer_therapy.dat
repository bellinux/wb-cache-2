5|$|Hsp90 is {{exploited}} by cancer cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors. These clients are often mutated, amplified or translocated in malignancy, and Hsp90 works to buffer these cellular stresses induced by malignant transformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 {{leads to the}} degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target <b>for</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E

Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant <b>for</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E

25|$|A cancer cell can die {{in three}} ways: apoptosis, {{necrosis}} and autophagy. Excessive ROS can induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which {{is necessary for}} subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 as well as apoptosis induction. In the intrinsic pathway, ROS function to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer). The intrinsic pathway {{is also known as}} the caspase cascade and is induced through mitochondrial damage which triggers the release of cytochrome c. DNA damage, oxidative stress, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential lead to the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins mentioned above stimulating apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage is closely linked to apoptosis and since mitochondria are easily targeted there is potential <b>for</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidence of {{the effects}} of {{terrestrial}} forms of ionizing radiation on the CNS has been documented from radiotherapy patients, although the dose is higher for these patients than would be experienced by astronauts in the space environment. CNS behavioral changes such as chronic fatigue and depression occur in patients who are undergoing irradiation <b>for</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy.</b> Neurocognitive effects, especially in children, are observed at lower radiation doses. A recent review on intelligence and the academic achievement of children after treatment for brain tumors indicates that radiation exposure is related to a decline in intelligence and academic achievement, including low intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, verbal abilities, and performance IQ; academic achievement in reading, spelling, and mathematics; and attention functioning. Mental retardation was observed in the children of the atomic-bomb survivors in Japan who were exposed to radiation prenatally at moderate doses (<2 Gy) at 8 to 15 weeks post-conception, but not at earlier or later prenatal times.|$|E
500|$|Thorium nuclei are {{susceptible}} to alpha decay because the strong nuclear force cannot overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons. The alpha decay of 232Th decay initiates the 4n decay chain which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by 4 (hence the name; it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor). This chain of consecutive alpha and beta decays begins with the decay of 232Th to 228Ra and terminates at 208Pb. Any sample of thorium or its compounds contains traces of these daughters, which are isotopes of thallium, lead, bismuth, polonium, radon, radium, and actinium. Natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract useful daughter nuclides, such as 212Pb, which is used in nuclear medicine <b>for</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy.</b> 232Th also very occasionally undergoes spontaneous fission rather than alpha decay, and has left evidence in doing so in its minerals (as trapped xenon gas formed as a fission product), but the partial half-life {{of this process is}} very large at over 1021years and alpha decay predominates.Th |journal=Phys.

40|$|AbstractCarbon ion <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy</b> is {{becoming}} more widespread due to its high curative effects and low burden on patients. Carbon ions are delivered to patients through electromagnets on a rotating gantry. A rotating gantry is attractive because it allows carbon ions to irradiate a tumor from any direction without changing the posture of the patient. On the other hand, {{because of the high}} magnetic rigidity of carbon ions, the weight of a rotating gantry <b>for</b> carbon <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy</b> is about three times higher than one <b>for</b> proton <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy,</b> according to our estimation. The use of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets has been considered for reducing the size of the rotating gantry <b>for</b> carbon <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy.</b> The target weight is 200 t or less,which is equivalent to the weight of a typical rotating gantry <b>for</b> proton <b>cancer</b> <b>therapy.</b> In this study, the magnet layout of the rotating gantry and the superconducting magnets were designed from the viewpoint of beam optics. When applying high-temperature superconductors to accelerator magnets, there are some issues that should be considered, for example, the influence of tape magnetization and manufacturing accuracy on the field quality, the thermal stability of the conduction-cooled HTS coils under an alternating magnetic field, and methods to protect the coils from thermal runaway caused by an anomalous thermal input such as that due to beam loss. First, the thermal stability of the conduction-cooled HTS coils was simulated numerically, and the thermal runaway current was calculated in a static situation...|$|R
