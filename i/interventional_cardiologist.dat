2500|$|A {{drug-eluting}} stent (DES) is {{a peripheral}} or coronary stent (a scaffold) placed into narrowed, diseased peripheral or coronary arteries that slowly releases {{a drug to}} block cell proliferation. This prevents fibrosis that, together with clots (thrombi), could otherwise block the stented artery, a process called restenosis. [...] The stent is usually placed within the peripheral or coronary artery by an <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologist</b> or interventional radiologist during an angioplasty procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{in the field of}} interventional cardiology is the overlapping roles of PCI and coronary artery bypass surgery for individuals with coronary artery disease. [...] This area has been studied in a number of trials since the early 1990s. [...] Unfortunately, due to the rapid changes in technique in both bypass surgery as well as PCI, added to the better understanding of the role of intense pharmacologic therapy in individuals with coronary artery disease, questions still remain on the best form of therapy in many subgroups of patients. [...] Multiple ongoing studies hope to tease out which individuals do better with PCI and which do better with CABG, but in general each case is individualized to the patient and the relative comfort level of the <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologist</b> and the cardiothoracic surgeon.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> may be {{immune to}} stress, {{allowing}} them to perform complex percutaneous interventions under pressure. Objectives To assess heart rate (HR) variations as {{a surrogate marker of}} stress of <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> during percutaneous cardiac procedures and in every-day life. Design This is a single-centre observational study including a total of six male <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> performing coronary interventions and pacemaker implantations. Participants were asked to record their HR with the Apple Watch Device during procedures, every-day life and control activities such as outpatient consultations, sport, marital conflicts and sexual intercourse. Results Average daily HR was 88 ± 17  bpm. During work days, HR increased significantly during procedures (90 ± 17  bpm) compared with days outside the cathlab (87 ± 17  bpm, p= 0. 02). The average HR was higher during a regular week working (88 ± 16  bpm) compared with weekends off (84 ± 18  bpm, p= 0. 002). Complex cardiac procedures were associated with higher HR up to 122  bpm. Peak HR were higher during physical exertion. Of note, participants complained of hypersexuality and mania after night shifts. Conclusions Work and especially percutaneous cardiac procedures increase HR independently of physical exertion suggesting that <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> experience mental stress and emotions...|$|R
40|$|Aims: As {{part of the}} EAPCI Young Initiative, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) {{conducted}} a survey to address {{the educational needs of}} young <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists.</b> Methods and results: A questionnaire was distributed to all individuals registered in the ESC database aged < 36 years with an interest in interventional cardiology. Nearly two-thirds of participants (60 %) indicated that they had difficulty in finding a fellowship training position. The desire for a fellow's course at European level was expressed by 95 %, while 94 % were in favour of developing a network of young <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> in Europe. More than three-quarters of respondents (79 %) said they had had difficulty in obtaining funding to attend EuroPCR. Multiple difficulties were identified in setting up a research programme, two of the more frequent being problematic access to research networks and the difficulties of finding a mentor. Career orientation was identified as another issue, with more than half of respondents (59 %) declaring they followed career options by chance. Conclusions: The survey underlines the need to fill a gap in order {{to address the needs of}} young <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists.</b> It may serve as a starting point for developing educational initiatives targeted at young <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> {{working in}} {{high-volume}} cardiac catheterization laboratory {{are exposed to}} significant occupational radiation risks. Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes are thought to modify the effects of low-dose radiation exposure onDNAdamage, the main initiating event {{in the development of}} cancer and hereditary disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between XRCC 1 (Arg 194 Trp and Arg 399 Gln), OGG 1 (Ser 326 Cys), APE 1 (Asp 148 Glu) and XRCC 3 (Thr 241 Met) SNPs and chromosomal DNA damage. We enrolled 77 subjects: 40 <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> (27 male, 41. 3 ? 9. 4 years and 13 female, 37. 8 ? 8. 4 years) and 37 clinical cardiologists (26 male, 39. 4 ? 9. 5 years and 11 female, 35. 0 ? 9. 8 years) without radiation exposure as the control group. Micronucleus (MN) assay was performed as biomarker of chromosomal DNA damage and an early predictor of cancer. MN frequency was significantly higher in <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> than in clinical physicians (19. 7 ? 7. 8 ? vs. 13. 5 ? 6. 3 ?, p = 0. 0003). Within the exposed group, individuals carrying a XRCC 3 Met 241 allele had higher frequency than homozygous XRCC 3 Thr 241 (21. 2 ? 7. 8 ? vs. 16. 6 ? 7. 1 ?, p = 0. 03). Individuals with two or more risk alleles showed a higher MN frequency when compared to subjects with one or no risk allele (18. 4 ? 6. 6 ? vs. 14. 4 ? 6. 1 ?, p = 0. 02). An interactive effect was found between smoking, exposure > 10 years and the presence of the two or more risk alleles on the MN frequency (F = 6. 3, p = 0. 02). XRCC 3 241 Met alleles, particularly in combination with multiple risk alleles of DNA repair genes, contribute to chromosomal DNA damage levels in <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: The eye is {{well known}} to be {{sensitive}} to clearly high doses (> 2 Gy) of ionizing radiation. In recent years, however, cataracts have been observed in populations exposed to lower doses. <b>Interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> are repeatedly and acutely exposed to scattered ionizing radiation (X-rays) during the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures they perform. These “low ” exposures may cause damage to the lens of the eye and induce early cataracts, known as radiation-induced cataracts. The O’CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was designed to test the hypothesis that <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists,</b> compared with an unexposed reference group of non-interventional cardiologists, have an increased risk of cataracts. Method/Design: The O’CLOC study is a cross-sectional study that will include a total of 300 cardiologists aged at least 40 years: one group of exposed <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> and another of non-interventional cardiologists. The groups will be matched for age and sex. Individual information, including risk factors for cataracts (age, diabetes, myopia, etc.), will be collected during a telephone interview. A specific section of the questionnaire for the exposed group focuses on occupational history, including a description of the procedures (type, frequency, radiation protection tool) used. These data will be used to classify subjects into “exposure level ” groups according to cumulative dose estimates. Eye examinations for all participants will be performed to detect cataracts, even i...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeCompared with trans-femoral {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (TFI), trans-radial PCI (TRI) has a {{lower risk}} of bleeding, access site complications and hospital costs, and is preferred by patients. However, TRI accounts for a minority of PCIs in the US, and there is currently little research that explores why. Methods/MaterialWe conducted a national survey in February 2013 to assess perceptions of TRI vs. TFI, and barriers to TRI adoption and implementation among <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> employed by the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and linked these data to site-level TRI annual rates for 2013. ResultsWe received 78 completed surveys (32 % response rate). Respondents at sites that perform few or no TRIs identified increased radiation exposure as the greatest barrier while at sites that perform {{a high percentage of}} TRIs respondents identified the steep learning curve as the greatest barrier. Majorities of survey respondents at all sites rated TRI as superior on 5 of 7 criteria, including patient comfort and bleeding complications, but rated TFI as superior on procedure time and procedure success. ConclusionsEven <b>interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> at sites that perform few or any TRIs recognized the superiority of TRI for patient comfort and safety, but rated it inferior to TFI on procedure time and technical results. <b>Interventional</b> <b>cardiologists</b> at high-TRI labs rated TRI as equivalent on procedure time and technical results. Efforts to increase TRI adoption and implementation may be more successful if they emphasize that procedure times and technical results depend on achieving proficiency...|$|R
