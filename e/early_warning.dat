40|$|The <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> alert is {{a result}} of the agrometeorological {{monitoring}} system that includes information on the content of soil moisture, living vegetation, and dead biomass. Starting from this, the danger potential conditions can be inferred to originate and to spread vegetation fires. The alert system was designed to operate at different temporal scales at the national level (<b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> alert) and provincial level (advanced and immediate warnings alert). The resulting information flow of the danger-potential alert conditions of vegetation fires surveillance is explained. Some results of the practical application of this potential danger index in long-term <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> alerts are reported. The index was evaluated with forest fire reports during 2001 and 2002, for the <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> alert of the occurrence of danger conditions of vegetation fires. This system has allowed the Cuban Body Keepers to strengthen preventive activity and to achieve operative efficiency during the high-danger occurrence period of forest fires in Cuba...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Concurrent Engineering has caused growing demands on project management. The classic project management methods are often slow: problems may already exist when those methods are applied. The {{objective of the}} present study is to improve the opportunities of those responsible for a project's operational management to receive advance information about potential problems and final results through <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> typical of the theory of weak signals by Igor Ansoff. The research examines the background of Ansoff's theory, the way in which project theories treat project problems, the causes of problems, and possible <b>early</b> <b>warnings.</b> Other aspects of the phenomenon investigated in this study include its relation to project risk management and its communicational character. A survey of the relevant literature shows that project literature contains some discussion of <b>early</b> <b>warnings.</b> However, only a few studies have the phenomenon as their main focus; similarly, research on the Ansoff theory is sparse. A number of studies concerning <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> can be found in other fields, such as military science and general business economics. In addition, communications studies are familiar with the concept of weak signals, which is analogous to the concept of <b>early</b> <b>warnings.</b> An examination of project literature shows that certain factors in a project - <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> detected in project work, project problems, and the causes of those problems - may form chains. The interpretation of these factors may vary depending on the perspective and the time of observation. In addition, they can to some extent be considered subsets of one set (as defined by set theory). The research was conducted using a qualitative research method. A total of seventeen project experts were interviewed using the semistructured (thematic) interview method, which was also used to identify and examine <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> in four case projects. Almost 900 such statements were observed. These observations were grouped according to similar characteristics, after which the various factors were analyzed qualitatively as well as according to percent distributions, both individually and through multiple attribute examination. The empirical research shows that stimuli (signals, messages) that comply with communications theory {{can be found in the}} project environment. These signals and messages are always to some degree inaccurate, and making decisions based on them is difficult. To clarify the meaning of these messages, the present study examines the general character of the <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> phenomenon and designs an explanatory model that illustrates the communicative character of the phenomenon as well as the stages of decision-making. Further, the study develops a hierarchical classification of warning signals, complete with signal type categorization and descriptive typology, and draws up categorizations to help in signal identification. The categorizations are formed using eight (8) different factors. In addition, the relationship between <b>early</b> <b>warnings,</b> project problems, and problem causes is investigated; the dependence network designed of these three factors plus the responses they require furnishes some of the most important data for further utilization. Furthermore, this study designs a fundamental model for the utilization of the <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> phenomenon. This model, and the results of the present research in general, can be used to identify <b>early</b> <b>warnings.</b> For the present, the data provided by this research have to be handled manually, which may be somewhat laborious. To aid utilization in the future, the study proposes a way to incorporate <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> to the Risk Management Knowledge-Based program created by Kiyoshi Niwa. The study provides project management and project risk management theories with additional information about the <b>early</b> <b>warnings</b> phenomenon, which has not been extensively studied, but which is widely known among project management specialists. The study defines the phenomenon and makes it easier to comprehend. A broader utilization of the phenomenon, however, requires further research. reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> radar in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was {{mounted on the}} forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> radar was mounted on the rear lip of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time.|$|E
