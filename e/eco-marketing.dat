40|$|Environmental {{marketing}} (<b>Eco-marketing),</b> as {{a relatively}} new movement, emerged {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century, is in the growing phase of its development. Eco-labeling and other ways/types of <b>eco-marketing</b> are attracting more attention of consumers, since they are aware of the necessity of nature conservation and environmental protection. There has been a lot of misunderstanding and miss leadings in interpretation and substantiation of ecomarketing claims in previous period of time. One of the most concrete improvements in <b>eco-marketing</b> was appearance and establishment of ISO 14020 guidelines. ISO 14020 guidelines are integral part of ISO 14000 series of standards, which could be implemented in <b>eco-marketing.</b> At the same time, development of "green" products and marketing of "green" products, are direct positive contributions to resources reduction, environmental protection and sustainable economic development.

The entire economic activity is related to the environment, being at least, the place for producing the goods. The consumers are growing their interest on the world behind the product, they want to know how, where and who manufactured the product they want to buy, in order to determine the price they want to pay, and to make the purchase decision. The main part of this article contains a marketing research made on the Brasov’s adult population, having the main objective to establish the opinions, attitudes and behaviors of the Brasov citizens on the <b>eco-marketing</b> campaigns. In order to determine this, a quantitative research was conducted, on 384 subjects. This research contains questions about the interest manifested by the population from Brasov on the ecological problems, the actions that were taken by different age groups concerning the ecological problems, the influence of the revenue on the actions on the <b>eco-marketing</b> campaigns and the degree of involvement of different economic actors in the <b>eco-marketing</b> plans.

40|$|Green {{consumerism}} and {{the role}} of <b>eco-marketing</b> have become increasingly important for increasing the market share of sustainable (non-) food products. The current study examines the effect of social identification with certain green consumer groups on brand knowledge, brand attitude and buying behavior. An online panel study was conducted among a representative sample of the German population (N= 961). For brand knowledge and brand attitude, we presented five well-known organic brands in the German market to the respondents. To test the hypothesized model, we used structural equation analysis in SPSS Amos 16. 0. Several competing path models were tested. One of the main conclusions of the current study is that people who are aware of their social identity concerning environmentally friendly consumer groups also seem to feel more attached to consumers who buy organic food products. In addition, brand knowledge and brand attitudes concerning specific organic brands have an effect on buying behaviors for organic food products. Moreover, the influence of brand knowledge on buying behavior seems to be mediated by brand attitude. The results of the current study can be used to develop more effective branding strategies in <b>eco-marketing.</b> Aside from classical strategies, marketers could use social identity theory to create future market strategies with regard to green consumeris...|$|E

40|$|Large food {{companies}} rarely produce organic products in Germany. Core {{problems on the}} economic level are: •	The target groups of the organic market are too small. Market increase requires the exploration of new target groups beyond the typical consumer of organic food. •	Small units lead to high costs per unit and to a vicious circle of too high prices and buying abstinence (in spite of “eco-affinity”). •	Organizational deficits in the marketing chain and inside enterprises hamper a proactive <b>eco-marketing.</b> There are also problems at the psychological level: The management in conventional food industry fears discrimination of their conventional range and therefore a loss in total turnover. However, this fear is not supported by any empirical experience. In contrast, positive image spill-over effects from the organic range towards the conventional range could be observed. We observed two reasons for this virtual threat: •	No conviction in the potential for demands of organic products. •	Emotional resistance against the lifestyle criticism of the organic movement. Prospect: Marketing and organizational problems require an active Marketing-Chain-Management {{inside and outside of}} enterprise borders.

40|$|Green {{consumerism}} is on {{the rise}} in America, but its environmental effects are contested. Does green marketing contribute to the greening of American consciousness, or does it encourage corporate greenwashing? This tenuous ethical position means that eco-marketers must carefully frame their environmental products in a way that appeals to consumers with environmental ethics and buyers who consider natural products as well as conventional items. Thus, <b>eco-marketing</b> constructs a complicated ethical identity for the green consumer. Environmentally aware individuals are already guided by their personal ethics. In trying to attract new consumers, environmentally minded businesses attach an aesthetic quality to environmental goods. In an era where environmentalism is increasingly hip, what are the implications for an environmental ethics infused with a sense of aesthetics? This article analyzes the promotional materials of three companies that advertise their environmental consciousness: Burt 2 ̆ 7 s Bee 2 ̆ 7 s Inc., Tom 2 ̆ 7 s of Maine, Inc., and The Body Shop Inc. Responding to an increasing online shopping market, these companies make their promotional and marketing materials available online, and these web-based materials replicate their printed catalogs and indoor advertisements. As part of selling products to consumers based on a set of ideological values, these companies employ two specific discursive strategies to sell their products: they create enhanced notions of beauty by emphasizing the performance of their natural products, and thus infuse green consumerism with a unique environmental aesthetic. They also convey ideas of health through community values, which in turn enhances notions of personal health to include ecological well-being. This article explicates the ethical implications of a personal natural care discourse for <b>eco-marketing</b> strategies, and the significance of a green consumer aesthetic for environmental consciousness in general...|$|E

People are searching for ways to secure sustainable and ethical foods and are open to learning new possibilities. This article provides a case study analysis of the work of Stuart Gifford, a long-term sustainability advocate, restaurateur and urban activist. Gifford currently is co-owner of Sarah's Sister's Sustainable Café. This restaurant features sustainability in the design principles and management of the enterprise. Gifford's commitment to sustainability advocacy and teaching permeates not only the business but is also a life commitment as he undertakes initiatives such as fostering an external <b>eco-market,</b> creating sustainability events associated with a major metropolitan festival, community activism and political advocacy. This article analyses the import of Gifford's efforts. Employing a qualitative research methodology, this article presents rich insights into the ways in which running a sustainable café can be read as a cultural pedagogy.

The increase of weight of eco-industries is among the development objectives in medium and long run. Romania has to implement a plan of 28 actions for promotion of eco-technologies and increase their competitiveness. Economic changes had main impact on ecological protection and on the general public as an entire. Almost all eco-food Romanian products are for export because inside the country it is only a small niche of consumers. The customers are that who used to consume this type of products on European markets, others see it as a trend and a third category is occasional consumers who introduce in their diet about 5 - 10 percent organic products There continue to exist obstacles in the manner of the expansion of this market such as the still low-scale production, a reduced range of products, higher prices (up to 150 % more) than for standard products, low level of consumer information and low promotion level. In spite of all these aspects it is a great potential in the medium and long term. An exploratory research was carried out in order to evaluate the state of Romanian ecological producers. The survey had 18 questions but here will be presented only some of the results. The aim of this exploratory research is to offer information for the set-up of a new eco-business.

40|$|Nowadays in Ukraine and {{worldwide}} more prevalent is so-called “green marketing ” or <b>eco-marketing.</b> The {{main reason for}} this process {{is the development of}} environmental consciousness of humanity and its own responsibility for saving the Planet. One more reason is our fear for ourselves, because we all want to live a healthy lifestyle, eat healthy products, wear natural clothing etc. Ecological marketing is a specific type of marketing that involves targeting the entire enterprise (product development, its production, packaging, transportation, sale, promotion, recycling and disposal) to form and meet environmentally-oriented demand for profits, environmental protection and people’s health [1]. It would seem that such aspirations are only positive, but the environmental theme in marketing has long ceased to be a whim of some supporters of a healthy lifestyle and turned into a powerful consumer trend. Currently, ecological branding includes a major shift in consumer psychology, and virtually no sphere of life is left behind.

40|$|In {{the context}} of East African pastoralism, {{improved}} risk management is proposed to offer ways to promote wealth conservation, reduce poverty, mitigate conflicts, and enhance food security at the household level. The Pastoral Risk Management (PARIMA) project is a multi-disciplinary, effort funded by USAID from 1997 to 2006. The two main components of the project include research arid outreach. The study area extends from Hagremariam in southern Ethiopia to Isiolo and Baringb Districts' in north-central Kenya. The study area represents an intact <b>eco-marketing</b> region, hosts 10 major ethnic groups, and is beset by pervasive poverty, violence, food insecurity, poor infrastructure, and inadequate public services: Research has focused on risk mapping, household survey, and community-level case studies to identify prominent risks for pastoralists, clarify pastoral coping strategies, and reveal possible Development interventions. Outreach disseminates research information among researchers, Development agents; policy makers, and communities. Outreach has also engaged in efforts to build awareness and capacity of pastoral communities and Development agents to implement risk-management interventions using pilot projects. Degree training has focused on master's and doctoral students, both in East Africa and the United States. Non-degree training includes workshops and interactive field tours for communities, Development facilitators, and policy makers. One Development vision of the PARIMA project is based on how to promote household wealth accumulation and conservation via asset and income diversification. The process could involve encouraging households {{to become involved in}} more timely livestock sales before crises occur, putting some revenue in draught-proof alternative investments, and then focusing on how to achieve a degree of sustainable livelihood diversification.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} {{conceptual}} framework of food retailers’ ecological orientation that considers the interaction between ecological marketing and ecological management. In this context, the relationship was examined between ecological orientation and sales of ecological food products and the overall store performance of Swedish food retailers. To fulfil this purpose eco-orientation was conceptualised into two dimensions: <b>eco-marketing</b> and eco-management based on indications in the greening literature that companies’ responses to ecological issues have often been skewed to the marketing side rather than integrated into strategic and operative substantive actions. The study contributes to the theoretical fields of green and retail marketing. In the empirical data, (based on a standardised questionnaire administered to a random sample of Swedish storekeepers) I found three distinct groups of stores. The three groups were positioned along the diagonal of the two dimensions of eco-orientation; thus the stores differed in the degree of eco-orientation and not by having skewed eco-orientations. In fact, the data showed consistency in the integration of eco-aspects in marketing and management over a wide area of functions and activities. The findings from the study indicated that there was a positive relationship between ecological orientation and sales of ecological food products as well as overall store performance. However, eco-orientation seems to contribute more to the explanation of the sales of the ecological range rather than to overall sales. This study not only supports the notions of the important role of the store for the sales and market development of ecological food products, but also indicates that the more a store integrates ecological aspects into both marketing and management the better the development of its sales of ecological food products. Moreover, the study indicated that those storekeepers who considered it possible to combine eco-concern with good business were more likely to integrate eco-issues into their store operations than storekeepers who only had a general positive attitude to eco-issues...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{study is}} part of a digital {{activation}} plan that was done for Sony Ericsson’s GreenHeart™ team in the fall of 2009. The investigation presents and discusses what Sony Ericsson and its 4 main competitors (Nokia, LG, Samsung and Motorola) have done within green digital marketing and how the subject was communicated on their webpages. The aim of this study is to: • To present and analyze consumer insights on ecologically-driven technology • To present and analyze the <b>eco-marketing</b> digital practices and strategies used by 4 competitive mobile phone brands • To propose a digital green marketing strategy for GreenHeart™ Method: This study consists of interviews with Sony Ericsson personnel, literature and web analysis that focus on the green initiatives of mobile phone manufacturers in the digital channel. Result & Conclusions: A main issue with green products is that consumers tend to find them not as good as non-green products. Consumer insight studies suggest that {{that the best way to}} communicate and promote green products is to focus on their direct benefits to consumers in comparison to non-green products, and communicate the green benefits only as a secondary message. This was also supported by theories such as Levit’s concept of “marketing myopia”, which describes a marketer’s tendency to focus on product features rather than consumer benefits. When analyzing the webpages of Sony Ericsson’s top 4 competitors, it was 3 evident that all 4 mobile phone manufacturers employed green digital marketing in quite a homogenous way. One striking similarity was that all brands have separated their green initiatives from the core of the website. It is a possibility that marketers have done this intentionally since consumers tend to associate green with lesser quality. In order for Sony Ericsson GreenHeart™ to stand out from the competitors, it was therefore suggested that green information should be integrated into the website and to communicate GreenHeart™ as a value-added product feature rather than a product in itself. Suggestions for future research: It is recommended to continue this research and to compare the findings from the mobile phone industry with other industries, such as the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), where Green and Organic branding at a glance seem to have been developed strongly. It would be interesting to gain a perspective on the similarities and differences in the green marketing practices of different industries, but also to gain knowledge and inspiration on how green consumer electronics could be marketed in a more effective and integrated fashion. In this perspective, analyzing any variations between on- and off-line marketing initiatives would be interesting to see if the green message changes in a typical marketing mix. Moreover, it would be good to counter analyze the psychological mechanisms why, for certain industries such as food, green products are regarded as high quality whilst in another industry like electronics, green products are regarded as having lesser quality and business value. Contribution of the thesis: The most important finding of this study is that all the analyzed mobile phone manufacturers have many green initiatives. However, they are communicated separately from all other marketing and communication initiatives in the main digital channel. They tend to be set aside that consumers need to search for them, thus the messages are not delivered seamlessly. This makes it appear that green initiatives are being regarded as something obligatory rather than something that has true business value. Using Theoretical arguments on communication strategy from Levit and ClearWorks show how this, in reality, can be changed and be integrated with product marketing where it can generate a more significant business valu...|$|E
40|$|In this master's thesis "Strategies of {{food and}} health experts' in {{interpretation}} and facilitation of risks" the author {{tried to find out}} which are the risk interpretation and facilitation strategies of Estonian food and health experts in the post-modern risk and knowledge-based society. The scope of the study is food risks. The aim of the author was {{to find out what the}} experts base their risk ratings on, how willing they are to take into account any other knowledge and experience different from their expert systems, and how is the communicative role of experts seen in interpretation and mediation of risks. The centre of the theoretical part of the study is a professor of sociology Urich Beck and his theory of the risk society. The author finds that the characteristic features of risk society have a considerable influence on the communication of the society and put forward new demands for scientific information creation. Today we have a demand for complex risk communication. The lack of it leads to communicative tensions between communication flows {{of food and}} health risks directed by various interest groups. The experts are mediators of knowledge in the risk and knowledge-based society and that is why the study is focused on the experts' strategy. The method of the study is 9 semi-structured expert interviews with various specialists of the Estonian food and health sphere. The empirical results of the study showed that the experts base their risk ratings on a complex of various factors. The influencing factors of risk rating are the age and the level of education of the expert, working experience and environment, fiduciary relations and authorities, and health conditions of the person or his/her immediate family. The expert's attitude towards risks and the manners and types of risk handling eventually form in concurrence with all of those factors. By the attitude towards the risks, the experts who participated in the study could be placed on the following scale: high vs. low uncertainty in constructing the risks, meaning if and how the risks of the expert's rating are controllable. Low uncertainty means that the limits of safe/dangerous are clear for the expert and the expert does not have many doubts or hesitations. High uncertainty means that the limits of safe/dangerous are not that clear to the expert, the limits are not so well controllable and raise doubts and hesitations for the expert. The results show that the experts are willing to consider different knowledge from their own expert system if the risk defining strategy used before does not work anymore and/or the expert has doubts and hesitations about it. The reason for hesitations of that kind could be a health condition or other health disorders of the expert or his/her family member, also the expert's personal wider and more systematic interest of dietic matters. The expert is not willing to consider different knowledge and experience regarding his/her education, practice and competence if the hesitations do not rise regarding the strategy used by the expert so far. According to the experts, the surrounding media of food and health risks is shaped by very many factors and channels. The experts pointed out media, internet and books, scientific research and articles, packages and verbally spreading information such as rumours and myths as the information source and information mediation medium. In addition to that, the information medium is influenced by Estonia, the European Union and the industry. The experts who participated in the study interpret the public information medium as a very eclectic one where it is very hard for the consumer to orientate without having prior knowledge about food and health risks. In addition to this overall eclecticism, the experts find that there are two controversial communication flows in the communicative medium. In contrary to the main communication flow emanating from the verifiability of risks which is representing the industry, Estonia and the EU, there is a so called alternative communication flow emanating from uncontrollable risks which represents the experts who stand for "sufferers' voice", the consumers aware of risks, and new business trends such as eco-production and <b>eco-marketing.</b> Due to the eclectic nature of the information medium and controversial information flows, there are communicative tensions of food and health risks also in the Estonian society which need addressing sooner or later. The experts' vision of their role in interpreting and mediating risks depends on the expert's communicative activity. The experts who participated in the study have a different level of activity in the communication of food and health risks. The experts who are active or moderately active in the communication see their role as a food and health risk mediators. Different views on the risks among the experts raise various problematic topics. There are two controversial groups in the other experts’ communication rating that do not accept each other: experts with high communicative activity who believe that the risks are clearly determinable and controllable vs. experts with high communicative activity who believe that the risks are indeterminable and uncontrollable. Therefore, the difference is essentially in the view on risks. The presence and absence of control contrast with the lack of and/or controllability of risks. All in all, in the light of this master's thesis it can be clearly noted that there are communicative tensions in the sphere of food and health risks among the two contrasting communication flows. One of those flows denies the food and health risks and emanates from the fact that the risks are defined and controllable. In contrary, the other flow emanates from the fact that there are risks and that the risks are indefinable and thus uncontrollable. The communicative tensions arising from risk communication need solutions sooner or later...|$|E
