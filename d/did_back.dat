25|$|As Phoenix sprawled north, {{developers}} found {{plenty of}} available land on Central Avenue and began {{capitalizing on the}} cachet of the youthful city's signature boulevard. Local steakhouse legend Durant's (2611 N) opened in 1950 and has changed little other than that patrons today enter the restaurant through the back off the parking lot as celebrities and other socialites once <b>did</b> <b>back</b> then. Park Central Mall (3110 N) replaced a dairy farm in the middle part of the decade, signaling the beginning of downtown's long decline as retail stores and malls opened {{away from the city}} center. America's second McDonald's restaurant was built near Indian School Road in 1953. It was the first McDonald's franchise, the first to feature the Golden Arches, and served as a model for Ray Kroc's Illinois store. These early commercial developments foreshadowed the trend towards autocentrism on Central Avenue and indeed the rest of the city. The first major high-rise built on Central Avenue outside of downtown was the Phoenix Towers (2201 N), erected in 1957. The Phoenix Art Museum moved to Central Avenue in 1959. Phoenix fully annexed Sunnyslope, at Central's north terminus, that year. Central Avenue to its southern terminus, South Mountain, where minorities had been historically redlined, was annexed a year later.|$|E

The most successful act has been the Canadian-French band The Musical Box that have been officially endorsed by the band and had Hackett and Collins perform as guests with them. Gabriel has taken his children to see the Musical Box, so [...] "they could see what their father <b>did</b> <b>back</b> then", while Hackett has said [...] "They not only manage to sound, but look virtually identical".|$|E

Grading it a D+, The A.V.

[...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a B minus and wrote, [...] "It's a decent enough stab at being what the old movie was to its time, following the same basic plot, full of respectful references to its model, updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson". Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was [...] "musty and derivative" [...] and thought its only bright spot was 10-year-old Jaden Smith's [...] "engaging, lively performance".|$|E
500|$|Leicester won the Premier League on 2 May 2016 after Tottenham {{threw away}} a 2–0 lead against Chelsea, drawing 2–2 at the [...] "Battle of Stamford Bridge". This {{completed}} the fastest seven-year {{rise to the}} title except for Ipswich Town in 1962, and Leicester faced a far more unequal top tier than Ipswich <b>did</b> <b>back</b> then. Bookmakers thought Leicester's victory was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,000–1 for it {{at the start of}} the season. Neither bookmaker had ever paid out such long odds, and the trophy resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winnings of £25million. The scale of the surprise attracted global attention for the club and the city of Leicester. The Economist declared it would be [...] "pored over for management lessons". Several commentators have viewed it as an inspiration to other clubs and fundamentally transforming the expectations similar sized clubs face in English football. Ranieri's Leicester became known for their counterattacking style of play, [...] "incredible pace in the areas it is most essential" [...] and defensive solidarity. Players were often praised for their work ethic and togetherness which was apparent throughout the squad. On 16 May 2016, over 240,000 Leicester City fans turned out on the streets of Leicester and Victoria Park to celebrate their team's historic achievement. Reacting to City winning the Premier League, Executive Chairman Richard Scudamore said: ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{original}} release, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror has received very positive reviews from critics. AppSafari gave the game a 5 out of 5, saying: [...] "Production {{values for the}} game are sky-high, with gorgeous graphics, challenging, well-designed puzzles, and pitch-perfect voice acting. The sequel also implements the same fantastic touch interface of its predecessor." [...] AppGamer gave the game a 10 out of 10, saying: [...] "Broken Sword 2 will last you hours, having all the playability of a full-priced PC game. It {{is the kind of}} game that could convert people who wouldn't look twice at adventure games, and is easily one of my most highly recommended titles on the platform." [...] GameZone gave the game an 8 out of 10 and praised the game's controls and cut scenes, but stated that the iPad version of the game can be blurry at times. Carl Stevens of TouchGen gave the game 4 out of 5 start and stated that it should be on everybody's [...] "must play list" [...] and that the ease of, and restriction between some puzzles were the only let down in the game. Jeniffer Allen of 148Apps gave the game a 4 out of 5 start and praised it, saying: [...] "Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror is a fantastic game. The story feels as fresh and as entertaining as it <b>did</b> <b>back</b> in the day, and the slightly improved graphics are much appreciated. Many hours of entertaining storytelling lie ahead." ...|$|E

500|$|The Way I See It was an {{exemplary}} {{release of the}} classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with Solange Knowles' 2008 record Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, {{as one of the}} [...] "retro-soul" [...] efforts that were released by contemporary R artists as the music scene peaked in popularity. Wang wrote that The Way I See It [...] "showcased a mastery of any number of past R styles, including those out of Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and of course, Detroit." [...] Estelle said in 2008, [...] "Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it <b>did</b> <b>back</b> in the day. Not to take away from Amy, but this is the real shit." [...] It was described by David Nathan as the [...] "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." [...] Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music: [...] "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to baby boomers. For Raphael Saadiq, there's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ratings of}} the PC port were {{not as high as}} for the other versions. It was heavily criticized for no mouse support and {{frustrating}} keyboard controls, low-quality FMV cut scenes, choppy graphics rendering (lacks shadows and proper lighting) and requiring a gamepad controller for more precise aiming and gameplay. Despite the issues, the game still received generally positive reviews from IGN and GameSpot that praised the gameplay. Japanese game magazine Famitsu reviewed the Wii version of the game, with two editors giving the game a perfect 10 score, and the remaining pair giving it a 9, resulting in a score of 38 out of 40. The reviewers noted that the game's improved controls offer something fresh and different. Multiple reviewers agreed that even those who own the original will find something fun and enjoyable in this version. British magazine NGamer gave the Wii Edition a score of 96%, slightly lower than the 97% given to the GameCube version. They praised the visuals, controls, and features and commented on the fact that such an [...] "exceptional package" [...] was on sale for a low price; however, when writing about the Wii controls, they said, [...] "if you've played the GC version this won't be as special". Official Nintendo Magazine gave the Wii version 94%, 3% less than the original due to it simply not having the same impact it <b>did</b> <b>back</b> then. IGN praised the Wii version, stating it is the superior edition, but does not push the Wii like it did with GameCube and PS2. GameSpot praised the new controls of the Wii Edition but commented on the lack of exclusive Wii features. Hypers Jonti Davies commended Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition for its [...] "visual improvements" [...] but criticized it for having [...] "no new content". The PS3 version of Resident Evil 4 HD received a score of 9.0 from Destructoid, which called it [...] "a hallmark of excellence".|$|E
