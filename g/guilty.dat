Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading <b>guilty</b> of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead <b>guilty</b> but for such failure to withdraw his <b>guilty</b> plea.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{extensive}} literature regarding {{sex differences in}} jealousy due to infidelity, guilt resulting from infidelity remains unexplored. We hypothesize that men will feel <b>guiltier</b> from imagined emotional rather than sexual infidelity, as it is most important for their partner's reproductive success. Similarly, we predict that women will feel more guilt from imagined sexual rather than emotional infidelity. The findings indicate a different pattern; men feel <b>guiltier</b> following sexual infidelity, whereas women feel <b>guiltier</b> following emotional infidelity. Results also show that both sexes believe their partners would have a more difficult time forgiving sexual, rather than emotional, infidelity, but women and not men report that sexual infidelity would more likely lead to relationship dissolution. These findings are discussed in view of evolved mating strategies and individual reproductive success...|$|R

The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 <b>Guilty</b> on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 <b>Guilty</b> on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder.

He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for attempted rape and 18 months' imprisonment for assault, with the sentences to run concurrently.|$|E
40|$|Current {{social and}} legal {{constraints}} tend to preclude the overt expression {{of racism in}} America thereby causing its expression {{to take a more}} subtle form (termed modern racism). Studies of modern racism suggest that white Americans express their racist tendencies only in situations which they perceive to be ambiguous enough to warrant a non-racial interpretation. This paper reviews the findings of four studies on juror decision-making which also suggest that ambiguity, as represented by target and task specificity, affect the expression of racism. Studies 1, 2, and 3 indicate that the guilt decisions of white mock jurors are effected by the manipulation of task specificity (represented by the inclusion or non-inclusion of standard jury instructions) and target specificity (represented by the social status of the defendant). That is, jurors rated the black defendant <b>guiltier</b> than the white defendant, but only if instructions were absent (i. e., low task specificity). Additionally, low social status defendants were rated significantly <b>guiltier</b> than high social status defendants regardless of race. Study 4, consequently, examined the effect of manipulating task and target specificity simultaneously. Subjects were asked to read a murder trial transcript in which defendant race (i. e., black or white) and social status (i. e., high, low, neutral, no information) were manipulated. In addition, half of the subjects were given instructions specifying their responsibilities and duties (high task specificity) while the other half were provided with no instructions to evaluate the guilt of the defendant (low task specificity). Results indicated that the low social status defendant was again rated as <b>guiltier</b> than the high social status defendant, regardless of race or the level of task specificity. However, when no social status information was provided, and task specificity was low, the black defendant was rated <b>guiltier</b> than the white defendant. As in study 1, this finding dissipated when task specificity was increased. The above results are discussed with regard to the theory of modern racism. ...|$|R

5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December. The judges {{declared}} him not <b>guilty</b> of personally killing anyone and not <b>guilty</b> of overseeing and controlling {{the activities of the}} Einsatzgruppen. He was deemed responsible for the dreadful conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found <b>guilty</b> of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found <b>guilty</b> of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E
