[...] In the United States congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial elections of 1990, Bart was one of the most popular write-in candidates, and in many areas was second only to Mickey Mouse amongst fictional characters. In the 1990 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Bart made his debut as one of the giant helium-filled balloons for which the parade is known. The Bart Simpson balloon has appeared at every parade since. This was referenced in The Simpsons in the episode [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving", which aired the same day as the parade, where Homer tells Bart, [...] "If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you turn the parade into a farce!"

Iizuka says, 'I wanted to write a play that spoke to issues that were very important to university students right now. Having taught at a number of schools as a guest artist, and now teaching at University of California-San Diego, it seems like the issue of sexual assault—and more importantly, the attitudes and misconceptions that create a climate where sexual assault is prevalent—seemed timely.' [...] As part of the Big Ten initiative, universities are performing <b>Good</b> <b>Kids</b> to tackle the issue of sexual assault on campus. <b>Good</b> <b>Kids</b> is about a drunk high school girl who is raped by a group of football players after a high school party. The play focuses on the rumors and social aftermath. The natural question arises: who is to blame? 'I think the question that the play asks is how can this happen?” Iizuka says.

[...] Through the process of creating <b>Good</b> <b>Kids,</b> Izuka collaborated with college students and solicited their input toward the issue of sexual assault and how campuses should prevent and respond to this crime. 'It’s something that they very much want to talk about, and do something about,' she says. 'There’s an enormous energy around the issue of sexual assault and what to do on campus. You don’t solve a problem like sexual assault with anything other than a deep shift in attitude, and a deep shift in attitude happens conversation by conversation, in dorm rooms, parties and rehearsal halls.' ...|$|R
