25|$|Sindhu (Suhasini), {{working as}} a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is {{performing}} a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead of listening to the music. Hence, she asks JKB to translate the song he is singing into Tamil, which everybody in the audience can understand. He then gets angry and challenges her to demonstrate. She successfully demonstrates it and is applauded by the audience. In a few days, Sindhu apologizes to JKB and he finds out that she is an intellectual equal and admires her knowledge of music. However this intellectual attraction is misunderstood based on the cultural limitations. Gajapathi, who has promised not to lie, informs Bhairavi that her husband <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> with Sindhu.|$|E

500|$|Returning home, the Griffin {{family are}} {{shown to be}} {{watching}} the syndicated talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show with actress and comedian Ellen DeGeneres appearing as host of the show. Lois then interrupts the family, and announces that she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to drink with Joyce. The two then share their darkest secrets, with Lois revealing that she {{had participated in the}} making of a pornographic film. Asked if the film still exists, Lois states that it is [...] "long gone," [...] just like the original ending to the 1978 musical film Grease. After Joyce shows the film on the local news, Lois becomes angered, and decides to confront Joyce, who reveals that Lois had tormented her during high school, under the name Joyce Chevapravatdumrong, a reference to the Family Guy writer and series producer Cherry Chevapravatdumrong. The scene then transitions into a Facebook cutaway gag, showing Lois's Facebook profile. Becoming depressed once she is kicked out of her church, Lois is confronted by Brian, who suggest that she take the criticism head on, giving the example of television host Ryan Seacrest taking on jokes about his alleged homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|Southern Ontario's limited {{supply of}} {{agricultural}} land <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of production at an increasing rate. Urban sprawl and farmland severances {{contribute to the}} loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and [...] of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18%". of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural severances provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim {{from many}} music critics. Nick Levine from BBC Music wrote a positive review, commenting: [...] "She's {{a natural and}} charismatic vocal presence, {{so much so that}} Want U Back even creates a recurring hook from – how to put this? – the sound of her ‘frustrated grunts’." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic wrote that the song is [...] "an infectious example of cutesy pure pop that recall Britney before she lost her innocence." [...] Alex Denney from NME considered it [...] "a sassy bit of bubble-drunk pop from Britney songwriter Max Martin." [...] Danner had previously written in another NME review that the song is [...] "a peachy-keen pop number that goes pining after an ex, Cher drawing comfort from the fact that, even if her beloved <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> with someone else now, at least they’re only getting sloppy seconds." [...] Joe Rivers from No Ripcord wrote that [...] "It's packed with hooks and has Cher’s personality stamped all over it." ...|$|E

Sean and Clare begin inquiring about the homeschooling, and the numerous manners in which Robert and Samantha have replicated a full high school experience within their home, going as far as hazing, bullying, and giving out detentions, are revealed. They believe the experience should be as awkward as possible, like [...] "real high school". This includes throwing parties that exclude Kevin, Samantha instigating Kevin's [...] "first kiss" [...] and Robert revealing romantic feelings for Kevin.

2500|$|The {{novel is}} divided into two parts, {{entitled}} [...] "One" [...] and [...] "Two", both of which are narrated by Tony Webster when he is retired and living alone. The first part begins in the 1960s with four intellectually arrogant school friends, of whom two feature in the remainder of the story: Tony, the narrator, and Adrian, the most precociously intelligent of the four. [...] Towards the end of their school days another boy at the school hangs himself, apparently after getting a girl pregnant. [...] The four friends discuss the philosophical difficulty of knowing exactly what happened. [...] Adrian goes to Cambridge University and Tony to Bristol University. Tony acquires a girlfriend, Veronica, at whose family home he spends an awkward weekend. On waking one morning he finds that he and Veronica's mother, Sarah, are alone in the house, and she apologises for her family's behaviour towards him. Tony and Veronica's relationship fails in some acrimony, as he breaks up with her after she has sex with him. In his final year at university Tony receives a letter from Adrian informing him that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> with Veronica. Tony replies to the letter, telling Adrian that in his opinion Veronica was damaged in some way and that he should talk to her mother about it. Some months later he is told that Adrian has committed suicide, leaving a note addressed to the coroner saying that the free person has a philosophical duty to examine the nature of their life, and may then choose to renounce it. Tony admires the reasoning. He briefly recounts the following uneventful forty years of his life until his sixties. At this point Tony's narration of {{the second part of the}} novel – which is twice as long as the first – begins, with the arrival of a lawyer's letter informing him that Veronica's mother has bequeathed him £500 and two documents. These lead him to re-establish contact with Veronica and after a number of meetings with her, to re-evaluate the story he has narrated in the first part. On consulting the lawyers, Tony learns that Veronica has Adrian's diary. This leads him to send Veronica repeated e-mails requesting the diary. Veronica eventually sends Tony a single page of the diary, containing Adrian's musings on life as a series of cumulative wagers. Following this, Veronica meets Tony on the Millennium Bridge in London and gives him the letter he sent to Adrian in his youth. On re-reading it, Tony realises how malicious and unpleasant it was, and how he has erased this from his memory. Nevertheless, he persists in attempting to retrieve the diary from Veronica, which leads to her asking him to meet at a location in North London, where she drives him to see a group of mentally retarded men being taken for a walk by their careworker, one of whom she points out to him. Tony does not understand the significance of this and Veronica leaves him with no explanation. Over the course of several weeks, Tony revisits the location until he is able to relocate the man Veronica showed him in a pub. Tony greets the man saying he is a friend of Veronica's which leads to an upset response from the man. Tony realises from the man's features that this is Adrian's son, and he e-mails Veronica an apology, saying he didn't realise that she and Adrian had a son together. Veronica only responds with the reply [...] "You don't get it, but then you never did." [...] On revisiting the pub where he saw the man, Tony gets into conversation with the careworker, which reveals that the man is actually the son of Adrian and Veronica's mother, Sarah, making him Veronica's half-brother. Tony realises that his letter to Adrian, telling him to talk to Sarah, was the cause of the affair they had together, that Sarah's son was born with mental issues because of her advanced age and that Adrian killed himself because he could not face the responsibility.|$|E
