Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E

Jennifer tells him she does not mind of what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E
5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E

5|$|According to Chapter I, Article 28, {{paragraph}} 2 of the Constitution, {{the national}} colors of Poland are white and red. The Coat of Arms Act, Article 4, further specifies that {{the colors are}} white and red in two horizontal, parallel stripes of equal width, of which the top one <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> the bottom one is red. If the colors are displayed vertically, the white stripe {{is placed on the}} left from the onlooker's viewpoint. Attachment no. 2 to the Act shows the national colors in both horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as the official shades of both colors expressed as coordinates in the CIE xyY (CIE 1931) color space with the tolerated color differences (ΔE) specified in the CIE 1976 (L*, u*, v*) color space (CIELUV).|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|In non-breeding plumage, the {{nominate}} has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, {{with the}} colour {{on the upper}} portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts {{on the sides of}} the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast <b>is</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.|$|E

5|$|Irma Johnson is {{the sister}} of the late Warren Johnson and Eve Russell's aunt. When she was young, Eve had a close {{relationship}} with her aunt because of their love of gospel music. Irma is proud of Eve's singing in the church's choir; she discouraged Eve from singing jazz and blues music, calling them sinful. Their relationship became strained when Irma saw a drugged and intoxicated Eve singing in a seedy Boston jazz club and cavorting with several men. Irma disowns Eve when she discovers her relationship with Julian, who <b>is</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> her pregnancy with his child. Eve and Irma did not speak for nearly 20 years. Eve paid for Irma to live in a retirement home, but told everyone she had no living relatives in an attempt to keep her past secret.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius has a {{flattened}} convex cap that is 4–10cm (1.6–4in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands, though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, {{and a very}} brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland. The cap is very slimy when moist and has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5cm (1.6–2in) tall by 1–1.7cm (0.4–0.7in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom. The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run a small way down the stem in attachment, or that they {{are attached to the}} stem by the whole depth of the gills. The milk <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> dries grey, and is very plentiful. L.blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7µm.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} <b>is</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> the oval to oblong spores are 7.5–9.5μm long by 5.0–7.0μm wide. Spores are smooth, hyaline (translucent), nonamyloid, {{and have a}} {{prominent}} hilum. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to club shaped, four spored, and measure 39–50 by 8.0–9.6μm. The cystidia present on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are thin walled, hyaline, have a short stalk and a spherical apical portion, and measure 29–41 by 12–21μm; cystidia are absent from the gill face. The cap cuticle ranges in cellular form from a cutis (in which the hyphae are bent over, running parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (with hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface); the hyphae comprising the cuticle are cylindrical, and measure 2.0–9.0μm wide with a club-shaped tip up to 11μm wide.|$|E
