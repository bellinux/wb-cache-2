40|$|PURPOSE: For nonsurgical {{treatment}} of fractures of the proximal phalanges of the triphalangeal fingers, different dynamic casts have been described. The main principle behind these casts is advancement and tightening of the extensor hood, {{caused by a}} combination of blocking the metacarpophalangeal joints in flexion and actively flexing the proximal interphalangeal joints. In contrast to established treatment protocols using <b>functional</b> forearm <b>casts,</b> the Lucerne cast allows for free mobilization of the wrist joint. The purpose of the current multicenter study was to compare the results of conservative, functional treatment using 2 different methods, either a forearm cast or a Lucerne cast. METHODS: Over a 2 -year-period, a prospective, randomized, multicenter study was conducted at 4 hospitals in Switzerland. Clinical and radiological results of 66 consecutive patients having 75 extra-articular fractures of the proximal phalanges were recorded through a minimum follow-up of 3 months. Intra-articular and physeal fractures, pathological fractures, open fractures, concomitant injuries of the tendons or collateral ligaments, and accidents more than 7 days before presentation were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Radiographically, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of palmar apex angulation and radial or ulnar angulation. There were no differences in total active range of finger motion. Wrist joint motion at the time of cast removal was statistically superior in patients treated with Lucerne cast. However, {{there were no significant differences}} in wrist joint motion at 12 weeks of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and radiological results achieved with the Lucerne cast are comparable to those of established treatment.

40|$|Background: Functional brace {{application}} for isolated humeral shaft fracture persistently yields good results. Nonunion though uncommon involves usually the proximal third shaft fractures. Instead of polyethylene bivalve functional brace four plaster sleeves wrapped and molded {{with little more}} proximal extension expected to prevent nonunion of proximal third fractures. Periodic compressibility of the cast is likely to yield a better result. This can be applied on the 1 st day of the presentation as an outpatient basis. Comprehensive objective scoring system befitting for fracture humeral shaft is a need. Materials and Methods: Sixty six (male = 40, female = 26) unilateral humeral shaft fractures of mean age 34. 4 years (range 11 - 75 years) involving 38 left and 28 right hands were {{included in this study}} during April 2008 to December 2012. Fractures involved proximal (n = 18), mid (n = 35) and distal (n = 13) of humerus. Transverse, oblique, comminuted and spiral orientations in 18, 35 and 13 patients respectively. One had segmental fracture and three had a pathological fracture with cystic bone lesion. Mechanisms of injuries as identified in this study were road traffic accidents 57. 6 % (n = 38), fall 37. 9 % (n = 25). 12. 1 % (n = 8) had radial nerve palsy 7. 6 % (n = 5) had Type I open fracture. Four plaster strips of 12 layers and 5 - 7. 5 cm broad depending on the girth of arm were prepared. Arm was then wrapped with single layer compressed cotton. Lateral and medial strips were applied and then after molding anterior and posterior strips were applied {{in such a way that}} permits full elbow range of motion and partial abduction of the shoulder. Care was taken to prevent adherence of one strip with other except in the proximal end. Limb was then put in loose collar and cuff sling intermittently allowing active motion of the elbow ROM and pendular movement of the shoulder. Weekly tightening of the cast by fresh layers of bandage over the existing cast brace continued. Results: The results were assessed using 100 point scoring system where union allotted 30 points and 60 points allotted for angulations (10), elbow motion (10), shoulder abduction (10), shortening (5), rotation (5), absence of infection (10), absence of nerve palsy during treatment (10). Remaining 10 points were allotted for five items with two points each. They were the absence of skin sore, absence of vascular problem, absence of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), recovery of paralyzed nerve during injury and recovery of paralyzed nerve during treatment. Results were considered excellent with 90 and above, good with 80 - 89, fair with 70 - 79 and poor below 70 point. Results at 6 months were excellent in 43. 94 % (n = 29), good in 42. 42 % (n = 28), fair in 9. 1 % (n = 6), poor in 4. 55 % (n = 3). Union took place in 98. 48 % (n = 65) with an average of 10. 3 weeks (range 6 - 16 weeks). 87. 5 % (n = 7) paralyzed radial nerve recovered. All wounds healed. Four patients had transient skin problem. One patient with mid shaft fracture had nonunion due to the muscle interposition. Conclusion: Modified <b>functional</b> <b>cast</b> brace is one of the options in treatment for humeral shaft fractures as it can be applied on the 1 st day of the presentation in most of the situations.

Humerus shaft fractures are unique among all long bone fractures in having very good results with non-operative methods like hanging <b>cast,</b> <b>functional</b> brace, Velpeau dressing, coaptation splint and abduction cast [3, 4, 5].

This remains a particularly challenging series of interactions to understand, especially given our evolving understanding of Treg and T effector interrelationships, as well as recent insights into <b>functional</b> plasticity that <b>cast</b> doubt upon the wisdom of a strict categorization of T effector cells based on cytokine production...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{presents}} the analyse of aluminium iron cast structure (as-cast condition) {{which are used}} in high temperature. While producing the casts of aluminium iron major influence has been preserve the structure of technological process parameters. The addition to Fe-C-Al alloy V, Ti, Cr leads to the improvement of <b>functional</b> and mechanical <b>cast</b> qualities. In this study, a method was investigated to eliminate the presence of undesirable Al 4 C 3 phases in a aluminium cast iron structure and thus improve the production process. V and Ti additions in aluminium cast iron allows to development of FeAl - VC or TiC alloys. In particular, V or Ti contents above 5 wt. % were found to totally eliminate the presence of Al 4 C 3. In addition, preliminary work indicates that the alloy with the FeAl - VC or TiC structure reveals high oxidation resistance. The introduction of 5 wt. % chromium to aluminium cast iron strengthened Al 4 C 3 precipitate. Thus, the resultant alloy can be considered an intermetallic FeAl matrix strengthened by VC and TiC or modified Al 4 C 3 reinforcements...|$|R
30|$|The shibboleth RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) {{is still}} used despite {{a lack of}} {{evidence}} for the benefit of compression. Conventional treatment includes early mobilization with weight bearing with or without the use of external support. External supports include tape, a brace, or elastic bandages, which are preferred to plaster of Paris (POP) because they gave better functional outcomes in previous studies [5]. A meta-analysis by Kerkhoffs and colleagues [6] showed {{no significant difference in the}} <b>functional</b> outcomes of <b>cast</b> immobilization and <b>functional</b> treatment. Contrary to the results obtained by Kerkhoffs, another study [7] provided evidence from a controlled clinical trial that a below-knee POP cast can increase the rate of healing of the sprained ankle, and they showed that cast immobilization was superior to other treatments during the first three months, but that with other functional treatments were equally effective after 9 months. Although no ankle sprain treatment is currently considered the gold standard, one survey found that functional treatment is being used by nearly 70  % of all doctors [8]. Studies also advocate that surgical management is a good option for sprains that result in instability, but this has not been shown to be superior over other treatments [9, 10].|$|R
40|$|Active edible {{films were}} {{prepared}} by adding carvacrol into sodium caseinate (SC) and calcium caseinate (CC) matrices plasticized with two different glycerol concentrations (25 and 35 wt%) prepared by solvent <b>casting.</b> <b>Functional</b> characterisation of these bio-films {{was carried out}} by determination of some of their physico-chemical properties, such as colour, transparency, oxygen barrier, wettability, dye permeation properties and antibacterial effectiveness against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. All films exhibited good performance in terms of optical properties in the CIELab space showing high transparency. Carvacrol was able to reduce CC oxygen permeability and slightly increased the surface hydrophobicity. Dye diffusion experiments were performed to evaluate permeation properties. The diffusion of dye through films revealed that SC was more permeable than CC. The agar diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the films antimicrobial effectiveness against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Both SC and CC edible films with carvacrol showed inhibitory effects on both bacteria.

5000|$|Littleton and Vogel {{continued}} to produce bags, adding their [...] "Acrobags" [...] and [...] "Imago" [...] series of works (both of which feature small bags balancing {{on top of}} a single large one) in the late 1990s to their continuing line of [...] "Bag Explosions." [...] By mid-decade the artists' cast sculptures focused exclusively on hands and arms posed in the act of proffering an object. Earlier in the decade smooth stones, found by the artists on walks, were the objects of choice; these gave way to hot-worked glass spheres, discs and faceted glass “jewels” made by the artists. After 2006 the artists created cast glass leaves [...] for the hands to uphold. Other objects included electroplated glass snakes, gold electroplated pennies and, in one instance, a decoratively painted violin. In 2006 the artists began to produce <b>functional</b> tables of <b>cast</b> and blown glass supported by a wrought iron armature. The tops of the tables, flat discs cast with the impressions of vines and leaves, were inspired by the artists' trip to Costa Rica. On a tour of the rain forest, high above the ground on a suspended walkway, Littleton and Vogel looked down on a “tangled web of plants that became radial patterns and spirals as the ferns and trees reached for the light.” ...|$|R
