Perennial grass species mixes common to drier and wetter upland areas in northern California were drill seeded at two sites (I- 5 North and I- 5 South) that had been burned in 2003 and received weed control (i. e., herbicide, cultivation, mowing) in spring 2004. Herbicides were the most important treatments for native perennial grass establishment and weed reduction. Native perennial grass species persistence was largely unaffected by cultivation or native plant accessions at these sites. Native perennial grass density increased at I- 5 North in the second year of growth (2006) resulting in a plant density totaled across all herbicide regimes of 3. 9 plants m- 1 compared to 2. 5 plants m- 1 at I- 5 South.

Establishing the architecture of regulatory networks requires gathering information on TFs, their targets in the genome, and the corresponding binding sites. We have developed GRASSIUS (<b>Grass</b> Regulatory Information <b>Services)</b> as a knowledge-based Web resource that integrates information on TFs and gene promoters across the grasses. In its initial implementation, GRASSIUS consists of two separate, yet linked, databases. GrassTFDB holds information on TFs from maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), and rice (Oryza sativa). TFs are classified into families and phylogenetic relationships begin to uncover orthologous relationships among the participating species. This database also provides a centralized clearinghouse for TF synonyms in the grasses. GrassTFDB {{is linked to the}} grass TFome collection, which provides clones in recombination-based vectors corresponding to full-length open reading frames for a growing number of grass TFs. GrassPROMDB contains promoter and cis-regulatory element information for those grass species and genes for which enough data are available.

Community psychologists primarily work in agency settings. Whether working in community health clinics involving in counseling practices and mental health work, or working in government or large social service agencies and doing research on existing social problems or planning and implementing <b>grass</b> roots social <b>service</b> programs. Their work is primarily with the marginalized and less-advantaged areas of society and those who struggle with poverty and discrimination amongst many other social ills. The primary purpose of a these psychologists is to strive for the wellbeing of an individual and society as a whole and to prevent issues from growing and treating them if they exit. The main focus of community psychologists are empowerment, social justice and wellness and prevention programs in community. These are all very broad areas of work that educate citizens to help themselves, their families and their communities to improve both their present and future.

40|$|During {{the past}} three decades, 1. 2 million {{hectares}} of Nepal’s forests have been transferred to community management with the twin objectives of supplying forest products and addressing local environmental problems. Community forests provide a range of benefits, from direct forest products such as timber, fuelwood, fodder, litter and <b>grasses</b> to ecosystem <b>services</b> such as soil protection and wildlife conservation. However, there is limited information {{on the relationship between}} the environmental and the community welfare effects of entrusting forests to communities. This study has analysed the production of natural environmental and direct forest product benefits in CFs, and identified the relationships between the outputs. Community Forest User Groups were surveyed to measure the flow of products from their community forests. Environmental benefits were measured using a novel application of the Analytic Network Process (ANP). The ANP is generally executed by taking expert opinions; however, this study has taken forest user member’s opinions. The stochastic frontier production analysis indicated that the production of direct forest product benefits per hectare was influenced by various socioeconomic and forest related factors, most prominently forest size, group heterogeneity, forest product dependency, size of community and links to the market. In addition, forest product benefits and environmental benefits were complementary to each other. Likewise, the production efficiency analysis showed that communities were not producing forest products efficiently. It also showed that factors such as social capital, support from the government and the longevity of CF management, contributed positively to the production efficiency, whereas caste heterogeneity in the executive committees of community forest user groups was negatively associated. It is anticipated that these findings will contribute to better implementation of community forestry programmes in Nepal and consequently will improve the welfare of communities by increasing direct forest product benefits and environmental benefits...|$|R

However within 65 years thematernal deaths were reduced to 1 in 10, 000 deliveries. How Sri Lanka achieved this substantial reductionwith minimal health expenditure?The national health policy of Sri Lanka was instrumental in reducing the maternal mortality by providingthe optimal care during pregnancy, labour and afterwards by skilled health personnel. The health care is absolutely free in Sri Lanka. This made all the low income people to have easy accessto the hospitals. Free health by the state, infrastructure facilities to provide health <b>services</b> at the <b>grass</b> rootlevel, health <b>services</b> by the well trained Family Health Workers (FHW- filed midwives) in remote ruralareas, child births mostly at hospitals and liberal use of contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnanciesare the key success in minimizing maternal deaths in Sri Lanka.

40|$|Impact {{of cattle}} {{stocking}} rate, under grazing, during autumn on potential nitrogen leaching: reference values {{established in the}} south-east of Belgium. Grassland, which accounts for half of the agricultural area in Wallonia, forms the basis of many ecosystemic services: cultural, <b>grass</b> production, regulatory <b>services,</b> etc. Nevertheless, the poor ability of cattle to fix ingested nitrogen leads to significant N rejection during grazing. N is excreted in concentrated form via urine, and thus becomes unevenly distributed within the paddock. This phenomenon {{increases the risk of}} N leaching in grazed grasslands, especially if urine deposit occurs later during the grazing season, in the autumn. It is therefore necessary to specify good livestock management practices, with particular reference to the livestock stocking rate to be applied during autumn grazing. This ensures the reconciliation of both animal and environmental performance. With this aim, a study was performed over a five-year period, during the autumn, to test the impact of the livestock stocking rate on the risk of nitrate leaching in grazed grassland, in the Jurassic area of south-east Belgium. A gradient of stocking rate was established, ranging between 150 and 350 BLU grazing days·ha- 1. Results underlined a highly significant impact of the "year" factor on potentially leached nitrogen (APL), ranging between 9 (2010) and 23 (2005) kg of N-NO 3 -·ha- 1. The impact of the stocking rate was only marginally significant. Whatever the year or the stocking rate, the recorded APL level never represented a significant risk to water resources, and this was in spite of a relatively high stocking rate {{at the end of the}} grazing season. This low impact of the stocking rate could be explained by the type of cattle (beef breed heifers and dry cows) mobilized in order to apply these end-of-season stocking rates. A further explanation could lie in the addition of hay to the cattle's diet in order to achieve the highest stocking rates. Higher level of APL would be expected under grazing with dairy cows...|$|R

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Prior to their eradication in 1987, feral pigs (Sus scrofa) were a common source of ground disturbance in the mountain parkland ecosystem of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, especially in grasslands. In 1985 - 1986, 27, 2 x 5 m plots were established in 9 open, grassy sites recently damaged by pigs. No pig digging occurred after the plots were initially established. The purpose of monitoring vegetation changes was to evaluate the efficacy of pig control in promoting community recovery and to detect any changes that might need further management intervention. Percent cover of plants was determined by point-intercept methods, and woody plants were counted in height classes in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989, and 1992. The 27 plots were stratified into 5 plant communities based on a Braun-Blanquet analysis of surrounding vegetation, and successional changes were graphed. Deschampsia nubigena, a native bunchgrass, consistently increased in cover in most communities where it was originally a dominant or codominant species in surrounding vegetation. It did not increase in cover where it was initially a minor component. These trends suggest that Deschampsia will continue to increase in importance. Velvet grass (Holcus lanatus), the main competitor with Deschampsia in mid and upper elevation sites, recovered rapidly at first but generally declined from its maximum cover after 2 - 4 years. However, Holcus cover may be stable at upper elevation sites where it was dominant prior to disturbance. In lower and mid elevation sites, Holcus species may continue to decline in importance, while other alien grass species, e. g., sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum ordoratum) and beardgrass (Schizachyrium condensatum), show signs of becoming more abundant. There was some recruitment of native shrubs in the disturbed areas, especially at lower elevations. Koa (Acacia koa), a root-sprouting, clonal tree in the study area, invaded many sites.

40|$|Six {{livestock}} owners, who {{are commonly}} used as demonstrators, {{participated in the study}} of which three were from communal areas and three from freehold farms in the Ganyesa area. The livestock production potential in communal areas was compared with that of freehold farms. Information on livestock production, veld condition, Dry matter, crude protein- content of natural <b>grasses</b> and extension <b>services</b> were determined and evaluated for each study area. The result of this study revealed that because of variation in climate, Ganyesa is classified as semi- arid and is mainly suitable for livestock production. The result further revealed that there were major constraints in livestock production in the study area and these were related to land tenure system and poor livestock production. In both communal areas and freehold farms, farmers were unable to invest in infrastructural development and this immensely affected production, and led to over-grazing. The performance of the herds (calving %) in communal areas was low (54 %) as compared to that on the freehold farms (6 %). However, the results revealed that more calves that were born lived up to weaning (85 % in communal areas, 90 % on freehold farms) and this compared favourably with results from other areas. Herd mortality rates for both communal (2 %) and freehold farms (2 %) were reported to be low. The performance of smallstock was somehow lower than expected for both communal and freehold farms. The lambing kidding percentage was low (62 % and 69 %, respectively) and mortality rates were somewhat high (to % and 23 % respectively). This means that many lambs/kids died due to diseases and malnutrition and thus did not reach a weaning age. Forage DM production was reported to be higher on freehold farms than in communal areas, and this supported the argument that the latter areas are over-stocked. The CP¬content of forage was high for freehold farms during December - January and low during July - August. The CP -values of forage for freehold farms were higher than those for communal areas with the highest figures recorded during January. The veld condition score was reasonable on freehold farms with a high percentage of desirable grass species (28 %) and low in communal areas (22 %) with high percentage of undesirable grass species (52 %) recorded by the latter. The results of this study revealed that all samples recorded high strontium (Sr) values, indicating likely contamination of the borehole sites. The high levels of titanium (Ti) and barium (Ba) on freehold farms may indicate a possibility of industrial pollution of boreholes. Most of the water sources sampled may also be utilised by humans for drinking, food preparation and drinking purposes with detrimental effects. In view of these constraints, some recommendations were made. Dissertation (M Inst Agrar (Animal Production)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005. Animal and Wildlife Sciencesunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|SOCIAL JUSTICE, HEALTH AND POVERTY IN UGANDA John Barugahare Injustice in Uganda manifests in many ways. One most serious, yet least {{discussed}} social injustice, is inequity in Health. Although {{there are}} two equally important aims of health systems – efficiency and equity, in Uganda too much {{focus has been on}} ensuring efficiency and as a consequence concerns of equity have been relegated. Ultimately, health policy in Uganda has disproportionately negatively affected the poor’s livelihoods in general and the trend seems to be worsening by day. Even though it is possible to borrow a leaf from the Western literature on how to design a good health policy, low income countries like Uganda have special features that render the extrapolation of the Western input good but not enough. In particular, these special features are the level of resource constraints, poverty and the financing mechanism of health care services. These three have very serious implications for equity in health. In general, {{there is a lot of}} injustice in the Uganda health care and this has been mainly due to poverty levels and the financing mechanism which the system relies on. Hence, there is an urgent need to concentrate on a discussion of injustice in health because health enhances people’s functionings and is a mandatory condition for people’s enjoyment of other life opportunities to the extent that if a section of a society is made to suffer injustice in health, this will translate into injustice in all the dimensions of their lives. This is something that fair‐minded people cannot afford to live with for long. Therefore, it is important in this work to illustrate how the above three special features play to cause and sustain inequity in Uganda health care system and to  suggest the starting point to overcoming this injustice, not only in Uganda but as a general trend in health policy analysis. THE POLITICS OF RESTORING ETHICS AND THE CHALLENGE OF PATRIOTISM IN SERVICE DELIVERY IN UGANDA’S PUBLIC SERVICE Dickson Kanakulya Reports indicate that there is an erosion of professionalism and ethics across most of the East African public service systems and this is limiting the efficient service delivery and negatively impacts on social justice. Because of this challenge many approaches are being applied to mitigate it, such as the institutional, legal, cultural and the political. This paper discusses the political approach and particularly problematizes the political push for patriotism in Uganda. Most of the critique and analysis was done while carrying out research and consultancy with Makerere Centre for Applied Ethics (MACAE) in selected districts in Uganda under the project “Pro‐poor Integrity” (PPI) funded by Tiri and DFID. The paper argues that the government’s policy of patriotism is more of politicking than real improvement of service delivery to the people. Political interference in public service has engendered a culture of impunity and increased unethical conduct among ‘politically‐connected’ civil servants right from the <b>grass</b> root <b>service</b> to the top administration, The paper argues that if ethics in Uganda’s public administration is to improve politicians ought  to be divorce party‐biased ideology from the patriotism discourse such that it can appeal to a wider spectrum of Ugandans. PERSISTENT COLONIAL COERCION IN CONTEMPORARY UGANDA: FOUNDATION OF SOCIAL INJUSTICES IN THE COUNTRY Gervase Tusabe Since 1962, all Uganda’s major centres of power i. e., political, economic and military have always been dominated by a chosen few, and the attendant wealth that goes with such powers has always been disproportionately enjoyed in favour of these chosen few when a considerable large number of people in the country are living under the weight of abject poverty. The major argument advanced in this paper is that the fundamental cause of this experience of injustice in Uganda is the persistent domestic colonial mode of political administration that is managed by a particular closed group of individuals who more or less conspired to work together to promote their self‐centred interests at the cost of deliberately ignoring the legitimate interests of the Ugandans who are outside their group. STRUCTURAL INJUSTICES AND THE ETHICS OF ENGENDERING POVERTY ERADICATION POLICIES IN UGANDA Michael George Kizito Since time immemorial, poverty reduction interventions in Sub‐Saharan Africa like everywhere in the South, have focused on the individual as the basic ingredient of a moral society (ethical individualism). According to this perspective, in order to lift human persons out of poverty, it is imperative to integrate poor persons into poverty eradication interventions irrespective of sex, social status and gender. Scholars and institutions that subscribed to this conception of poverty thought that individuals were poor because of personal weaknesses (case poverty). This perspective has been greatly challenged due to the upsurge of gender and human rights scholarship in the 20 th century. Gender scholars have painstakingly argued that in order to understand poverty, we need to look at society (ethical collectivism). They have rejected the Women in Development(WID) discourse that aims at integrating women into the development process in favour of the Gender and Development(GAD) approach to development and poverty reduction that aims at confronting power relations between men and women (empowerment). This GAD perspective looks at poverty in terms of the powerlessness speared head by prevailing structures in society (structural poverty) and hence the need to empower vulnerable persons such as women to challenge structures and strictures of oppression. The International Monetary fund (IMF) and World Bank as vehement promoters of economism in Sub‐Saharan Africa for decades have urged governments to include the perspectives of the poor in poverty polices through what they call participatory poverty assessments (PPAs). Despite its deceptive appearance, this PPAs stance of the IMF and World Bank tacitly looks at poverty as a case and not structural issue and that is why Uganda’s ambitious poverty reduction policy though greatly informed by Participatory Poverty Assessments greatly ignores structures and strictures that render women vulnerable to poverty. This paper critically assesses the obliviousness of Uganda’s Agricultural poverty policy to structures and how this has militated on the gender poverty production in Uganda. The paper contends that in order to realise engendered poverty eradication in Uganda, it is pertinent for the agricultural policy to ultimately make paradigm shift from focusing on the individual as the basic ingredient of a moral society (ethical individualism) to confronting structures and strictures that disempower and vulnerablelise individual moral agents (ethical collectivism).
