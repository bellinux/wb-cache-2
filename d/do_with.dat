The remainder of the cases consisted of arm veins, bank veins and superficial femoral veins.

40|$|Aim:-The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of instrument design on inducing root fracture. Methodology:- 60 single rooted premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were collected. Periapical radiographs were taken from the proximal view to eliminate any teeth with double canal morphology. Each specimen was decoronated 2 mm coronal to cementoenamel junction with the help of diamond disc Specimens were divided into 6 groups of 10 teeth each and instrumentation was <b>done</b> <b>with</b> files of different designs by Crown-down technique. Group 1 -Instrumentation was <b>done</b> <b>with</b> stainless steel K hand files Group 2 -Instrumentation was <b>done</b> <b>with</b> stainless steel H hand files.
