40|$|I analyse {{congestion}} {{costs in}} the Vickrey bottleneck model of a congestible facility with a peak load in demand. The shape of the peak is endogenous, being the sum of <b>individual</b> <b>scheduling</b> decisions. Capacity and demand are random, which introduces uncertainty into the <b>individual</b> <b>scheduling</b> choices. These are essential features of actual peak loads. Based on work by Arnott, de Palma and Lindsey, I derive the expected marginal and total congestion costs and compare to the case with fixed capacity and demand. Using stylised values for scheduling costs relative {{to the value of}} time, I find that randomness of capacity and demand increases congestions cost by up to 50 percent relative to the deterministic case. The bound is general for any distribution of random capacity and demand. ...|$|R

All sensors outside the work pattern can enter into sleeping model for maximal energy saving. However, if only one working pattern is used, network lifetime equals to the time duration until the first node dies. However, due to spatial redundancy of sensors, lifetime can be prolonged by switching among different working patterns subject to energy constraints. Note that we assume that through some synchronization technologies implemented in the link layer a sensor can change states smoothly and punctually according to its <b>individual</b> <b>schedule,</b> which implies smooth transition among working patterns.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a Data Envelopment {{analysis}} based Genetic Algorithm (DEA-GA) {{is proposed}} for multi-objective scheduling on Chip-Multiprocessor. The proposal adopts modified GA as the searching heuristic {{to explore the}} solution space, and the fitness of each <b>individual</b> (<b>schedule)</b> is evaluated using the DEA approach. Three of the schedule metrics, namely makespan, energy and load balance are used to construct the multi-input multi-output Decision Making Units in the DEA, and the BCC super efficiency of each schedule is calculated. In the modified genetic algorithm, the metapopulation {{is divided into three}} subpopulations each optimizing a single metric. The top performance individuals in each subpopulation are then regrouped and applied DEA evaluation. Comparing to other multi-objective scheduling algorithm in simulations, our proposal always produces more efficient schedule solutions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Patient-scheduling in {{hospitals}} {{is a complex}} task which requires new computational methods, e. g. market mechanisms and enhanced support by software agents. These demands are addressed by the MedPAge-Project (Medical Path Agents) which covers {{the development of a}} multiagent -system for which an agent oriented specification will be presented. Firstly, based on field studies in five German hospitals, the hospital domain is analysed (c. f. [9]). In this domain analysis, a generic hospital structure is derived and the relevant co-ordination objects for patient-scheduling are identified. Secondly, hospital specific scheduling problems are discussed. On the foundation of this domain analysis, the architecture of the MedPAge multi-agent-system is developed, taking actual agent-oriented methodologies into account. The agents, consisting of an <b>individual</b> <b>schedule</b> and utility function, are modeled and the co-ordination mechanism, determining the agent interactions, is described. ...|$|E

In this paper we present a mixed-initiative system for the task of schedule maintenance in a simulated shipping network.

The goal is to maximize throughput while minimizing disruptions to the original schedule. We present results of experiments in which human subjects attempt to obtain that goal both with and {{without the aid of}} the agent. We found that the human and the agent working together are able to achieve better results than either one working alone.

Coverage List automatically links each patient to the proper resident when the patient is admitted, and updates the linkage whenever the resident coverage changes due to night or weekend coverage, physician illness, changes in clinical rotations, and other factors. Using this association, decision-support applications that detect significant clinical events can transmit them directly to the responsible resident. Sign-out and patient-review systems, which collect information on all of a physician's patients, always know the patients for whom that physician is responsible. Nurses who need to contact a physician about a patient issue always know which physician is covering that patient. Coverage List also manages schedule entry and display for physicians, or for any other staff members.
