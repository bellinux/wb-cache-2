50|$|By the mid-1860s, {{drought and}} {{recession}} {{had led to}} a collapse in the pastoral industry in north Queensland. In order to salvage some profit, squatters turned to the boiling down of sheep and cattle for tallow (for candles and soap). <b>Hoofs</b> <b>and</b> <b>horns</b> were utilised for oil, and hides for leather. In 1864 a number of small-scale boiling down works were established on pastoral properties in the Kennedy and gulf districts, but the boiling down industry became more professional in 1866, when Towns & Co. opened a boiling down plant at Cleveland Bay, and Morehead & Young, partners in the Scottish Australian Pastoral Company, opened a similar operation on the Albert River where the settlement of Burketown had been established in 1865. Neither of these establishments survived {{for any length of}} time. At Cleveland Bay, the Queensland Meat Export Company established a meatworks south of Townsville on Alligator Creek in 1879, using some of the equipment from Towns' factory.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathy. Genetic and iatrogenic forms {{have been}} recognised {{but most are}} sporadic and of unknown cause. We have studied risk factors for CJD {{as part of the}} 1993 - 95 European Union collaborative studies of CJD in Europe. METHODS: The 405 patients with definite or probable CJD who took part in our study had taken part in population-based studies done between 1993 and 1995 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. Data on putative risk factors from these patients were compared with data from 405 controls. FINDINGS: We found evidence for familial aggregation of CJD with dementia due to causes other than CJD (relative risk [RR] 2. 26, 95 % CI 1. 31 - 3. 90). No significant increased risk of CJD in relation to a history of surgery and blood transfusion was shown. There was no evidence for an association between the risk of CJD and the consumption of beef, veal, lamb, cheese, or milk. No association was found with occupational exposure to animals or leather. The few positive findings of the study include increased risk in relation to consumption of raw meat (RR 1. 63 [95 % CI 1. 18 - 2. 23]) and brain (1. 68 [1. 18 - 2. 39]), frequent exposure to leather products (1. 94 [1. 13 - 3. 33]), and exposure to fertiliser consisting of <b>hoofs</b> <b>and</b> <b>horns</b> (2. 32 [1. 38 - 2. 91]). Additional analyses, for example stratification by country and of exposures pre- 1985 and post- 1985, suggest that these results should be interpreted with great caution. INTERPRETATION: Within the limits of the retrospective design of the study, our findings suggest that genetic factors other than the known CJD mutations may play an important part in CJD. Iatrogenic transmission of disease seems rare in this large population-based sample of patients with CJD. There is little evidence for an association between the risk of CJD and either animal exposure, or consumption of processed bovine meat or milk products for the period studied...|$|E

Later, the term was applied to the partially purified similar products of the action of heat on nitrogenous animal matter generally. Finally, the term was applied to any aqueous solution of ammonia.|$|R
