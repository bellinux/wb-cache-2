40|$|The {{occurrence}} of process-related discontinuities and minor {{flaws in the}} interior of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> cannot be fully avoided during the manufacturing process. Obviously, these microscopic defects affect the material properties of the casting near locations where they occur. However, their very occurrence does not necessarily deteriorate the stability of the entire casting element. Unfortunately, current testing approaches do not integrate a reliable and customized case-by-case quality assessment. Consequently, manufacturers usually apply a general, rather expensive and resource-intensive <b>finishing</b> of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> components. Our research is aimed at making best use of the available material and avoiding such potentially unnecessary finishing steps. For this purpose, non-destructive testing (NDT) is combined with fracture mechanical assessments allowing us to assess the quality of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> in a reliable way. As a first step of our proposed approach, a reliable process needs to be developed to determine realistic standard defect sizes and material parameters as basis for subsequent fracture mechanical assessments of <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> To this end, we determined quantitatively the 3 D distribution of microscopic defects and material parameters in representative <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> samples using innovative, volume-oriented NDT methods (e. g., ultrasonic testing using the phased-array technique and high-energy x-ray tomography). In this paper we compare and discuss the results obtained with the aforementioned methods to verify the validity of the proposed NDT approach. Furthermore, our work provides the basis for an improved correlation between existing quality classes and the real defect pattern in <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> and, thereby, contributes fundamentally to an optimal use of the resource steel...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The inverse problem {{consisting}} in {{the identification}} of volumetric latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> is presented. Additionally it is assumed that the courses of temperature at the points from the casting or mould are known. The substitute thermal capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> (this parameter is directly connected with the latent heat) is approximated by the fourth-degree polynomial. In order to solve the inverse problem the least squares criterion containing the sensitivity coefficients is applied. In the final part of the paper the results of computations are shown. Design/methodology/approach: In this work numerical modelling of solidification process is applied. A <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> solidifying in a sand mould is analyzed. The information concerning the course of cooling curve at the selected point from the casting domain is used in order to identify the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast.</b> Findings: It is shown that only one sensor located at the optional point from casting or mould domain gives the information sufficient for successful identification of unknown parameter. Research limitations/implications: Further work requires an introducing of real temperature measurements to the model presented. Practical implications: The paper shows the possibilities of thermophysical parameters identification on the basis of temperature measurements. In the case considered the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> has been identified. Originality/value: The algorithm presented allows to identify the latent heat {{in the case of the}} complex, temperature dependent function determining the substitute thermal capacity of metallic alloy...|$|R
