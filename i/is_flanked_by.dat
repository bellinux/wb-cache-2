Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.|$|E
5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure <b>is</b> <b>flanked</b> <b>by</b> two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band <b>is</b> <b>flanked</b> <b>by</b> two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

We have sequenced the junctions between an ALSV (Avian Leukemia and Sarcoma Viruses) -based vector and quail DNA from five individual proviruses. Three proviruses <b>were</b> <b>flanked</b> <b>by</b> the expected 6 -bp duplication of host DNA, whereas the two others <b>were</b> <b>flanked</b> <b>by</b> a 5 -bp duplication. Nucleotide sequencing {{of the native}} integration sites of these two proviruses showed that these integrations had occurred at the immediate vicinity of either a CA or a TG dinucleotide, revealing striking microhomologies between the integration sites and viral LTR ends. These results suggest that size duplication of the target DNA might be influenced by nucleotidic sequence {{at the site of}} integration...|$|R
