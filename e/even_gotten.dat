2500|$|Blaxploitation was {{the first}} {{exploitation}} genre to {{picked up by the}} major studios in a substantial way. Indeed, the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, is seen as the first significant film of the type. Crossing over before the genre had <b>even</b> <b>gotten</b> established, Laurence Merrick's micro-budget independent The Black Angels (aka Black Bikers from Hell; 1970) followed by a few months. But the movie regarded as truly igniting the blaxploitation phenomenon, again completely independent, came the following year: Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form—wildly experimental in style, borderline pornographic ("Rated X by an All White Jury," [...] declared the ads), and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with the last-minute help of a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby. It premiered in April 1971, distributed by Cinemation Industries, a small company then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane [...] "shockumentaries" [...] and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill, as well as for its one in-house production, The Man from O.R.G.Y. (1970). These were the sort of films that played in the [...] "grindhouses" [...] of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather specializing in all manner of exploitation cinema. As director Quentin Tarantino describes in a 2007 interview, [...] "Grindhouses were usually in the ghetto. Or they were the big old downtown movie theaters that sometimes stayed open all night long, for all the bums. At the grindhouse that I went to, every week there was the new kung fu movie, or new car-chase movie, or new sexploitation movie, or blaxploitation movie." [...] The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a sketch}} called [...] "Conan O'Brien Hates My Homeland", Conan mocked every {{nation in the}} world to see which ones he gets letters from. An {{announcer}} on the Finnish entertainment channel SubTV, which airs the show {{a couple of days after}} it is aired in the USA, asked people to defend Finland before Conan got to insult it, and the viewers in Finland began sending mail before the bit had <b>even</b> <b>gotten</b> to the letter F. Conan responded by assuming the Finnish [...] "just couldn't wait" [...] to be insulted and officially insulted Finland in the segment. An overwhelming number of postcards were supposedly received, which apparently [...] "forced" [...] Conan to give Finland a formal apology. Conan then went as far as to have the flag of Finland shown in the background during a speech and slandered the Finns' [...] "hated" [...] neighbor Sweden with a sign saying [...] "Sweden Sucks!" [...] printed over the flag of Sweden. It would seem that this chain of events led to elevated ratings in Finland and subsequently also sparked a special relationship with the viewers in Finland. Later when Conan was talking to audience members before the show, a group of fans visiting from Finland commented that he resembled their female president Tarja Halonen. [...] Conan mentioned the resemblance on his show, even showing pictures of Halonen next to himself. [...] When he discovered that Halonen was up for reelection he began making satirical commercials in support of Halonen and vowed to travel to Finland to meet her if she won re-election. When she did indeed win re-election in January 2006, Conan traveled to Finland and met with her. One episode, broadcast on March 10, 2006, was compiled mainly of footage from O'Brien's trip to Finland. [...] In the episode, Conan greeted fans at the airport, participated in a Sami cultural ceremony, appeared on a Finnish talk show, and attempted to visit a fan who had written to him. The episode was not strictly taped as a live episode there, however, but was prefaced by an introduction by O'Brien taped in New York. The Finland episode came as the culmination of a long-running joke on the show.|$|E

50|$|Organized {{crime in}} Brazil {{has been active}} for several years now.

The organized crime consists of illegal arms dealing and drug traffiking. Government officials are said to be involved with these illegal acts as well. In 2006, 74 city police officers in Rio de Janeiro were arrested for involvement in these same crimes of illgal arms dealing and drug traffiking. In 2007, 40 people were arrested including judges, lawyers, and police officers for being involved in these crimes as well. People have been killed for disagreeing with local gangs.

Opat insisted the new neighborhood should offer home buyers a variety of housing that would be affordable to middle-class residents, provide enhanced views of Shingle Creek, and fit into the scale of homes found on Victory Memorial Drive. In 2000, work began to remove about 212 existing single family homes {{and replace them with}} about 270 new single family homes and townhomes, building value and enhancing the existing tax base through investment in parks and improved infrastructure. “I think the results are great, especially the public open spaces,” Opat has said. “Humboldt Avenue is terrific, after we gave it a curving look, streetscaping and bike paths.

Meera is stunned, and the two lie to both Jo and Vikram to spend time with each other. They realize how much they still like each other's company.

50|$|The {{day that}} Acting Lt. Jim Chee, of the Navajo Tribal Police, {{is called to}} Yells Back Butte by Officer Benny Kinsman, only to find Hopi eagle poacher Robert Jano {{standing}} over Kinsman’s bleeding body, is {{the same day that}} Catherine Pollard, a vector analyst from the Arizona Health Department, vanishes from Yells Back (along with her Jeep) while she’s looking for fleas—particularly the fleas that may have carried the antibiotic-resistant plague germs that killed Anderson Nez. So even though ex-Lt. Joe Leaphorn has retired from the Tribal Police (The Fallen Man, 1996), he’s back on the job, looking for Pollard at the request of her wealthy aunt. The murder case couldn’t seem simpler; Jano’s <b>even</b> <b>gotten</b> his blood obligingly mixed with his victim’s on both their clothing, and his claim that they were both nipped by an eagle isn’t borne out by the eagle on the scene, which doesn’t show a trace of blood itself. But Jano’s public defender—who just happens to be Chee’s off-again fiance Janet Pete, returned from hobnobbing in Washington, D.C., to the Rez, but not to Chee’s arms—insists that her client is innocent; Leaphorn’s crisscrossing investigation keeps turning up evidence that the murder and the disappearance are {{two sides of the same}} coin; and an ambitious prosecutor is so eager for a capital conviction that there’s got to be something funny. Chee brings it all, including his relationship with Janet, to a climax with a theatrical coup that would put a lesser writer on the map all by itself—and that reminds you, in case you’ve forgotten, that Hillerman’s mysteries are in a class of their own.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the main}} {{shopping}} center that serves the Avondale neighborhood. It {{is located at the}} corner of Queens Chapel Road and Chillum Road. This shopping center has been home to a Giant Food Store from the mid 1950's to April 4, 2013. The Avondale Giant was supposedly one of the first Giant Food stores to open in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.

The Giant has been the main tenant of the shopping center for roughly six decades. Many senior citizens and longtime residents of the Avondale and Mount Rainier communities, have been relying on this Giant for many years to buy their groceries. When this Giant finally decided to close its doors on April 4, 2013, it faced backlash from the seniors and long time residents of Avondale and Mount Rainier. It was the only convenient place for them to buy groceries across the street. A Price Rite Supermarket has occupied Giant's space in the shopping center after it closed. Another store that closed after being in the shopping center for a long time was Fleischer's Jewelers. In addition to Giant and Fleischer's Jewelers, the shopping center was also home to a CVS Pharmacy store (formerly the People's Drug Store), Game Stop store, Hearty's ll Chinese Restaurant, Payless Shoe Store, and Checkers Fast Food Restaurant.
