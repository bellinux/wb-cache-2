40|$|Many {{statutory}} solvency requirements, e. g. {{the system}} prescribed by the EU, {{do not take}} into account the distribution of the investments.

First, the paper describes the use of an asset liability simulation model for the calcula-tion for the solvency margin. Then some formulas are developed for approximating the simulation results. These formulas depend on the means, standard deviations and cor-relation coefficients of the investment yields, as well as on the chosen risk level.

The main result is that the taxation of banks' profit is equivalent to a taxation on loans and as such it exerts a substantial impact on the composition of banking sector revenues. However credit intermediaries have the ability to shift a substantial part of their corporate income tax burden and therefore differences in the level of taxation cannot explain the dispersion observed in banks' net profitability across industrialized countries.

Our results, over the period 1997 - 2006, show that an increase in foreign intermediaries’ market share leads to a less stable market share index.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} to support the theory that, in Italy, {{over the course of the}} past two years, even though a considerable slowdown in bank lending has been recorded, there has not been a credit crunch. After a first section dedicated to a descriptive analysis of the data, the paper presents an econometric estimation of the production sector’s demand for bank loans. An Error Correction Model (ECM) is used – estimated for the pre-crisis period (1998. Q 2 – 2007. Q 2) and applied both with the one and two step procedure – which considers lending as a function of the added value of the private sector, of the gross operating margin to nominal added value ratio (a proxy for self-financing) and of the real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>applied</b> to loans. To test the robustness of the results obtained in the first specification of the model, we remove the assumption of weak exogeneity of the independent variables of the single equation model and construct a multivariate multi-equation model (VECM). All of the different approaches and methods adopted provided similar results: as expected, the demand for credit increases as real added value increases and decreases as the cost of lending and self-financing increase. The dynamic out-of-sample forecast of the model, relating to the two-year period of economic and financial crisis (2007. Q 3 – 2009. Q 2), shows that the actual loan stock remained well above the “theoretical” level forecasted on the basis of the functional relationships estimated before the crisis. This delta (which can be defined as “extra-credit”) is interpreted as the outcome of a rightward shift of the credit supply curve, rather than a leftward shift as would have happened in a credit crunch scenario. ...|$|E
40|$|Countries in the European Monetary Union {{have been}} {{divided into two}} major blocks {{according}} {{to their ability to}} respect fiscal criteria and ensure sound public finance. The widespread belief is that this ability influences the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> financial markets <b>apply,</b> the sustainability of deficit and debt and the long-run growth. As a consequence, some countries are asked to achieve severe retrenchment to restore confidence. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that the financial stability is realized at expenses of a lower targeted output, rather than representing the premise of a greater growth. When a negative shock occurs the deficit/GDP ratio goes up and sends the signal that governments are loosening their fiscal stance, so that financial markets increase the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>applied.</b> Due to aggregate demand effect of the sharp increase in refinancing costs, deficit grows greater and greater causing unsustainability of public finance. Hence national policy authorities, following Emu prescriptions, accept to reduce public expenditure regardless the level of output and employment to be reached. They face the choice either to target a lower output or to devalue the currency, but the uncertainty of cost of exiting from the EMU makes devaluation highly unlikely and causes a passive acceptance of fiscal retrenchments...|$|R
