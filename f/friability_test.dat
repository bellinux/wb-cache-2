40|$|Abstract:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of particle size distribution on the mechanical properties of granular sulphur and its relation to silo blockage at South Pars Gas Complex Phases 2 & 3. Solid elemental sulphur is a relatively hard, friable crystalline material that tends to break up into smaller particles when subjected to force or stress of any magnitude. Conglomeration of the dust so produced clogs storage silos, making truck loading difficult. Grain size selection is based on the “friability value ” and “maximum entropy ” for granules in a static state. The model of the behavior of confined granular sulphur is based on the principle of continuum mechanics. Granules were formed by feeding liquid sulphur and water to a rotating granulation drum. Sample granules were classified into different size fractions (300 µm – 4. 75 mm) by sieve analysis, and <b>friability</b> <b>tests</b> were done by the Fines 28 -inch tumbler S 5 - 77 <b>test.</b> <b>Friability</b> and granule size data collected over four years were studied.

For this study pristine and accelerated aged RDX-based polymer bonded explosives (PBX) have been subjected to laboratory and insensitive munition (IM) related tests such as cook-off and fragment impact tests. The study showed that ageing has an effect on the PBX {{in the way that the}} PBX becomes more stiff, has less elasticity and shows first indications of damage. These features have been revealed by means of gas-dilatometry and <b>friability</b> <b>test</b> series. Both methods are good candidates in the methodology for the surveillance of energetic materials (EM) for IM in the future. The aged PBX investigated in the Dutch program, showed a minor increase in sensitivity in the slow cook-off and fragment impact test which is fully in agreement with the results of the <b>friability</b> <b>test.</b> In the impact test, the reaction below the shock limit of aged material was more violent than the reaction of the pristine material. However, in order to draw conclusions on this phenomenon also the results of the experimental work of the other nations in this cooperation should be analysed. Due to an unexpected detonation in one of the test series, it was shown that several other aspects have a major influence on the sensitivity of the EM. Purity of the components in the EM (including that of the crystals), polymer-crystal bonding, production process, crystal defects and the properties of the pre-polymer all might have an effect on the sensitivity of the EM and the consequences of these effects will most likely be enhanced with ageing.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of Na-alginate and hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) polymer combination of Aceclofenac floating pellets. The Aceclofenac pellets were prepared with two different grades of HPMC polymers in the ratio of 2 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1. 5 : 1. 5 respectively while the amounts of Na-alginate used in the formulations was 3. 50, 5. 25 and 7. 0 g. Prepared pellets were evaluated by Particle size and Morphology, Contraction ratio, Moisture content, <b>Friability</b> <b>Test,</b> Swelling study, Buoyancy time and floating time of the pellets were examined on the basis of polymer concentration. The contraction ratio of the particle was highest when pellets were prepared with 1. 5 % Na- alginate solution and the polymer ratio was 1 : 2 (BX, BY, BZ). In case of Buoyancy of Pellets, When Alginate concentration was 1 % and HPMC K 4 M and HPMC K 100 LV ratio was 2 : 1 then, the Aceclofenac pellets were not floated for long time. When the concentration of Na-Alginate increased to 1. 5 %, 2 %, then all pellets were floated. In case of swelling study, CY, BZ, CZ showed highest swelling of approximately 8 % when Na-alginate concentration was (1. 5 %, 2 %, 2 %) and BY and CY batches showed lowest swelling of 2. 9 % at 4 hrs when Na-alginate concentration was 1. 5 %. Friability values for each formulation were recorded in table the values of the preferred formulas are within acceptable limit. Thus, the selection and use of suitable polymers in appropriate ratio is very important in designing floating pellets of Aceclofenac...|$|E
40|$|The ever growing {{importance}} of humans {{to depend on}} renewable resources has shifted the focus of consumers, producers, and even politicians to more sustainable answers. Furthermore, pressure on the {{oil and natural gas}} industry has elevated the status of biopolymers in this regard. Polylactic acid (PLA) is unique polymer that offers unique abilities for tailored property derivation; thereby, enabling one to replace many engineered polymers and provide a sustainable solution as a nontoxic renewable resource. As a bioplastic, the tailoring of PLA under various conditions is important to the application and integration into current industry uses. After irradiating high molecular weight PLA in increments of 10 kGy to 100 kGy, the molecule changes can be evaluated through viscometry and <b>friability</b> <b>testing</b> to optimize material properties. The change in molecular weight of irradiated samples was evaluated through dilute solution viscometry, and friability was evaluated based upon generation of fine particulates under fixed milling conditions. As the high molecular weight PLA was irradiated from 0 kGy to 100 kGy the relative viscosity (RV) decreased with increasing dose. The initial RV of 3. 52 for 0 kGy conditions dropped to 1. 62 after a dose of 100 kGy. The decrease in relative viscosity correlated directly with increasing friability and generation of fine powders. Such controlled tailoring of PLA should permit the user to derive a suitable formulation pertaining to its durability in different operational conditions. Food packaging and medical applications are the most likely industries to benefit from this approach...|$|R
40|$|Dry {{granulation}} using roll compaction (DGRC) {{becomes increasingly}} {{adopted in the}} pharmaceutical industry due to its unique advantage of not requiring liquid binder and a subsequent drying process. However the DGRC process presents also some challenges, in particular, high fine fraction generated during the milling stage significantly limits its application. Although the fines produced can be recycled in practice, it may lead to poor content uniformity of the final product. At present {{there is a lack}} of mechanistic understanding of milling of roll compacted ribbons. For instance, it is not clear how fines are generated, what are the dominant mechanisms and controlling attributes and if any measurement technique can be used to characterise ribbon milling behaviour. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to assess if ribbon milling behaviour can be assessed using some characterization methods. For this purpose, friability was evaluated for ribbons made of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders using a friability tester that was originally developed for characterising the tendency of pharmaceutical tablets to generate small pieces while being abraded. Granules were also produced by milling of the ribbons and their size distributions were analysed. The correlation between the fine fraction of the granules with ribbon friability was then explored. It was found that there was a strong correlation between ribbon friability and the fine fraction of granules generated during milling. This implies that <b>friability</b> <b>tests</b> can be performed to characterise ribbon milling behaviour, and ribbon friability provides a good indication of the fraction of fines generated during ribbon milling...|$|R
40|$|Modified release multiparticulate pellets {{have been}} {{produced}} {{by the process of}} extrusion and spheronisation for colon-targeted delivery of cystamine, a cysteamine derivative. Orally ingested cysteamine formulations used in the treatment of cystinosis, are observed to cause gastrointestinal mucosa irritation leading to nausea, vomiting and ulceration in patients on such therapies. Spheronised pellets were prepared varying the type and concentration of the polymer used as an extrusion aid in the formulation. Classes of polymeric materials tested include starches, natural gums and cellulose derivatives. The properties of each wet mass formulation, extrudate and spheronisation product obtained were subsequently evaluated and compared to that obtained from a standard extrusion aid, microcrystalline cellulose. Viable pellets produced were subjected to detailed analytical procedures that include: pellet size analysis, qualitative sphericity determination, <b>friability</b> <b>testing,</b> bulk density measurements, optical and scanning electron microscopy. Amongst the polymers tested, blends of 60 / 40 % and 65 / 35 % low/high acyl gellan gum (Kelcogel®) incorporated into lactose-based wet masses produced good pellets with relatively high sphericity (percentage sphericity: 65 - 70 %). Cystamine was subsequently incorporated into gellan and microcrystalline cellulose pellets and efforts made to tailor the release profile of the drug by coating pellets with Eudragit® FS 30 D, a pH-sensitive polymer. The dosage forms described should selectively deliver the drug to the colon through pH-dependent dissolution of the polymer coating at colonic pH conditions (pH 7. 4) thereby minimising the incidence of any gastrointestinal side effects. Dissolution results showed that Eudragit® FS 30 D coated cystamine pellets released 90 % of the drug was released in phosphate buffer at pH 7. 4. Indicating the suitability of these coated pellets as potential colon-targeted dosage forms for delivery of cysteamine...|$|R
