50|$|IEC flanges are {{identified}} by an alphanumeric code consisting of; the letter U, P or C for Unpressurizable (plain cover), Pressurizable (with a gasket groove) and Choke (with both choke gasket grooves); a second letter, indicating {{the shape and}} other details of the flange and finally the IEC identifier for the waveguide. For standard rectangular waveguide the second letter is A to E, where A and C are round flanges, B is square and D and E are rectangular. So for example UBR220 is a square plain cover <b>flange</b> <b>for</b> R220 waveguide (that is, for WG20, WR42), PDR84 is a rectangular gasket <b>flange</b> <b>for</b> R84 waveguide (WG15, WR112) and CAR70 is a round choke <b>flange</b> <b>for</b> R70 waveguide (WG14, WR137).|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} study, {{based on}} an advanced Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) analysis <b>for</b> helicopter <b>rotor</b> systems, is carried out to investigate HHC application <b>for</b> <b>rotor</b> performance enhancement. The effects of HHC on stall characteristics of rotor and blade pitch-link loads when the system is configured to suppress vibration are also examined. For vibration control, simulated results indicate that HHC may promote early blade stall. Effects of blade torsion frequencies on HHC performance are moderate, and torsionally stiff blades require less actuator power than torsionally soft blades. <b>For</b> <b>rotor</b> performance improvement, a 3 to 5 percent reduction in rotor shaft power can be achieved with 2 deg of two-per-rev blade pitch control...|$|R

This loading is compared with the optimal loading <b>for</b> a <b>rotor</b> in hover or climb and with the Betz rotor loading (which is optimum <b>for</b> a lightly-loaded <b>rotor).</b> Wake contraction <b>for</b> each of the various loadings is also presented...|$|R
