5|$|Galileo's {{dispute with}} Grassi {{permanently}} alienated {{many of the}} Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas, and Galileo and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation.

5|$|Pericles and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> never {{immune from}} attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule.

5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, {{both of whom}} {{he heard}} on the radio and playing in the Detroit area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E
5|$|Potter's tale pays {{homage to}} the leisurely summers her father and his companions passed sport fishing at rented country estates in Scotland. Following the tale's publication, a child fan wrote Potter {{suggesting}} Jeremy find a wife. Potter responded {{with a series of}} miniature letters on the theme as if from Jeremy and his pals. After Potter's death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters. Jeremy and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> released as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Douglas and Jean MacArthur {{spent their}} last years {{together}} in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, {{a part of the}} Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He was elected {{chairman of the board of}} Remington Rand. In that year, he earned a salary of $68,000 (equivalent to $612,000 in 2016), in addition to $20,000 pay and allowances as a General of the Army. The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on 26 January thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General Leif J. Sverdrup. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th birthday, many of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> startled by the general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day, he collapsed and was rushed into surgery at St. Luke's Hospital to control a severely swollen prostate.|$|E

5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.|$|E
5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the United States by June 1885, living with his daughter and her husband in Southboro, Massachusetts. He then spent time in Boston with his sister before returning to Elmwood in November 1889. By this time, most of <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> dead, including Quincy, Longfellow, Dana, and Emerson, leaving him depressed and contemplating suicide again. Lowell spent part of the 1880s delivering various speeches, and his last published works were mostly collections of essays, including Political Essays, {{and a collection of}} his poems Heartsease and Rue in 1888. His last few years he traveled back to England periodically and when he {{returned to}} the United States in the fall of 1889, he moved back to Elmwood with Mabel, while her husband worked for clients in New York and New Jersey. That year, Lowell gave an address at the centenary of George Washington's inauguration. Also that year, the Boston Critic dedicated a special issue to Lowell on his seventieth birthday to recollections and reminiscences by his friends, including former presidents Hayes and Benjamin Harrison and British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone as well as Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Francis Parkman.|$|E

5|$|His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand Brock Tupper) {{asserts that}} shortly after Brock joined the regiment, a {{professional}} dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged Brock had {{his choice of}} terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. <b>His</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> shocked as Brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. Brock, however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked Brock to decide how many paces they would take. Brock insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently {{was forced to leave}} the regiment. This contributed to Brock's popularity and reputation among his fellow officers, as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, Brock served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and nearly died. He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi and <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family {{and living in a}} single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E
5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E
