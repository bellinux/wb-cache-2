40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} {{case study of}} <b>induction</b> <b>programmes</b> from five different countries: Britain, Australia, New Zealand, United States, and Canada. The intent was to investigate pedagogical and structural factors prevailing within these <b>induction</b> <b>programmes</b> that would encourage the confluence of pre-service, induction, and in-service education. An examination of how these <b>induction</b> <b>programmes</b> might enhance ongoing professional development opportunities for the beginning teacher was also undertaken. Based on a review of literature concerning i) issues, parameters, and pedagogical perspectives of teacher education; ii) the socialization experiences and instructional challenges of beginning teachers; and iii) the processes, academic systems, and <b>programme</b> variations of <b>induction</b> the argument is made that many conflicting and complex pedagogical variables as well as historical, cultural, and educational factors may influence the establishment and institutionalisation of induction. A qualitative research methodology was employed using naturalistic inquiry techniques within a case and field study design. Data was derived from interviews, extant documentations, field notes, and evaluation summaries over a three-year period. Documented evidence revealed that no two <b>induction</b> <b>programmes</b> were identical, although various academic, governance, and organisational factors did indicate similarities within and among various countries. Confluence of the three stages of teacher education were generally absent from most programmes. Teacher assessment and supervision were identified as important strategies that could either enhance or obstruct professional development among beginning teachers. Self-evaluative activities incorporated as basic teacher assessment procedures were also profiled as critical factors in promoting a self-directed beginning teacher. From these findings an identification of five distinguishable paradigms or induction was developed. The five models have been categorized as the laissez-faire model, the collegial- model, the formalized mentor-protege model, the mandated competency-based model, and the self-directing professional model. The latter was absent from the <b>induction</b> <b>programmes</b> that were investigated. Thirteen recommendations were proposed based upon the research findings. Twelve recommendations described how induction may enhance the confluence of teacher education {{as well as how}} induction may establish continuous professional development for beginning teachers.

The study employed cross sectional research design. The total of sample size was 180 respondents. Data were collected by using questionnaires, interview and documentary review. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 17. This study found out that induction is highly needed by LGAs for better performance of the council. Respondents from Health Department are more inducted than other Department in Morogoro Municipal Council.

40|$|Induction into {{university}} education {{is identified as}} crucial to the retention of an increasingly diverse student body. This paper explores the issues revealed by a qualitative examination {{of a series of}} case studies of Higher Education (HE) <b>induction</b> <b>programmes</b> in UK universities. These case studies represent a cross-section of <b>induction</b> <b>programmes</b> offered by different disciplines. Research demonstrates that ineffective induction into higher education can leave learners shocked, lost, lonely, disorientated and disaffected (Percy, 2001). The analysis suggests that, in response to the increasingly diversified student body, institutions themselves can respond by, for example adapting <b>induction</b> <b>programmes,</b> learning and teaching approaches or course management. Alternatively, students can be required to adapt to the learning environment that is new to them. This paper argues that these issues can more helpfully be considered a process of transition and that universities can extend their induction support activities beyond the first week and into the first year. Further research, we suggest, should include the development of a benchmarking tool as a means of facilitating institutions in their development of processes and mechanisms to support learner transitions into and through the HE experience, and our initial findings begin to suggest a number of areas of induction activity which could well be so benchmarked.
