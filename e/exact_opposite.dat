5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did the <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating {{the illusion of}} solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5|$|Although a close {{game was}} predicted, {{the game was}} the <b>exact</b> <b>opposite,</b> as the Wolverines finally {{displayed}} the long sought offensive firepower from a Rich Rodriguez offense. Michigan scored the only points of the first quarter, as Vincent Smith opened the scoring with a 12-yard touchdown run and quarterback Denard Robinson added another touchdown on a 32-yard run. Michigan started the second quarter with another touchdown, {{this time with a}} 3-yard run by Michael Shaw. All of Connecticut's scoring came in the second quarter: a 32-yard field goal by Dave Teggert, and then a 2-yard run by Jordan Todman. The only scoring of the third quarter came on a 24-yard Michigan field goal by Brendan Gibbons. Connecticut managed to enter Michigan's red zone during the third quarter, but D.J. Shoemate fumbled the ball after a hit by J.T. Floyd and Obi Ezeh recovered it to prevent Connecticut from scoring. In the fourth quarter, Smith caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Robinson; however, the extra point attempt was no good.|$|E

5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E

Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.|$|E

40|$|Woman in T. T. Cloete’s 'toepasslngs van dante' In T. T. Cloete's fourth {{collection}} of poems, Idiolek (1986), several references {{are made to}} the poetry of Dante Alighieri.

Although these two women are almost <b>exact</b> <b>opposites</b> - Beatrice possessing a divine beauty and an almost Christ-like nature, whereas Marilyn Monroe is portrayed as a dumb blonde and sex symbol of the fifties - the two poems are suspiciously similar in style and content. Both women are portrayed as being fundamentally perfect ("fundamenteel perfek"). In symbolizing the same virtues, they lose their unique and contrasting characteristics, and merge into a symbol of female perfection. Although the third poem, "columbae", does not have the Beatrice/Marilyn Monroe-figure as subject matter, it can be read as dealing with the issue of individuality and uniqueness, thus commenting on the previous two poems...|$|R

6000|$|BROWNING'S PLACE AND MESSAGE. Browning's {{place in}} our {{literature}} will be better appreciated by comparison with his friend Tennyson, whom we have just studied. In one respect, at least, these poets are in perfect accord. Each finds in love the supreme purpose and meaning of life. In other respects, especially in their methods of approaching the truth, {{the two men are}} the <b>exact</b> <b>opposites.</b> Tennyson is first the artist and then the teacher; but with Browning the message is always the important thing, and he is careless, too careless, of the form in which it is expressed. Again, Tennyson is {{under the influence of the}} romantic revival, and chooses his subjects daintily; but [...] "all's fish" [...] that comes to Browning's net. He takes comely and ugly subjects with equal pleasure, and aims to show that truth lies hidden in both the evil and the good. This contrast is all the more striking when we remember that Browning's essentially scientific attitude was taken by a man who refused to study science. Tennyson, whose work is always artistic, never studied art, but was devoted to the sciences; while Browning, whose work is seldom artistic in form, thought that art was the most suitable subject for a man's study.|$|R
