40|$|Abstract Background Liquid {{feeding system}} has been {{introduced}} to domestic swine farms, but negative cognition about liquid feeding {{system has been}} remained for feed waste decay related with poor management and microbial contamination. For these reasons, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate the effects of feeding method in lactating sows. Methods A total of 30 mixed-parity (average 4. 13) lactating sows (Yorkshire[*]×[*]Landrace) with an initial BW of 218. 8 [*]±[*] 19. 5 kg was used in a 3 week trial. Sows were allotted to 1 of 2 treatments in a completely randomized design by their body weight, backfat thickness, parity and alive litter weight. One of treatments was <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> and the other was liquid feeding (water to feed ratio, 1 : 1). Experimental diets contained 3265 kcal ME/kg, 12. 6 % CP, 5. 76 % EE, 1. 09 % total lysine, 0. 25 % total methionine, as fed basis. Results <b>Dry</b> <b>feeding</b> treatment had high body weight loss rather than liquid feeding treatment (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). <b>Dry</b> <b>feeding</b> treatment had tendency to increase litter weight at 21 d of lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 06) and litter weight gain (P[*]=[*] 0. 04) during lactation period (0 – 3 week). Sows fed <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> method made milk containing high content of casein and total solid rather than sows fed liquid feeding method (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). In addition, <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> treatment had tendency to higher content of milk fat, protein and solid not fat on 21 d of lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 07). Sows fed <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> type also showed higher milk energy content in milk of 21 d lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 05).

30|$|Ribeiro et al. (2012) {{observed}} angel fish larval {{performances are}} independent from the feeding frequency. Further, similar growth performance {{were obtained by}} feeding angel fish larvae at four meals per day and two meals per day by l (Kasiri et al. 2011). On the other hand, two times per day frequency is more practicable and convenient to employ according to our experience. Present study revealed that, angel fish larvae are able to accept both live <b>feed</b> and formulated <b>dry</b> <b>feed</b> {{at the onset of}} feeding. However, larvae solely fed live feed showed comparatively higher growth performances than that of larvae exclusively fed formulated <b>dry</b> <b>feed.</b> Similar observation has also been reported for Danio rerio (Carvalho et al. 2006), Heterobranchus. longifillis(Kerdchuen & Legendre 1994), southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma (Faulk & Holt 2009), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) (Blair et al. 2003) and Whishker cat fish (Macronema bleekeri) (Dan 2008). Well developed digestive system with functional digestive enzymes are absent at the onset of feeding and exogenous enzymes from live feeds {{play an important role in}} digestion (Person 1989; Dbrowski 1982). Therefore, the least growth performances observed in larvae exclusively fed <b>dry</b> <b>feed</b> (TR 4) could be attributed to a less developed digestive system which cannot support fish larvae to fully digest artificial <b>dry</b> <b>feed.</b> Further, Artemia nauplii contain nearly 56 % protein and 17 % lipid (Garcı́ a-Ortega et al. 1998; Nguyen et al. 2011) that make it as an excellent feed for first-feeding larvae. Aquaculture organisms are in need of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) during their developmental stages and the requirements vary with the developmental stage. Different ascorbic acid derivatives have been observed in Artemia and the evidences are available in the literature for the liberation of vitamin C from the freshly hatched naupli (Dabrowski 1991; Nelis et al. 1994). On the other hand, Artemia can be pre enriched with nutrients. It was observed that fish larvae promptly captured and ingested Artemia nauplii than <b>dry</b> <b>feed</b> particles. It was further indicated by the orange coloured larval digestive tract a few minutes after feeding. Low ingestion rate of <b>dry</b> <b>feeds</b> and leaching nutrients from <b>dry</b> <b>feeds</b> have also been highlighted as factors behind the poor growth in fish larvae fed <b>dry</b> <b>feeds</b> (Muguet et al. 2011).

In the past 20 years, litter size in Irish sows {{has increased by}} only one pig. Born alive figures now average at 11. 2 pigs per litter. In this regard, Ireland is falling behind our European competitors who have made significant advances over this time. Denmark, for example, has an average figure of 12. 7 pigs born alive per litter and France an average of 12. 5. The single area that could be improved immediately is sow feeding. It is important that sows are fed correctly throughout pregnancy. If over-fed during pregnancy, sows will have depressed appetite during lactation. If underfed in pregnancy, sows will be too thin at farrowing. The correct way to feed a pregnant sow is to match her feed allocation to her requirement for maintenance, body growth and growth of her developing foetuses. During lactation, sows should be given as much feed as they can eat to prevent excessive loss of body condition. Liquid-feed curves should be such that lactating sows are provided with a minimum mean daily feed supply of 6. 2 kg. A small proportion of sows will eat more and this could be given as supplementary dry feed. Where <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> is practised in the farrowing house, {{it is difficult to}} hand-feed sows to match their appetite. Ideally ad libitum wet/dry feeders should be used.

40|$|Gasification of comingled biomass {{and coal}} {{feedstock}} {{is an effective}} means of reducing the net life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the coal gasification process while maintaining its inherent benefits of abundance and high-energy density. However, feeding a comingled biomass and coal feedstock into a pressurized gasification reactor poses a technical problem. Conventional <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> systems, such as lock hoppers and pressurized pneumatic transport, are complex and operationally expensive. A slurry formation of comingled biomass and coal feedstock can be easily fed into the gasification reactor but, in normal conditions, only allows for a small portion of biomass in the mixture. This is a consequence of the hydroscopic and hydrophilic nature of the biomass. The College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) at the University of California, Riverside, has developed a process producing high solid content biomass-water slurry using a hydrothermal pretreatment process. In this paper, the systematic investigation of the rheological properties (e. g., shear rate, shear stress, and viscosity) of coal-water slurries, biomass-water slurries, and comingled biomass and coal-water slurries is reported. The solid particle size distribution in the slurry and the initial solid/water ratio were investigated to determine the impact on shear rate and viscosity. This was determined using a rotational rheometer. The experimental results show that larger particle size offers better pumpability. The presence of a high percentage of biomass in solid form significantly decreases slurry pumpability. It is also shown that the solid loading of the biomass-water slurry can be increased to approximately 35 wt%with viscosity of less than 0. 7 Pa 3 s after the pretreatment process.

Gasification technologies represent clean, flexible and efficient conversion pathways to utilize coal and biomass resources. Substantial experience and knowledge had been developed worldwide on gasification of either coal or biomass. However, reliable data on effects of blending various biomass fuels with coal during gasification process and resulting syngas composition are lacking. In this project, GE Global Research performed a complete characterization of the gas, liquid and solid products that result from the co-gasification of coal/biomass mixtures. This work was performed using a bench-scale gasifier (BSG) and a pilot-scale entrained flow gasifier (EFG). This project focused on comprehensive characterization of the products from gasifying coal/biomass mixtures in a high-temperature, high-pressure entrained flow gasifier. Results from this project provide guidance on appropriate gas clean-up systems and optimization of operating parameters needed to develop and commercialize gasification technologies. GE‘s bench-scale test facility provided the bulk of high-fidelity quantitative data under temperature, heating rate, and residence time conditions closely matching those of commercial oxygen-blown entrained flow gasifiers.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} method {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the degradation of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6) in non-heat-treated wheat (NHW), heat-treated wheat (HW), soybean meal (SBM) or rapeseed cake (RSC) soaked separately or in combination. The feedstuffs were soaked in water (20 °C) and samples were collected after 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) phytase addition to soaked NHW or HW improves InsP 6 degradation, (2) phytase and xylanase addition to soaked NHW or HW improves InsP 6 degradation further compared solely with phytase, (3) phytase addition to SBM or RSC improves InsP 6 degradation, and (4) soaking of SBM or RSM together with NHW (ratio 1 : 1) stimulates InsP 6 degradation from SBM or RSC due to the activity of wheat phytases, whereby phytase addition results in no further InsP 6 degradation. Additionally, degradation of lower inositol phosphates (myo-inositol pentakisphosphate-myo-inositol bisphosphate or InsP 5 -InsP 2) was studied to verify if InsP 6 degradation leads to an accumulation of InsP 5 -InsP 2. In NHW or HW addition of phytase alone or with xylanase had no significant effect on InsP 6 degradation. However, InsP 6 degradation was influenced by the interaction between heat-treatment and soaking time (P≤ 0. 001). This was mainly due to a smaller proportion of non-degraded InsP 6 -P at 24 h in HW compared with NHW (0. 13 vs. 0. 47) (P≤ 0. 001) possibly caused by structural changes imposed by the heat-treatment. In SBM, RSC, SBM/NHW or RSC/NHW, the InsP 6 degradation was affected by the interaction between phytase addition and soaking time (P≤ 0. 001) as phytase reduced the proportion of non-degraded InsP 6 -P at 2, 4, 8 or 24 h. Soaking of NHW, SBM or RSC (without phytase) separately resulted in a limited InsP 6 degradation, whereas a pronounced InsP 6 degradation occurred when RSC or SBM were soaked together with NHW (without phytase) because wheat phytases degraded InsP 6 in SBM or RSC. However, addition of phytase to SBM/NHW or RSC/NHW increased further the degradation of InsP 6 indicating that endogenous wheat phytases were not sufficient. The formation of InsP 5 -InsP 2 -P was very small (40 - 180 μg/kg DM) during the degradation of InsP 6 indicating a rapid and almost complete degradation of these compounds. In conclusion, the effect of phytase on InsP 6 degradation during soaking depends on the feedstuff and processing of the feedstuff. InsP 6 degradation results in a negligible accumulation of InsP 5 -InsP 2. Soaking of plant feedstuffs prior to feeding of pigs may improve P digestibility compared with <b>dry</b> <b>feeding,</b> but studies with pigs are required to clarify this...|$|E
40|$|The goats {{raised in}} the barn are usually fed on fresh grass. As dry forage can be stored for long periods in large amounts, <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> makes it {{possible}} to feed large numbers of goats in barns. This review explains the physiological factors involved in suppressing dry forage intake and the cause of drinking following <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> Ruminants consume an enormous amount of dry forage in a short time. Eating rates of dry forage rapidly decreased in the first 40 min of feeding and subsequently declined gradually to low states in the remaining time of the feeding period. Saliva in large-type goats is secreted in large volume during the first hour after the commencement of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> It was elucidated that the marked suppression of dry forage intake during the first hour was caused by a feeding-induced hypovolemia and the loss of NaHCO 3 due to excessive salivation during the initial stages of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> On the other hand, it was indicated that the marked decrease in feed intake observed in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period was related to ruminal distension caused by the feed consumed and the copious amount of saliva secreted during <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> In addition, results indicate that the marked decreases in dry forage intake after 40 min of feeding are caused by increases in plasma osmolality and subsequent thirst sensations produced by <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> After 40 min of the 2 h <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> period, the feed salt content is absorbed into the rumen and plasma osmolality increases. The combined effects of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality accounted for 77. 6 % of the suppression of dry forage intake 40 min after the start of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> The results indicate that ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality are the main physiological factors in suppression of dry forage intake in large-type goats. There was very little drinking behavior observed during the first hour of the 2 h feeding period most water consumption occurring in the second hour. The cause of this thirst sensation during the second hour of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> period was not hypovolemia brought about by excessive salivation, but rather increases in plasma osmolality due to the ruminal absorption of salt from the consumed feed. This suggests the water intake following <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> is determined by the level of salt content in the feed...|$|R
