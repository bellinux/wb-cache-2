The hypothesis is that fund managers lengthen their maturities when interest rates will be falling, while the maturities are shortened when rate increases are imminent.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the most important statistical properties of individual hedge fund returns. We find that the net-of-fees monthly returns of the <b>average</b> individual hedge <b>fund</b> exhibit significant degrees of negative skewness, excess kurtosis, as well as positive first-order serial correlation. The correlations between hedge funds in the same strategy group are of the same order of magnitude as the correlations between funds in different strategy groups and relatively low. Only 10 - 20 % of the variation in the <b>average</b> individual hedge <b>fund’s</b> returns can be explained by what happens in the US equity and bond markets. Compared to individual funds, portfolios of hedge funds tend to exhibit lower skewness, higher serial correlation and higher correlation with stocks and bonds. Movements in the US equity and bond markets still only explain 20 - 40 % of the variation in hedge fund portfolios returns though. Finally, an equally-weighted portfolio of all funds in our sample offers a 2. 76 % higher mean return than the <b>average</b> <b>fund</b> of funds. This strongly suggests that the timing and fund picking activities of the <b>average</b> <b>fund</b> of funds are not rewarded by a higher return. ...|$|R

40|$|If {{investors are}} rational, the {{variance}} of closed-end mutual fund returns should equal {{the variance of}} the underlying securities in their portfolios. In fact, this paper shows that the <b>average</b> closed-end <b>fund's</b> monthly return is 64 percent more volatile than its assets. Unlike variance-bounds tests, this facilitates an excess volatility test that does not rely on strong assumptions about discount rates or dividend streams. Although largely idiosyncratic, 15 percent of the <b>average</b> <b>fund's</b> excess risk is explained by market risk, small-firm risk, and risk that affects other closed-end funds.
