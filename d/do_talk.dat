In September 2015, Feige provided further comments on {{the return of the}} One-Shots, saying, [...] "The universe is big, and we're moving up to three [...] a year this year. I don't know how much beyond that we can go... we <b>do</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] a lot...It's just about finding the time and the place." [...] In June 2017, Spider-Man actor Tom Holland hinted that Marvel was planning on creating more One-Shots. That October, Pearson further hinted that Marvel was interested in creating more, adding he had [...] "a whole folder full of other One-Shots" [...] he had created. Taika Waititi, director of , also stated there had been discussions to resurrect the One-Shots, creating one centered on the characters Korg and Miek from Ragnarok. Feige also noted that the One-Shot films could potentially [...] "morph into extra content that’s created prior to a film’s release instead of for its home entertainment release", noting the successful [...] "Team Thor" [...] mockumentary shorts directed by Waititi, which [...] "were great fun, and are quite doable, and in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in Ragnarok in a fun way. So there might be opportunities for more things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|A 1979 {{stipulation}} {{of evidence}} signed by officials for Scientology states that Moxon provided false handwriting samples of GO operative Michael Meisner to the FBI. Both {{parties to the}} case were in agreement that Moxon responded to an October 14, 1976 subpoena titled [...] "Grand Jury subpoena for all original known handwriting exemplars of Michael Meisner and the employment application and personnel records of Mr. Meisner {{in the possession of}} the Church of Scientology" [...] by providing [...] "fake handwriting samples in lieu of Mr. Meisner's true handwriting exemplars" [...] to the United States government. The stipulation stated Moxon was [...] "directed to supply the government with fake handwriting samples". Nine Scientologists signed the stipulation as part of a plea bargain. According to a 1976 letter from the [...] "District of Columbia Security Office" [...] of the Guardian's Office, [...] "Rick Moxon" [...] and four other individuals had either [...] "full data or almost all of it", about covert operations against the United States government. According to the Guardian's Office letter, Moxon was prevented under penalty of a US$50,000 fine from disclosing his knowledge of the church cover operations. The non-disclosure agreement was titled [...] "Covenant of Non-Disclosure; 'Doomsday Agreement'". The letter told an official for the Church of Scientology to instruct Moxon [...] "if they <b>do</b> <b>talk,</b> then they will be expelled forever, hounded by the GO [...] until doomsday, and left to rot in the Physical Universe".|$|E
2500|$|In a May 2011 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Cramer {{explained that he}} was unprepared for Stewart's intense interview, saying [...] "As soon as he started, I realized Stewart was on a mission to make me look like a clown. I didn't defend myself because I wasn't prepared. What was I supposed to <b>do,</b> <b>talk</b> about how often I had been right? Praise myself? Get mad? I was mad, but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, which I did, and made me into a buffoon... They wanted to make me the Face of the Era, and they succeeded. Rick Santelli's a conservative. Ideological. O.K., I get that. But me? I was very anti-Bush. I'm a Democrat, I've got the canceled checks to prove it, and suddenly I'm the enemy? Me? Me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Yet, though {{freedom and}} {{happiness}} {{is a part}} of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Fronsdal, [...] "when Asian teachers <b>do</b> <b>talk</b> about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from—that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth". Nibbana is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, [...] "without drastic changes in lifestyle". Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives. The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia. According to Spiro, [...] "the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message," [...] but an eschatological message.|$|E
