40|$|Most of the {{software}} projects may deviate from their original plans during the Software Life Cycle in the organization. This deviation typically results from the changes that happed and the project manager depends on his experience to estimate {{the effects of the}} change. This may affect the <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> of the project. It is important that {{the software}} project should not deviate or crash according to the estimated deadline. Thus any change should be estimated and discussed before implementation. In this paper will introduce a framework that integrates the Software Project Management (SPM) with Software Change Management (SCM) to achieve the following objectives: Firstly, optimizing the Change Management Process in a project and track the whole Change Requests. Secondly, monitoring if the software project finished early by revising the project plan w. r. t the actual schedule to shrink the project deadline. And execute the consequences processes according to finish early. Thirdly, the actual results with performance will be tracked against the project plan and any variances should be analyzed. In addition, facilitating distribution of tasks (Change Requests) and availability of information. Finally, providing more control over a project when the technical issues can be raised and turned to managerial issues to take corrective actions if: the project takes more time, the project takes more cost or both of the...|$|E

40|$|To immunize an {{insurance}} company’s surplus against interest-rate fluctuations, asset-liability managers commonly adopt the so-called classical immunization strategy {{to set the}} duration of the surplus equal to zero. Unfortunately, this strategy is derived {{on the basis of the}} flat-term structure. This article examines the immunization strategy with a stochastic process, which can generate a mean-reverting term structure. By means of the stochastic process, the authors provide a measurement for evaluating the assets and liabilities of the insurance company. The authors also show that the immunization strategy suggested in the article is a general model and includes the classical immunization strategy as a special case. Furthermore, if a firm’s objective is to maximize its convexity of the surplus subject to zero surplus <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> its <b>budget</b> constraint, the authors demonstrate that linear programming can implement the optimal immunization strategy in this case. Moreover, the results of this simulation show that the cost of failing to recognize stochastic interest-rate changes can be extremely high...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (O. T. D.) [...] Boston UniversityOccupational therapy Level II {{fieldwork}} (FW) students face contemporary stressors {{that may}} interfere with the learning process. Academic programs have {{a greater number of}} non-traditional students who must find a balance between academic, family and financial obligations. FW environments have become more stressful as increased productivity levels, shorter treatment <b>durations,</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> cuts control clinic operations. These stressors may result in the FW student expressing higher degrees of anxiety and decreased confidence in performing entry-level skills at graduation. While physician and nursing professions have addressed best practices to manage clinical student stressors and training strategies for supervisors, a review of the occupational therapy (OT) literature reveals no study focusing on FW student well-being. This is surprising given the value that OT places on quality of life and establishing therapeutic relationships with our clients. This doctoral project describes a program directed to OT practitioners who have little or no experience in supervising OT Level II FW students. The program, given as a continuing education course, will provide the participants with training and tools to establish therapeutic relationships with their FW students. The program will use elements of the Intentional Relationship Model (Taylor, 2008) to educate the OT supervisor to use the therapeutic use of self (TUOS) {{to improve the quality of}} the student/supervisor relationship. The participants will also be introduced to the Fieldwork Quality of Life (FWQoL), a theoretical framework developed for this doctoral project, which will provide guidelines to assist the OT supervisor in determining if the FW student is having a positive FW experience. The program will use a small group format incorporating lecture, group discussions, video simulations, and provision of standardized questionnaires to assist the FW supervisor in monitoring the student's confidence and anxiety levels. A follow-up program, composed of volunteers from the program, will track their supervision of a FW student to determine program effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Sri Lanka is {{a country}} which is famous from its history for {{cinnamon}} {{and it is one}} of the major export products which generates significant amount of foreign income. Export market of Sri Lankan cinnamon is established in Mexico, USA, Central American and European countries. In the current competitive world, hygienic issue is a sever challenge to both the industry and the economy. Since the cinnamon production process is traditional over one hundred years old, the current hygienic issues have a great impact on the industry which is under discussion at government ministry level. A sample of cinnamon peelers in the industry along with small home based processing centre owners were selected for the survey and interviews respectively and all the findings were done by covering all the created objectives of the study. Data gathered from observations were also considered for explanations. Collected data was analysed to identify project management challenges hence the improvement of hygiene of cinnamon production process in home based small processing centres can be considered as a project by enforcing <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> a <b>budget.</b> Nine challenges were found and some of them are as challenges in facilitating formal education to workers to have a better understanding of the hygiene requirement, training and convincing workers and owners to use sanitized tool cleaning methods, dust controlling methods, improved pest controlling methods and practice personal hygiene method...|$|R
40|$|A main {{challenge}} in today's embedded system design {{is to find}} the perfect balance between performance and power consumption. This paper presents a run-time resource management framework for embedded heterogeneous multi-core platforms. It allows dynamic adaptation to changing application context and transparent optimization of the platform resource usage following a distributed and hierarchical approach. A Global Resource Manager (GRM) is running in parallel with the central manager of the application on the host processor of the platform. Each IP core of the platform can execute its own Local Resource Manager (LRM), and the GRM conforms to practices of each LRM. The operating points managed by the GRM are identified in a design-space exploration phase as a set of Pareto-optimal configurations of the application and their impacts with regards to the quality of experience, performance and energy consumption. The GRM has already been integrated in a POSIX version of an audio-driven video surveillance application in order to maximize its QoE parameters with respect to the battery <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> the energy <b>budget</b> of the platform, used to analyze the GRM efficiency...|$|R

Opening and closing hours of POIs, trip <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> trip allocated <b>budget</b> represent the hard constraints, while the satisfaction factors of the POIs and travelling distance in the trip are considered as soft constraints. We use the soft constraints {{to evaluate the}} generated solution of the algorithm. The algorithm is developed by utilizing the taboo search method as a meta heuristic. The operators of Swap, Insert and Delete are used to explore the search space. The Swap and Insert operator are used in each iteration of the algorithm loop, while the Delete operator is used whenever the algorithm tends to enter in an endless cycle. The algorithm is developed by using Java programming language, while the data repositories are created in the XML format. The algorithm is tested with 40 instances of POIs {{of the city of}} Vienna. Various entry parameters of the algorithm are used to test its performance. The results gained are discussed and compared in respect to the optimal solution...|$|R

For identifying projects, the authors consulted databases, legal decrees, and information hosted on the websites of funding bodies and of different organisations within the field of LIS. An e-mail survey was sent out to the heads of LIS departments at Spanish universities, university libraries, the National Library and the central libraries of the Autonomous Communities and the Public Libraries of the State. The 168 research projects identified in this study constitute an important number, revealing the growing capability of the LIS sector to obtain public funding in order to resolve research problems. Projects at the national level are the most numerous, followed by those at the Autonomous Community and European levels. There are still very few institutions that promote and participate in research projects, although two institutions —CINDOC and the Universidad Carlos III— stand out above all others. The study reveals the low level of collaboration in managing traditional LIS projects in Spain. Bibliometric studies evaluating the science and practices of communication of Spaniards, on the one hand, and works examining different aspects of information technology, continue to be the key themes of funded research activities.

40|$|Macaroni {{penguins}} are {{the main}} avian consumer of Antarctic krill {{in the vicinity of}} South Georgia. The largest breeding colonies occur on small offshore islands to the northwest of the main island. To delimit the foraging range of penguins from these colonies during the chick-rearing period, we used a series of ship-based survey transects to estimate their distribution and abundance. The survey transects were positioned so as to radiate from a point close to those islands with the largest colonies. Spatial and temporal variations within the data are examined. Penguins were mostly over the continental shelf in water less than 350 m depth and with more than 70 % of birds at distances less than 40 km from the main breeding site. To model the observed distribution of penguins, a theoretical at-sea distribution is developed together with a 'potential foraging footprint'. The results are compared with those from previous models based solely on the use of foraging trip <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> at-sea activity <b>budgets.</b> The foraging 'footprint' is probably the best basis currently available for assessing the nature of interactions between macaroni penguins and the commercial fisheries for krill...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the European Commission (EC) decisions on state aid control using data on 550 state aid cases approved by the EC between 1998 and 2009. More specifically, we measure the determinants of the duration of state aid, total budget of state aid <b>and</b> daily <b>budget</b> of state aid. By using these imperfect proxies, we try to identify the extent of European state aid control. Our results suggest that aid with multiple objectives to achieve has both longer <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> higher amounts of budget. We also find that for some aid objectives or industries, the EC approves cases of aid with both longer <b>durations</b> <b>and</b> higher levels of budget. On the other hand, for some class of aid objectives and industries, there is a trade-off between <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> the level of budget so as to counter-balance the undesired effects. The interpretation of the results imply that the European state aid control, which once was originally intended to address concerns about export subsidies and strategic trade, recently puts more emphasis on market failures mostly associated with externalities and public goods. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concentrates}} on the quality management of a project by applying network approaches and statistics methods. A large-scale project can be modeled as a project network. This paper tries to schedule {{the duration of the}} project by applying the approaches in network analysis in case the activity <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding cost are both arbitrary random variables with a probability distribution. Subject to the project time (the deadline to complete the project) constraint <b>and</b> the <b>budget</b> constraint, this paper studies how to schedule all activity durations of the project. Two algorithms are proposed to generate all upper <b>and</b> lower <b>duration</b> vectors for the project. All feasible activity durations are among such upper <b>and</b> lower <b>duration</b> vectors. Whenever any constraint is changed during the project period, we can re-schedule the activity durations efficiently by applying the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we can evaluate the probability that the project will be executed successfully, subject to the time <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> constraints. Such a probability is an index for measuring the quality and feasibility of the project...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to highlight and rank delaying factors in the Annual Development Programme public sector building infrastructure projects and examine them through a relative importance index. A total of 52 delaying factors were identified through a detailed literature review and categorized into eight major groups, and a pilot study with 16 experienced construction experts was conducted. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the importance of each factor from public construction experts. In total, 102 respondents participated in the survey. The study determined that difficulties in financing projects by contractors, delays in progress payments, dispute on land usage, improper project feasibility studies, award project to the lowest bid price, extreme weather conditions, inadequate contractor experience, and insufficient data collection and survey before design were among the top eight critical delaying factors. In addition, Spearman’s rank correlation tests revealed that there was no difference in perception between owners and contractors. A comparison of the top five delay factors was done with eight preferred construction industries in Asia to validate the results of this study. The findings are likely to be a solid contribution to the Gilgit-Baltistan construction industry in mitigating future construction delays...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{activity}} model under time <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> constraints to simultaneously predict {{the allocation of}} time and money to out-of-home leisure activities. The proposed framework considers the activity episode level, given that the activity is scheduled. Thus, the model considers the decision of the quantities for <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> expenditure spent during the activity. We use a flexible utility function and show how the simultaneous equations can be estimated by using structural equations model (SEM) estimation techniques to handle the endogeneity problem of time and expenditure. The estimation results are based on a large national leisure diary data set collected in 2008 in the Netherlands, which provides detailed information about time and money spent as well as timing and location attributes of the activities. The analysis reveals that socio-demographics, travel party, timing and location variables influence the <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> expenditure of activity episodes. It shows that various socio-demographic groups display different preferences in terms of the time and money spent on activities. The results also indicate substitution relationships between spending more time and money for various activity categories. Thus it is concluded that the analysis provides useful results for a better understanding of combined time and money allocation decisions for leisure activities...|$|R
