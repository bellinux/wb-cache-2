However, nondisclosure agreements may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources {{they would not be}} obligated to keep the information secret. In other words, the nondisclosure agreement typically only requires the receiving party to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the <b>disclosing</b> <b>party.</b> Ironically, however, it is sometimes easier to get a receiving party to sign a simple agreement that is shorter, less complex and does not contain safety provisions protecting the receiver.|$|E

40|$|Comparisons among firms play a {{major role}} in {{securities}} analysis. This essay asks if this fact justifies the mandatory nature of securities regulation. Once a firm approaches the public securities markets, federal securities regulations compel it to disclose financial information to the public. A seminal theory argues that firms would not otherwise commit to maintain optimal disclosure levels, since a disclosing firm bears all disclosure costs but does not gain all disclosure benefits. This paper examines the robustness of this argument in relation to disclosure benefits which arise from comparisons among firms. Financial data of peer firms allows shareholders to measure and monitor the relative performance of their own firm. The ability to makes such comparisons is a benefit that each disclosing firm provides to its peers; it may have great social value but allegedly no private value to the <b>disclosing</b> <b>party</b> which bears the full cost of such disclosure. One might, therefore, call to address this market failure with a mandatory disclosure requirement. Interestingly, while the above description might justify a mandatory disclosure requirement for private firms (a requirement which does not exist in practice), it does not automatically justify mandated disclosure by public firms. If comparison benefits accrue only after the public shareholders or securities analysts have had a chance to review the data of all the relevant firms (which is the case for all public firms), then each individual firm cannot enjoy comparison benefits without exposing its own statements. In other words, if one firm must make its financials public in order to incur comparative disclosure benefits [...] which is normally the case with public firms since their public investors process financial data outside the boundaries of the firm [...] then public firms would tend to disclose information regardless of the fact that such information benefits their peers. This voluntary mutual disclosure phenomenon, which helps firms capture comparative disclosure benefits, mitigates the fear that disclosure might be sub-optimally produced without the intervention of the regulator. Nevertheless, if a material piece of information confers significant comparative benefits when reviewed by corporate insiders and not by the public shareholders, then one cannot count on voluntary mutual disclosure to occur, and the mandatory federal intervention might be in order...|$|E

GAO examined (1) the extent of PI nursing home ownership and firms' involvement in homes' operations, (2) whether PECOS reflects PI ownership, and (3) how HHS and states use ownership data for oversight.

40|$|For {{at least}} thirty years the Supreme Court has adhered to its {{third-party}} doctrine in interpreting the Fourth Amendment, meaning that so far as a <b>disclosing</b> <b>party</b> is concerned, information {{in the hands of}} a third party receives no Fourth Amendment protection. The doctrine was controversial when adopted, has been the target of sustained criticism, and is the predominant reason that the Katz revolution has not been the revolution many hoped it would be. Some forty years after Katz the Court 2 ̆ 7 s search jurisprudence largely remains tied to property conceptions. As I have demonstrated elsewhere, however, the doctrine is not the universal constitutional rule in the United States. Eleven states reject the doctrine, providing some constitutional search and seizure protection to information in the hands of third parties, and another eleven give some reason to believe they might reject it. But it is one thing to urge that some third-party information should by protected, and quite another to articulate how and when different information should be accessible to police. To answer this question it makes sense to turn to the most robust source of practical applications we have, namely those states that have diverged from the federal doctrine. Although state courts often employ a gestalt jurisprudence that defies precise delineation, an analysis of many cases reveals a set of relevant factors that would seem to be consistently useful in determining whether law enforcement access should be restricted, and if so in what manner. What such analysis does not reveal is a tidy system of bright-line delineations, seemingly at odds with two thoughtful alternatives to the current federal doctrine proposed by Daniel Solove and Christopher Slobogin. Part I of this article frames the discussion via recent events. The realization that the National Security Agency has been parsing phone conversations, dialing records, and banking records since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, demonstrates that the third-party doctrine is very much a contemporary concern. The decision last term in Georgia v. Randolph demonstrates that five members of the Supreme Court are willing to depart from the doctrine, at least in the context of the home. Part II then utilizes the existing state (and to a limited extent federal) jurisprudence to determine and explain what factors are relevant in determining whether to constitutionally restrict law enforcement access. This yields an uncertain calculus that also logically challenges the essentially unrestricted ability of law enforcement to probe the recollection of a recalcitrant witness. In Part III I compare my approach to the seemingly more administrable proposals of Professors Solove and Slobogin. I conclude with a tentative defense of the current multi-faceted - and therefore necessarily uncertain - jurisprudence. Although its administrability is imperfect, it more appropriately distinguishes between and among different types and amounts of third-party information...|$|E
