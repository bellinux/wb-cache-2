5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|The AW101's {{navigation}} system includes a GPS receiver and <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system,</b> VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR), {{instrument landing system}} (ILS), TACAN, and automatic direction finding. The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{represented}} {{a significant improvement}} to the RAAF's ground attack capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically advanced than the Canberra, as they could fly at supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar and missiles, and had an <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system,</b> ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would {{also be able to}} perform.|$|E

5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (<b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system)</b> mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
5|$|All RAF GR.1s and {{the initial}} AV-8As were fitted with the Ferranti FE541 {{inertial}} navigation/attack suite, but these were replaced in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer to aid quick turnaround between missions. The Martin-Baker ejection seats were also replaced by the Stencel SEU-3A in the American aircraft. The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103. The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> to the aircraft's avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; {{at the same time}} several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft. Spain's Harriers, designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC Harriers differing only in the radios fitted.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, Pakistan was {{reportedly}} {{to select a}} Western company {{by the end of}} the year to provide and integrate the FC-1's avionics, which was expected to go into production by 1999. The avionics were said to include radar, <b>Inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system,</b> Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. Competing bids came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi Electronic Systems with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF. In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 turbofan engine to power the fighter. In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter. Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 turbofan engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.|$|E

Finally, we describe how INS gyro drift manifests itself in different coordinate systems for the orbital case. These results may assist orbital flight dynamics and attitude control systems engineers in the design and analysis of INS-equipped spacecraf...|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was not fitted with an <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system,</b> and GPS navigation {{was not available}} at the time. Due to an error in calculating magnetic declination, the plane flew in an enormous, right-turning arc.

It flew southeast over the Svalbard archipelago and the Barents Sea, past northern Scandinavia and into Soviet airspace.|$|E
