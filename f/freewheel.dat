One method, ‘Initial Rotor Position Estimation’, based on inductance variation {{can be used}} to start the motor with position feedback, but the performance is affected by the process of <b>freewheeling.</b> Therefore, this paper studies on the two <b>freewheeling</b> modes, which are the <b>freewheeling</b> mode through power and the mode not through power, in the universal three-phase bridge in the system of brushless DC motors. Besides, the paper analyzes the influence caused by different <b>freewheeling</b> modes. The analysis results show that the <b>freewheeling</b> mode through power is more suitable for the starting technique than the other one. On the basis above, the simulation carried out in MATLAB/Simulink verifies the validity of the theoretical analysis...|$|R

25|$|Track {{bicycles}} do {{not have}} brakes, because all riders ride {{in the same direction}} around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no <b>freewheel.</b> Without a <b>freewheel,</b> coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.|$|E

50|$|Cassettes are {{distinguished}} from <b>freewheels</b> in that a cassette has {{a series of}} straight splines that form the mechanical connection between the sprockets and the cassette compatible hub, called a freehub, which contains the ratcheting mechanism. The entire cassette is held on the hub {{by means of a}} threaded lockring. Some cassette systems from the late 1980s and early 1990s use a threaded small sprocket to hold on the larger splined sprockets. Cassettes resemble <b>freewheels</b> when installed, but are clearly different when removed as they do not contain a <b>freewheel's</b> internal ratcheting mechanism.|$|R

25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} freewheels. A <b>freewheel,</b> as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a road wheel to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop pedalling while going downhill. Some early automobiles had the engine driving two freewheels, one for each driving road wheel. When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the outside was permitted to rotate faster by its <b>freewheel.</b> Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one driving wheel. Driving in reverse is impossible as is engine braking due to the freewheels.|$|E
25|$|Riding fixed is {{considered}} by some to encourage a more effective pedaling style, which it is claimed translates into greater efficiency and power when used on a bicycle fitted with a <b>freewheel.</b> It allows for the rider to engage in and practice proper cadence, which is the balanced and rhythmic flow of pedaling, enhancing performance for both cyclist and bicycle.|$|E

These unicycles almost always have brakes because they cannot stop the way traditional unicycles do. The brake lever is generally mounted {{in the bottom of}} the saddle. These unicycles also cannot go backwards.|$|E

25|$|Usually, {{the rear}} hub {{is the best}} {{component}} on which one can operate chainline adjustments, especially on threaded hubs. If a track hub is used, it’s better to operate on the bottom bracket or - for minor shifts - on the crankset. The same occurs if a flip-flop hub is used, because the chainline {{should be the same}} in both sides (<b>freewheel</b> and fixed gear).|$|E
25|$|Further {{innovations}} increased {{comfort and}} {{ushered in a}} second bicycle craze, the 1890s Golden Age of Bicycles. In 1888, Scotsman John Boyd Dunlop introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear <b>freewheel</b> was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of coaster brakes. Dérailleur gears and hand-operated Bowden cable-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.|$|E
25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to a}} crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or <b>freewheel).</b> There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|E

25|$|One of the {{perceived}} main attractions of a fixed gear bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully geared drive train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, cable carriers, multiple chain rings, <b>freewheel</b> hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a fixed gear bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less sideways force and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a fixed gear drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most direct power transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a fixed gear requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear.|$|E
25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a <b>freewheel</b> {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E
2500|$|A fixed-gear bicycle (or fixed-wheel bicycle, {{commonly}} known {{in some places}} as a fixie) is a bicycle that has a drivetrain with no <b>freewheel</b> mechanism. The <b>freewheel</b> was developed early {{in the history of}} bicycle design but the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design. More recently the [...] "fixie" [...] has become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantage of simplicity compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle.|$|E
2500|$|Some cranksets {{have been}} {{produced}} that incorporate a ratcheting mechanism to accommodate coasting. In this case, the chain continues to rotate with the rear wheel when the rider stops pedaling. [...] The ultimate goal of <b>freewheeling</b> cranks is to allow the rider to shift the chain while coasting. [...] Shimano's discontinued FF system (Front <b>Freewheeling)</b> {{is one of the}} more commonly seen examples.|$|R

Therefore, systems designed for low duty cycle operation will suffer from higher losses in the <b>freewheeling</b> diode or lower switch, and for such systems it is advantageous to consider a synchronous buck converter design.|$|R

2500|$|When first {{riding a}} fixed gear, a cyclist {{used to a}} <b>freewheel</b> may try to <b>freewheel,</b> or coast, {{particularly}} when approaching corners or obstacles. Since coasting is not possible {{this can lead to}} a [...] "kick" [...] to the trailing leg, and even to loss of control of the bicycle. Riding at high speed around corners can be difficult on a road bike converted into a fixed-gear bicycle, as the pedals can strike the road, resulting in loss of control. Proper track bikes have a higher bottom bracket to compensate for the constantly spinning cranks and largely mitigate this problem.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert <b>freewheel</b> {{bicycles}} to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed <b>freewheel.</b> [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted <b>freewheel</b> hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|E
