40|$|ABSTRACT: The viscous {{coefficient}} of a homogeneous ER fluid {{can be changed}} by the application of an electric field. However, the ER effect of the fluid is easily varied by temperature variation. Therefore, an envelopment and time in which the fluid is applied is limited. In this paper, we examine {{the influence of the}} thermal effects induced on the fluid by the device, in order to construct more reliable homogeneous ER devices. We discuss two kinds of thermal effects caused by joule heat and the dissipation of viscous energy. The results of simulations and experiments suggest that most of the exothermic elements of the homogeneous ER fluid are caused by the dissipation of viscosity energy in the fluid. Therefore, it seems reasonable to drive the clutch at a low rotating speed for short periods. We think that a robot arm for impedance control is more effective than a damper for vibration control.

40|$|Shear {{thickening}} is {{a phenomenon}} of significant viscosity increase of colloidal suspensions. While electrorheological (ER) fluids {{can be turned into}} a solid-like material by applying an electric field, their shear strength is widely represented by the attractive electrostatic interaction between ER particles. By shearing ER fluids between two concentric cylinders, we show a reversible shear thickening of ER fluids above a low critical shear rate ( 100 V/mm), which could be characterized by a modified Mason number. Shear thickening and electrostatic particle interaction-induced inter-particle friction forces is considered to be the real origin of the high shear strength of ER fluids, while the applied electric field controls the extent of shear thickening. The electric field-controlled reversible shear thickening has implications for high-performance ER/magnetorheological (MR) <b>fluid</b> design, <b>clutch</b> <b>fluids</b> with high friction forces triggered by applying local electric field, other field-responsive materials and intelligent systems.

50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system <b>fluid),</b> the <b>clutch</b> would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|R
5000|$|This style limited-slip {{differential}} {{works by}} using a gerotor pump to hydraulically compress a clutch to transfer torque to the wheel that is rotating slower.

When {{there is a difference}} between the left and right wheels' speed, the pump pressurizes the hydraulic <b>fluid</b> causing the <b>clutch</b> to compress. thereby causing the torque to be transferred to the wheel that is rotating slower. These pump-based systems have lower and upper limits on applied pressure which allows the differential to work like a conventional or open differential until there is a significant speed difference between the right and left wheel, and internal damping to avoid hysteresis. The newest gerotor pump based system has computer regulated output for more versatility and no oscillation.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A magnetorheological fluid (MRF) {{fan drive}} {{prototype}} for automotive truck application is designed and tested for both performance and durability. A dual concentric gap with drum rotor design is chosen {{to meet the}} required torque capacity, packaging, and mass constraints.

The <b>clutch</b> is filled with a custom-formulated MR fluid. Performance testing shows excellent speed control and response. The required 40 N-m torque capacity is achieved along with low drag speed, which is a key design characteristic of the fan drive.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design, construction, and {{evaluation}} of a prototype two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interface, which takes advantage of Magneto-Rheological <b>Fluid</b> (MRF) based <b>clutches</b> for actuation. Haptic information provides important cues in teleoperated systems and enables the user to feel the interaction with a remote or virtual environment during teleoperation. The two main objectives in designing a haptic interface are stability and transparency. Indeed, deficiencies in these factors in haptics-enabled telerobotic systems has the introduction of haptics in medical environments where safety and reliability are prime considerations. An actuator with poor dynamics, high inertia, large size, and heavy weight can significantly undermine the stability and transparency of a teleoperated system. In this work, {{the potential benefits of}} MRF-based actuators to the field of haptics in medical applications are studied. Devices developed with such fluids are known to possess superior mechanical characteristics over conventional servo systems. These characteristics significantly contribute to improved stability and transparency of haptic devices. This idea is evaluated and verified through both theoretical and experimental points of view. The design of a small-scale MRF-based clutch, suitable for a multi-DOF haptic interface, is discussed and its performance is compared with conventional servo systems. This design is developed into four prototype clutches. In addition, a closed-loop torque control strategy is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme comes from the magnetic field acquired from embedded Hall sensors in the clutch. The controller uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior using an estimated model, based on Artificial Neural Networks. Such a control strategy eliminates the need for torque sensors for providing feedback signals. The performance of the developed design and the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control techniques are experimentally validated. Next, a 2 -DOF haptic interface based on a distributed antagonistic configuration of MRF-based clutches is constructed for a class of medical applications. This device is incorporated in a master-slave teleoperation setup that is used for applications involving needle insertion and soft-tissue palpation. Phantom and in vitro animal tissue were used to assess the performance of the haptic interface. The results show a great potential of MRF-based actuators for integration in haptic devices for medical interventions that require reliable, safe, accurate, highly transparent, and stable force reflection...|$|R
