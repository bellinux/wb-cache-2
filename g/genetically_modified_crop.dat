5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E

In 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first commercially genetically engineered crop marketed in Europe.|$|E
40|$|McLean County, Illinois {{farmers were}} {{surveyed}} {{in order to}} explore and analyze their perceptions of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> and their <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cropping</b> decisions. Questionnaires were mailed to 400 randomly selected farmers, and 156 were returned. The 134 respondents who reported that they planned to plant crops in 2003 {{were asked to provide}} information about gender, age, education, and number of tillable acres farmed. Respondents were also asked if they had previously planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> and if they planned to plant either <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> corn or <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> soybeans in 2003. Finally, respondents were presented with 40 statements that pertained to biotechnology and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops,</b> and they were asked to record their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement using a 5 -point Likert scale. Factor analysis was used to construct four factors from responses to the 40 statements that pertained to biotechnology and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> Items that loaded into the first factor indicated that McLean county farmers perceived agricultural biotechnology to be acceptable and beneficial, and their perspectives of biotechnology were much broader than the economic impacts on their own farms. The second factor revealed that McLean County farmers' cropping decisions had been affected to some degree by events such as the StarLink corn case that had cast a negative shadow over biotechnology. The third factor reflected direct benefits of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> to farm operations, specifically higher yields and profits. The fourth factor included increased regulation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in international markets and lower prices for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops,</b> which were potentially negative factors in the marketing of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> Binary logistic regression analysis was used to classify respondents according to past and planned experiences with <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> When weighted factor scores from the four factors were used as independent variables, 100 % of farmers who had planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in the past, 98. 4 % of farmers who planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003, and 100 % of farmers who had not discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> were correctly classified. On the other hand, only 62. 5 % of farmers who had not planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in the past, 60. 0 % of farmers who planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003, and 60. 0 % of farmers who had discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> were correctly classified. When the highest loading items from each of the four factors were used as independent variables, classification of farmers who had planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in the past, farmers who planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003, and farmers who had not discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> were little changed. However, correct classification of farmers who had not planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in the past dropped from 62. 5 % to 50 %, correct classification of farmers who had planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003 dropped from 60. 0 % to 20. 0 %, and correct classification of farmers who had discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> dropped from 60 % to 0 %. Additional information about farmers' age, education, and farm size increased the explanatory power of models only modestly. Inspection of regression coefficients revealed that increases in Factor 1 scores, which were dominated by positive aspects of biotechnology from a macro perspective, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in the past, having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003, and having continued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> Alternatively, increases in Factor 2 scores, which were dominated by negative perceptions of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> seeds and <b>crops,</b> were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003, and having discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> Factor 3 scores, which were dominated by micro benefits to farmers, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003, and having continued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> Results for two individual items that were significant, namely "as a consumer, I am satisfied with the benefits of biotechnology," and "restrictions on saving GM seed affect my GM crop planting decisions," were consistent with results for weighted factor scores. Greater agreement with the former statement was associated with increases in odds ratios for having planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in the past, and having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003. Greater agreement with the latter statement was associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> in 2003 and having discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> biotechnology, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified,</b> corn, soybeans, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Q 16,...|$|R
40|$|McLean County, Illinois {{farmers were}} {{surveyed}} {{in order to}} explore their perceptions of biotechnology and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops,</b> and to analyze the relationships between those perceptions and choices regarding use of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops.</b> Statistical analyses revealed that perceptions {{could be used to}} distinguish between users and non-users of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops,</b> but the approach was more effective for past use than for planned use. Perceptions that were related to past use of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> included satisfaction with the benefits of biotechnology, the perception that biotechnology would be beneficial to agriculture, and the perception that farmers were well informed and could easily obtain objective information about biotechnology. Perceptions of the agronomic and economic benefits of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops,</b> {{with the possible exception of}} Bt corn, were of limited use when distinguishing between users and non-users.

40|$|The {{potential}} effects of horizontal gene transfer {{on human health}} are an important item in the safety assessment of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. Horizontal gene transfer from <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> to gut microflora most likely occurs with transgenes of microbial origin. The characteristics of microbial transgenes other than antibiotic-resistance genes in market-approved <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> are reviewed. These characteristics include the microbial source, natural function, function in <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops,</b> natural prevalence, geographical distribution, similarity to other microbial genes, known horizontal transfer activity, selective conditions and environments for horizontally transferred genes, and potential contribution to pathogenicity and virulence in humans and animals. The assessment of this set of data {{for each of the}} microbial genes reviewed does not give rise to health concerns. We recommend including the above-mentioned items into the premarket safety assessment of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crops</b> carrying transgenes other than those reviewed in the present study...|$|R

5000|$|Genes from a GMO may pass {{to another}} {{organism}} {{just like an}} endogenous gene. The process is known as outcrossing and can occur in any new open-pollinated crop variety. Introduced traits potentially can cross into neighboring plants of the same or closely related species through three different types of gene flow: crop-to-crop, crop-to-weedy, and crop-to-wild. In crop-to-crop, genetic information from a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crop</b> is transferred to a non-genetically modified crop. Crop-to-weedy transfer refers to the transfer of genetically modified material to a weed, and crop-to-wild indicates transfer from a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>crop</b> to a wild, undomesticated plant and/or crop. There are concerns that the spread of genes from modified organisms to unmodified relatives could produce species of weeds resistant to herbicides that could contaminate nearby non-genetically modified crops, or could disrupt the ecosystem, This is primarily a concern if the transgenic organism has a significant survival capacity and can increase in frequency and persist in natural populations. This process, whereby genes are transferred from GMOs to wild relatives, {{is different from the}} development of so-called [...] "superweeds" [...] or [...] "superbugs" [...] that develop resistance to pesticides under natural selection.|$|E
