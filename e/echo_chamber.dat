5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones {{an hour before the}} sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's quiet voice, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound. Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators– customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension– and the studio's tiled <b>echo</b> <b>chamber</b> built in 1931.|$|E

Dumont created an effect similar to that of an <b>echo</b> <b>chamber</b> by placing a microphone inside a metal garbage can with the can's open end facing a drum kit. Richard B.

It was followed by Smiley Smile (1967), an album of stripped-down recordings. In 2003, Stylus Magazine wrote that the album [...] "embrace the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era.

500|$|Along {{with the}} {{conventional}} rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent synthesizers to their sound.

Critical response to MacFarlane's performance was mixed.

500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an <b>echo</b> <b>chamber.</b> The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{intended}} [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] – a song {{he later}} characterised as a [...] "kid's story" [...] – {{as a vehicle}} for Starr's limited vocal range. The lyrics were written by McCartney and Lennon, with assistance from Scottish singer Donovan, and tell of life on a sea voyage accompanied by friends. Gould considers the song's childlike qualities to be [...] "deceptive" [...] and that, once in the studio, it became [...] "a sophisticated sonic pastiche". On 1 June, the Beatles and a group of their friends created a nautical atmosphere over the pre-recorded basic track, by mixing sounds such as gongs, whistles and bells with an assortment of Studio 2's sound effects. To fill the portion after the lyrics refer to a brass band playing, Martin and Emerick used a Sousa march recording, sourced from EMI's library, splicing up the taped copy and rearranging the melody. Lennon recorded the track's superimposed voices in an <b>echo</b> <b>chamber,</b> supporting Starr's lead vocal in a manner that Gould likens to [...] "an old vaudevillian with the crowd {{in the palm of his}} hand". Riley recognises the song's mix of comedy as reminiscent of The Goon Show with satire inspired by Spike Jones. Donovan later said that [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] represented the Beatles' predicament as prisoners of their international fame, to which they reacted by singing an uplifting, communal song.|$|E

50|$|Some {{recording}} {{companies and}} many small independent labels {{could not afford}} large purpose-built <b>echo</b> <b>chambers</b> such as the Abbey Road chamber, so enterprising producers and engineers often made use of any large reverberant space.

40|$|<b>Echo</b> <b>chambers,</b> i. e., {{situations}} where one is exposed only to opinions that agree with their own, are an increasing {{concern for the}} political discourse in many democratic countries. This paper studies the phenomenon of political <b>echo</b> <b>chambers</b> on social media. We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared ('echo'), and the place that allows its exposure ('chamber' [...] - the social network), and examine closely at how these two components interact. We define a production and consumption measure for social-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared and received by them. By comparing the two, we find that Twitter users are, to a large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own. We also find that users who try to bridge the <b>echo</b> <b>chambers,</b> by sharing content with diverse leaning, {{have to pay a}} 'price of bipartisanship' in terms of their network centrality and content appreciation. In addition, we study the role of 'gatekeepers', users who consume content with diverse leaning but produce partisan content (with a single-sided leaning), in the formation of <b>echo</b> <b>chambers.</b> Finally, we apply these findings to the task of predicting partisans and gatekeepers from social and content features. While partisan users turn out relatively easy to identify, gatekeepers prove to be more challenging. Comment: Accepted at The Web Conference 2018 (WWW 2018). Please cite the WWW versio...|$|R

In this work, we focus on users commenting posts published by US Facebook pages supporting scientific and conspiracy-like narratives, and we classify the personality traits of those users according to their online behavior.
