Alexander Looby's home in north Nashville, apparently {{in retaliation for}} his support of the demonstrators. Although the explosion almost destroyed the house, Looby and his wife, who were asleep in a back bedroom, were not injured. More than 140 windows in a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.|$|E

25|$|Following the bombing, {{more than}} $300,000 in {{unsolicited}} gifts were {{received by the}} church and repairs were begun immediately. The church reopened on June 7, 1964. A stained glass window depicting a black Jesus, designed by John Petts, was donated by citizens of Wales and installed in the <b>front</b> <b>window,</b> facing south.|$|E

25|$|The Ulysses soft X-ray {{detectors}} {{consisted of}} 2.5-mm thick × 0.5cm2 area Si surface barrier detectors. A 100mg/cm2 beryllium foil <b>front</b> <b>window</b> rejected the low energy X-rays and defined a conical FOV of 75° (half-angle). These detectors were passively cooled and {{operate in the}} temperature range −35 to −55°C. This detector had 6 energy channels, covering the range 5–20 keV.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} power car, numbered 43002, {{was delivered}} in late 1975, with a significantly different appearance from the prototype. The streamlined front end lacked conventional buffers, and the drawgear was hidden under a cowling. The single cab <b>front</b> <b>window</b> was {{much larger than}} the prototype's, and side windows were included. There was also no driving position at the inner end.|$|E
25|$|Abram's {{most visible}} changes, begun in 1876, {{were the two}} <b>front</b> <b>window</b> gables, adding a Picturesque aspect to the house, and an update to the front entranceway and the {{accompanying}} hall, although it is uncertain from the house today exactly what changes were made. The porch roof may {{have been changed to}} its flat hipped style, more consistent with tastes of the time.|$|E

25|$|Thirty new train units (named DT3) {{were ordered}} {{and have been}} {{delivered}} for U3 operations. Those trains are designed to operate without a driver, controlled by an ATC system from Siemens, and will provide the passengers with an unobstructed view from the <b>front</b> <b>window</b> into the tunnel. A normally locked drivers panel exists at every <b>front</b> <b>window</b> which enables service employees to drive DT3 units by hand if required. As with all Nuremberg subway trains, these units consist of two carriages and are half the platform length. They can be run as a single unit (short train) or coupled as double unit (long train), depending on passenger numbers. For {{the first time in}} a Nuremberg subway train, the two carriages of a unit are built with an accessible gangway. This is intended to improve passenger distribution in the train as many stations in the system have their exits at the very ends of the platform and therefore often the first and the last carriages of a 4 carriage (long) train are rather full, while the two middle carriages are relatively empty.|$|E
25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The <b>front</b> <b>window</b> was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a quarter light window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E
25|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps {{built the}} guard station {{residence}} in 1938. It is rectangular one-story, wood-frame structures with gabled roof. The structure rests of a concrete foundation. There is an interior stone chimney off center {{from the roof}} ridge. The exterior walls are horizontal clapboard with vertical board and batten covering the gable ends. Windows are either a nine or twelve pane light sash type. The main <b>front</b> <b>window</b> {{is a group of}} three twelve pane windows set below a front gabled bay. A garage with hinged two-leaf doors is built into one end of the structure.|$|E

25|$|Class B trains {{were built}} between 1981 and 1994 {{to provide more}} stock to service the growing network in the 1980s. As with the class A trains, six prototypes were ordered. However, it took six years until the series {{production}} started and the prototypes had to be modified to match the series-production units. B units have {{the same size as}} A units but differ in the design (especially of the <b>front</b> <b>window)</b> and use three-phase current instead of direct current motors. The other difference is the door opening mechanism. On B units, the passengers only need to pull just one handle to open both doors rather than both handles as on A units. Of a total of 63 units, 57 are still in service (including one prototype), and six have been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment was performed on the house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters knew there was a problem somewhere in the city, but no one could find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, he slammed the door closed. The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a <b>front</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} rocket, the {{collapse}} of the gravity field causes Toby to reveal the mind of the Beast is still possessing him as he taunts the others while breathing out fire. Rose takes Captain Zach's bolt gun and shoots out the rocket's <b>front</b> <b>window,</b> unhooking Toby's safety harness to jettison the possessed man into space towards the black hole. The cabin is sealed by automatic shields but the rocket still lacks the power to escape the gravity well. Suddenly their ride smooths out and the rocket turns away from the black hole. The Doctor contacts Captain Zach, telling him that he is towing the rocket to safety with the TARDIS. The Doctor asks for Rose and jokingly offers to trade Zach back Ida, whom he rescued from the planet caverns, for Rose. The Doctor reports he did not have time to go back and save the Ood, who were innocent victims of the Beast's possession. Once safe, the respective crews depart on their separate ways. As they return to Earth, Captain Zach reads off the list of personnel that died, including the Ood.|$|E

50|$|Altogether 35 of the Class 1E {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} withdrawn from mainline service, modified and reclassified to Class 1ES {{for use as}} shunting locomotives. The modifications included alteration of the resistance grids in the electrical circuit and enlarged and widened cabs, but the gear ratios were not altered. Apart from the wider cabs, the modified Class 1ES locomotives were identifiable by their <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> with slanted upper edges compared to the rectangular <b>front</b> <b>windows</b> of the Class 1E.|$|R
500|$|The U Street {{corridor}} {{was devastated}} by the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. During the riots, black activist Stokely Carmichael, leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, asked Ben to keep his restaurant open and the Alis obtained permission to stay open past curfew. The restaurant fed both the police officers and firemen working to impose order on the neighborhood, {{as well as the}} black activists. The violence and arson reached such an extent that Ben wrote [...] "Soul Brother" [...] in soap on the <b>front</b> <b>window</b> in the hopes that it would stop the angry mobs.|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna {{from her}} third studio album True Blue (1986). The song was written by Brian Elliot with {{additional}} lyrics by Madonna, who produced it with Stephen Bray. The song also appears remixed on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and in its original form on the 2009 compilation album Celebration. The song's musical style combines pop and classical styling, and its lyrics deal with teenage pregnancy and abortion. It was based on teen gossip Elliot heard outside his studio, which has a large <b>front</b> <b>window</b> {{that doubles as a}} mirror where schoolgirls from the North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat.|$|E
500|$|Deemed Madonna's most girlish album yet, True Blue {{deals with}} Madonna's view of love, work and dreams {{as well as}} disappointments. According to Madonna, the title was from a {{favorite}} expression of her then husband Penn and his very pure vision of love. The album was her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. Most of its songs reflect this idea although each was developed separately. The first track, [...] "Papa Don't Preach", was written by Brian Elliot, who described it as [...] "a love song, maybe framed a little bit differently". The song is based on teenage gossip Elliot heard outside his studio, which had a large <b>front</b> <b>window</b> that doubled as a mirror where schoolgirls from the North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat.|$|E
