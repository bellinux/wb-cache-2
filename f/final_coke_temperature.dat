40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} in a microactivity test (MAT) and a fluidized bed reactor to develop an experimental protocol {{to determine how the}} yield and composition of coke and the associated catalyst surface area vary as a function of stripper conditions in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In both reactors, the use of rapid quenching has allowed the relatively short stripping times encountered in FCC units to be simulated. Low sulphur vacuum gas oils (VGO) with a low metal equilibrium catalyst (E-cat) were used for stripping periods of up to 20 minutes. Significant variations occur in the structure of both hard and soft coke during stripping. Although the hard coke becomes more highly condensed with prolonged stripping, the surface area reduction by the hard coke remains fairly constant for stripping periods in excess of ca. 5 - 10 minutes and is small (10 m 2 g- 1) in relation to the loss of surface area from the soft coke. The use of about 70 g of catalyst in the fluidized bed provides sufficient sample for demineralization to recover sufficient of the hard coke for 13 C NMR analysis after the initial extraction of the soft coke. Indeed, it has been found that a further pool of soft (chloroform soluble) coke is physically entrapped within the catalyst pore structure and is only released after demineralization. In fact, this second soft coke fraction is much more highly aromatic than the first and ultimately controls the <b>final</b> <b>coke</b> yield. For the combination of E-cat and VGOs investigated here, typically about half of the <b>final</b> hard <b>coke</b> content of nearly 1 % w/w catalyst is derived from this second soft coke fraction by carbonization. The structural information obtained has been used to formulate a model for the stripping process where the soft coke II fraction undergoes cracking in competition with coke formation and evaporative removal from the catalyst...|$|R

30|$|Methanol-to-hydrocarbon (MTH) process over acidic zeolite {{catalysts}} {{has been}} widely utilised to yield many types of hydrocarbons, {{some of which are}} eventually converted into the highly dehydrogenated (graphitized) carbonaceous species (cokes). The coking process can be divided into two parallel pathways based on the accepted hydrocarbon pool theory. From extensive investigations, it is reasonable to conclude that inner zeollite cavity/channel reactions at acidic sites generate cokes. However, coke formation and accumulation over the zeolite external surfaces {{play a major role in}} reaction deactivation as they contribute a great portion to the total coke amount. Herein we have reviewed previous literatures and included some recent works from KOPRC in understanding the nature and mechanism of coke formation, particularly during an H-ZSM- 5 catalysed MTH reaction. We specially conclude that rapid aromatics formation at the zeolite crystalite edges is the main reason for later stage coke accumulation on the zeolite external surfaces. Accordingly, the catalyst deactivation is in a great certain to arise at those edge areas due to having the earliest contact with the incoming methanol reactant. The <b>final</b> <b>coke</b> structure is therefore built up with layers of poly-aromatics, as the potential sp 2 carbons leading to pre-graphite structure. We have proposed a coke formation model particularly for the acidic catalyst, which we believe will be of assistance in understanding—and hence minimising—the coke formation mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the project is to demonstrate that a partial oxidation system, which utilizes a transport reactor, is a viable means of converting refinery wastes, byproducts, and other low value materials into valuable products. The primary product would be a high quality fuel gas, which {{could also be used}} as a source of hydrogen. The concept involves subjecting the hydrocarbon feed to pyrolysis and steam gasification in a circulating bed of solids. Carbon residue formed during pyrolysis, as well as metals in the feed, are captured by the circulating solids which are returned {{to the bottom of the}} transport reactor. Air or oxygen is introduced in this lower zone and sufficient carbon is burned, sub-stoichiometrically, to provide the necessary heat for the endothermic pyrolysis and gasification reactions. The hot solids and gases leaving this zone pass upward to contact the feed material and continue the gasification process.

40|$|Catalytic {{performance}} {{and the nature of}} surface adsorbates were investigated for high-surface-area ceria during the ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction using CO 2 as a soft oxidant. The high surface area ceria material was synthesized using a template-assisted method. The interactions among ethylbenzene, styrene, and CO 2 on the surface of ceria and the role of CO 2 for the ethylbenzene ODH reaction have been investigated in detail by using activity test, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared and Raman spectroscopy. CO 2 as an oxidant not only favored the higher yield of styrene but also inhibited the deposition of coke during the ethylbenzene ODH reaction. Ethylbenzene ODH reaction over ceria followed a two-step pathway: ethylbenzene is first dehydrogenated to styrene with H 2 formed simultaneously, and then CO 2 reacts with H 2 via the reverse water gas shift. The produced styrene can easily undergo polymerization to form polystyrene, which is a key intermediate for coke formation. In the absence of CO 2, the produced polystyrene transforms into graphite-like <b>coke</b> at <b>temperatures</b> above 500 °C, which leads to catalyst deactivation.

The microstructure of the coke was found to comprise an essentially inaccessible pore system at low temperatures of 77 - 273 K used in characterization, and it is more accessible to oxygen at higher temperatures of about 773 K used in oxidation. The correlation of reactivity data using the random pore model suggests that the true micropore area is significantly larger than that measured using physical gas adsorption methods. The difference in surface area {{can be attributed to the}} low kinetic energy of gas molecules at the lower temperatures of characterization; as a result, they are unable to overcome the pore mouth energy barrier. By examining the variation of coke structure with burnoff level, we find that most of the internal reaction occurs in pores in the narrow pore width range 1 - 2 nm.

In order to test catalytic behavior in more stressful conditions, contact time was decreased and the stability of powder and foam catalysts was investigated at 50, 000  h− 1. Despite very similar H 2 selectivities were recorded, the structured samples, containing boehmite as binder, showed the most interesting catalytic performance, as total ethanol conversion was assured for more than 1 day of time-on-stream. Foams geometry, in fact, enhanced coke gasification reactions, limiting, at the same time, plugging phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Calcined coke is a {{high quality}} carbon {{material}} produced by calcining green petroleum coke. Calcining {{is the process of}} heating green petroleum coke in a kiln to remove excess moisture, extract all remaining hydrocarbons, and modify the crystalline structure of the coke into a denser, electrically conductive product. The <b>final</b> product, calcined <b>coke,</b> is primarily used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum industry and recarburizing agent for industries such as the steel industry. If not appropriately controlled, the calcining process could lead to excess production of particulate emissions from either handling or storing of raw coke, or from the stack emissions during the production of calcined coke. Though calcined coke has shown low hazard potential in human populations due to low volatile content, there remains some public health concern regarding the emissions from these facilities. This study is designed to evaluate the emissions of petroleum coke calcining facility and assess the public health concern from the processes engaged in the handling and storage of green coke {{as well as from the}} calcining process. The ambient air levels were measured from a calcining facility and compared with the standards promulgated by USEPA. The results showed that pollutant contribution from the facility, measured by monitoring carbon fraction of the emissions, was de-minimis. The current research also studied whether the exposure levels and health risks specified in various epidemiological studies correlate with the standards promulgated by USEPA to protect public health from petrochemical emissions...|$|R
