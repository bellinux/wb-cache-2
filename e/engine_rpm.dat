25|$|In August 1919 Olympic {{returned}} to Belfast for restoration to civilian service. Her interior was modernised and her boilers {{were converted to}} burn oil rather than coal as it lowered the refuelling time from days to hours; it also gave a steadier <b>engine</b> <b>R.P.M</b> and allowed the engine room personnel to be reduced from 350 to 60 people. During the conversion work and drydocking, a dent with a crack at the centre was discovered below her waterline which was later concluded to {{have been caused by}} a torpedo that had failed to detonate.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|E

50|$|Setting {{the correct}} {{ignition}} timing {{is crucial in}} the performance of an engine. Sparks occurring too soon or too late in the engine cycle are often responsible for excessive vibrations and even engine damage. The ignition timing affects many variables including engine longevity, fuel economy, and engine power. Modern engines that are controlled in real time by an engine control unit use a computer to control the timing throughout the <b>engine's</b> <b>RPM</b> and load range. Older engines that use mechanical spark distributors rely on inertia (by using rotating weights and springs) and manifold vacuum in order to set the ignition timing throughout the <b>engine's</b> <b>RPM</b> and load range.|$|R
25|$|Since 2009 {{there have}} been {{widespread}} concerns from Chinese consumers particularly among the online community, who expressed that Volkswagen has {{failed to respond to}} complaints about defects in its DSG-equipped vehicles. Typical issues associated with 6-speed DSG include abnormal noise and inability to change gear; while issues associated with 7-speed DSG include abnormal noise, excessive shift shock, abnormal increase in <b>engine</b> <b>RPM,</b> flashing gear indicator on the dashboard as well as inability to shift to even-numbered gears. In March 2012 China’s quality watchdog the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said that it had been in contact with Volkswagen (China) and urged the carmaker to probe the issues. In a survey held by Gasgoo.com (China) of 2,937 industry experts and insiders, 83% of respondents believed that the carmaker should consider a full vehicle recall. In March 2012 Volkswagen Group China admitted that there could be an issue in its seven-speed DSG gearboxes that may affect approximately 500,000 vehicles from its various subsidiaries in China. A software upgrade has since been offered for the affected vehicles in an attempt to repair the problem.|$|E
500|$|Powered turret {{traverse}} {{was provided}} by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6º/second in low gear independent of <b>engine</b> <b>rpm,</b> at 19º/second — the same as with the Tiger I — [...] with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36º/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually turn the turret at one-half a degree per 360º turn.|$|E
500|$|F-84G: Single-seat {{fighter-bomber}} {{capable of}} delivering the Mark 7 nuclear bomb using the LABS, J35-A-29 engine, autopilot, capable of inflight refueling using both the boom (receptacle in left wing leading edge) and drogue (probe fitted to wingtip fuel tanks), introduced the multi-framed canopy which was later retrofitted to earlier straight-winged F-84s. A total of 3,025 were built (1,936 for NATO under MDAP). The larger engine {{had a higher}} airflow at its take-off thrust than the intake had been designed for. This caused higher flow velocities, increased pressure losses and thrust loss. Commencing with block 20, auxiliary [...] "suck-in" [...] doors were added ahead of the wing leading edge to regain some of the thrust loss. At high <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> and low aircraft speeds, such as take-off, the spring-loaded doors were sucked open by the partial vacuum created in the duct. When the aircraft reached sufficient airspeed the ram pressure rise in the duct closed the auxiliary doors. F-84G 51-1343 was modified with a periscope system to test the periscope installation proposed for the Republic XF-103.|$|E

5000|$|To {{control the}} turbocharger, the APC {{monitors}} the <b>engine's</b> <b>RPM</b> and inlet manifold pressure via a pressure transducer, and uses these inputs {{to control a}} solenoid valve that trims the rate of rise of pressure {{as well as the}} maximum pressure by directing boost pressure to the turbocharger's pneumatic wastegate actuator.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the load}} on the engine changes, its {{rotational}} speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through {{a change in the}} engine speed feedback signal. [...] The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that <b>engine</b> <b>RPM</b> and torque (and thus power output) will remain constant for any given throttle setting, regardless of actual road speed.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{equipped}} with a pair of Pratt and Whitney PW119C turboprop engines, which drive fully reversible Hartzell HD-E6C-3B propellers. The propeller blades generate notably less noise in comparison to their contemporary counterparts due to features such as their lower RPM, propeller synchrophasing, and the use of a six-blade configuration. The propeller system is dual-acting, being capable of adjusting pitch to maintain a constant <b>engine</b> <b>RPM.</b> During the early 1990s, the manufacturer claimed that the use of various noise reduction measures across the aircraft kept the internal cabin noise [...] "below that of even some modern jet aircraft".|$|E
2500|$|Turbochargers start {{producing}} boost {{only when}} {{a certain amount of}} kinetic energy is present in the exhaust gasses. Without adequate exhaust gas flow to spin the turbine blades, the turbocharger cannot produce the necessary force needed to compress the air going into the engine. The boost threshold is determined by the engine displacement, <b>engine</b> <b>rpm,</b> throttle opening, {{and the size of the}} turbocharger. The operating speed (rpm) at which there is enough exhaust gas momentum to compress the air going into the engine is called the [...] "boost threshold rpm". Reducing the [...] "boost threshold rpm" [...] can improve throttle response.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the required data, NHTSA also set standards for 30 other types of data if EDRs were voluntarily configured to record them. For example, if a manufacturer configured an EDR to record <b>engine</b> <b>RPMs</b> or ABS activity, then the EDR would have to record 5 seconds of those pre-crash data in half-second increments.|$|R

2500|$|Cams {{that have}} {{excessive}} valve lift, running at high rpm, can cause {{what is called}} [...] "valve float", where the valve spring tension is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex. This {{could also be a}} result of a very steep rise of the lobe, where the valve is effectively shot off the end of the cam rather than following the cams’ profile. [...] This is typically what happens when a motor over revs. [...] This is where the <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> exceeds the maximum design rpm. [...] The valve train is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily. [...] Sometimes an over rev can cause engine failure when the valves become bent as a result of colliding with the piston crowns.|$|E
2500|$|... 1982 saw {{the debut}} of the “Cross-Fire Injection” fuel {{delivery}} system. This TBI (Throttle Body Fuel Injection) was {{not the type of}} fuel injection installed previously in some C1 and C2 Corvettes. It utilized two throttle bodies combined with Chevrolet’s computer control system. The engine produced [...] and was mated to a new four-speed automatic transmission with torque converters bypass in the top three gears. Compared to the previous Turbo-Hydramatic 3-speed, the new 700-R4 transmission had a lower first and second gear for improved low-end acceleration, and a fourth gear overdrive that would reduce <b>engine</b> <b>RPM</b> by 30 percent at highway cruising speeds, resulting in better fuel economy. On the downside, the new transmission was not considered a strong unit and proved problematic. The final model C3 Corvette's published performance numbers were 0-60 in 7.9seconds-the quarter-mile in 16.1 @ [...] This was the last year for 8-track tape availability and new “cross-fire injection” emblems appeared on front fenders. Nose and fuel door crossed-flags emblems changed to a more squared design.|$|E
2500|$|The XJ12 {{version was}} {{announced}} in July 1972, featuring simplified grille treatment, and powered by a 5.3L V12 engine (coupled to a Borg Warner Model 12). The car as presented {{at that time was}} the world's only mass-produced 12-cylinder four-door car, and, with a top speed [...] "around 140 mph" [...] (225km/h) as the [...] "fastest full four-seater available in the world today". Although it had been the manufacturer's intention from launch that the XJ would take the twelve-cylinder engine, its installation was nonetheless a tight fit, and providing adequate cooling had evidently been a challenge for the engineers designing the installation. [...] Bonnet/hood louvres such as those fitted on the recently introduced twelve-cylinder E Type were rejected, but the XJ12 featured a complex [...] "cross-flow" [...] radiator divided into two separated horizontal sections and supported with coolant feeder tanks at each end: [...] the engine fan was geared to rotate at 1¼ times the speed of the <b>engine</b> <b>rpm,</b> subject to a limiter which cut in at a (fan) speed of 1,700rpm. [...] The fuel system incorporated a relief valve that returned fuel to the tank when pressure in the leads to the carburetters exceeded 1.5 psi {{to reduce the risk of}} vapour locks occurring at the engine's high operating temperature, while the car's battery, unusually, benefited from its own thermostatically controlled cooling fan.|$|E

50|$|Dual-Stage turbochargers use {{two smaller}} turbochargers either {{side-by-side}} or in sequence. The first is used at low speeds and a valve {{opens up the}} second as <b>engine</b> <b>RPMs</b> increase. The dual-stage used in the Audi A6/A7 three liter V6 engine however runs both turbochargers at a lower pressure mode and some use one larger turbo followed by a smaller one. The Dualboost has dual compressors to mimic a twin turbocharger.|$|R
50|$|Hydrostatic {{transmissions}} for {{earth moving}} machines, such as for track loaders, are often {{equipped with a}} separate 'inch pedal' {{that is used to}} temporarily increase the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> while reducing the vehicle speed in order to increase the available hydraulic power output for the working hydraulics at low speeds and increase the tractive effort.

50|$|Introduced for 1980, the AOD {{automatic}} transmission helped raise the fuel economy of all full-size cars at Ford; {{instead of the}} commonly seen 3-speed layout, it boasted a 4-speed overdrive configuration, which significantly lowered <b>engine</b> <b>RPMs</b> (and fuel consumption) at highway speeds. The AOD was standard equipment on the Continental Mark VI, the Lincoln Continental, and the Lincoln Town Car, spreading to the Ford and Mercury lines in 1981.|$|R
50|$|The {{cruise control}} takes its speed signal from a {{rotating}} driveshaft, speedometer cable, {{wheel speed sensor}} from the <b>engine's</b> <b>RPM,</b> or from internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle. Most systems do not allow {{the use of the}} cruise control below a certain speed - typically around 25 mph. The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the throttle cable with a solenoid, a vacuum driven servomechanism, or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle (fully electronic) if it uses a 'drive-by-wire' system.|$|R
50|$|One unique {{innovation}} of the K-series was {{the introduction}} of Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). Based on the Helmholtz resonance principle, the intake manifold is equipped with 3 chambers tuned to a specific resonant frequency. The computer dynamically switches between each resonant chamber to achieve the appropriate resonant frequency for the <b>engine's</b> <b>rpm.</b> This effect optimizes volumetric efficiency over a given rpm range to provide maximum torque over the entire rpm range. VRIS is used on the K8, KF, and KL but nearly all modern Mazda V6s are now using this technology.|$|R
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} clutch {{is used in}} some vehicles (e.g., mopeds) and also in other applications where {{the speed of the}} engine defines the state of the clutch, for example, in a chainsaw. This clutch system employs centrifugal force to automatically engage the clutch when the <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> rises above a threshold and to automatically disengage the clutch when the <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> falls low enough. See Saxomat and Variomatic.|$|E
50|$|Turbochargers and superchargers {{are both}} {{engine-driven}} air compressors (exhaust-driven or mechanically driven, respectively) and provide {{varying levels of}} boost according to <b>engine</b> <b>rpm,</b> load etc. Quite often there is a power band within a given range of available boost pressure {{and it is an}} aid to performance driving to be aware of when that power band is being approached, in the same way a driver wants to be aware of <b>engine</b> <b>rpm.</b>|$|E

I-Shift borrowed from old transmission technologies like non-synchronised main gears which allowed a reduction in size and weight and a countershaft brake to achieve more precise shift control while matching <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> to transmissions rpm e.g. TECU requests the EECU to correct <b>engine</b> <b>rpm</b> so as to synchronise the rpm to effect a smooth gear change, similar to double declutching.|$|E
50|$|The {{engineer}} {{operated the}} machinery {{from a position}} between the main engine propulsion gearboxes on the centreline of the vessel. This was generally done in the sitting down position, using a removable seat which was hung from the engine room access ladder. Four levers were used to control the two Gardner 8L3s <b>engine's</b> <b>RPM</b> settings and the direction of drive to the propellers via reversing gearboxes. A governor (speed control) control lever was used to adjust the engine revolutions, and a gearbox lever was used with positions for ahead, neutral and reverse.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} altitude, the autopilot then commanded a continuous nose-up movement of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevators. This resulted {{in an increase in}} the angle of attack of up to 24°, or 13° above the stall angle of attack in the event conditions, as well as the broadcast of several [...] "STABILIZER MOTION" [...] warnings. Both engines suffered a surge probably due to the plane's high angle of attack. Both <b>engines</b> <b>RPM</b> then decreased to values close to idle. This surge may have been noticed by the crew.|$|R

However, there are different levels of regulations {{that are based on}} the ship’s date of construction. Those levels are broken down into 3 Tiers. Tier I applies to the ships built after January 1st of 2000. It states that for <b>engines</b> below 130 <b>rpm</b> must have the total weighted cycle emission limit (g/kWh) of 17, engines that are between 130 and 1999 rpm must have no more than 12.1 (g/kWh), <b>engines</b> above 2000 <b>rpm</b> must have the limit of 9.8 (g/kWh). Tier II has the following requirements: 14.4 (g/kWh) for engines less than 13 rpm, 9.7 (g/kWh) for engines 130 - 1999 <b>rpm,</b> and for <b>engines</b> over 2000 <b>rpm</b> 7.7 (g/kWh) is the limit. Tier II limits apply to the ships constructed after January 1st of 2011.Tier III controls only apply in the specific areas where the NOx emission are more seriously controlled (NECAs) and apply to the ships constructed after January 1st of 2016. For <b>engines</b> under 130 <b>rpm</b> the limit is 3.4 (g/Kwh), <b>engines</b> between 130-1999 <b>rpm</b> the limit us 2.4 (g/kWh), <b>engines</b> above 2000 <b>rpm</b> must have the total weighted cycle emission limit of 2.0 (g/kWh).|$|R
