2500|$|Sackville-West {{loved to}} travel, {{frequently}} going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia, and these trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse with its theme of longing {{for someone who}} is not there was inspired partly by the frequent absences of Sackville-West. Woolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write one of her most famous novels, , featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West's son Nigel Nicolson as [...] "the longest and most charming love-letter in literature." [...] Unusually, Woolf documented the moment of the conception of Orlando: she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: [...] "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other" [...] (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband Leonard Woolf). Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write Orlando, asking in a letter: [...] "But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and <b>its</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind...Do you mind, say Yes or No?" [...] Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. [...] Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves to too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. [...] Orlando, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world. After finishing Orlando, Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: [...] "For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of Orlando-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity passim". In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: [...] "Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting...I'm not so sure...I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks".|$|E

[...] The Nation of Ulysses described themselves not as a rock and roll group in the traditional sense, but [...] "as a political party" [...] and as [...] "a shout of secession".

[...] Cosmopolitans Eliza Thompson wrote that [...] "the clip shows Rihanna rolling around under sheets while dice roll up and down her body, writhing on the floor in sheer lingerie, and stripping off her oversize business-lady suit." [...] According to McDean the idea to include dice in the video came from him and his creative partner Masha Vasyukova, [...] "Sometimes <b>its</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> combining things that might not make any sense, like subconsciousness and dreams.

5000|$|Landsman's role in {{the police}} {{department}} is that of a supervisory detective sergeant who rarely participates in investigative work. Landsman generally acts {{in the best interests of}} his subordinates especially those who give him the necessary clearances (closed cases). As a supervisor, Landsman acts in accordance with the wishes of his superior officers even though in some cases, he does not necessarily agree with specific commands. Examples of this are when he is ordered to have Bunk Moreland find Kenneth Dozerman's missing firearm in Season 3 and when a dead state's witness becomes an electoral issue in Season 4. Throughout the series, he is shown as a commander attempting to strike a balance between loyalty to subordinates and superiors, most often favoring the latter. Landsman has only been called to solve a few murders on his own as a supervisor. Landsman is generally jovial and provides a degree of comic relief in the series. He also possesses a shrewd understanding of the subtle politics in the chain of command, almost always successfully acting in self-preservation and self-promotion without making many enemies. He states that clearly to McNulty, during the first episode of season 2, by saying <b>its</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> self-preservation and it is too bad that McNulty never learned that. Overall, under Landsman's supervision, the homicide unit ends up often clearing many of the more challenging [...] "whodunit" [...] homicides occurring in Baltimore city proving him to be an effective sergeant within the department. However, he can be mildly bullying and tends to derive his good humor from schadenfreude though he is not generally malicious.|$|E

I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadnt sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers Corner saying, Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard whats happening at Glastonbury this year? I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonalds are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesnt mean Im attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. Ive hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. Ive seen his show. Its not my bag, but its all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesnt like hip-hop—shock, horror. I dont dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the 80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But <b>its</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> status and bling now, and it doesnt say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallaghers comments he said [...] "I havent spoken to him Gallagher, I heard he was reaching out. I dont bear any grudge, its all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, Ive always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, Ive always stated that I dont believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it".

5000|$|Todd Agnew told CCM Magazines Matt Conner, [...] "I still {{really believe}} in these songs, and Im excited about sharing them, its {{actually}} a neat thing, because typically you write the songs, record those songs {{and then you go}} play the songs after you get everything ready and it comes out. Whereas Ive gotten this unexpected blessing of being able to really dig into that record and take a break from it. I was able to live life—to be a husband, dad, church guy, friend and neighbor. Then after having so fresh air, I can come back to it and remember why it was important and what God was doing." [...] In addition, Agnew said [...] "...this is a lot more hopeful album than the other stuff that Ive done, not that Im veering away from dealing with tough subjects, but God has been showing me that the goodness that I tell about him to others is something he desires for me too. I understand my shame and mistakes well, so Ive always been amazed that God would love me. Thats what Grace Like Rain is about. Worship comes out of gratitude." [...] Agnew tells that this has impacted him in that [...] "Rather than focusing on what guitar part was right or wrong and only thinking about those things, I can enjoy it as the music God was giving me in that period of time, <b>its</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> what God was teaching me and sharing through me." [...] Because Agnew now understands more than ever, [...] "...God has been teaching me that He is the prime mover. I am a part of His moving. Thats the opposite of what Ive understood for so long. Thats a different thing for me. Ive always been performance oriented, so when I made mistakes, they were devastating for me. God has had me on this journey of starting to understand that Hes the one doing this and it cannot be stopped. I might mess it up, but that doesnt surprise Him. Instead He knew that would and uses that and will still be victorious despite some of my failures." ...|$|E
