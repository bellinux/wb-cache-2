5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts <b>for</b> <b>creation</b> of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the act, a series of test strikes {{depicting}} Martha Washington were carried out to test a variety of gold-colored metallic compositions. Although the act provided <b>for</b> <b>creation</b> of the new coin, it also allowed for resumption of striking the Anthony design until production began on the gold-colored dollar. Nearing depletion of Treasury stores, on May 20, 1999, the U.S. Mint announced that production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar would resume. In total, 41,368,000 Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck for circulation dated 1999. The design was officially retired in 2000, when the Sacagawea dollar entered production.|$|E

NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site, construction, operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040. Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government had volunteered to host the facility. Kōchi Prefecture showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Henry College {{received}} accreditation in 2007 {{from the}} Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, a national accrediting organization for Christian colleges, universities, and seminaries {{created by the}} Institute <b>for</b> <b>Creation</b> Research. The College had previously been denied accreditation by the American Academy for Liberal Education {{in the spring of}} 2002 because creationism was part of the curriculum. On June 30, 2005, the school was officially recognized by the United States Department of Education as an institution eligible for DOE programs. It also allowed students to use more scholarships and grants and made donors and students eligible for various tax benefits. On April 3, 2012, the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools reaffirmed Patrick Henry College's accreditation for a period of ten years.|$|E
5|$|Pixar and Disney had {{disagreements}} {{after the}} production of Toy Story 2 (1999). Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible <b>for</b> <b>creation</b> and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights {{was perhaps the most}} onerous aspect to Pixar and {{set the stage for a}} contentious relationship.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} as chief {{executive}} officer of Dekalb County, Georgia in 2000, winning 64% of the vote, and was re-elected in 2004 with 54% of the vote. Jones is the first African American to serve as CEO of the county, and the youngest ever elected in the county. In April 2001, shortly after Jones became CEO, he voted, along with five other DeKalb County Commissioners, to offer life and health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of gay and unmarried County employees. DeKalb was the first county in Georgia to offer such benefits. During his administration, Dekalb County established the first local Homeland Security Office in 2001. Under Jones, DeKalb County approved creation of a new senior center, increased funding for roads, libraries, and park improvements while maintaining a balanced budget, and increasing the County's credit rating to AAA. As CEO, Jones promoted and achieved passage of a $125 million bond referendum that allowed for the acquisition of 2,735 acre expansion of the DeKalb County's green space, increasing the county's parks and green space by 70%. He requested and received Congressional designation of Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area. Jones was also primarily responsible <b>for</b> <b>creation</b> of Dekalb County’s first economic development department, which generated $4 billion in new investments.|$|E

It was originally created by Univac <b>for</b> the <b>creation</b> of Operating System (OS) updates.

The sources could recursively reference additional sources, providing wide flexibility in input parsing. The rules <b>for</b> output <b>creation</b> were also in source files, with similar levels of dynamic input capability. Interpretation of the multiple input sources allowed <b>for</b> dynamic <b>creation</b> of output stream content. Complex recursive processes {{could be applied to}} create program source code, job execution sequences, simulated dynamic input from virtual consoles, and in general provide scripting capabilities reminiscent of the Unix GREP and YACC tools.|$|R
