50|$|The <b>haze</b> <b>meter</b> also {{measures}} total transmittance. Total transmittance is {{the measure}} of the total incident light compared to the light that is actually transmitted (e.g. total transmittance). So the incident light may be 100%, but because of absorption and reflection the total transmittance may only be 94%.|$|E
50|$|A <b>haze</b> <b>meter</b> {{measures}} {{the amount of}} light that is diffused or scattered when passing through a transparent material. Transparency is important because a material {{needs to be more}} or less see-through depending on its practical usage, e.g. a grocery bag needs the light to be more diffused so that less can be seen while food packaging film needs the light to be less diffused so that the contents can be seen clearly. For reasons such as these haze meters are necessary to determine which material is needed for which practical purpose.|$|E
40|$|Looks of beer is an {{important}} factor which is associated with high clarity. Clarity of beer is a basic precondition of its good marketability and consumer satisfaction. Beer filtration is ideal tool to create required optical properties. There is a high accent on this operation in brewery and minibrewery. The process of filtering removes unwanted haze-active substances in order to increase clarity and overall stability of beer. Objective method to expressing clarity of beer is nephelometric determination of turbidity, which is highly sensitive and achieved by reliable results directly in the units used to express the turbidity values in beer. The objective of our study was to measure haze before and after filtration in various types of beer with different length of lagering. Kieselguhr was used as filtration material. Haze of beer was measured by <b>haze</b> <b>meter</b> in determination under 2 angles and values were expressed in European Brewery Convention units directly...|$|E
40|$|Methyltrimethoxysilane {{has been}} used as a base in the {{formation}} of transparent sol-gel coatings on glass substrates. Several types of alcohol were used as solvents in order to obtain the highest transparency and scratch hardness of the film. The coating cures at room temperature (26 ∘C). The clarity of the coated film on the glass substrate was measured using <b>haze</b> <b>meter.</b> The best formulation based on the lowest haze values and light diffusion is the ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 1 trimethoxy silane to N-propanol. The haze value obtained for this system is 0. 86, and the light diffusion was measured at 0. 77 %. Tack-free time and hardness were within acceptable value. Nanoparticles of silver, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide were incorporated into the coating system from 0. 5 % to 2. 5 % by weight, and the haze values of the dried film were measured. The highest transparency was obtained from the samples that were mixed with 0. 5 % silver. The haze value for this sample is of 0. 5...|$|E
30|$|The {{morphology}} of the PVP layer adsorbed on the AgNWs {{was investigated}} by optical microscope (VHX- 600, Keyence), {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM, SU 8020, Hitachi High-Technologies), and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM- 2100, JEOL). The sheet resistance of 30  mm ×  20  mm AgNW electrodes was measured using a four-point probe meter (Loresta GP T 610, Mitsubishi Chemical Analytech). The transmittance investigated here was the transmittance of parallel light and {{does not include the}} transmittance of diffused light. The parallel transmittance (Tp) of the AgNW electrode for wavelengths in the range 300 – 900  nm was measured using a UV–visible/near-infrared spectrophotometer (V 670, JASCO). The testing window size of the spectrophotometer is 12  mm ×  6  mm, and three different places of one sample were tested and the average value was used as the transmittance for each sample. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out on a thermal analyzer (TG–DTA 2000 SA, Netzsch Japan). The electrode haze was measured using a D 65 illumination <b>haze</b> <b>meter</b> with a strong visible light source (HZ-V 3, Suga Test Instruments). For the capacitive sensor, changes in capacitance were measured using a digital multimeter (34410 A, Agilent Technologies).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Inadequate {{radiation}} or insufficient {{cutaneous absorption}} of UVB {{is one of}} the cardinal causes of vitamin D deficiency. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether air pollution and low ground level of ultra-violet B light (UVB; 290 - 315) can deteriorate the body vitamin D status in healthy women. Methods In this cross sectional study 200, free-living, housewives, aged between 20 to 55 years, from Tehran (high polluted area) and Ghazvin (low polluted area) were included. The Tehranian women were selected randomly from participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) and the Ghazvinian females from patients who came to public health centers. Participants were excluded for disease and drugs which affect vitamin D status and also if they were pregnant or breast feeding. We measured the ground level of UVB using a <b>Haze</b> <b>meter</b> as a surrogate of air pollution. In order to calculate the adjusted mean difference of 25 -OH-D, ANCOVA analysis was used. Moreover, Binary logistic regression model was developed to determine the odds of living in Tehran for having serum 25 -OH-D less than 20 ng/ml. Results The mean ± SD of serum 25 -OH-D was significantly higher in Ghazvinian women ((18 ± 11 vs. 13 ± 7), P-value vs. 31 % and 32 % in respectively). Secondary hyperparathyroidism was also significantly higher in Tehranian women (47 % vs. 32 %). In ANCOVA analysis, after adjustment, the mean of 25 -OH-D in the Ghazvinian group was still statistically significantly higher than Tehranians (13 vs. 17 ng/ml P-value = 0. 04). In addition, in binary logistic model, the odd of living in Tehran for having serum 25 -OH-D less than 20 ng/ml was 5. 22 (95 % confidence interval 2. 2 - 12. 2, P-value Conclusion We found that living in a polluted area plays a significant independent role in vitamin D deficiency and hence, residence can be one of the main reasons of vitamin D status of the women. </p...|$|E
