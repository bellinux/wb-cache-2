500|$|Swan's {{time on the}} South Coast was miserable: {{family dog}} Zee died; wife Bex had a {{difficult}} birth with baby George; and Swan became a hate figure with his teammates and the local population at large after the club suffered a poor start to the season. Swan's problems then took a supernatural bent as the young couple became convinced that their Plymouth home was haunted – the family moved 260 miles back to the more friendly surroundings of Stoke. He got {{off on the wrong}} foot with the Argyle fans after the local media pointed out that his goal saving tackle at Vale Park on 19 February 1994 had cost Plymouth promotion (Vale had finished three points ahead of Plymouth, who lost out to Burnley in the playoffs); Shilton also did little to help Swan's cause by appointing him as captain at the expense of fan's favourite Steve Castle. His new teammates also resented the record-signing Northerner for intruding on their clique. Rudge offered Shilton £150,000 to bring Swan back to Vale Park, but was refused; the local press asked Swan [...] "If you're so desperate to leave, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Plymouth in the first place?"; his answer of [...] "For the money" [...] only served to further incense supporters. Meanwhile, he had off-the-field scuffles with teammates Alan Nicholls and Kevin Nugent. Despite this, Swan's form on the pitch did improve {{towards the end of the}} season. Shilton was replaced by Steve McCall, who was in turn replaced by caretaker-manager Russell Osman, though neither men were able to steer the club away from relegation at the end of 1994–95 – to Swan's delight.|$|E

2500|$|After {{retiring}} {{for less}} than three hours, the jury returned to deliver a guilty verdict. On 22 August 2000, while sentencing Dupas to life imprisonment without the opportunity for release on parole, Judge Frank Vincent remarked [...] "...the prospects of your eventual rehabilitation must be regarded as so close to hopeless {{that they can be}} effectively discounted. There is no indication whatsoever that you have experienced any sense of remorse for what you have done, and I doubt that you are capable of any such human response. At a fundamental level, as human beings, you present for us the awful, threatening and unanswerable question: How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be as you are?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{answered}} in terms which satisfied them both, and the supper proceeded gaily. But when {{the table was}} cleared, and Mr. Engelman had lit his pipe, and I had kept him company with a cigar, then Mr. Keller put the fatal question. [...] "And now tell me, David, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us on business or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us on pleasure?" ...|$|R
