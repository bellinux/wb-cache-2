5|$|For {{reasons that}} USAF {{officers}} {{were unable to}} explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle <b>Flight</b> <b>unit</b> at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating {{for almost two years}} in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded negatively for technical reasons that the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} and flight results from the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) <b>flight</b> <b>units</b> used in the Orbiter middeck, Spacelab module and the Orbiter cargo bay. The SAMS units are general purpose microgravity accelerometers designed to support a variety of science experiments with microgravity acceleration measurements. A total of six <b>flight</b> <b>units</b> have been fabricated; four {{for use in the}} Orbiter middeck and Spacelab module, and two for use in the Orbiter cargo bay. The design of the units is briefly described. The initial two <b>flights</b> of SAMS <b>units</b> on STS- 40 (June 1991) and STS- 43 (August 1991) resulted in 371 megabytes and 2. 6 gigabytes of data, respectively.

40|$|The Advanced Video Guidance Sensor (AVGS), {{an active}} sensor system that {{provides}} near-range 6 -degree-of-freedom sensor data, {{has been developed}} {{as part of an}} automatic rendezvous and docking system for the Demonstration of Autonomous Rendezvous Technology (DART). The sensor determines the relative positions and attitudes between the active sensor and the passive target at ranges up to 300 meters. The AVGS uses laser diodes to illuminate retro-reflectors in the target, a solid-state imager to detect the light returned from the target, and image capture electronics and a digital signal processor to convert the video information into the relative positions and attitudes. The development of the sensor, through initial prototypes, final prototypes, and three <b>flight</b> <b>units,</b> has required a great deal of testing at every phase, and the different types of testing, their effectiveness, and their results, are presented in this paper, focusing on the testing of the <b>flight</b> <b>units.</b> Testing has improved the sensor's performance...|$|R
