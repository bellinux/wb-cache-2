In so doing, it addresses a relatively new area in leadership. The study focuses on four main questions: Are there parallels between feminist leadership styles and a new evolving field for leaders in technology? Is there something about technology that lends itself to female leadership styles? Has technology helped validate women's styles of leadership? What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> women entering the field now?Six women administrators, interviewed over a three-month period spoke {{on such issues as}} formal and informal relationships, collaborative team building, and getting the job done.

40|$|Historically, {{reforms and}} American {{schools have been}} closely intertwined. Currently, another reform, {{academic}} learning standards, is being implemented in most classrooms. Since the history surrounding school reform (Labaree 1999, Sarason 1990, Gibboney 1997, Fullan 1997) is not replete with success, {{it makes sense to}} question why yet another reform. Implementation becomes a key component of this study. Research portrays implementation as a process in which local actors redefine policy to fit local agendas (Spillane, 1998). Successful implementation requires mutual adaptation in which external policy is adapted to fit local conditions, and local conditions are adapted to fit policy (McLaughlin, 1990). Therefore, the implementation of academic learning standards may require close scrutiny if it is to succeed. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} to document, describe and analyze the journey of students, teachers and a principal in an elementary school in Southeastern Pennsylvania as academic learning standards are implemented as a reform effort. The following questions are addressed: As a reform, how are academic learning standards implemented at the local level and what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> students, teachers and a principal? What kinds of structures are supported and created in this implementation process? ^ The data sources for this study are artifacts, fieldnotes, walkthrough data, student and teacher interviews and a principal 2 ̆ 7 s journal. The data are analyzed with a specific focus on understanding the participants 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences of the phenomenon (Marshall and Rossman, 1999). ^ The results indicate that the implementation of academic learning standards is a very complex process. The implementation process produces a tension between the creation of a shared vision around standards and autonomous decisions in the classroom. A teacher 2 ̆ 7 s teaching and learning practices may or may not be impacted. Also, in this era of accountability, teachers and administrators are influenced to create and use normative structures that demonstrate student learning. The study reveals that rubrics, as a normative structure of standards, may increase students 2 ̆ 7 capacity for controlling their learning and assessing their work. In addition, having access to ideas and knowledge about standards influences the flow of these ideas and knowledge within the school community. Finally, the study indicates that language is a key factor in a successful implementation process. ...|$|E

In {{the first part of}} my thesis I take a little journey into history and I show the most important principles in compensating workers. In the second part I am discovering the differences between theory and real life. I based my arguments on assumption, that every employee, every person is unique, has its own goals and preferences.

40|$|AbstractSocial media {{steps over}} {{traditional}} outlets to offer faster news delivery sprinkled with opinions, commentary and perspectives on business activity. It {{has become the}} need of the hour for financial services organizations to set a policy concerning social media. Getting it wrong could mean significant reputational damage, ignoring it could mean being left behind. Those financial services institutions embracing social media {{are better able to}} pick up on customer complaints circulating in the online world, and respond before reputational damage occurs. Clearly social media is about socializing in communities online. Social media is collective rather than monologue. Many people talking to many and being able to do so when they want, where they want, and how they want. Connecting through emails, blogs, wikis, web, video and photo sites, social media isn’t necessarily about going to a particular place. It's more about coming together and networking and connecting in a new, more equal and progressive way. To be ‘best able <b>to</b> connect’ <b>means</b> <b>to</b> move toward a sophisticated, responsive distribution mindset. To be where people are and to participate in a way that speaks to them directly. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be in people's personal environments – Facebook, MySpace, Linkedin, Twitter, etc. Ignoring the power of online word-of-mouth is no longer an option in today's interconnected world. The ability of consumers to influence corporate behavior and impact business planning in unanticipated and, at times, unwelcome ways has grown exponentially. One ‘entertaining’ complaint from an irate customer going viral can escalate into a full-blown crisis in less than 24 hours. In this environment, understanding what customers feel, think and say about company – in real time – is ever more critical. Financial services companies need to harness the great power of social media in order to enhance customer service, manage their reputation and obtain a competitive advantage. Social media humanizes customer service, brings businesses closer to their stakeholders, and makes information more accessible...|$|R

3000|$|... (p)= 0 otherwise. We {{have chosen}} the {{truncation}} point at p= 10 because datasets generated with p= 10 or with p close to 10 have similar statistical behavior. Hence, to distinguish whether a process follows an EP distribution with p= 10 or, say, p= 10.1 we would need an extremely large data set. Moreover, the choice of truncation should be made before the analyst looks at the data. For example, for the first application below, after looking at the scatterplot one may think about truncating the prior for values of p that correspond to leptokurtic distributions, that is, 1 <p< 2. However, <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> would <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> use the data twice in the Bayes Theorem formula: once through the prior, and another time through the likelihood. Usually, such double use of the data leads to underestimation of the uncertainty. Therefore, we prefer to decide the truncation of the prior before looking at the data.|$|R
