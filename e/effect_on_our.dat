An example of implicit memory's <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> social interactions has been {{illustrated by the}} pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he would shake the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to shake his hand. Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, {{in spite of the}} fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.|$|E

Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12, which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons.

Bethmann Hollweg told Riezler that Germany was [...] "completely paralysed" [...] and that the [...] "future belongs to Russia which is growing and growing, and is becoming an ever increasing nightmare to us".
