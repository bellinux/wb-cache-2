5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a flurry of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), was written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{published}} {{information about}} follicular fluid leptin concentrations or presence of 25 leptin and leptin-receptor in the equine ovary or oocyte. Three groups of mares: adult draft 26 mares, draft fillies and adult Standardbred mares {{were included in}} the study. Leptin and 27 leptin-receptor were detected in all immature oocytes by immunofluorescence with 28 intensity that was higher <b>in</b> oocytes from <b>draft</b> mares compared to draft fillies and 29 Standardbred mares. After in vitro maturation a higher proportion of oocytes reached 30 metaphase II <b>in</b> <b>draft</b> mares than <b>in</b> <b>draft</b> fillies and Standardbred mares, and in all groups 31 both leptin and leptin-receptor became localized in the oocyte cortex but with higher 32 immunopositivity <b>in</b> <b>draft</b> mares compared to draft fillies and Standardbred mares. These 33 intensities were confirmed by expression profile of leptin and leptin-receptor mRNA. 34 Moreover, leptin was detected in ovarian blood vessels in all kind of animals and within the 35 corpora lutea in adult mares. Serum and follicular fluid concentrations of leptin were 36 similar <b>in</b> <b>draft</b> and Standardbred mares but higher <b>in</b> <b>draft</b> mares than <b>in</b> <b>draft</b> fillies. This 37 study supports the hypothesis that expression of leptin and leptin-receptor mRNA and the 38 rate of maturation can be related either to adiposity or to puberty...|$|R
5|$|Mathematics were {{essential}} <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> the astronomical calendar, a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. Use {{of the ancient}} Sifen calendar (古四分曆), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days, was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar (太初曆) that measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. However, Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Hodgson was ranked ninth among North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau.

Scouting reports and former coaches {{emphasized}} Hodgson's hockey sense and character, while Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis cited his leadership as a strong factor <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> him. After the 2007–08 season, OHL coaches had voted him the smartest player in the Eastern Conference. As his skating was considered a weakness, he spent the subsequent off-season training to improve it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{instrumental}} <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally did {{not want}} to swear allegiance to the British government, and he chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States. Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now that the war was over, the tour failed, forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands. Here his health failed him again, leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society).|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. <b>In</b> <b>drafting</b> A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E

5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli was {{politically}} active in Warsaw {{during and after}} the Four-Year Sejm (1788–92). He served as intermediary between the reformist Patriotic Party and King Stanisław August Poniatowski, and as an aide to the King (1789–93). He is best remembered for his participation <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> the Constitution of May 3, 1791, a milestone act in the history of Polish political legislation. He was one of the organizers of the Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence in 1794, which was the last armed struggle to be held under the banners of the Commonwealth. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Piattoli was interned by the Austrians for several years, together with another Polish activist of the Constitution movement, Hugo Kołłątaj. Freed in 1800, he worked several years with Polish and Russian statesman Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski in the service of Russia, before retiring to Courland.|$|E
5|$|The British Parliament's {{efforts to}} levy new taxes {{following}} the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to {{taxation without representation}} was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> the national Declaration of Independence.|$|E

5|$|The largely free {{elections}} of 1950 were {{won by the}} popular Árbenz, and represented the first transfer of power between democratically elected leaders in Guatemala. Árbenz had personal ties to {{some members of the}} communist PGT, which was legalized during his government, and a couple of members played a role <b>in</b> <b>drafting</b> the new president's policies. Nonetheless, Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a communist state, instead choosing a moderate capitalist approach. The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from feudalism and improving workers' rights. The most prominent component of Árbenz's policy was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill himself, having sought advice from economists across Latin America. The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would then be able to begin viable farms of their own.|$|E
