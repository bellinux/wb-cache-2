50|$|It {{is known}} that <b>Grover's</b> {{algorithm}} is optimal. That is, any algorithm that accesses the database only by using the operator Uω must apply Uω at least {{as many times as}} <b>Grover's</b> algorithm. This result is important in understanding the limits of quantum computation. If the <b>Grover's</b> search problem was solvable with logc N applications of Uω, that would imply that NP is contained in BQP, by transforming problems in NP into Grover-type search problems. The optimality of <b>Grover's</b> algorithm suggests (but does not prove) that NP is not contained in BQP.|$|R

5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove <b>Grover</b> from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. <b>Grover</b> returned to Clinton and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with <b>Grover</b> reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Grover's</b> quantum search {{algorithm}} finds one of t {{solutions in}} N candidates by using N/t basic steps.

On the other hand, Boyer etal proposed a randomized application of <b>Grover's</b> algorithm, which runs, on average, in O(N/t) basic steps (more precisely, (9 / 4) N/t steps) without knowing t in advance. Here we show a simple (almost trivial) deterministic application of <b>Grover's</b> algorithm also works and finds a solution in O(N/t) basic steps (more precisely, (8 #/ 3) N/t steps) on average. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{dissipation}} or leakage on the time evolution of <b>Grover's</b> algorithm for a quantum computer. We introduce an effective two-level model with dissipation and randomness (imperfections), which is based upon the idea that ideal <b>Grover's</b> algorithm operates in a 2 -dimensional Hilbert space. The simulation results of this model and <b>Grover's</b> algorithm with imperfections are compared, and it is found that they are in good agreement for appropriately tuned parameters. It turns out that the main features of <b>Grover's</b> algorithm with imperfections can be understood in terms of two basic mechanisms, namely, a diffusion of probability density into the full Hilbert space and a stochastic rotation within the original 2 -dimensional Hilbert space.

50|$|When {{applications}} of <b>Grover's</b> algorithm are considered, {{it should be}} emphasized that the database is not represented explicitly. Instead, an oracle is invoked to evaluate an item by its index. Reading a full data-base item by item and converting it into such a representation may take a lot longer than <b>Grover's</b> search. To account for such effects, <b>Grover's</b> algorithm can be viewed as solving an equation or satisfying a constraint. In such applications, the oracle is a way to check the constraint and is not related to the search algorithm. This separation usually prevents algorithmic optimizations, whereas conventional search algorithms often rely on such optimizations and avoid exhaustive search. These and other considerations about using <b>Grover's</b> algorithm are discussed in a paper by Viamontes, Markov and Hayes.|$|R
5|$|Percy tells Annabeth {{about his}} dreams, and she deduces that <b>Grover</b> {{has found the}} Golden Fleece, which can cure Thalia's {{poisoned}} tree, and {{is located at the}} coordinates from the Gray Sisters. Tantalus (who replaced Chiron as camp counselor) sends Clarisse La Rue on a quest to find the Golden Fleece. Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson run away from camp to find <b>Grover.</b> They are aided in their escape by the god Hermes, who helps them reach a passing cruise ship, the Princess Andromeda. Once aboard, they discover that the ship is full of tourists in a dream-like state living alongside Greek monsters. They are captured by Luke Castellan and learn that he is trying to revive his master Kronos. They escape on a lifeboat and eventually find one of many hideouts that Luke, Thalia, and Annabeth built as children. They are attacked by a hydra but are saved by Clarisse, who is sailing on a confederate ironclad called the CSS Birmingham.|$|E
