5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E

The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E

25|$|Verbal Behavior had an uncharacteristically cool reception, {{partly as}} a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms. Skinner's peers may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> adopt the ideas {{presented}} in Verbal Behavior because of the absence of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked Skinner's experimental work.

25|$|Re-localization of {{manufacturing}} infrastructure by multinational corporations (MNCs) to low-cost countries {{has led to}} de-industrialisation. The reduction of human intervention through automation of production and logistics processes has reduced employment opportunities. Differing taxation regimes within the European Union have led to aggressive tax optimization and avoidance by conglomerates and small and medium-sized enterprises. Favourable commercial tax credit agreements and the rampant misuse of special purpose entity (SPE) based in certain EU28 member States (UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxemburg & Belgium) have allowed large corporations to avoid, minimise or indefinitely defer tax dues. Populist movements all over the European Union have campaigned for policies which target loopholes allowing tax avoidance by transnational corporations and scrutinize incentives and subsidies given to factories where automation {{of manufacturing}} processes has improved productivity and enriched share-holders but diminished job prospects for non-specialized workers. Governments <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> move away from neoliberal policies and adopt measures which advance the public good of local communities through public-private initiatives which nurture grass-roots innovation, promote social partnering entrepreneurship and sustain job creation in self-employing SMEs.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict angiographic CAD. The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.|$|E

500|$|In 934 Olaf Guthfrithson succeeded {{his father}} Guthfrith as the Norse King of Dublin. The {{alliance}} between the Norse and the Scots was cemented by the marriage of Olaf to Constantine's daughter. By August 937 Olaf had defeated his rivals {{for control of the}} Viking part of Ireland, and he promptly launched a bid for the former Norse kingdom of York. Individually Olaf and Constantine were too weak to oppose Æthelstan, but together they could hope to challenge the dominance of Wessex. In the autumn they joined with the Strathclyde Britons under Owain to invade England. Medieval campaigning was normally conducted in the summer, and Æthelstan could hardly have expected an invasion on such a large scale so late in the year. He seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> react, and an old Latin poem preserved by William of Malmesbury accused him of having [...] "languished in sluggish leisure". The allies plundered English territory while Æthelstan took his time gathering a West Saxon and Mercian army. However, historian Michael Wood praises his caution, arguing that unlike Harold in 1066, he did not allow himself to be provoked into precipitate action. When he marched north, the Welsh did not join him, and they did not fight on either side.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his last}} trip to Afghanistan U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel {{announced}} on 6 December 2014 {{the end of}} the U.S original plan to withdraw its troops form Afghanistan. Under a plan announced in May 2014 the number of American troops was supposed to fall to 9,800 by 1 January 2015. Instead the U.S. will keep up to 10,800 troops for {{the first few months of}} 2015 and then restart the drawdown, which is scheduled to reach 5,500 troops by the end of 2015. Besides partaking in NATO's Resolute Support Mission consisting of 12,500 soldiers some U.S. troops will take part in a separate counterterrorism mission focused on al-Qaeda. By the time U.S. President Obama leaves office in 2017 only a small force attached to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul is to remain in Afghanistan. The reason for the United States to keep additional forces in the country temporarily was that planned troop commitments by US allies for the Nato train-and-assist mission starting in January 2015 <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> materialize. President Barack Obama [...] "has provided US military commanders the flexibility to manage any temporary force shortfall that we might experience for a few months as we allow for coalition troops to arrive in theater," [...] Hagel said in a news conference with President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul.
