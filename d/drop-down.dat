40|$|Ten years ago, the Georgia Tech Library {{created an}} {{electronic}} Tally Sheet to record transaction statistics. In the last decade, this {{system has been}} used by each of our public service departments and has evolved to make recording transactions easier for library staff to use. The system started as a unified single-page sheet with <b>drop-downs</b> to reflect multiple transactions and transaction details to sidebars individualized to each unit with single-click buttons and <b>drop-downs.</b> Reporting of the transaction statistics has evolved from monthly and annual reports in Excel to a dynamic web-based interface. This data along with attendance data and circulation data has helped determine staffing and hours. Recently, the library has developed an assessment dashboard to share library trends to both internal and external stakeholders. This project has involved data mining of information from a variety of systems including, circulation, ILL, course reserves, the library website, the library catalog, and transaction and attendance logs. Both projects uses a combination of in-house web-design using PHP/MySQL and open-source APIs like Google Chart and PHPlot to create visual representations of library data. This presentation will discuss our design philosophy and how other libraries can implement similar assessment tools...|$|R

5000|$|At their simplest, TextMate “snippets” are {{pieces of}} text {{which can be}} {{inserted}} into the document at the current location via a context-sensitive key stroke or tab completion. Snippets are [...] "intelligent", supporting [...] "tab stops" [...] dynamic updating, access to environment variables, {{and the ability to}} run inline scripts. This allows complicated behaviors. Tab stops can be cycled through using the “tab” key and support default text, <b>drop-downs,</b> to complete elements of the snippet. The results of these tab stops can be dynamically changed in another portion of the snippet, as the user fills in a stop. TextMate environment variables can be used, supporting information about the current scope, line number, or author name, etc. Snippets also have the ability to run inline shell scripts.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{distributed}} and anticipative model for collision detection and propose a lead for distributed collision handling, two {{key components of}} physically-based simulations of virtual environments. This model is designed to improve the scalability of interactive deterministic simulations on distributed systems such as PC clusters. Our main contribution consists of loosening synchronism constraints in the collision detection and response pipeline to allow the simulation to run in a decentralized, distributed fashion. To do so, we setup a spatial subdivision grid, and assign {{a subset of the}} simulation space to each processor, made of contiguous cells from this grid. These processors synchronize only with their direct neighbors in the grid, and only when an object moves from one's area to another. We rely on the rarity of such synchronizations to allow anticipative computing that will also work towards improving scalability. When synchronizations occur, we propose an arrangement of collision checks and rollback algorithms that help reduce the processing cost of synchronized areas' bodies. We show potential for distributed load balancing strategies based on the exchange of grid cells, and explain how anticipative computing may, in cases of short computational peaks, improve user experience by avoiding frame-rate <b>drop-downs...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to other survey modes, web-surveys allow {{for using a}} closed response format for survey questions {{with a large number}} of categories, such as car types, camera types, countries, regions, industries, and occupations. In other survey modes, these questions require an open response format, followed by field- or office-coding. Web-surveys allow the use of <b>drop-downs,</b> for example for an alphabetically sorted list of 200 + countries, or for the use of search trees. A search tree is the most appropriate way for selfidentification of occupation, which is a key variable in socio-economic research. This paper summarizes the design principles underlying a Database of Occupations for the measurement of occupations in multi-country web-surveys by means of selfidentification. The Database was compiled as part of the FP 6 funded EurOccupations project (2006 - 2009, no 028987). The paper introduces the use of the occupation variable in datasets, in particular multi-country datasets, and explores the reasons why the Database has been designed. Using a variety of sources, the Database includes almost 1, 600 occupational titles, which is judged to be sufficiently detailed for valid-self-identification. The Database consists of a source list, a search tree and translations into the languages of almost 50 countries. It is explained how the source list has taken into account issues such as skill levels, corporate hierarchies, job ladders, managerial and supervisory occupations, craft versus manufacturing occupations, composite occupations and the methods used for translations. The requirements posed by web-surveys, such as readability, alphabetical sorting, coping with the category "Other" are discussed. Finally, the paper details how the Database is used in the worldwide WageIndicator web-survey. For more information see www. euroccupations. org or www. wageindicator. org...|$|R

25|$|In 1997, {{yet another}} {{change of design}} that was {{controversial}} with the fans, a kit that featured a white <b>drop—down</b> V with a black and red mesh design {{at the bottom of}} the jersey. This was Mizuno's first design, taking over from Stag. The traditional red V was once more reverted to, after the controversial design, with a more circular design used for the 1999 season. In 2000, a more regular V was seen again. In 2003, a triple—V design was seen, and the first to be used by long—serving kit designers Puma AG. 2004 saw a double curvy red V used, before, in 2005, yet again tradition was reverted to in the design and this design was used until 2009. The away strip used in 2005 was the famous blue strip with a dark blue V. 2009 saw the long red V of 1985's design appear again, before, in 2010, a casual thin red V was seen.|$|E
25|$|In the film, {{the code}} that composes the Matrix itself is {{frequently}} represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and numerals. The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors. Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised {{the creation of}} the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall. The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, Ghost in the Shell, which had a strong influence on the Matrix series (see below). It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game , and its <b>drop-down</b> effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.|$|E
