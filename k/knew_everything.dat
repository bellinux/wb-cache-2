All {{technical}} know-how was at her fingertips: harmonic transposition, the figured bass, score reading, organ registration, instrumental techniques, structural analyses, the school fugue and the free fugue, the Greek modes and Gregorian chant.|$|E

Pieczenik explained the leak to Argentina with the presence in the committee of numerous members of the P2 lodge, which had strong ties with the South American country (its founder Licio Gelli had lived for a period there).|$|E
25|$|In Chicago, McManigal and McNamara {{were not}} {{taken to a}} police station, but to the private home of Chicago Police Sergeant William Reed and held from April 13 until April 20. Burns {{apparently}} convinced McManigal that he <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> and that McManigal could save himself by cutting a deal with authorities. McManigal agreed to tell all he knew {{in order to secure}} a lighter prison sentence, and signed a confession. He said that he had not participated in the Times bombing, but that Jim McNamara had told him all about it, and that it was done by Jim (J. B.) McNamara and two others, Matthew Schmidt and David Caplan (Schmidt and Caplan evaded arrest until 1915). McManigal also said that others involved included union president Ryan, J. J. McNamara, Hockin and other Iron Worker leaders.|$|E

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E

Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship. Shaw later reflected: [...] "You <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> that I didn't know and I <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> you didn't know... We had everything to learn from one another and brains enough to do it".|$|E

500|$|In the song's lyrics, Dylan criticizes {{himself for}} having been certain that he <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> and apologizes for his {{previous}} political preaching, noting that he has become his own enemy [...] "in the instant that I preach." [...] Dylan questions whether one can really distinguish between right and wrong, and even questions the desirability {{of the principle of}} equality. The lyrics also signal Dylan's disillusionment with the 1960s protest movement and his intention to abandon protest songwriting. [...] The song effectively analogizes the protest movement to the establishment it is trying to overturn, concluding with the refrain: ...|$|E
500|$|Tatler listed Cumberbatch in the [...] "Most Eligible Bachelors in the United Kingdom" [...] in 2012. In {{the same}} year, Cumberbatch {{described}} a cyberstalking {{incident in which}} he discovered that someone had been live-tweeting his movements in his London home. Coming to terms with it, he said, it is [...] "an ongoing process. To think that somebody <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> I'd done in a day and told {{the rest of the}} world in real time!" [...] His photograph taken at the Garrick Club by Derry Moore, 12th Earl of Drogheda was the cover of Moore's 2012 book An English Room.|$|E

Because, indeed, {{there was a lot more}} going on." [...] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, [...] "It's our view that John <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|Liviu Librescu {{was born}} in 1930 to a Jewish family {{in the city of}} Ploiești, Romania. After Romania allied with Nazi Germany in World War II, his family was {{deported}} to a labor camp in Transnistria, and later, along with thousands of other Jews, was deported to a ghetto in the Romanian city of Focșani. His wife, Marlena, who is also a [...] Holocaust survivor, told Israeli Channel 10 TV the day after his death, [...] "We were in Romania during the Second World War, and we were Jews there among the Germans, and among the anti-Semitic Romanians." [...] Dorothea Weisbuch, a cousin of Librescu living in Romania, said in an interview to Romanian newspaper [...] Cotidianul: [...] "He was an extraordinarily gifted person and very altruistic. When he was little, he was very curious and <b>knew</b> <b>everything,</b> so that I thought he would become very conceited, but it did not happen so; he was of a rare modesty." ...|$|E
500|$|The writing staff cited The Wizard of Oz as {{a source}} of {{thematic}} influence for Tron: Legacy in writing the script, with Kitsis stating that [...] "They both have very similar DNA, which is Tron really lives on, in a lot of ways, trying to get home. You're put on this world and you want to go home and what is home? That's in a lot of way inspired us." [...] Kitsis also added that they had to include an"emotional spine to take us into the story or else it just becomes a bunch of moves or gags and stuff", eventually deciding on adding a mysterious destiny to Flynn and giving him a legendary aura - [...] "Kevin Flynn to us was Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all wrapped up into one and John Lennon". The writers decided to create the character of Clu as an evil embodiment of [...] "how you look back on your younger self, (...) that guy [...] thought he <b>knew</b> <b>everything,</b> but he really knew nothing". Bridges liked the idea of the dual perspectives, and contributed with the writers for the characterization of Flynn as a sanguine Zen master by suggesting them to get inspiration from various Buddhist texts. Part of the concepts emerged from a reunion the producers had with scientists from California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to discuss concepts such as isomorphic algorithms and the digitizing of organic matter.|$|E

2500|$|Among Cook's most bold assertions was that, {{utilizing}} his strategies, a {{team could}} gain up to 250 runs a season, a number which modern methods indicate {{is an extreme}} overestimate. Years later, sabermetrician Pete Palmer and sports historian John Thorn asserted that their computer simulations using Cook's lineup modifications actually slightly {{reduce the number of}} runs a team scored. Bill James would later write in his 1981 Baseball Abstract that [...] "Cook <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> about statistics and nothing at all about baseball--and for that reasons, all of his answers are wrong, all of his methods useless." [...] Earnshaw Cook also dismissed the effects of player handedness (thus, condemning the use of the platoon system), which even contemporary studies pointed out to be erroneous. Cook did, however, uncover several important pieces of information which are now accepted as common knowledge in modern sabermetrics, such as the inefficiency of the sacrifice bunt. More importantly, the material generated discussion on statistical analysis in baseball and introduced many baseball fans to objective research. [...] In 1971, Waverly Press published Cook's follow-up to Percentage Baseball titled Percentage Baseball and the Computer, in which Cook describes many pieces of strategy his computer simulations suggest.|$|E
2500|$|Andrews {{was born}} in Bangor, Maine. His parents {{divorced}} when he was 12 months old. He was raised by his mother's parents in Pineville, Louisiana. They moved to Monroe, Louisiana, when he was ten years old. After he {{graduated from high school}} in Monroe, he decided to live with his mother in St. Louis. They did not get along very well. He said, [...] "I was young and set in my ways and thought I <b>knew</b> <b>everything</b> like every child does." [...] He worked for his stepfather as a maintenance man at the motel that his stepfather managed. Andrews needed parts to repair a broken vacuum cleaner, so he went to the O.K. Vacuum repair shop co-owned by Rusty Wallace's father and uncle. Gary Wallace, Rusty's uncle, had a conversation with Andrews about vacuum cleaners and other topics. Gary Wallace offered Andrews a job. Andrews helped move the vacuum cleaner repair shop to a larger facility. Andrews worked closely with Rusty Wallace and the two got to know each other well. [...] After work, he helped fix Wallace's USAC stock car, starting in 1979. He moved with Wallace to the ASA in 1983 when the team won the championship. Wallace moved from USAC to NASCAR in 1984, and Andrews moved to Louisiana to run Wallace's Sportsman for his driver Nicki Fraisson. Andrews quit in 1986.|$|E
