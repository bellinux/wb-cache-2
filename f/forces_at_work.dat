5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} the present troubles in Iraq {{are derived from}} the political boundaries Bell conceived, to create its borders. Her reports however indicate that problems were foreseen, {{and that it was}} clearly understood that there were just not many (if any) permanent solutions for calming the divisive <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{in that part of the}} world.|$|E
5000|$|Janet Maslin, {{writing in}} The New York Times, notes that [...] "sexual jealousy {{is the main}} <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> ... but you'd never know it from the film's amiable, even dispassionate mood", and called it [...] "a modest, {{agreeable}} and doubtless very personal film".|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile at Cyberforce HQ, Cyberforce {{are seeing}} violent {{incidents}} rising {{all over the}} country. Unsure of where to assist first, they conclude that all these incidents arising {{at the same time}} can be no coincidence and there must be a larger <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> <b>At</b> that point Velocity runs in and informs them of big mess in downtown New York City, and they decide to go there first.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} another <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and quite as {{powerful}} as rain and rivers, making the soil of alluvial flats. Perhaps it has helped, likewise, to make the soil of all the lowlands in these isles--and that is, the waves of the sea.|$|R
25|$|That October, {{it emerged}} {{in the form of}} a new company called the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, a name which {{accurately}} reflected the physical reality of its route structure. One of the <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the reorganization which engendered the BR was a Rochester coal merchant named Arthur Yates. Not coincidentally, Yates was the line's biggest coal shipper.|$|E
25|$|In their visions, these mystics {{would enter}} into the {{celestial}} realms and journey through the seven stages of mystical ascent: the Seven Heavens and seven throne rooms. Such a journey is fraught with great danger, and the adept must not only have made elaborate purification preparation, but must also know the proper incantations, seals and angelic names needed {{to get past the}} fierce angelic guards, as well as know how to navigate the various <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> inside and outside the palaces.|$|E
25|$|As {{a manifestation}} of the social and {{political}} <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in Afghanistan, the Herat uprising was the subject of academic research, which has offered contradictory explanations for it. Giorgio Vercellin presented the uprising as an anti-Pashtun movement, driven by the resentment of Persian-speaking communities against Pashtun settlers. This version is rejected both by Olivier Roy and by Gilles Dorronsoro, the latter pointing out that certain figures of the uprising such as Gul Muhammad, were ethnic Pashtuns, and that the revolt took hold equally in Pashtun-inhabited areas.|$|E
60|$|The {{first that}} {{either of the}} sailors {{knew that there was}} a new <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> upon the ship was the falling of a mighty hand upon a {{shoulder}} of each. As if they had been {{in the grip of a}} fly-wheel, they were jerked suddenly from their prey.|$|R
50|$|A child {{psychologist}} Caitlin O'Hara investigates {{a series of}} strangely behaving young people all around the world, which causes Caitlin to think that there's an unexplained <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> She does her best to uncover the supernatural links between these seemingly unrelated cases in order to not only save her patient; Maanik, but perhaps the whole world from disaster.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Twain {{wrote in}} August 1863 [...] "..From one spring {{the boiling water}} is ejected a foot or more by the infernal <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> below, and in the {{vicinity}} of all of them one can hear a constant rumbling and surging, somewhat resembling the noises peculiar to a steamboat in motion - hence the name" ...|$|R
25|$|At first I {{was only}} {{thinking}} about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{propose that}} myths from different cultures reveal the same, or similar, psychological <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in those cultures. Some Freudian thinkers have identified stories {{similar to the}} Greek story of Oedipus in many different cultures. They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the Oedipus complex in those cultures. Likewise, Jungians have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many different cultures. They believe that these similarities result from archetypes present in the unconscious levels of every person's mind.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day as Myers' report was made public, NASCAR {{announced}} its own investigation, after having remained silent for six weeks since the crash. The official NASCAR report, which had cost over a million dollars and was published on August 21, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt's death {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, which included the last-second collision with Schrader's car, the speed and angle of impact, and the separation of the seat belt as being contributing factors. It was also noted that investigators could not determine whether a head and neck support (HANS) device would have saved Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in a crash such as Earnhardt's.|$|E
60|$|They {{had reached}} the top of the bank, now, and the man, still holding her in his arms, stood upon a mat of jungle grass beneath a great tree. Slowly he lowered her to her feet. The madness of desire still gripped him; but now there was another <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> combating the evil that had predominated before.|$|R
50|$|Suspicious of a malevolent <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> Harry {{continues}} his explorations of the cavern system, where down a deep shaft, he discovers a young orphan girl named Nell. Over {{the course of}} the next few years Nell is adopted by Simon and Madge but reveals nothing of where she came from, only that she had never been out of the mine.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, two film {{adaptations of}} Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, {{directed}} by Kenneth Branagh (1993) and Joss Whedon (2013), are analysed, each film representing a particular cinematic tradition within {{the history of}} cinema. I argue that the main <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in both adaptations is a complex nostalgia, one intrinsic to {{the very notion of}} 'heritage film' and likewise implicit in Whedon's indebtedness to American screwball comedy...|$|R
25|$|The {{government}} collapsed {{after only}} nine months when the Liberals {{voted for a}} Select Committee inquiry into the Campbell Case, a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing 1924 general election saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the Zinoviev letter, in which Moscow talked about a Communist revolution in Britain. The letter had little impact on the Labour vote—which held up. It was {{the collapse of the}} Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being {{at the expense of the}} Liberals. However many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on foul play (the Zinoviev letter), thereby according to A. J. P. Taylor misunderstanding the political <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and delaying needed reforms in the party.|$|E
25|$|The tectonic <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the Andean folding were {{horizontal}} pressures {{generated from}} the west and due to the rigidity of the underlying material caused the existence of faults, almost all north-south and an alignment of the strings accordingly. The result was that seen at present, a mountain range with steep western slopes and eastern slopes with gentle slope, which allowed the formation of natural lakes and streams of high ecological value. These mountain ranges are represented {{the three types of}} rocks: metamorphic, sedimentary and igneous. The granites geochemically include calc-alkaline granites with alkaline, meta-aluminous to peraluminous more abundant and monzogranites granites. Granodiorites, leucogranites and tonalites are also present. Mafic enclaves, dikes including lamprophyres, pegmatites and aplites. Its chemical composition places it within the field of collisional or intraplate granites (Rapela et al. 1990), and has been interpreted as a product of partial melting of the crust due to changes in the thermal regime during regional uplift (Otamendi et al. 2002).|$|E
500|$|The game {{returns to}} Columbine High School, where {{a press conference}} {{addresses}} the murders. [...] Some of the dialogue appears precisely as it was spoken after the actual event, while other lines caricature the political <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{in the aftermath of}} the murders. The conference references gun control advocacy, religious fundamentalism, and the media's implication of Marilyn Manson and video games as culpable in the shooting.|$|E
5000|$|With other sociologists of his time, Lemert saw how all deviant {{acts are}} social acts, {{a result of}} the {{cooperation}} of society. In studying drug addiction, Lemert observed a very powerful and subtle <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Besides the physical addiction to the drug and all the economic and social disruptions it caused, there was an intensely intellectual process <b>at</b> <b>work</b> concerning one's own identity and the justification for the behavior: [...] "I do these things because I am this way." ...|$|R

2500|$|Bob Smithouser of Plugged in Online {{believed}} that film {{was trying to}} convey the evils and sins of humanity rather than specifically targeting Jews, stating: [...] "The anthropomorphic portrayal of Satan as a player in these events brilliantly pulls the proceedings into the supernatural realm—a fact that should have quelled the much-publicized cries of anti-Semitism since it shows a diabolical <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> beyond any political and religious agendas of the Jews and Romans." ...|$|R
500|$|One {{creative}} {{solution was}} uncovering Peter Parks, {{a specialist in}} macro photography, who had retrieved deep-sea microorganisms and photographed them in 3-D under partial funding from the Bahamas government. Parks brewed chemicals and bacteria together to create reactions that Schrecker and Dawson shot, recording 20,000 feet worth of film over eight weeks. To create the effects, Peter Parks took advantage of fluid dynamics, which affected {{the behavior of the}} substances that he photographed. [...] "When these images are projected on a big screen, you feel like you're looking at infinity. That's because the same <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the water—gravitational effects, settlement, refractive indices—are happening in outer space," [...] Parks said. The specialist's talent convinced the film's creative department to go beyond computer-generated imagery and follow Parks' lead. Instead of millions of dollars for a single special effects sequence, Parks generated all the footage for the film for just $140,000.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 7.8 out of 10, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} [...] "good", but his review was mixed. Comparing it {{with the rest of}} the season, he opined that it suffered from some of the same problems of previous episodes. He thought that the actions of many of the characters in [...] "Hi, Infidelity" [...] were out of character or unrealistic. While writing that [...] "the rape storyline is still not feeling nearly as weighty as it should," [...] he praised the development of the rape mystery for hinting that there were larger <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Price Peterson of TV.com gave a positive review, praising the case-of-the-week's emotional connection to Veronica for [...] " [...] the stakes" [...] and Piz's increased role. He also believed that all the series regulars, excluding Wallace, had an important and interesting role to play. Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A", which is one of its highest ratings given for the season.|$|E
2500|$|Herman Melville's classic {{short story}} [...] "Bartleby, the Scrivener" [...] (first {{published}} in 1853 and republished in revised edition in 1856) is subtitled [...] "A Story of Wall Street" [...] and portrays the alienating <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{within the confines}} of Wall Street.|$|E
60|$|Now {{after this}} {{look at our}} own side of the world, let us turn to the other; for it is this very {{psychological}} fact that mental progression implies an ever-increasing individualization, and that imagination is the <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the process which Far Eastern civilization, taken in connection with our own, reveals. In doing this, it explains incidentally its own seeming anomalies, the most unaccountable of which, apparently, is its existence.|$|R

2500|$|Shasta Kearns Moore of the Portland Tribune {{called the}} {{demonstration}} [...] "a {{reaction to the}} election of Donald Trump, and {{nearly all of the}} <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> to upset politics in the 2016 presidential race were also in play in organizing the Portland march: social media, race, gender, the urban-rural divide, generational concepts of feminism and, most of all, lots of people feeling like they weren't being heard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film upon its premiere was mostly positive. Tim Reyes of Universe Today complimented the titular theme of ambition in the film, stating that it [...] "shows us the <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in and around ESA", and that the it [...] "might accomplish more in 7 minutes than Gravity did in 90." [...] Ryan Wallace of The Science Times also gave praise to the film, writing, [...] "whether you're a sci-fi fanatic, or simply an interested humble astronomer, the short clip will undoubtedly give you a new view of our solar system, and the research out there in space today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frank M. Yamada {{argues that}} the abrupt {{transition}} between Genesis 34:2 and 34:3 was a storytelling technique {{due to the fact}} that the narrative focused on the men, a pattern which he perceives in other rape narratives as well, also arguing that the men's responses are depicted in a mixed light. [...] "The rape of Dinah is narrated in a way that suggests there are social <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> which complicate the initial seal violation and will make problematic the resulting male responses. [...] The abrupt transition from rape to marriage, however, creates a tension in the reader's mind…the unresolved issue of punishment anticipates the response of Simeon and Levi." ...|$|E
5000|$|Even {{with all}} of the other {{sociologist}} back then, Lemert was able to view how most of the social acts are viewed as deviant acts. While studying drug addiction, he admired a powerful <b>force</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Beside the physical changes due to the addiction and all of the economic issues it can cause, there was an immense process of learning one's identity and justifying every action, [...] "I do these things because I am this way." ...|$|R
