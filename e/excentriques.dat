The name originally meant a place that brewed beer, but in 1867 it was a type of café where young women in the national costumes of different countries served different drinks of those countries, including beer, ale, chianti, and vodka. The idea was continued after the Exposition by the Brasserie de l'Espérance on the Rue Champollion on the Left Bank, and was soon imitated by others. By 1890, there were forty-two brasseries on the Left Bank, with names including the Brasserie des Amours, the Brasserie de la Vestale, the Brasserie des Belles Marocaines, and the Brasserie des <b>Excentriques</b> Polonais (brasserie of the eccentric Poles), and they were often used {{as a place to}} meet prostitutes.|$|E

I used to learn things and do scenes and rant {{about the room}} when I was but five years old." [...] She went on, communicative, persuasive, familiar, egotistical (as was necessary), and slightly common, or perhaps only natural; with reminiscences, reasons, and anecdotes, an unexpected profusion, and {{with an air of}} comradeship, of freedom in any relation, which seemed to plead that she was capable at least of embracing that side of the profession she desired to adopt. He noted that if she had seen very little, as she said, she had also seen a great deal; but both her experience and her innocence had been accidental and irregular. She had seen very little acting--the theatre was always too expensive. If she could only go often--in Paris for instance every night for six months--to see the best, the worst, everything, she would make things out, would observe and learn what to do, what not to do: it would be a school of schools. But she couldn't without selling the clothes off her back. It was vile and disgusting to be poor, and if ever she were to know the bliss of having a few francs in her pocket she would make up for it--that she could promise! She had never been acquainted with any one who could tell her anything--if it was good or bad or right or wrong--except Mrs. Delamere and poor Ruggieri. She supposed they had told her a great deal, but perhaps they hadn't, and she was perfectly willing to give it up if it was bad. Evidently Madame Carré thought so; she thought it was horrid. Wasn't it perfectly divine, the way the old woman had said those verses, those speeches of Célie? If she would only let her come and listen to her once in a while like that it was all she would ask. She had got lots of ideas just from that half-hour; she had practised them over, over, and over again, the moment she got home. He might ask her mother--he might ask the people next door. If Madame Carré didn't think she could work, she might have heard, could she have listened at the door, something that would show her. But she didn't think her even good enough to criticise--since that wasn't criticism, telling her her head was good. Of course her head was good--she needn't travel up to the quartiers <b>excentriques</b> to find that out. It was her mother, the way she talked, who gave the idea that she wanted to be elegant and moral and a femme du monde and all that sort of trash. Of course that put people off, when they were only thinking of the real right way. Didn't she know, Miriam herself, that this was the one thing to think of? But any one would be kind to her mother who knew what a dear she was. [...] "She doesn't know when any thing's right or wrong, but she's a perfect saint," [...] said the girl, obscuring considerably her vindication. [...] "She doesn't mind when I say things over by the hour, dinning them into her ears while she sits there and reads. She's a tremendous reader; she's awfully up in literature. She taught me everything herself. I mean all that sort of thing. Of course I'm not so fond of reading; I go in for the book of life." [...] Sherringham wondered if her mother had not at any rate taught her that phrase--he thought it highly probable. [...] "It would give on my nerves, the life I lead her," [...] Miriam continued; [...] "but she's really a delicious woman." ...|$|E

That same year, he represented France at the Venice Biennale and won the Golden Lion Award for best pavilion. Buren had major solo exhibitions at the Touko Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, in 1989, at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 2002, at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2005, at Modern Art Oxford in 2006, and at the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden in 2011. In December 2006 Buren won the competition to make Arcos Rojos/Arku Gorriaka, a new major project for the iconic Puente de La Salve bridge next to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao while, in February 2007, the Musée Fabre in Montpellier re-opened with a new permanent commission. For the 52nd Venice Biennale, Buren created a new site-specific work for the Giardini of the Italian Pavilion, and was curator of Sophie Calle's contribution to the French Pavilion.

5000|$|La belle <b>excentrique</b> (The Eccentric Beauty) is a dance suite {{for small}} {{orchestra}} by Erik Satie. A parody of music hall clichés, it was {{conceived as a}} choreographic stage work and by modern standards {{can be considered a}} ballet. Satie gave it the whimsical subtitle [...] "fantaisie sérieuse" [...] ("A Serious Fantasy"). It was premiered at the Théâtre du Colisée in Paris on June 14, 1921, conducted by Vladimir Golschmann. The composer later arranged it for piano duet.|$|R
50|$|Like much of Satie's music, La belle <b>excentrique</b> {{slipped into}} obscurity until after World War II. His {{earliest}} biographers, Pierre-Daniel Templier (1932) and Rollo H.

Pianists Francis Poulenc and Jacques Février made a commercial recording in 1959 (Musidisc). Since then the piano duet version {{has been more}} frequently performed, though La belle remains one of Satie's lesser-known compositions.|$|R

He also used names derived from the association of the word mervieilleux with French fashion of the late 18th century: Sans-Culotte for caramel. His Incroyable, which uses speculoos cream and white chocolate shavings, translates as unbelievable but is also a term paired with merveilleux in French fashion.|$|R

50|$|La belle <b>excentrique</b> was {{commissioned}} by the avant-garde dancer and choreographer Élisabeth (Élise) Toulemont (1889-1971), who performed under the stage name Caryathis. A student of Léo Staats, she won notoriety during World War I with her outré interpretations of contemporary music. Her style was rooted in character dance and served up {{an eclectic mix of}} classical technique, popular and international dance forms, pantomime, eroticism, and ironic humor. In the early 1920s she threw orgiastic parties at her Paris home, some of which the usually hyper-moral Satie attended with voyeuristic fascination. She later married the novelist Marcel Jouhandeau.|$|R
50|$|The suite was Satie's first {{composition}} for piano duet, a genre {{he would}} subsequently enrich with original works (Aperçus désagréables, En habit de cheval) and arrangements (Parade, La belle <b>excentrique).</b> Keyboard duets were a popular form of home music-making {{in the years}} before World War I, but as Satie made no immediate attempt to publish the Trois morceaux it is possible he chose this form simply because it provided him and Debussy with an opportunity to play together. What Debussy thought of the work is not known, though he retained enough interest to help Satie correct the proofs for its initial publication eight years later.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1924 Satie was at {{the height}} of his postwar cachet. He had {{produced}} little since his orchestral dance suite La belle <b>excentrique</b> (1921), but his role as [...] "precursor" [...] to Debussy and Ravel was acknowledged, as was his advocacy of young French composers (Les Six and the [...] "Arcueil School"). The March 1924 edition of La Revue musicale contained several laudatory articles about him, and that same month he traveled to Belgium to give lectures on his music in Brussels and Antwerp. Beaumont trusted him implicitly and his influence pervaded the Soirées de Paris: most of its leading artists were Saties friends or disciples, including 25-year-old music director Désormière, whose first important engagement this was. Once Mercure was finished Satie would immediately tackle another big commission from Rolf de Maré of the Ballets suédois; this resulted in his final compositions, the ballet Relâche and the score for its accompanying [...] "cinematographic interlude", Entracte.|$|R
5000|$|For {{her first}} major postwar recital Caryathis collaborated with author and artist Jean Cocteau, who {{at that time}} was a {{spokesman}} for Satie and the composers of Les Six, and the program they assembled focused primarily on their music. [...] Satie was paid 500 francs each for his three dance numbers; he threw in the Grande ritournelle for free. The title La belle <b>excentrique</b> was coined by Cocteau. Caryathis began her choreography in October 1920, with Satie protégé Francis Poulenc assisting as a rehearsal pianist. Poulenc wrote to Belgian music critic Paul Collaer that it was [...] "a work of genius." [...] An invitation-only preview was given at the home of actor Pierre Bertin on January 8, 1921. Satie was closely involved in all phases of the project. Couturier Paul Poiret and artists Marie Laurencin, Kees van Dongen, and Jean Hugo were approached to create Belle's costume, but the composer rejected their designs as too charming or too crass. [...] "My music calls for something outrageous," [...] he remarked, [...] "a woman who is more like a zebra than a doe." [...] Cocteau solved the problem by designing a midriff-baring outfit he described as befitting [...] "a mad American woman from the Salvation Army out for revenge." [...] Nicole Groult (Poiret's sister) provided a creepy face mask that hid all but the dancer's eyes.|$|R

5000|$|Satie's cabaret {{songs of}} the early 1900s were {{products}} of an unhappy period in his life, when he was unsure of his musical direction and poverty compelled him to write what he called [...] "rudes saloperies" [...] ("crude shit") to make a living. As Rollo H. Myers pointed out, he succeeded in doing this without sacrificing his creative integrity: [...] "The interesting thing about these early 'Montmartre' compositions is that they show that Satie, even when aping the methods and language of the circus and music-hall, somehow managed to preserve all his innate candor and purity of style - the same purity that can be perceived in such works as the Gymnopédies or the Gnossiennes". They had important repercussions, on his own subsequent development and for other French composers (notably Les Six) who would find inspiration in popular music. Satie's close friend Claude Debussy famously included a cakewalk (with a satirical Wagner quotation) in his piano suite Children's Corner (1908) and Satie himself revisited the ragtime rhythms of [...] "Diva" [...] in his ballets Parade (1917) and La belle <b>excentrique</b> (1920).==Lyrics== Sous le grand chapeau Greenaway,Mettant l'éclat d'un sourire,D'un rire charmant et fraisDe baby étonné qui soupire,Little girl aux yeux veloutés,C'est la Diva de l'Empire.C'est la reine dont s'éprennentLes gentlemenEt tous les dandysDe Piccadilly.Dans un seul [...] "yes" [...] elle met tant de douceurQue tous les snobs en gilet à cœur,L'accueillant de hourras frénétiques,Sur la scène lancent des gerbes de fleurs,Sans remarquer le rire narquoisDe son joli minois.Elle danse presque automatiquementEt soulève, oh très pudiquement,Ses jolis dessous de fanfreluches,De ses jambes montrant le frétillement.C'est à la fois très très innocentEt très très excitant.|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{innovative}} hermeneutic {{reading of the}} middle piece of Stravinsky's Three Pieces for String Quartet (later subtitled 'Excentrique' by the composer when he reorchestrated {{it as part of}} his Four Etudes for Orchestra). Taking as its starting point Robert Hatten's adaptation of linguistic markedness theory to read the expressive gestures of Beethoven's musical syntax, I argue that Stravinsky's 'eccentric' syntax wilfully annihilates almost all conventions of tonal syntax and the string quartet genre itself. Stravinsky's music is thus read as instigating a 'markedness reversal' in which classical tonal 'marked' values are reversed to become 'unmarked'. It thus becomes a syntactic norm in <b>Excentrique</b> (a case study for Stravinsky's Turanian works in general) for an accompanimental gesture to appear without the theme it should be accompanying [an example of synchronic subversion] or for opening moments to employ (closural) cadence gestures [an example of diachronic subversion]. The work is thus read through semiotic theory as an allotrope (something that exists simultaneously in two distinct forms) : both quartet and anti-quartet - a reading suggested by Stravinsky's alignment of another Turanian work, Les Noces, with James Joyce's Ulysses (a work often read as an allotrope of both the essence of novel and anti-novel). This eccentric string quartet, replete with percussive gestures that annihilate all traces of lyrical subjectivity through an overt 'death of the theme' strategy, is thus shown to be a work ripe for semiotic decoding through Hatten's own model of tropological mediation and Bakhtin's literary theory model of dialogised voices. These hermeneutic perspectives (new to the Stravinsky literature) are shown to complement the contextual-historical work of Richard Taruskin which asserts that Stravinsky's Turnanian works must be heard as works written consciously 'against' the traditions of Germanic culture...|$|R
