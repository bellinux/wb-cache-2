40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the influence of}} the PQ-monitor connection on the estimation of voltage dip site and system <b>indices.</b> Voltage <b>dip</b> <b>indices</b> are estimated for a set of events obtained from simulation and measurement of voltage dips. The simulated dips are obtained applying the method of fault positions on a large transmission network and the measured dips come from a one-year survey realized on three buses of a sub-transmission and distribution network. The site and system indices estimated to compare phase-to-phase and phase-to-neutral dips are SARFI- 90, SARFI- 70, SARFI-ITIC, expected voltage dip amplitude (µ[VDA]), and the cumulative distribution frequency of voltage <b>dip</b> amplitude. These <b>indices</b> are estimated at the bus level and then they are aggregated to estimate the system performance. The comparison of phase-to-phase and phase-to-neutral indices indicates that, at high voltage level, phase-to-neutral dips are more frequent and more severe than phase-to-phase ones. However, these differences are damped at low voltage level, where the monitored bus presented similar indices for phase and line voltages. These observations must be taken in consideration to compare voltage dip benchmark because the lack of information about the type of the measured voltages may lead to derive inaccurate conclusions about the site and system performance regarding voltage dips...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} fault {{position}} {{is useful for}} characterising power-system performance {{in the presence of}} voltage dips due to faults. It is based on short-circuit simulations repeated for all the system nodes and for many points along the system lines: fault voltages that are below a preset threshold are the required voltage dips. These dips are stored in so-called dip matrices which contain only the dips in all the system nodes when faults occur at points along the lines. The paper proposes a new compact analytical formulation of dip matrices for balanced and unbalanced faults in terms of bidimensional vector relations and for site- and system-voltage <b>dip</b> <b>indexes.</b> Compact formulations are very useful tools when several sensitivity analyses have to be conducted to estimate variation of site- and system-voltage <b>dip</b> <b>indexes</b> in relation to possible reinforcement and/or compensation devices.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been proposed to be better in detecting hypertension as compared to casual blood pressure (CBP). This study aims to study the usefulness of ABPM in detecting masked hypertension, evaluating the adequacy of blood pressure (BP) control and predicting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) amongst children with CKD. A prospective cross-sectional study of 46 children with stage 3 – 5 CKD was conducted at the Pediatric Nephrology department of a tertiary hospital in South India. All children underwent CBP, ABPM and an echocardiography. Results were categorized as normal BP; confirmed hypertension; masked hypertension and white coat hypertension. Out of 46 children studied, 11 were undergoing dialysis. While 39. 1 % children had stage 3 and 4 CKD each, 21. 7 % had stage 5 CKD. Masked hypertension was detected in 19. 6 % and 21. 7 % had confirmed hypertension. Thirty-four (73. 9 %) children were already receiving antihypertensive medication. In these, CBP was elevated in 23. 5 % and ABP in 47 %. Among children with hypertension as defined by ABPM, LVH was detected in 32. 2 %. We found that higher the number of abnormal ABPM indices (assessed by BP <b>Index,</b> nocturnal <b>dipping</b> and BP Load) higher the likelihood of LVH (P = 0. 046).

40|$|Abstract: This paper focuses the {{analysis}} on the control of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based high-power wind turbines when they operate under presence of voltage dips. The main objective of the control strategy proposed for doubly fed induction generator based wind turbines is to eliminate the necessity of the crowbar protection when low-depth voltage dips occurs. Conventional Direct Torque Control (CDTC) suffers from some drawbacks such as high torque ripple and variable switching frequency, difficulties in torque as well as flux control at very low speed. This paper is aimed to analyze DTC principles. A direct torque control strategy that provides fast dynamic response accompanies the overall control of the wind turbine. The proposed control does not totally eliminate the necessity of the typical crowbar protection for turbines it eliminates the activation of this protection during low depth voltage dips. The modeling of the complete system is done in MATLAB-SIMULINK. Simulation results show the proposed control strategythat mitigates the necessity of the crowbar protection during low depth voltage <b>dips.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms:doubly fed induction machine (DFIM), direct torque control (DTC), crowbar protection etc. I...|$|R

Abstract Two high-resolution sediment cores from eastern Fram Strait {{have been investigated}} for sea subsurface and surface temperature variability during the Holocene (the past ca 12, 000 years). The transfer function developed by Husum and Hald (2012) {{has been applied to}} sediment cores in order to reconstruct fluctuations of sea subsurface temperatures throughout the period. Additional biomarker and foraminiferal proxy data are used to elucidate variability between surface and subsurface water mass conditions, and to conclude on the Holocene climate and oceanographic variability on the West Spitsbergen continental margin. Results consistently reveal warm sea surface to subsurface temperatures of up to 6 °C until ca 5 cal ka BP, with maximum seawater temperatures around 10 cal ka BP, likely related to maximum July insolation occurring at that time. Maximum Atlantic Water (AW) advection occurred at surface and subsurface between 10. 6 and 8. 5 cal ka BP based on both foraminiferal and dinocyst temperature reconstructions. Probably, a less-stratified, ice-free, nutrient-rich surface ocean with strong AW advection prevailed in the eastern Fram Strait between 10 and 9 cal ka BP. Weakened AW contribution is found after ca 5 cal ka BP when subsurface temperatures strongly decrease with minimum values between ca 4 and 3 cal ka BP. Cold late Holocene conditions are furthermore supported by high planktic foraminifer shell fragmentation and high δ 18 O values of the subpolar planktic foraminifer species Turborotalita quinqueloba. While IP 25 -associated indices as well as dinocyst data suggest a sustained cooling due to a decrease in early summer insolation and consequently sea-ice increase since about 7 cal ka BP in surface waters, planktic foraminiferal data including stable isotopes indicate a slight return of stronger subsurface AW influx since ca 3 cal ka BP. The observed decoupling of surface and subsurface waters during the later Holocene is most likely attributed to a strong pycnocline layer separating cold sea-ice fed surface waters from enhanced subsurface AW advection. This may be related to changes in North Atlantic subpolar versus subtropical gyre activity...|$|R

BACKGROUNDExtensive information {{is available on the}} relative diagnostic accuracy of the two tests assessed in a head-to-head fashion, whereas comparative data on their prognostic yield are largely preliminary to date. METHODSDipyridamole (up to 0. 84 mg/kg over 10 min) atropine (up to 1 mg over 4 min) (DIP) and dobutamine (up to 40 μg/kg/min) -atropine (1 mg over 4 min) (DOB) stress tests were performed in 460 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Patients were followed up for 38 ± 21 months. RESULTSThe DIP was negative in 253 and positive in 207 patients. The DOB was negative in 242 and positive in 218 patients. During the follow-up, there were 80 cardiac events. For all cardiac events, the negative and positive predictive value were 83 % and 17 % for DOB, 84 % and 19 % for DIP, respectively (p = NS). Considering only cardiac death, by univariate analysis Wall-Motion Score <b>Index</b> (WMSI) at <b>DIP</b> peak dose (chi-square 13. 80, p < 0. 0002) was the strongest predictor, followed by WMSI DOB (χ 2 = 8. 02, p < 0. 004) and WMSI at rest (χ 2 = 6. 85, p < 0. 008).

40|$|Flexion of {{the index}} finger is a fairly complex process {{requiring}} the coordination of different joints. This study is the first attempt to investigate how the angular velocity profile of the three right <b>index</b> joints (<b>DIP,</b> PIP, and MCP) varies with respect to time {{during the course of}} flexion. Ten right-handed subjects (healthy college students between 21 and 23 years old) were recruited to participate in the experiment. Each of these human subjects was instructed to perform a flexion task with his/her right hand. Five miniaturized (5 -mm diameter) reflective markers were applied to each human subject: three placed at the DIP, PIP, and MCP joints {{of the index}} finger on the side close to thumb, and the rest at the predetermined landmarks on dorsum of thumb. A high-speed camera was used to record the motion of the index finger during a paced flexion, and the instantaneous angular velocity of each joint was determined by relating the marker displacement to the frame frequency (~ 5 ms between two consecutive frames). Opposite to the general belief that the speed is constant throughout a flexion cycle, to our best knowledge, this study, for the first time, has revealed that the speed of multi-joint movement actually varies with time. It has been identified that during one full flexion cycle, the angular velocity of the three joints of interest undergoes five distinguishable phases, referred as phases P 1 (slow), P 2 (fast), P 3 (slow), P 4 (fast), and P 5 (slow), respectively. It has also been observed that duration of each of phases P 1, P 2, P 4, or P 5 accounts for approximately 10 – 15 % of the whole flexion cycle, while P 3 lasts for nearly half a cycle. Furthermore, although the flexions of DIP, PIP, and MCP joints cycle through the same five phases, the starts of their respective phases tend to vary. In P 2 and P 5, flexion of MCP takes place considerably later than those of PIP and DIP, whereas DIP flexes earlier than PIP in P 2. The angular velocity of each joint reaches its peaks in P 2 and P 4; the peak velocity of DIP occurs earlier than that of PIP or MCP in P 2, whereas peak of MCP is reached later than that of PIP. Moreover, the three joints of index finger flex with different angular velocities in each of the five phases: PIP moves significantly faster than MCP in P 2, whereas DIP moves faster than MCP in P 4. The results from our study indicate that the multi-joint motion of index finger is an uneven course, i. e. different joints flex with different angular velocities during the flexion. The temporal features of the velocity due to a single joint or multi-joint motion provide useful information to further clarify the dexterity of finger movement...|$|R

Both countries have a violent history {{of conflict and}} continued socio-economic problems {{for the majority of}} their populations. Cambodia resumed its reconstruction and development after severe and pervasive destruction caused by more than two decades of civil war. Besides, decades of political and social unrest contributed to a low level of human development in these two countries. In 1990 s, Timor-Leste recorded a rising Human Development <b>Index</b> (HDI) then <b>dipped</b> in 1999 due to the phenomenal destruction and dislocation which occurred during the referendum period. Likewise, 35. 9 per cent of the Cambodian population lived under the poverty line in comparison with 42 per cent of people who lived under the poverty line in Timor-Leste. The concept of human development reaches beyond considering income expansion and examines the quality of people’s lives. Thus, the human development framework sees ‘income’ as the “means” of development rather then as the “end” and includes all aspects of life, including political, economic and cultural development. The HDI, which measures average achievement in three key dimensions of human development [...] a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living for Cambodia and Timor-Leste is. 494 and. 502 respectively. This study uses a comprehensive approach to analyse the multidimensional relationship between various indicators that construct the notion of human development. It analyses several indicators (e. g. quality of dwelling, access to water, sanitation, access to medical treatment, uses and source of power, quality of food intake and socio-political participation) {{in the life of the}} research participants in both Cambodia and Timor-Leste. As such, this research carries out a comparative analysis of these foregoing human development indicators in the two countries. The study involves structured interviews with 1000 interviewees in Timor-Leste and 1000 from Cambodia across different socio-economic and geographic locations in these two countries. These participants are active members of grassroots credit union programs supported by the Credit Union Foundation Australia (CUFA). The qualitative data collected is analysed using both univariate and multivariate statistical techniques to test the state of human development of these participants. This analysis also entails a cross-country comparison of the state of human development among the credit union members. The study also reports the extent of socio-political engagement of the research participants in these two post-conflict countries. Additionally, logistic regression analysis and Structural Equation Modelling techniques are used to test both within and between the hypothesised country multi-dimensional relationships. Structural Equation Modelling supports the proposed multidirectional complex relationship between credit union membership and various aspects of human development. In the past there has been little research that looks at cross country comparisons of human development in the context of post conflict circumstances. This in-depth cross-country analysis raises key policy questions (e. g. aid policy, alignment and focus of development programs etc.) that are associated with various development programs in post-conflict countries.
