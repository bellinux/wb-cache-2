Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts the doors, and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E

She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E

500|$|Professor Roy M. Anker {{argues that}} the film's {{thematic}} center is its direction to the audience to [...] "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission {{that this is the}} last <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, [...] "from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story? If he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die." [...] Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside [...] "to view the film and its philosophical issues". Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a [...] "willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in [...] "house beautiful" [...] domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a [...] "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden". The Burnhams are unaware that they are [...] "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" [...] who expect the [...] "rudiments of American beauty" [...] to give them happiness. Anker argues that [...] "they are helpless {{in the face of the}} prettified economic and sexual stereotypes that they and their culture have designated for their salvation." ...|$|E
