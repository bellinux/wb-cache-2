40|$|Plants in {{drylands}} {{are exposed}} to a suite of stress factors. The most obvious stress factor is drought stress induced by a strongly negative balance between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Drylands are increasingly being used for grazing livestock and with increasing human populations this form of land use is intensifying. Overgrazing is argued to be the major cause of desertification worldwide by affecting both plants directly and the surrounding environment. Burial, by wind-blown sand, directly damages leaves and dramatically changes the growth conditions of plants. High level of mechanical stress caused e. g. by animal trampling or drag forces imposed by the generally high wind speedpossibly contributes to reduction in growth and survival by increasing the risk of rupture of aboveground shoots. These stress factors may have strongly interactive effects. Woody plants are {{an important component of}} <b>drylands</b> <b>vegetation</b> and appear to exhibit traits that make them particularly well-adapted to these conditions. Moreover many woody species are used in combating desertification. This thesis focuses on the growth, phenotypic and mechanical characteristics and eco-physiology of woody species in Mu Us Sandland, Inner Mongolia, China, in response to different stress factors mentioned above. Unlike most previous studies on this issue, I place particular emphasis on the interactive effects of different stress factors. Particularly, the objectives of this thesis include: 1) a study of how woody species respond to local stress; 2) investigations on the interactive effects of these stress factors on plants; 3) evaluation of the role of clonal growth in alleviating the effects of these stress factors; 4) a deepening of the understanding of inter- and intra-specific variation in adaptive responses of the plants.

Connectivity {{has emerged as}} a key concept for understanding the hydrological response to vegetation change indrylands, providing an explanatory link between abiotic and biotic, structure and function. Reduced vegetationcover following woody encroachment, generally promotes longer, more connected overland flow pathways, whichhas the potential to result in an accentuated rainfall-runoff response and fluxes of both soil erosion and carbon. Changing hydrological connectivity was investigated as an emergent property of changing ecosystem structureover two contrasting semi-arid grass to woody vegetation transitions in New Mexico, USA. Vegetationstructure was quantified to evaluate if {{it can be used to}} explain observed variations in water, sediment and carbonfluxes. Hydrological connectivity was quantified using a flow length metric (mean flowpath length), combiningtopographic and vegetation cover data. Results at the large plot scale (300 m 2) demonstrated that the two woody-dominated sites had significantlylonger mean flowpath lengths (4. 3 m), than the grass-dominated sites (2. 4 m). Mean flowpath lengths illustrateda significant positive relationship with the functional response. The woody-dominated sites lost more water, soiland carbon than their grassland counterparts. Woody sites eroded more, with mean event-based sediment yieldsof 1203 g, compared to 295 g from grasslands. In addition, the woody sites lost more organic carbon, with meanevent yields of 39 g compared to 5 g from grassland sites (Puttock et al, 2013). Hydrological connectivity will be discussed as a meaningful measure of the interaction between structure andfunction and how this manifests under the extreme rainfall events that occur in drylands. Further work is requiredto assess how flow length varies across spatial scales and evolves across temporal scales. However, it is argued thatflow path length metrics provide a valuable tool by which to classify hydrological connectivity at the catchmentscale and to quantify the relationship between structure, function and resultant fluvial fluxes in <b>dryland</b> landscapesundergoing <b>vegetation</b> change.

Turing patterns are multistable, such that many different patterns with different wavelengths are possible for the same set of parameters, but in a given region typically only one such wavelength is dominant. In the Turing instability region, random initial conditions will mostly lead to a wavelength that is similar to that of the leading eigenvector that arises from the linear stability analysis, but when venturing beyond, little is known about the pattern that will emerge.

With a ~ 1, 000 km precipitation gradient and distinct wet-dry climate, the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) was well suited for evaluating how energy and water availabilities constrain water use by vegetation, but has not been done yet. In this study, we addressed this question using Budyko framework that quantifies the evapotranspiration {{as a function of}} energy-limited rate and precipitation. Path analysis was adopted to evaluate the dependencies of water and carbon fluxes on ecohydrological variables. Results showed that the major drivers of water and carbon fluxes varied between wet and dry savannas: down-welling solar radiation was the primary driver of the wet season ET in mesic savanna ecosystems, while soil water availability was the primary driver in inland <b>dryland</b> ecosystems. <b>Vegetation</b> can significantly regulate water and carbon fluxes of savanna ecosystems, as supported by the strong link of LAI with ET and GPP from path analysis. Vegetation structure (i. e. the tree:grass ratio) at each site can regulate the impact of climatic constraint on ET and GPP. Sites with a low tree:grass ratio had ET and GPP that exceeded sites with high a tree:grass ratio when the grassy understory was active. Identifying the relative importance of these climate drivers and vegetation structure on seasonal patterns of water use by these ecosystems will help us decide our priorities when improving the estimates of ET and GPP. 21 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{scarcity}} of water characterising <b>drylands</b> forces <b>vegetation</b> to adopt appropriate survival strategies. Some of these generate water-vegetation feedback mechanisms {{that can lead to}} spatial self-organisation of vegetation, as it has been shown with models representing plants by a density of biomass, varying continuously in time and space. However, although plants are usually quite plastic they also display discrete qualities and stochastic behaviour. These features may give rise to demographic noise, which in certain cases can influence the qualitative dynamics of ecosystem models. In the present work we explore the effects of demographic noise on the resilience of a model semi-arid ecosystem. We introduce a spatial stochastic eco-hydrological hybrid model in which plants are modelled as discrete entities subject to stochastic dynamical rules, while the dynamics of surface and soil water are described by continuous variables. The model has a deterministic approximation very similar to previous continuous models of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. By means of numerical simulations we show that demographic noise can have important effects on the extinction and recovery dynamics of the system. In particular we find that the stochastic model escapes extinction under a wide range of conditions for which the corresponding deterministic approximation predicts absorption into desert states.

40|$|The wheatbelt of Western Australia shows a {{distinct}} Mediterranean climate {{with most of}} the rainfall occurring in the winter months. The main factor limiting plant production in this region is rainfall. Due to clearing of native <b>vegetation,</b> <b>dryland</b> salinity is a major problem in south-west Australia. Since the mid 1970 s the region has experienced a significant decrease in winter rainfall. Across nine sites, growing season rainfall (May to October) decreased by an average of 11 % and the sum of rainfall in June and July (June + July) decreased by 20 %. We used the ASPIM-Nwheat model in combination with historic climate data to study the impact of recent climate change on the hydrology and production of wheat based farming systems by comparing results for before and after 1975. Despite the large decline in rainfall, simulated yields based on the actual weather data did not fall. At the same time, simulated drainage decreased by up to 95 % which will significantly reduce the spread of dryland salinity. These results were due to the rainfall changes mainly occurring in June and July, a period when rainfall often exceeds crop demand and large amounts of water are usually lost by deep drainage. The findings will have significant implications for estimates of future climate change impacts in this region with changes in rainfall causing non-proportional impacts on production and hydrological aspects, such as deep drainage and waterlogging, where proportionality is often presumed...|$|R

40|$|In dryland ecosystems, {{understanding}} {{the effects of}} heterogeneity in soil moisture and geophysical properties on vegetation structure and dynamics poses a suite of challenging research questions. Heterogeneity in soil depth can affect resource availability and the subsequent organization of woody vegetation, while spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture can reveal important ecohydrological feedbacks that govern the outcome of anthropogenic activities on the organization of <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation.</b> In this research we investigate two cases of soil resource heterogeneity that affect the organization of <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> patterns by expanding previous electromagnetic induction (EMI) imaging techniques. In the first case we examine the influence of soil depth as a control on soil resource availability on hillslopes in tree-grass systems in central Kenya. Our results indicate that woody vegetation clumping occurs where soil depth changes, and the deeper rooted Acacia tortilis occurs on deep soils while the drought tolerant Acacia etbaica occurs on shallow soils. In the second case we examine daily patch–interpatch scale moisture dynamics following two different-sized rain events in a degraded landscape. With {{the aid of a}} numerical subsurface flow model, EMI, and soil moisture data, we have identified a possible positive feedback mechanism (‘soil moisture halo effect’) that we believe {{may have contributed to the}} proliferation and two-phase pattern formation of a native succulent Sansevieria volkensii in degraded ecosystems of Kenya.

40|$|In <b>drylands,</b> the {{underlying}} <b>vegetation</b> structure {{is associated with}} ecosystem functioning and ecosystem resilience. Although scale-dependent patterns are also predicted, empirical evidence often demonstrates that patch sizes are distributed according to a power-law probability distribution function or truncated power-law probability distribution function for a varied range of environmental conditions. Using satellite images and field measures, we assessed the spatial pattern of vegetation patches {{for a wide range}} of vegetation cover values in a large set of Mediterranean dryland (MDL) plots, focusing on the statistical distribution function that better fits the patch sizes. We found that power-law or truncated power-law probability distribution function does not always fit the observed patch size frequencies, while lognormal probability density function always fit well to them, implying that the vegetation structure is scale dependent for a large range of conditions. We show how the sampling approach, fit methods, and system dimensionality can affect the patch size distribution, which can explain some conflicting evidence obtained from the empirical data. Our findings question the robustness of criticality as {{the underlying}} mechanism driving vegetation patterns in MDLs. The better fit to patch size distribution provided by lognormal as compared with power-law indicates that multiplicative effects of multivariate local influences underlie pattern formation, and suggests that the role of plant–plant facilitation can be overestimated for a large range of conditions.

40|$|The ‘rain use efficiency’ (RUE) may {{be defined}} as the ratio of {{above-ground}} net primary productivity (ANPP) to annual precipitation, and it is claimed to be a conservative property of the <b>vegetation</b> cover in <b>drylands,</b> if the <b>vegetation</b> cover is not subject to non-precipitation related land degradation. Consequently, RUE may be regarded as means of normalizing ANPP for the impact of annual precipitation, and as an indicator of non-precipitation related land degradation. Large scale and long term identification and monitoring of land degradation in drylands, such as the Sahel, can only be achieved by use of Earth Observation (EO) data. This paper demonstrates that the use of the standard EO-based proxy for ANPP, summed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies 3 rd generation (GIMMS 3 g)) over the year (ΣNDVI), and the blended EO/rain gauge based data-set for annual precipitation (Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation, CMAP) results in RUE-estimates which are highly correlated with precipitation, rendering RUE useless as a means of normalizing for the impact of annual precipitation on ANPP. By replacing ΣNDVI by a ‘small NDVI integral’, covering only the rainy season and counting only the increase of NDVI relative to some reference level, this problem is solved. Using this approach, RUE is calculated for the period 1982 – 2010. The result is that positive RUE-trends dominate in most of the Sahel, indicating that non-precipitation related land degradation is not a widespread phenomenon. Furthermore, it is argued that two preconditions need to be fulfilled in order to obtain meaningful results from the RUE temporal trend analysis: First, there must be a significant positive linear correlation between annual precipitation and the ANPP proxy applied. Second, there must be a near-zero correlation between RUE and annual precipitation. Thirty-seven percent of the pixels in Sahel satisfy these requirements and the paper points to a range of different reasons why this may be the case...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the impact of regional change in ET on groundwater level changes and the assessment and development of a groundwater sustainability index for climatically diverse regions across Nebraska during 2000 - 2014. Irrigation in the selected regions is predominantly supplied by groundwater. The hypothesis is that groundwater use can become sustainable if the regional evapotranspiration (ET) is managed so that it equals the ET of vegetation that is native to the region. Site locations were Box Butte, Chase, Dundy, Holt LNNRD and York Counties and 3 ecosystems were evaluated: native <b>vegetation,</b> <b>dryland</b> and irrigated cropping systems. Methodology consisted of remote sensing data analysis, GIS modeling, ASCE-Penman Monteith Evapotranspiration equation (Allen et al., 2005) and analysis of historical data. Precipitation, ET, NDVI, Kc and ET weighed to obtain county average ET. Groundwater level declines and groundwater storage data were assessed and compared with ET. Also the same procedures were applied at the township scale for 5 townships in each county. Results showed that precipitation increased from west to east ranging between 406 - 693 mm. y- 1. York County had the overall highest ET values, and Box Butte County had the lowest. Annual native vegetation ET ranged 382 - 644 mm. y- 1 and county annual ET ranged 415 - 720 mm. y- 1 from west to east. The highest groundwater level declines were in Box Butte, Dundy and York Counties (0. 26 m. y- 1) and the lowest in Holt LNNRD (0. 12 m. y- 1). Sustainability index (SI) indicated that Holt LNNRD was the most sustainable in water use (SI= 0. 94) and Chase County the least sustainable (SI= 0. 88). County average ET exceeded native vegetation ET in all cases due to the higher ET of irrigated crops. The positive correlation between ET increases and reduction in water storage showed a significant correlation (0. 62) at p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05 level confidence, n= 10. Higher SI resulted in lower reduction in groundwater storage. The negative correlation between SI and reduction in groundwater storage (- 0. 69) proved to be significant at p-value 3 ̆c 0. 025, n= 10. However, data suggested that reducing county average ET, approaching that of native vegetation, which kept water levels in balance in the past, could be a promising practice. Advisor: Dean E.

As these changes are often accompanied by a shift from C(4) to C(3) vegetation with characteristic δ(13) C values, stable isotope analysis provides a promising mechanism for tracing these fluxes. Input vegetation, surface sediment and fluvially eroded sediment samples were collected across two contrasting C(4) -C(3) <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> transitions in New Mexico, USA. Isotope ratio mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a Carlo Erba NA 2000 analyser interfaced to a SerCon 20 - 22 isotope ratio mass spectrometer to determine bulk δ(13) C values. Stable isotope analyses of contemporary input vegetation and surface sediments over the monitored transitions showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the bulk δ(13) C values of C(4) Bouteloua sp. (grama) grassland, C(3) Larrea tridentata (creosote) shrubland and C(3) Pinus edulis/Juniperus monosperma (piñon-juniper) woodland sites.

40|$|Holocene pollen assemblages from coastal {{lowlands}} and lowland floodplains often suggest changes occurring simultaneously within both wetland and dryland source areas. Evidence for wetter {{and more}} open conditions are frequently accompanied by increases in taxa regarded as anthropogenic indicators. A {{number of different}} scenarios can be proposed. Coastal / floodplain processes alone could be responsible, with changes in the wetland vegetation modifying {{the way in which}} the <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> is sensed in the pollen record. Coincidence is also plausible, as wetland change in such environments can be driven by natural processes which operate over extended periods of time (e. g. relative sea-level change). Simultaneous changes might also result from anthropogenic activity impacting on both areas or from dry land woodland destruction producing a hydrological response (though in a temporally well resolved sequence a delay should be evident). The lack of taxonomic precision in the pollen identification of key taxa (e. g. Poaceae and Cyperaceae), and in particular the ability to separate Cereal pollen from certain wild grasses, is a major limitation when attempting to distinguish between these scenarios. However, coincidence can be seen as an easy explanation and its routine acceptance removes the opportunity for improving our understanding of these processes and their potential interaction. Examples of pollen assemblages which appear to show simultaneous changes in wetland and <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> will be given from a number of areas in the UK (the East Anglian Fenland, Thames estuary, Romney Marsh) along with the results of recent investigations from two sites in the Thames estuary where high temporal resolution, improved taxonomic procedures and multivariate statistics provide new insights into the interpretation of pollen data from coastal and floodplain settings...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} (TLS) provides fast collection of high-definition structural information, {{making it a}} valuable field instrument to many monitoring applications. A weakness of TLS collections, especially in vegetation, is the occurrence of unsampled regions in point clouds where the sensor’s line-of-sight is blocked by intervening material. This problem, referred to as occlusion, may be mitigated by scanning target areas from several positions, increasing the chance that any given area will fall within the scanner’s line-of-sight from at least one position. Because TLS collections are often employed in remote regions where the scope of sampling is limited by logistical factors such as time and battery power, {{it is important to}} design field protocols which maximize efficiency and support increased quantity and quality of the data collected. This study informs researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize TLS sampling methods for <b>vegetation</b> monitoring in <b>dryland</b> ecosystems through three analyses. First, we quantify the 2 D extent of occluded regions based on the range from single scan positions. Second, we measure the efficacy of additional scan positions on the reduction of 2 D occluded regions (area) using progressive configurations of scan positions in 1 ha plots. Third, we test the reproducibility of 3 D sampling yielded by a 5 -scan/ha sampling methodology using redundant sets of scans. Analyses were performed using measurements at analysis scales of 5 to 50 cm across the 1 -ha plots, and we considered plots in grass and shrub-dominated communities separately. In grass-dominated plots, a center-scan configuration and 5 cm pixel size sampled at least 90 % of the area up to 18 m away from the scanner. In shrub-dominated plots, sampling at least 90 % of the area was only achieved within a distance of 12 m. We found that 3 and 5 scans/ha are needed to sample at least ~ 70 % of the total area (1 ha) in the grass and shrub-dominated plots, respectively, using 5 cm pixels to measure sampling presence-absence. The reproducibility of 3 D sampling provided by a 5 position scan layout across 1 -ha plots was 50 % (shrub) and 70 % (grass) using a 5 -cm voxel size, whereas at the 50 -cm voxel scale, reproducibility of sampling was nearly 100 % for all plot types.

This paper demonstrates the use of wetland area derived from analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery as an indicator of groundwater flow from springs in the GAB. The method developed was tested on three spring groups in South Australia, encompassing a diversity of spring forms, spatial extents, geomorphic and hydrogeological settings. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was computed from QuickBird and WorldView- 2 satellite imagery captured to coincide with ground-based vegetation cover and spring discharge measurements. Significant linear relationships were established between image NDVI and ground-based vegetation cover, and from these relationships NDVI thresholds were determined to delineate GAB-fed wetlands from surrounding <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation.</b> There were strong linear relationships between NDVI-derived wetland areas and spring flow rate measurements for selected springs (R 2 = 0. 92 to 0. 99). Although there were some differences in this relationship for the three sites, they were not statistically significant. This research demonstrates a relationship between surface flow rate and wetland area that is transferable to a range of GAB springs, which vary in spatial scale, outflow rates, surface form, geomorphic setting and vegetation composition. The technique provides an objective, quantitative and accurate means of documenting the distribution and extent of spring-fed wetlands: a relatively consistent NDVI threshold can be used to differentiate wetland from <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> and spring flow rates can be determined from image-derived wetland extents.

The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was computedfrom QuickBird and WorldView- 2 satellite imagery captured to coincide with ground-based vegetationcover and spring discharge measurements. Significant linear relationships were established betweenimage NDVI and ground-based vegetation cover, and from these relationships NDVI thresholds weredetermined to delineate GAB-fed wetlands from surrounding <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation.</b> There were strong lin-ear relationships between NDVI-derived wetland areas and spring flow rate measurements for selectedsprings (R 2 = 0. 92 to 0. 99). Although there were some differences in this relationship for the three sites,they were not statistically significant. This research demonstrates a relationship between surface flowrate and wetland area that is transferable to a range of GAB springs, which vary in spatial scale, outflowrates, surface form, geomorphic setting and vegetation composition. The technique provides an objective,quantitative and accurate means of documenting the distribution and extent of spring-fed wetlands: arelatively consistent NDVI threshold can be used to differentiate wetland from <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> andspring flow rates can be determined from image-derived wetland extents. This approach provides naturalresource managers with an indicator of spring wetland response {{that can be used to}} monitor the impactsof land use, groundwater extractions and climate change over time for the GAB and potentially otheraquifers worldwide.

40|$|The <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> model {{proposed}} by Rietkerk and collaborators has been explored from a bifurcation perspective in several previous studies. Our aim {{here is to}} explore in some detail the bifurcation phenomena present when the coefficients of the model are allowed to vary {{in a wide range}} of parameters. In addition to the primary bifurcation parameter, the precipitation, we allow the two infiltration rate parameters to vary as well. We find that these two parameters control the size and stability of nonhomogeneous biomass states in a way that can be predicted. Further, they control when certain homogeneous and inhomogeneous (in space) periodic (in time) orbits exist. Finally, we show that the model possesses infinitely many unphysical steady state branches. We then present a modification of the model which eliminates these unphysical solutions, and briefly explore this new model for a fixed set of parameters...|$|E

The fluctuations in lake water balance deduced from diatom and ostracod inferred lake salinity suggest that the lake began to fill {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene and was saline and shallow. Toward the mid-Holocene the water levels rose and yet the lake remained largely saline. The late Holocene is marked by a return to more shallow but fluctuating, water conditions.

40|$|Global {{population}} growth is expected to impose an increasing pressure on agricultural production in the world's drylands, which cover approximately 41 % of the continental area. The land resources in drylands are severely threatened by soil degradation, with wind erosion being. {{one of the major}} degradation processes. It causes sedimentation at undesired places, crop damage by sand blasting and burial, deterioration of soil structure, a loss of soil fertility, and it affects the water economy in the topsoil. On drylands in developing countries, adequate wind erosion control is currently not achieved due to poor socio-economic conditions, low crop biomass production, crop competition and management constraints. A potential solution is {{to make use of the}} natural <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> of scattered trees and shrubs. But, more research is needed to better understand the effects of scattered vegetation on wind speed and erosion, as well as on particle deposition and accumulation. This ultimately should lead to models that can help develop location-specific wind erosion control strategies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{particular}} {{sequence of}} patterns, "gaps→labyrinth→spots," occurs with decreasing precipitation in previously reported numerical simulations of PDE <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> models. These observations {{have led to}} the suggestion that this sequence of patterns can serve as an early indicator of desertification in some ecosystems. Since parameter values can take on a range of plausible values in the vegetation models, it is important to investigate whether the pattern sequence prediction is robust to variation. For a particular model, we find that a quantity calculated via bifurcation-theoretic analysis appears to serve as a proxy for the pattern sequences that occur in numerical simulations across a range of parameter values. We find in further analysis that the quantity takes on values consistent with the standard sequence in an ecologically relevant limit of the model parameter values. This suggests that the standard sequence is a robust prediction of the model, and we conclude by proposing a methodology for assessing the robustness of the standard sequence in other models and formulations.

40|$|Drylands are characterised by patchy vegetation, {{erodible}} {{surfaces and}} erosive aeolian processes. Empirical and modelling {{studies have shown}} that vegetation elements provide drag on the overlying airflow, thus affecting wind velocity profiles and altering erosive dynamics on desert surfaces. However, these dynamics are significantly complicated by a variety of factors, including turbulence, and vegetation porosity and pliability effects. This has resulted in some uncertainty about the effect of vegetation on sediment transport in drylands. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of the effects of <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> on wind flow and aeolian sediment transport processes. In particular, wind transport models have {{played a key role in}} simplifying aeolian processes in partly vegetated landscapes, but a number of key uncertainties and challenges remain. We identify potential future avenues for research that would help to elucidate the roles of vegetation distribution, geometry and scale in shaping the entrainment, transport and redistribution of wind-blown material at multiple scales. Gaps in our collective knowledge must be addressed through a combination of rigorous field, wind tunnel and modelling experiments...|$|E

Major changes {{appear in the}} record at approximately 6500 calibrated years B. P. {{with the establishment of}} permanent swamp or lake conditions at the core site and a decline in regional arboreal taxa. These changes are difficult to explain in simple climatic terms and are inconsistent with other climatic reconstructions for the region. A coincident increase in disturbance indicators in the microfossil record may reflect human activities, particularly changes to <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> through the use of fire. The technique appears to be insensitive to the development of intensive wet-rice agriculture, which almost certainly occurred during the period represented by the microfossil record. Despite this, the results indicate good potential for further detailed microfossil analyses at Nong Han Kumphawapi.

40|$|Burraga Swamp {{is a small}} {{enclosed}} basin at 985 m altitude in Barrington Tops, in the Eastern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia. It lies in {{the midst}} of a Nothofagus moorei cool temperate rainforest, which is at its southern limits here. The swamp is close to the boundaries between temperate rainforest, subtropical rainforest, sclerophyll forest and sub-alpine formations and may be a sensitive recorder of past changes in the vegetation. The palynology and the sediments have been studied to a depth of 6. 5 metres and were dated with eleven 14 C dates. The base of the sediment is about 40, 000 years old. The results showed the following: From 40, 000 - 30, 000 years BP, Burraga was a lake with a very slow rate of deposition of fine grained sediments and flourishing aquatic/swamp vegetation. The <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> was an open or sparsely treed grassland/herbfield. From 30, 000 - 21, 000 years BP, the <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> remained much the same, but the aquatic vegetation disappeared. From 21, 000 - 17, 000 years BP, sandy sediments were deposited at an accelerated rate in a relatively shallow lake, culminating in a layer of gravelly sand. The vegetation was a treeless grassland between about 21, 000 and 15, 000 years BP. After 17, 000 years BP, the rate of sediment accumulation slowed and after 15, 000 years, some mesic elements appeared. Dicksonia antarctica became prominent between about 13, 000 and 12, 000 years BP and Nothofagus was consistently present after about 11, 500 years BP. Peat deposition started about 6, 500 years BP. By 6, 000 years BP the cool temperate rainforest was fully developed, remaining on the site until the present. These changes suggest that the climate at 40, 000 years BP was drier than the present, becoming drier and reaching maximum aridity about 17, 000 years BP, when temperatures were also at their lowest. Subsequently, the temperature increased and around 15, 000 years BP the climate became wetter. Maximum moistures and temperatures were reached between about 9, 000 and 5, 000 years BP. The climate then varied until it reached the present. Burraga extends the record of treeless vegetation over most of southeastern Australia, during the last glacial maximum, to more northerly localities than previously known...|$|E
40|$|Drylands are pattern-forming systems showing self-organized {{vegetation}} patchiness, {{multiplicity of}} stable states and fronts separating domains of alternative stable states. Pattern dynamics, induced by droughts or disturbances, {{can result in}} desertification shifts from patterned vegetation to bare soil. Pattern-formation theory suggests various scenarios for such dynamics; an abrupt global shift involving a fast collapse to bare soil, a gradual global shift involving the expansion and coalescence of bare-soil domains, and an incipient shift to a hybrid state consisting of stationary bare-soil domains in an otherwise periodic pattern. Using models of <b>dryland</b> <b>vegetation</b> we address the question which of these scenarios can be realized. We found that the models can be split into two groups: models that exhibit multiplicity of periodic-pattern and bare-soil states, and models that exhibit, in addition, multiplicity of hybrid states. Furthermore, in all models we could not identify parameter regimes in which bare-soil domains expand into vegetated domains. The significance of these findings is that while models belonging to the first group can only exhibit abrupt shifts, model belonging to the second group can also exhibit gradual and incipient shifts.
