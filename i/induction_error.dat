We use a simple technique to discover induction errors, which occur when good translations are absent from model search spaces. Our results show that a common pruning heuristic drastically increases <b>induction</b> <b>error,</b> and also strongly suggest that the search spaces of phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based models are highly overlapping despite the well known structural differences. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>induction</b> <b>error</b> {{in random}} tree ensembling results {{mainly from the}} {{strength}} of decision trees and the dependency between base classifiers. In {{order to reduce the}} errors due to both factors, a Semi-Random Decision Tree Ensembling (SRDTE) for mining streaming data is proposed based on our previous work on SRMTDS. The model contains semi-random decision trees that are independent in the generation process and have no interaction with each other in the individual decisions of classification. The main idea is to minimize correlation among the classifiers. We claim that the strength of decision trees is closely related to the estimation values of the parameters, including the height of a tree, the count of trees and the parameter of n min in the Hoeffding Bounds. We analyze these parameters of the model and design strategies for better adaptation to streaming data. The main strategies include an incremental generation of sub-trees after seeing real training instances, a data structure for quick search and a voting mechanism for classification. Our evaluation in the 0 - 1 loss function shows that SRDTE has improved the performance in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness. We have applied SRDTE to e-business data streams and proved its feasibility and effectiveness...|$|E

In {{considering}} {{the sources of}} unfounded inference, it is unnecessary to reckon the errors which arise, not from a wrong method, nor even from ignorance of the right one, but from a casual lapse, through hurry or inattention, {{in the application of}} the true principles of <b>induction.</b> Such <b>errors,</b> like the accidental mistakes in casting up a sum, do not call for philosophical analysis or classification; theoretical considerations can throw no light upon the means of avoiding them. In the present treatise our attention is required, not to mere inexpertness in performing the operation in the right way (the only remedies for which are increased attention and more sedulous practice), but to the modes of performing it in a way fundamentally wrong; the conditions under which the human mind persuades itself that it has sufficient grounds for a conclusion which it has not arrived at by any of the legitimate methods of induction—which it has not, even carelessly or overhastily, endeavored to test by those legitimate methods.|$|R

In SOS-induced cells, error frequency increased to 11 % and the resulting mutations included targeted substitutions and near-targeted single base additions, as well as the T deletions. Replication efficiency was 29 % in these conditions. SOS induction therefore leads not only to an enhanced capacity to replicate damaged DNA but also to a marked change in mutation frequency and spectrum...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the spatial and temporal changes in the expression of AQP 4 and Kir 4. 1 channels in an avascular retina during the first week of the optical <b>induction</b> of refractive <b>errors.</b> Methods: Three-day-old hatchling chicks were randomly assigned to three groups and either did not wear lenses or were monocularly goggled with +/- 10 D lenses for varying times up to 7 days before biometric assessment. Retinal tissue was prepared either for western blot analysis to show the presence of the AQP 4 and Kir 4. 1 protein in the chick retina or for immunolocalization using AQP 4 and Kir 4. 1 antibodies to determine the regional distribution and intensity of labeling during the <b>induction</b> of refractive <b>errors.</b> Results: As expected, ultrasonography demonstrated that all eyes showed rapid elongation post hatching. Negative lens-wearing eyes elongated faster than fellow eyes or normal non goggled eyes and became progressively more myopic with time post lensing. Positive lens-wearing eyes showed reduced ocular growth compared to normal controls and developed a hyperopic refraction. Quantitative immunohistochemistry revealed the upregulation of AQP 4 channel expression on Muller cells in the retinal nerve fiber layer during the first 2 days of negative lens wear. Kir 4. 1 channel upregulation in the inner plexiform layer was only found on day 4 of positive lens wear during the development of refractive hyperopia. Conclusions: These results indicate that the expression of AQP 4 and Kir 4. 1 channels on Muller cells is associated with the changes in ocular volume seen during the <b>induction</b> of refractive <b>errors.</b> However, the sites of greatest expression and the temporal pattern of the upregulation of AQP 4 and Kir 4. 1 were dissimilar, indicating a dissociation of AQP 4 and Kir 4. 1 function during refractive error development. Increased AQP 4 expression in the nerve fiber layer is suggested to contribute to the rapid axial elongation and movement of fluid into the vitreous cavity in the presence of minus lenses; whereas, upregulation of Kir 4. 1 channels appears to play a role in limiting axial elongation in the presence of plus lenses...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to control a wheeled mobile robot without velocity measurement. The controller developed is based on kinematic model as well as dynamics model to take into account parameters of dynamics. These parameters related to dynamic equations are identified using a proposed methodology. Input–output feedback linearization is considered with a slight modification in the mathematical expressions to implement the dynamic controller and analyze the nonlinear internal behavior. The developed controllers require sensors to obtain the states needed for the closed-loop system. However, some states may not be available due to the absence of the sensors because of the cost, the weight limitation, reliability, <b>induction</b> of <b>errors,</b> failure, and so on. Particularly, for the velocity measurements, the required accuracy may not be achieved in practical applications due to the existence of significant errors induced by stochastic or cyclical noise. In this article, Elman neural network is proposed to work as an observer to estimate the velocity needed to complete the full state required for the closed-loop control and account for all the disturbances and model parameter uncertainties. Different simulations are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in tracking different reference trajectories in comparison with other paradigms...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} a mindfulness meditation induction to affect the brain’s error monitoring process, as indexed by the error related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and error related alpha suppression (ERAS). Participants (n= 37) engaged in a mindfulness of breathing audio exercise or attended to a control listening exercise, depending on condition, to examine the influence of the mindfulness <b>induction</b> on <b>error</b> related neural phenomena and performance on the Stroop test. Self-report measures of mindfulness, anxiety, and worry were also collected, including the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a brief survey assessing prior mindfulness experience. Analysis of participants’ self-report, EEG, and performance data indicated no influence of the mindfulness induction on the ERN, Pe, or task performance. Instead, these two ERP components were related to individual self-report measures. However, ERAS did respond to the mindfulness induction, as participants in the mindfulness condition showed enhanced alpha power following control trials relative to controls. Together, these data suggest that neural responses to errors are predicted in complex ways by individual differences in mindfulness and anxiety. Findings are discussed as they relate to the adaptive role of mindfulness practices...|$|R

40|$|There are {{virtually}} no antiviral drugs {{available for the}} treatment of infections with RNA viruses. This is particularly worrisome since most of the highly pathogenic and emerging viruses are, and will likely continue to be, RNA viruses. These viruses can cause acute, severe illness, including severe respiratory disease, hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, with a high case fatality rate. It is important to have potent and safe drugs at hand {{that can be used for}} the treatment or prophylaxis of such infections. Drugs approved {{for the treatment of}} RNA virus infections (other than HIV) are the influenza M 2 channel inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine; the influenza neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, and ribavirin for the treatment of infections with respiratory syncytial virus and hepatitis C virus. The molecular mechanism(s) by which ribavirin inhibits viral replication, such as depletion of intracellular GTP pools and <b>induction</b> of <b>error</b> catastrophe, may not readily allow the design of analogues that are more potent/selective than the parent drug. Highly pathogenic RNA viruses belong to a variety of virus families, each having a particular replication strategy, thus offering a wealth of potential targets to selectively inhibit viral replication.

40|$|The precise {{mechanism}} by which the broad-spectrum anti-RNA virus agent ribavirin elicits its in vitro antiviral effect has remained a matter of debate. We have demonstrated that inhibition of cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity, and thus depletion of intracellular GTP pools, is the predominant {{mechanism by}} which ribavirin inhibits the replication of four flavi- and two paramyxoviruses (J Virol 79 : 1943 - 1947, 2005). As a consequence, <b>induction</b> of <b>error</b> catastrophe, which has been proposed as a {{mechanism by which}} ribavirin may elicit its anti-RNA virus activity, {{may be expected to}} have little, if any, impact on its antiviral effect. The flavivirus yellow fever virus (17 D vaccine strain) was cultured for five consecutive passages in the presence of 1 -beta-D-ribofuranosyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 3 -carboxamide (ribavirin), 5 -ethynyl- 1 -beta-D-ribo-furanosylimidazole- 4 -carboxamide (EICAR) (the 5 -ethynyl analog of ribavirin), or mycophenolic acid (MPA; a compound that exclusively inhibits IMPDH). The reduction in infectious virus yield brought about by ribavirin (as well as MPA and EICAR) was paralleled by a similar reduction in viral RNA yield; in case of error-prone replication, the infectious virus yield is expected to decrease significantly faster than the viral RNA yield. In addition, pre-extinction populations of the virus that has suffered a maximum impact of treatment with ribavirin did not accumulate an increased number of mutations. Very similar observations were obtained with EICAR and with MPA, a molecule that cannot be incorporated into viral RNA. These data thus allow us to conclude that the in vitro anti-yellow fever virus activity of ribavirin is independent of error-prone replication. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{examine the}} effects of {{refractive}} error on avian lens morphology and optical quality. METHODS. Hatchling white leghorn chicks were unilaterally goggled for 7 days with either a form-deprivation goggle (n � 12), a � 10 D defocus goggle (n � 12), or a � 10 D defocus goggle (n � 12) to induce myopia and hyperopia. Optical quality of lenses (focal length and focal length variability) from treated and contralateral control eyes was assessed using a scanning laser apparatus. Lens morphology was examined by light and electron microscopy. RESULTS. Although the <b>induction</b> of refractive <b>errors</b> did not significantly alter lens size, shape, paraxial focal length, or average focal length, average focal length variability increased. Lenses from eyes goggled with form-deprivation and � 10 D defocus goggles demonstrated a twofold increase in average focal length variability, when compared with their contralateral controls. The morphology of the lens is not altered by these experimental manipulations. CONCLUSIONS. This study provides evidence that the refractive development of the chick lens is not independent of the refractive development of the ocular globe and that chick lenticular development is influenced by both genetics and visual experience.

40|$|Purpose: The {{relevance}} of retinal integrity and energy pathways to ocular growth and <b>induction</b> of refractive <b>errors</b> has seldom been investigated. Thus, we used ouabain {{to target the}} channels that are essential {{for the maintenance of}} membrane potentials in cells, sodium potassium ATPase (Na/K-ATPase), to examine refractive compensation and ocular growth in response to lens-induced defocus in the chick. Methods:  A single intravitreal injection of 1 mM ouabain in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) carrier or DMSO alone was followed by monocular defocus with positive or negative 10 D lens (or no lens) from post-hatching days 5 - 9 under 12 / 12 hr light/dark conditions. Biometry and dark-adapted flash and electroretinography (ERG) were conducted on day 9, followed by immunohistological analyses. Results: Ouabain inhibited differential ocular growth and refractive compensation to signed defocus compared to DMSO. By 4 -days post-ouabain injection all components of the typical ERG responses to light had been eliminated, and widespread histological damage was apparent, though some ‘default state’ ocular growth was measurable. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated reduction in the specialized water channel Aquaporin 4 (AQP 4) expression and increased evidence of caspase 3 expression (a cell death associated protein) in ouabain-treated eyes compared with DMSO alone. Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that blockade of photoreceptor and inner retinal responses to light onset and offset by ouabain inhibits differential refractive compensation to optical blur, but does not prevent ocular growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose: Why is myopia {{a common}} {{risk factor for}} most sight {{threatening}} disorders? Our earlier biometric, ultrastructural and elemental analyses of the chick form deprivation model have provided evidence of severe physiological, oxidative and hyperosmotic stress. More recently prolonged hyperosmotic stress {{has been shown to}} lead to chronic inflammation in a number of diseases (Brocker etal 2013). We hypothesized that perturbation of axial growth during <b>induction</b> of refractive <b>errors</b> would also be accompanied by hyperosmosis and osmoadaptative gene changes, that should be demonstratable with elemental microanalysis (EDX) and RNA seq respectively. Methods: Chicks were raised with &# 0177; 10 D lenses, or no lens. Following biometric measurements at 1, 2, and 3 days, 8 chicks per lens group were euthanized. RNA was extracted from the retina/RPE/choroid of 4. Four were used for scanning electron-microscopy and EDX. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 1500. Counts per million were imported into GSEA and expression of KEGG and Reactome pathways during myopia/hyperopia induction compared to age-matched no lens chicks (FDR cut-off &lt;. 25). Results: Refractive compensation (RC) to - 10 D defocus continued for 72 hrs whereas RC to + 10 D was in near completion after 24 hours. EDX shows sodium and chloride ion distributions were greatly upregulated in outer retina by - 10 D over the 72 hrs but only at the retino-vitreal border in + 10 D at 72 hrs. Potassium profiles in RC to + 10 D remained upregulated across the retina for 72 hrs with concurrent up-regulation of reactome potassium channel pathways at 72 hrs in RNAseq data. Consistent with altered osmotic and oxidative stress, implicated pathways during refractive compensation included those related to synthesis of small molecule osmolytes, structural remodelling, inflammation, and metabolism. Conclusions: The EDX results demonstrate that RC to optical defocus is accompanied by hyperosmotic shifts in ion distribution profiles across the entire posterior eye, while concurrent changes in gene expression profiles were seen in metabolic and ion solute processes. These pathways have previously been associated with osmoadaptation and more severe disease states such as ARM and diabetes. The findings suggest the need for further experimental considerations of hyperosmotic changes as risk factors for severe visual impairments and for development of therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Resistance to anti-estrogens (i. e. {{tamoxifen}} and fulvestrant) {{is a major}} clinical {{challenge in}} the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancers. To improve treatment and survival of breast cancer patients, the search for new potential targets and biomarkers is crucial. To identify and explore the molecular mechanisms driving anti-estrogen resistant cell growth, we have utilized a large kinase inhibitor library comprising 195 kinase inhibitors on a unique panel of two fulvestrant and two tamoxifen resistant T 47 D breast cancer cell lines, as well as their parental ER positive anti-estrogen responsive T 47 D cell lines. In total, 15 kinase inhibitors were identified to preferentially inhibit growth of fulvestrant resistant T 47 D cell lines compared to growth of parental T 47 D cell. Moreover, three kinase inhibitors were found to preferentially inhibit growth of tamoxifen resistant T 47 D cell lines, compared to growth of their parental cell line. None of the identified inhibitors targeted the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family or their downstream signaling molecules, which previously {{have been shown to be}} important for growth of MCF- 7 derived anti-estrogen resistant breast cancer cell lines. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the T 47 D based model systems could thereby elucidate novel mechanisms for anti-estrogen resistant cell growth. In the screens, treatment with the highly selective Aurora B inhibitor barasertib was found to preferentially inhibit growth of fulvestrant resistant cell lines compared to growth of their parental T 47 D cell line. Subsequently, it was also found that the expression of the activated form of Aurora B is higher in the fulvestrant resistant cells compared to parental T 47 D cells and that treatment with barasertib selectively inhibits phosphorylation of the Aurora B kinase. Additional investigations revealed that the growth inhibitory effect of barasertib was accomplished through <b>induction</b> of mitotic <b>errors</b> and subsequent cell death. These experiments indicate that functional Aurora B kinase may be a driving factor for continuous growth of fulvestrant resistant T 47 D cell lines, and suggests Aurora B inhibition, e. g. with the highly selective kinase inhibitor barasertib, as a candidate treatment for breast cancer patients with tumors expressing the phosphorylated form of the Aurora B kinase. In the screens, treatment with the Src Family Kinase (SFK) inhibitor dasatinib was found to preferentially inhibit growth of both fulvestrant and tamoxifen resistant cell lines, compared to growth of their parental cells. Additional experiments showed that treatment with other inhibitors targeting this family selectively inhibited growth of resistant cells, and that the protein expression of phosphorylated c-Src, which is a SFK, was increased in both fulvestrant and tamoxifen resistant T 47 D cell lines. This suggests that c-Src could be an important kinase for growth of anti-estrogen resistant cells and a treatment target in breast cancer patients expressing the active c-Src kinase. In conclusion, Aurora B was identified as a novel kinase important for growth of fulvestrant resistant T 47 D cell lines, while c-Src was suggested as a kinase involved in both fulvestrant and tamoxifen resistant T 47 D cell growth...|$|R
