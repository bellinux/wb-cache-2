25|$|Oregon is {{also one}} of four major world <b>hazelnut</b> <b>growing</b> regions, and {{produces}} 95% of the domestic hazelnuts in the United States. While the history of the wine production in Oregon can be traced to before Prohibition, it became a significant industry beginning in the 1970s. In 2005, Oregon ranked third among U.S. states with 303 wineries. Due to regional similarities in climate and soil, the grapes planted in Oregon are often the same varieties found in the French regions of Alsace and Burgundy. In 2014, 71 wineries opened in the state. The total is currently 676, which represents growth of 12% over 2013.|$|E
50|$|Like {{everywhere}} {{else on the}} Black Sea coast it rains (and often snows in winter) and is very humid throughout the year, {{with a lack of}} extreme temperatures both in summer and winter. As a result, Giresun and the surrounding countryside is covered by luxuriant flora.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Apple mosaic virus (ApMV) is {{the most}} {{important}} viral pathogen of hazelnut. The Black Sea region is the main hazelnut producing area in Turkey. <b>Hazelnut</b> <b>growing</b> areas from Giresun which are located in the Black Sea region were surveyed for occurrence and distribution of ApMV in 2011 - 2012. Hazelnut leaf samples were collected randomly from non-symptomatic and symptomatic plants displaying yellow rings and lines, yellow flecking, oak leaf pattern and broad vein banding. Leaves from 229 samples collected in 35 fields were tested for the presence of ApMV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a commercial antiserum. Based on the ELISA results, 18 out of 229 samples (7. 86 %) were infected with ApMV...|$|E
40|$|The {{filbertworm}} infests all <b>hazelnut</b> <b>growing</b> {{areas of}} Oregon. • During most years, the filbertworm damages 20 % of the hazelnuts in untreated orchards. • Hazelnut shipments are rejected by nut processors {{if more than}} 1 % filbertworm infestation is present. • Insecticide sprays reduce filbertworm damage to 0. 13 %. Technical Summary The cultivated hazelnut was introduced from Europe {{to the west coast}} of the U. S. during the late 1800 s. Commercial production of hazelnuts (then called “filberts”) began in the 1920 s. Oregon’s hazelnut orchards, concentrated in the Willamette Valley account for 99 % of U. S. hazelnut production and 5 % of world production. Oregon’s harvest of hazelnuts ranks third in the world after Turkey and Italy. Oregon growers produce 86 million pounds of hazelnuts with a value of $ 46 million from 28, 000 acres. Shelled nuts account for 53 % of the market while nuts in the shell comprise the remaining 47 %. Hazelnuts emerge from a husk and drop to the ground where they are collected. Orego...|$|E

40|$|In Turkey, {{hazelnut}} grows {{mostly in}} the Eastern Black Sea Region of the country, and has also a vital impact on regional economical development. Most important task is to determine what areas exactly hazelnut grows {{and how it can}} be grown-up productively in the region. The principle aim of this study is, firstly, to create a methodology for determining existing and potential hazelnut plantation areas, using GIS/Remote Sensing techniques in order to help hazelnut policies developers and economists. This study was done in the province of Trabzon {{which is one of the}} most hazelnut produced area of Turkey. In this study, Landsat ETM+ image was used to generate a current land cover classification. Using the supervised classification method, overall accuracy was determined as 84. 7 %. As for <b>hazelnut</b> <b>growing</b> areas, an 87. 9 % overall accuracy percentage was reached. It was determined that there is an area of 71. 401 hectares hazelnut plantation area in the Trabzon province. Because hazelnut production exceeds the consumption in Turkey, some new regulations have been released to find new land use policies since 1983. By putting into practice these regulations that restrict hazelnut plantation areas, a more efficient and productive hazelnut harvest policy should be reached. As a result, potential hazelnut areas were determined and examined with respect to raster-based spatial analysis functions of GIS. 1...|$|E
40|$|The European {{hazelnut}} (Corylus avellana L.), is {{an important}} temperate zone nut tree species {{for which there is}} an expanding demand worldwide. Historically, the Eastern filbert blight disease (EFB), caused by the ascomycete fungus Anisogramma anomala, has prevented commercial <b>hazelnut</b> <b>growing</b> in Tennessee. As part of a UTC hazelnut cultivar trial, EFB resistant hazelnut cultivars and numbered selections from Oregon State University and Burnt Ridge Nursery were planted in 2003 at Smith Farm in Ooltewah, TN. Hazelnut trees are wind-pollinated, dichogamous, and self-incompatible, which means they are not self-fertile, their male and female blossoms may open at different times, and they must be cross pollinated. The low seed set observed in the UTC trial may result from the local weather patterns and/or from a lack of adequate pollinizers. I hypothesized that the pollen release and the pistil emergence (female flower receptivity) are not occurring {{at the same time and}} therefore sufficient pollination is not occurring amongst the cultivars in the trial. I also hypothesized that the pollinizers may not have the correct S-alleles (genetic loci that regulate compatibility) for successful cross pollination. I collected phenological data from thirteen cultivars in the orchard every week during the normal pollination months of January, February, and March 2016. Furthermore, I constructed a table of S-alleles for all varieties in the orchard and compiled records for the weather for the orchard for the months of my study. The results of my one season of observation do not support the hypotheses but do provide important baselines for further investigation...|$|E

Sixteen traits (oil, protein and ash contents as chemical; nut weight, nut size, shell thickness, kernel weight, kernel size, percent kernel, internal cavity, shriveled kernels, good kernels as physical; pH, organic matter, phosphorus and potassium in soil) were examined at each elevation. Interrelationships among important soil, nut and kernel characteristics were examined. There were significant correlation and interrelationships among the traits. The correlation between oil-nut size, oil- protein positively; protein-kernel size, protein- shriveled kernel negatively; organic matter- shell thickness, organic matter-good kernel negatively; pH- shell thickness, pH-good kernel negatively; good kernel-shell thickness positively; shriveled kernel-kernel weight, shriveled kernel-percent kernel negatively; internal cavity-nut weight positively and internal cavity-nut size negatively; percent kernel-kernel weight, percent kernel-kernel size positively; kernel size-kernel weight positively, and kernel weight-nut weight positively were significant. Significant differences among elevations were observed for shell thickness, ash content in kernel, and pH value in soil.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Medical studies {{indicate}} that acrylamide causes cancer in animals and certain doses of acrylamide are toxic to the nervous system of both animals and humans. Acrylamide is produced in carbohydrate foods prepared at high temperatures such as fried potatoes. For this reason, it is crucial for human health to quantitatively measure the amount of acrylamide formed {{as a result of}} prolonged cooking at high temperatures. In this thesis, a correlation is demonstrated between measured acrylamide concentrations and NABY (Normalized Area of Brownish Yellow regions) values estimated from surface color properties of fried potato images using a modified form of the k-means algorithm. Same method is used to estimate acrylamide levels of roasted coffee beans. The proposed method seems to be a promising approach for the estimation of acrylamide levels and can find applications in industrial systems. The quality and price of hazelnuts are mainly determined by the ratio of shell weight to kernel weight. Due to a number of physiological and physical disorders, <b>hazelnuts</b> may <b>grow</b> without fully developed kernels. We previously proposed a prototype system which detects empty hazelnuts by dropping them onto a steel plate and processing the acoustic signal generated when kernels hit the plate. In that study, feature vectors describing time and frequency nature of the impact sound were extracted from the acoustic signal and classified using Support Vector Machines. In the second part of this thesis, a feature domain post-processing method based on vector median/mean filtering is shown to further increase these classification results. Dülek, BerkanM. S...|$|R
