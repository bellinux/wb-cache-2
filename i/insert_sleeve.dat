5000|$|DNA is {{the seventh}} studio album by the American rock band Trapt, {{released}} on August 19, 2016. The album's recording was partly {{funded by a}} 2014 campaign on Indiegogo. The band was originally set to release the album in 2015. Best Buy offered a Limited Edition, which included the 2 bonus track [...] "Panic Room" [...] and [...] "Chasing Highs", {{as well as the}} front cover of the <b>insert</b> <b>sleeve</b> being autographed by the band.DNA became Trapt's first album to miss the Top 100 on the Billboard chart, peaking at #148, selling only 4,500 copies in its first week.|$|E
50|$|The {{image on}} the front of 1988's Godflesh is a still from the cult 1966 John Frankenheimer film Seconds. The {{image on the}} cover of Streetcleaner is a still from the movie Altered States, a 1980 horror film by {{director}} Ken Russell in which the film's protagonist, played by William Hurt, explores other states of consciousness with the aid of hallucinogens and an isolation chamber. Photos from the <b>insert</b> <b>sleeve</b> for the album are taken from David Lynch's Eraserhead (another major influence cited by Broadrick). The cover of Merciless is a still from the 1943 experimental film Meshes of the Afternoon.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, guided implant surgery {{has been}} {{introduced}} and several studies verified its accuracy. While those studies reported on {{the accuracy of the}} entire procedure, this experiment wanted to evaluate the degree of deviation that can occur during the drilling procedure alone, due to the tolerance of the drill in the <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Drilling was executed in a plexi-glass box with a maximal inclination of the drills within the <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert.</b> Different <b>sleeve</b> <b>inserts,</b> <b>sleeve</b> positions, <b>sleeve</b> heights, <b>sleeve</b> <b>insert</b> heights and diameters were evaluated. RESULTS: The two tested <b>sleeve</b> <b>inserts</b> gave a maximum deviation in angulation of 5. 2 ° and a maximum horizontal deviation of 1. 3  mm at the implant shoulder and 2. 4  mm at the apex for a 13  mm implant. These deviations decreased if the distance of the sleeve above the plexi-glass box became smaller and hand hold <b>sleeve</b> <b>inserts</b> gave less deviation than drill hold <b>sleeve</b> <b>inserts.</b> The deviation increased by longer implant length, larger drill key diameter, shorter sleeves and/or drill key heights. CONCLUSIONS: For a minimal deviation during the surgery with a stereolithographic guide, {{it is very important to}} use the drill in a centric position, parallel to the cylinder. The use of longer drill keys and sleeves are critical for optimal accuracy. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|The final {{music that}} was ever {{recorded}} by Christopherson occurred in Bangkok, Thailand with a project named [...] "Electric Sewer Age" [...] that also involved musician Danny Hyde. The original {{intention of the}} recordings was to complete a series of releases called [...] "Moons Milk", but an album called In Final Phase was eventually released in 2013, with only 999 numbered CD copies made available. The CD is packaged in record sleeve-style thickened cardboard, and each copy is numbered from 1 to 999, while the <b>insert</b> <b>sleeve</b> displays a picture of Christopherson in his Bangkok studio that was taken {{at the moment that}} the recording was completed.|$|E

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by <b>inserting</b> a <b>sleeve</b> bearing or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or <b>inserted</b> <b>sleeves</b> complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R

5000|$|Built {{around an}} all-new tubular space frame, the Disco Volante used {{lightened}} components from the Alfa Romeo 1900. As on the 1900, {{the engine was}} a inline-four with double chain-driven overhead camshafts, but used an aluminium block and <b>inserted</b> <b>sleeves</b> instead of the 1900's cast iron one. While the 1900's 88 mm stroke was retained, cylinder bore had grown from 82.55 mm to 85 mm, bringing total displacement to 1,997.4 cubic centimetres; compression ratio was raised to 8.73:1. So configured, fed by two twin-choke sidedraught carburettors, the engine produced [...] at 6,500 rpm. The transmission was 4-speed gearbox with synchronised forwards speeds and a multi plate dry clutch. Suspension was, as on other Alfa Romeos of the time, by double wishbones at the front and solid axle linked to the chassis by an upper triangle and two lower longitudinal reaction arms. The brakes were drums on all four corners, and the 6.0×16" [...] tyres were fitted to wire wheels with duralumin rims.Thanks to its aerodynamic shape the car could attain {{a top speed of}} 220 km/h.|$|R

500|$|As he {{had done}} with All Things Must Pass and The Concert for Bangladesh, Harrison {{entrusted}} the album's art design to Tom Wilkes, and the latter's new business partner, Craig Baun. The gatefold and lyric <b>insert</b> <b>sleeves</b> for Living in the Material World were much commented-on {{at the time of}} release, Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone describing the record as [...] "beautifully-packaged with symbolic hand-print covers and the dedication, 'All Glories to Sri Krsna'", while author Nicholas Schaffner likewise admired the [...] "color representations of the Hindu scriptures", {{in the form of a}} painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita. Reproduced on the lyric insert sheet (on the back of which was a red Om symbol with yellow surround, on a black background), this painting features Krishna with Arjuna, the legendary archer and warrior, in a chariot, being pulled by the enchanted seven-headed horse Uchchaihshravas. With the album arriving at the height of the glam or glitter rock musical trend, Clayson writes of this image: [...] "a British teenager might have still dug the gear worn by Krishna in his chariot … Androgynous in beaded kaftan, jewelled fez and peacock feather, and strikingly pretty, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was not unlike some of the new breed of theatrical British chartbusters." ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{utility knife}} {{often used for}} cutting open boxes {{consists}} of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which single-edge utility blades can be <b>inserted.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> slides {{up and down on}} the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use. The blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife. The blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of corrugated fiberboard, to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.|$|R

50|$|Two common {{elements}} of drilling fixtures are {{the hole and}} bushing. Holes are often designed into drilling fixtures, to allow space for the drill bit itself to continue through the workpiece without damaging the fixture or drill, or to guide the drill bit to the appropriate point on the workpiece.

5000|$|Three-piece barrels have {{a single}} back. A series of <b>inserts,</b> or <b>sleeves,</b> with differing bores are {{inserted}} into the back. The front is attached to keep the sleeve in place. Sleeves are generally offered in either aluminium or stainless steel. Aluminium sleeves are light but can be dented or scratched easily; stainless steel versions are more resilient but carry a weight penalty. The user needs only one set of sleeves and a back for each marker. Front sections, which adjust {{the length of the}} barrel, can be interchanged. This type offers the widest selection of barrel diameters, usually [...]680 (.680 in), [...]681 (.681 in), [...]682 (.682 in), [...]683 (.683 in), and up to [...]696 caliber (.696 in).|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAccurate {{positioning}} of locking screws depends on accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the locking compression plate (LCP). The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine factors affecting accurate drill sleeve insertion. HypothesisTilting and shallow locking screw holes and combination-type holes make it difficult to <b>insert</b> the drill <b>sleeve</b> in the LCP. Materials and methodsTwenty-seven 3. 5 mm LCP metaphyseal insertion holes were selected (Philos®, LPHP®, DMTP®, low-band DMTP® [Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland]). Two orthopedic surgeons checked the time taken for accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the plate. Variables relating to LCP drill sleeve insertion time were analyzed. ResultsIt took an average 6. 6 seconds to <b>insert</b> the drill <b>sleeve</b> accurately in the holes. Insertion time increased with the tilt of the screw hole but not with shallowness. Insertion time in combination-type holes was longer (8. 8 seconds) than in single locking holes (5. 6 seconds). DiscussionTilted screw holes and combination-type holes affect the insertion of the drill sleeve into 3. 5 mm LCPs. Level of evidenceLevel IV, experimental study...|$|R
50|$|This weapon {{combined}} an 18 pounder breech {{and barrel}} with a liner (<b>sleeve)</b> <b>inserted</b> {{to reduce the}} bore from 3.3 in to 3 in {{so that it could}} fire the slightly smaller 13 pounder shell but still use the larger cartridge and propellant charge of the 18 pounder resulting in a much higher velocity. A slight neck was introduced in the 18 pounder cartridge to hold the slightly narrower 13 pounder shell in place.|$|R
40|$|The fast-growing "Ring 4 " {{instability}} {{occurring at}} intensities above 6. 5 1012 protons {{in the top}} {{one of the four}} rings of the CERN PS Booster (PSB) is finally explained by an asymmetry in the 40 vacuum pump manifolds common to all rings. Impedance measurements (by wire method) and numerical calculations show a sharp resonant peak (Q~ 2000) at 1100 MHz and shunt impedances two times higher for the Ring 4 ports as compared to the other rings. This factor is sufficient to explain that the threshold of the instability falls below the maximum intensity only in Ring 4. A final, but labor-intensive and expensive, cure consists of <b>inserting</b> short-circuiting <b>sleeves</b> into all 160 beam ports. Results of beam and impedance measurements and the planned cure will be presented and discusse...|$|R
50|$|In some modern {{propeller}}s, a hard polymer insert {{called a}} drive sleeve replaces the rubber bushing. The splined or other non-circular {{cross section of}} the <b>sleeve</b> <b>inserted</b> between the shaft and propeller hub transmits the engine torque to the propeller, rather than friction. The polymer is weaker than the components of the propeller and engine so it fails before they do when the propeller is overloaded. This fails completely under excessive load, but can easily be replaced.|$|R
5000|$|On November 12, 2015, the Jets {{participated in}} the NFL's first [...] "Color Rush" [...] {{promotion}} on Thursday Night Football, at home against the Buffalo Bills. The uniform used the same basic template as the standard uniform but with kelly green in place of hunter green; green jerseys and pants with white numerals and stripes, and solid green socks. Although the jerseys had the regular shoulder <b>inserts</b> the <b>sleeves</b> were not inverted, i.e., they were green with white TV numerals. The helmet decals, stripes and facemasks were also kelly green, with a shiny chromed finish. Because the Bills wore solid red uniforms in the game, the matchup was problematic for fans with red-green color blindness. When the two teams met again the following season for Thursday Night Football/"Color Rush" [...] on September 15, 2016, the Jets wore their standard white uniforms and helmet decals with white facemasks and solid white socks.|$|R

They anonymously produced 20,000 copies of a flexi-disc with a live recording of [...] "Sheep Farming...", copies of which were randomly <b>inserted</b> into the <b>sleeves</b> of other records by sympathetic workers at the Rough Trade Records distribution warehouse to spread their views to those who might not otherwise hear them.|$|R
5000|$|All 986 and 987 Boxsters use the M96, a water-cooled, {{horizontally}} opposed ("flat"), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche's first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it {{is placed}} mid-engine, {{while in the}} 911, rear-engine. The flat, mid-engine layout provides a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and neutral handling. The engines {{had a number of}} failures, resulting in cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign and better control of the casting process in late 1999. A failure for these early engines was a spate of porous engine blocks, as the manufacturer had difficulty in the casting process. In addition to causing problems with coolant and oil systems mingling fluids, it also resulted in Porsche's decision to repair faulty engines by boring out the cast sleeves on the cylinders where defects were noted in production and <b>inserting</b> new <b>sleeves</b> rather than scrapping the engine block. Normally, the cylinder walls are cast {{at the same time as}} the rest of the engine, this being the reason for adopting the casting technology.|$|R

40|$|An {{improvement}} {{has been}} made to the design of the hollow cathode geometry that was created for the rare-earth electron emitter described in Compact Rare Earth Emitter Hollow Cathode (NPO- 44923), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 3 (March 2010), p. 52. The original interior assembly was made entirely of graphite in order to be compatible with the LaB 6 material, which cannot be touched by metals during operation due to boron diffusion causing embrittlement issues in high-temperature refractory materials. Also, the graphite tube was difficult to machine and was subject to vibration-induced fracturing. This innovation replaces the graphite tube with one made out of refractory metal that is relatively easy to manufacture. The cathode support tube is made of molybdenum or molybdenum-rhenium. This material is easily gun-bored to near the tolerances required, and finish machined with steps at each end that capture the orifice plate and the mounting flange. This provides the manufacturability and robustness needed for flight applications, and eliminates the need for expensive e-beam welding used in prior cathodes. The LaB 6 insert is protected from direct contact with the refractory metal tube by thin, graphite sleeves in a cup-arrangement around the ends of the <b>insert.</b> The <b>sleeves,</b> <b>insert,</b> and orifice plate are held in place by a ceramic spacer and tungsten spring inserted inside the tube. To heat the cathode, an insulating tube is slipped around the refractory metal hollow tube, which can be made of high-temperature materials like boron nitride or aluminum nitride. A screw-shaped slot, or series of slots, is machined in the outside of the ceramic tube to constrain a refractory metal wire wound inside the slot that is used as the heater. The screw slot can hold a single heater wire that is then connected {{to the front of the}} cathode tube by tack-welding to complete the electrical circuit, or it can be a double slot that takes a bifilar wound heater with both leads coming out the back. This configuration replaces the previous sheathed heater design that limited the cycling-life of the cathode...|$|R
