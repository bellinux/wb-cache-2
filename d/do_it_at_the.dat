She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E
