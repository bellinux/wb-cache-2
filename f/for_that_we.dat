25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|As {{the show}} {{is based on the}} uncensored novel {{released}} in 2011, rather than the 1953 film adaptation, it contains references to prostitution and gay sex, as well as the Army's investigation into them, that the film did not feature. The right to create the musical adaptation came with the condition {{that it had to be}} based on the original book. James Jones's daughter Kaylie and son Jamie were in the audience for the show's opening night in London. During its preview period some people walked out of the performance, having been unprepared for the nudity and swearing in the production. Darius Campbell who played First Sergeant Milt Warden, said that the [...] "James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film – and wanted to see more – have been giving us standing ovations and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are all grateful." [...] Kaylie admitted they had doubts about the idea of the show when it first came up, but added that [...] "I'm thrilled—it's so sophisticated and moving." [...] She also noted that she [...] "was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes, because my dad said this is just the way it was back then" [...] and that [...] "my father would have been amazed".|$|E

2500|$|In 2002 Navetta and Lombardo joined Stevenson for {{a reunion}} {{performance}} by the Descendents' original power trio lineup at Stevenson's Stockage festival in Fort Collins, Colorado. According to Lombardo, they also recorded some songs for a potential future release: [...] "We recorded some of my songs in 2006 at The Blasting Room. In 2002 we recorded {{a whole bunch of}} songs, mostly Frank's songs. He was a great songwriter. He had such a unique EQ out of his amp. When we recorded later in 2008, we did some more of my songs, but Frank wasn't there <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> tried to recreate that unique Frank sound. I'd like to think of these as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands.

2500|$|In 1668 Penn {{was imprisoned}} in the Tower of London after writing a {{follow-up}} tract entitled The Sandy Foundation Shaken. The Bishop of London ordered that Penn be held indefinitely until he publicly recanted his written statements. The official charge was publication {{without a license}} but the real crime was blasphemy, as signed in a warrant by King Charles II. Placed in solitary confinement in an unheated cell and threatened with a life sentence, Penn was being accused of denying the Trinity, though this was a misinterpretation Penn himself refuted in the essay Innocency with her open face, presented by way of Apology for the book entitled the Sandy Foundation Shaken, where he himself proceeded to prove the Godhead of Christ. Penn said the rumour had been [...] "maliciously insinuated" [...] by detractors who {{wanted to create a}} bad reputation to Quakers. Later, he stated that what he really denied were the Catholic interpretations of this theological topic, and the use of unbiblical concepts to explain it. Penn expressly confessed he believed in the Holy Three {{as well as in the}} divinity of Christ. In 1668 in a letter to the anti-Quaker minister Jonathan Clapham, [...] Penn wrote: [...] "Thou must not, reader, from my querying thus, conclude we do deny (as he hath falsely charged us) those glorious Three, which bear record in heaven, the Father, Word, and Spirit; neither the infinity, eternity and divinity of Jesus Christ; <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know he is the mighty God." ...|$|E
2500|$|No, we do {{not love}} humanity; {{but on the other}} hand we are not nearly [...] "German" [...] enough, in the sense in which the word [...] "German" [...] is {{constantly}} being used nowadays, to advocate nationalism and race hatred and to be able to take pleasure in the national scabies of the heart and blood poisoning that now leads the nations of Europe to delimit and barricade themselves against each other as if it were a matter of quarantine. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are too open-minded, too malicious, too spoiled, also too well-informed, too [...] "traveled": we far prefer to live on mountains, apart, [...] "untimely," [...] in past or future centuries, merely in order to keep ourselves from experiencing the silent rage to which we know we should be condemned as eyewitnesses of politics that are desolating the German spirit by making it vain and that is, moreover, petty politics:—to keep its own creation from immediately falling apart again, is it not finding it necessary to plant it between two deadly hatreds? must it not desire the eternalization of the European system of a lot of petty states? ...
