With connections to St. Louis promoter Tom Packs, Watson’s notoriety resulted in Watson ending Longson’s four year title reign with a victory at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis on February 21, 1947. The territory of St. Louis became a <b>home</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>home</b> for Watson. More than 10,000 St. Louis fans watched local hero Lou Thesz beat Watson for the world title on April 25, 1947. After Packs retired in 1948, Tunney bought into the territory in St. Louis and this resulted in many more matches for Watson in the city.|$|E
25|$|October 3, 1924 was {{the first}} time Roosevelt {{traveled}} to Warm Springs, Georgia and it soon became his <b>home</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>home.</b> For many years to come Warm Springs would be where Franklin would retreat in comfort and do hydrotherapy for his legs. On April 29, 1926 he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients. One of Roosevelt's major goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health. It is now the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, a comprehensive rehabilitation facility operated by the State of Georgia.|$|E

She even joked with an interviewer in 1958 that Oslo hospital had become her <b>home</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>home.</b> From 1958 to 1960, Flagstad was the first Director of the Norwegian National Opera. In her last years she gave many benefit concerts throughout Norway. She was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 1960 and died of the disease on 7 December 1962. At her own request she was buried in an unmarked grave in Vestre Gravlund Cemetery in the Frogner borough of Oslo. The largest floral arrangement at her funeral was sent by Lauritz Melchior.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} on stage nearly every weekend, even at Elks Lodges and YMCA centers. The band soon {{became part of}} a circuit that also {{included}} the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and the band found its way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at Soma, a local all-ages venue located on Market Street which the band longed to headline. Big-name acts such as NOFX and Green Day played {{on the main floor}}, while smaller acts were relegated to the basement, an area referred to as [...] "the Dungeon". The original location closed its doors and relocated before the band would be promoted to the main stage (which required a 100+ crowd to attend). [...] "Soma was like <b>home</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>home.</b> All the punk kids who didn’t give a fuck about football games and proms or whatever came to hang out at Soma," [...] claimed Hoppus. The band's first big show on the main floor took place on a Thursday, where the band opened for Face to Face. Hoppus' manager at the record store, Patrick Secor, fronted him the money to properly record another demo at local studio Doubletime. The result was Buddha (1994), which the members of the band viewed as the band's first legitimate release. By this time, the group had branched out to venues such as the Soul Kitchen in El Cajon, but Raynor's family relocated to Reno, Nevada, and he was briefly replaced by musician Mike Krull. The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows, but eventually Raynor moved in with Hoppus for a summer in which the band would record its first album and music video and gain even more exposure.|$|E

But {{when it comes to}} prestige, the Waldorf-Astoria has no peer. When presidents come to New York, they stay at the Waldorf-Astoria. Kings and queens make it their <b>home</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> as have people as diverse as Cary Grant, the Dalai Lama and Chris Evert. Some of them liked the hotel so well, they made their home there." [...] From its inception, the Waldorf was always a [...] "must stay" [...] hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him. Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including Shahanshah of Iran and Empress Farah, King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Princess Astrid of Norway, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway, King Baudouin I of Belgium and Queen Fabiola, Prince Albert and Princess Paola of Belgium, King Hussein I of Jordan, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, King Michael of Romania, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Homaira Shah of Afghanistan, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan and many others. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year.|$|E

Many small size hotels in Ghana keep springing up quickly in a bid to provide <b>home</b> for people <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>home.</b> Yet, innovative ideas that enhance patronage and sustainability is on a decline, leading to eventual foldup. This study seeks to advance the entrepreneurial innovations of small hotels in order to sustain growth in Ghana. Successful stories about SMEs exist but are rare. A population size of 2915 entrepreneurs operating small medium hotels across the country were zoned into three, and schematic random sampling method was used in selecting the hotels. A scale of 100 % hospitality industry attitudinal variables such as Service Innovations, Process Innovations, Management Innovations and Marketing Innovations were used. Responses from small hotel managers/owners indicate that there is a strong correlation between innovative activities and patronage. We therefore, recommend small hospitalities’ managers to develop their innovative abilities as a reliable path to the survival and growth of their businesses in a highly perishable and competitive business environment.|$|R
