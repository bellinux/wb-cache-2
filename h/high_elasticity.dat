While Lycra is used in most swimsuits designs because of its <b>high</b> <b>elasticity,</b> lower expense, and water wicking nature, its major drawback is that it breaks down in chlorine, commonly found in swimming pools. When worn daily, a swimsuit made of Lycra will break down in about 2–3 months. Speedo introduced Fastskin in 2007 as the lightest and fastest material for competitive swimwear. Unlike lycra, it does not break down in chlorine.|$|E

Factors of importance are the load/deflection rate and the maximum elastic moment or yield moment.

40|$|This paper updates {{a review}} {{conducted}} by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1996 in which the agency evaluated the academic research {{on the effects of}} changes in after-tax wages on labor supply in the U. S. economy. That review concluded that substitution elasticities were larger in absolute value than income elasticities and that the decision to work was more responsive to after-tax wages than was the choice of hours. In this update, we find that for men and single women, estimates of substitution elasticities have increased, and income elasticities still appear to be smaller in absolute value than substitution elasticities. We also find that labor supply elasticities of married women have fallen substantially in the last three decades, although they are still <b>higher</b> than the <b>elasticities</b> of men and unmarried women. Based on our review, the elasticities of broad measures of income (total income less capital gains) from tax return data are in most instances consistent with the labor supply elasticities estimated using survey data. We find little compelling evidence that high-income taxpayers have substantially <b>higher</b> <b>elasticities</b> with respect to their labor input than other taxpayers: While some studies have estimated <b>higher</b> <b>elasticities</b> of broad income among high-income taxpayers, those results appear to reflect those taxpayers’ greater ability to time their income.

3000|$|Our {{results also}} confirm that disparities do {{exist in the}} sense that labour markets are {{heterogeneous}} and exhibit segmentation at different dissections. In general, we find that the determinants of industrial labour demand are quantitatively different, mainly across regions and, to some extent, across subsectors and plant sizes, in the latter cases when we focus on demand for temporary workers. For example, the <b>highest</b> long-run own-price <b>elasticity</b> is found for unskilled-permanent workers located in Pereira (−[*] 1.843) while the lowest corresponds to unskilled-temporary in Bogotá (−[*] 0.27). Interestingly, the elasticities of permanent skilled workers range between −[*] 0.555 (Bogotá) and −[*] 1.3 (Manizales). Thus, we claim that heterogeneity of labour demand is reflected the most in the estimated coefficients across cities and draw attention to the implications of this heterogeneity for labour policy design and outcomes. In particular, wage setting across cities should be studied in order to understand whether the <b>higher</b> <b>elasticities</b> respond to rigidities. In addition, some retraining programs might be designed to face the output shocks given the <b>high</b> <b>elasticities</b> found in some regions. 5 [...]...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} non-cooperative and cooperative strategies {{with respect to}} manufacturer and retailer coupons. In a model with one manufacturer selling its product to one retailer, {{it is found that}} the retailer can achieve third-degree price discrimination equilibrium in retail markets by issuing coupons to demanders with <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity.</b> Although facing only one retailer, the manufacturer can also achieve the same third-degree price discrimination equilibrium by issuing coupons directly to demanders of <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity.</b> However, when only one firm issues the coupon, both manufacturer and retailer coupons can help alleviate the channel profit loss due to double marginalization. If the manufacturer and the retailer non-cooperatively issue coupons, then the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium outcomes are equivalent to those under the successive third-degree price discrimination. Moreover, cooperative strategies between the manufacturer and the retailer can eliminate double marginalization, achieve the vertical integration effect, and lead to higher profits, consumer surpluses, and social surpluses than non-cooperative coupon strategies.

30|$|Flow {{resistance}} {{is the third}} mechanism that can improve volumetric or macroscopic sweep efficiency during polymer flooding. Dehghanpour and Kuru (2010) investigated the effect of viscoelastic fluid rheology on {{the formation of an}} “internal cake” (frictional pressure drop). They observed that the fluid with <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity</b> exhibited significantly <b>higher</b> pressure drop during flow through porous media. This elastic effect that results in additional pressure drop could be enhanced by widening the molecular weight distribution without changing the shear viscosity. A similar trend was obtained by Urbissinova et al. (2010), who also evaluated the contribution of polymer’s elasticity in EOR. Likewise, they observed that the polymer solution showing <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity</b> experienced <b>higher</b> flow resistance (pressure drop) to flow through porous media than the polymer with lower elasticity, even though their shear viscosities were identical, which rendered improved macro-scale sweep efficiency and oil recovery (Veerabhadrappa 2012).
