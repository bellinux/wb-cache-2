25|$|Somerset awarded Gimblett {{a benefit}} match in 1952, though perhaps {{typically}} <b>he</b> <b>grumbled</b> {{that it was}} not the potentially lucrative bank holiday local derby match with Gloucestershire but the game with Northamptonshire at Glastonbury that he was allocated. Gimblett made a century in that match and had, in terms of run aggregate, his best-ever season in 1952. He scored 2134 runs in all matches, at an average of 39.51. Against Derbyshire at Taunton, he became the first Somerset player to hit two centuries in a match twice, scoring 146 and 116 in a drawn game.|$|E
2500|$|Jordanian {{field marshal}} Habis Al-Majali claimed that Sharon was among 6 Israeli {{soldiers}} {{captured by the}} Jordanian 4th battalion during the battle, and that Habis took them to a camp in Mafraq and the 6 were later traded back. Sharon denied the claims, but Habes was adamant. [...] "Sharon is like a grizzly bear," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "I captured him, I healed his wounds." [...] In 1994 and during the peace treaty signing ceremony with Jordan, Sharon wanted {{to get in touch}} with his former captor, but the latter [...] determinedly refused to discuss the incident publicly.|$|E
2500|$|Charity {{lost money}} and closed on 14 March. [...] Its failure was disappointing to Gilbert, {{particularly}} after {{the success of}} his earlier [...] "fairy comedies" [...] at the Haymarket, and <b>he</b> <b>grumbled</b> that [...] "pieces written with anything like an earnest purpose seldom seem to succeed." [...] Charity did have a good provincial tour, and a production at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York, starring Fanny Davenport and Ada Dyas as Ruth. Augustin Daly's production at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in 1880 was not authorised by the author, and Gilbert was angry that Daly [...] "debased" [...] his play, adding characters and revising the text. The American courts would not issue an injunction to prohibit this, since British copyright was unenforceable in America at that time (as Gilbert and Sullivan would experience with H.M.S. Pinafore and their later hits).|$|E
5000|$|Karl buys his horses, but Barbarosa {{declines to}} {{accompany}} him back to lawful living. [...] "To tell the truth, I'm worn out keeping you amused," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbles.</b> The two part ways as friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is what I {{always tell}} George," [...] remarked the Woman of the World, [...] "when <b>he</b> <b>grumbles</b> at the tradesmen's books. If Papa {{could only have}} seen his way to being a poor man, I feel I {{should have been a}} better wife." ...|$|R
5000|$|Margaretta Scott {{appears as}} the aristocratic dog-owner Mrs Pumphrey. Her servant, irked {{at having to}} look after Mrs Pumphrey's pampered Pekingese Tricki-Woo, is William Hodgekin (Teddy Turner). He longs for it to [...] "have its chips" [...] and succumb to illness, which is why <b>he</b> <b>grumbles</b> {{whenever}} the vets pay a visit.|$|R
60|$|He well {{knew the}} fame of Butzow's sword arm, and having no stomach for an {{encounter}} with it <b>he</b> <b>grumbled</b> an apology.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that your outlook is a trifle superficial, dear," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "However--now what the dickens is the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, there," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled,</b> [...] "I shall {{do my best}} to {{find the}} laggard, lest those pretty eyes should weep away their beauty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{returned}} our hostess, with {{a thoughtful}} air, [...] "you're quite right in that. One always meets {{more women than}} men in society. But it's because the men are so lazy, and so comfortable at their clubs, they won't go. They enjoy themselves well enough in society after they get there, as I tell my husband when <b>he</b> <b>grumbles</b> over having to dress." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped back}} respectfully out of earshot, where <b>he</b> stood <b>grumbling</b> {{to himself and}} {{measuring}} the distance in springs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Chubby!" [...] Then {{she turned}} with that {{sweetish}} smile to Mrs. Morel. [...] "Don't you think <b>he's</b> always <b>grumbling,</b> Mrs. Morel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chap who {{was going}} to cut it for me got shot yesterday," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "Anything doing as you came over the ridge, Major?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Humph!” The man {{fell back}} a little. “Well, I am thankful for that. But you boys {{had no right}} to look at it,” <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{your first}} haul {{in this line}} ain't worth much," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "Hows'ever, I've got coppers enough for a night's lodgin' an' grub." ...|$|E
5000|$|In many {{campaign}} {{settings for}} the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, Caoimhin (pronounced [...] "koo-ev-inn," [...] meaning [...] "kindly") is the killmoulis deity {{of food and}} shy friendship. His symbol is a tiny bowl and pin. Caoimhin is a large-nosed, mouthless brownielike creature only a foot in height. He wears gossamer armor covered in thick woolen rags to help him keep warm. <b>He</b> <b>grumbles</b> nervously from time to time. Caoimhin dwells in the Seelie Court realm.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think not,' {{replied the}} Doctor. 'But do not suppose me so unwary as to adopt {{him out of}} hand. I am, I flatter myself, a {{finished}} man of the world; I have had all possibilities in view; my plan is contrived to meet them all. I take the lad as stable boy. If he pilfer, if <b>he</b> <b>grumble,</b> if <b>he</b> desire to change, I shall see I was mistaken; I shall recognise him for no son of mine, and send him tramping.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say he's kind," [...] replied Cap'n Joe, [...] "for he's as near a devil as any livin' critter CAN be. <b>He</b> <b>grumbles</b> an' growls in {{his soft}} voice all day, an' hates himself an' {{everybody}} else. But I don't {{see much of}} him. There's {{so many of us}} slaves here that Zog don't pay much attention to us, an' we have a pretty good time when the ol' magician is shut up in his den, as he mostly is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled,</b> [...] "or how can {{you expect}} a fair trial? Prisoner at the bar, you have been found guilty of witchcraft." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One labours {{the whole}} day long for that," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "When the hour for rest comes, surely one may drop it for a time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice time ter send fer me, this is, Joe," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "It's gittin' so a feller can't even paint {{his foot}} in peace an' quiet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bailey sat and <b>grumbled.</b> <b>He</b> {{was still}} <b>grumbling</b> when his eye caught {{something}} black and round among the waves. [...] "Hullo!" [...] he said. He looked narrowly and saw two triangular black bodies frothing {{every now and}} then about a yard in front of this.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to {{the spot}} on the Choctawhatchee, they find the {{houseboat}} sunk, and Skink standing on the roof, nursing a non-fatal gunshot wound - [...] "It would have been helpful," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbles</b> to Malley, [...] "to {{know that he had}} another gun." [...] He admits that Tommy got away. Richard advocates leaving the manhunt for the police, but Malley has been traumatized enough that she needs to see him captured herself. Skink says he can find Tommy, and they insist on going with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] {{replied the}} Doctor. [...] "But do not suppose me so unwary as to adopt {{him out of}} hand. I am, I flatter myself, a {{finished}} man of the world; I have had all possibilities in view; my plan is contrived to meet them all. I take the lad as stable-boy. If he pilfer, if <b>he</b> <b>grumble,</b> if <b>he</b> desire to change, I shall see I was mistaken; I shall recognise him for no son of mine, and send him tramping." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{the morning}} <b>he</b> <b>grumbled</b> incessantly, until at length, warned by an {{offensive}} smell of rum that dinner {{was on the}} table, {{he got up and}} went below.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they manage}} to pile up enough o' brush to clap a light to," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled</b> to himself in an undertone, [...] "it's all up wi' us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “They {{certainly}} {{know how to}} make prisons,” <b>he</b> <b>grumbled</b> to himself. “If it was not that I shall never lose hope of something turning up, I would accept my parole.” ...|$|E
60|$|During {{all this}} while {{the man with}} the chest on his back was waiting for orders. Bent nearly double, <b>he</b> was <b>grumbling</b> audibly at his uncomfortable position.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> was <b>grumbling,</b> [...] "The whole thing's {{right in}} line with the {{criticism}} you've always been making. Might have known you'd oppose any decent constructive work for the town or for----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with the place?" [...] asked her {{withered}} companion. [...] "I don't see nought amiss with it. Here's Mr. Girdlestone a-comin'. <b>He</b> don't <b>grumble</b> at the place, I'll warr'nt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought we'd drop {{before we}} got you fellows up," [...] added Werner. [...] "You sure are some sleepers," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled,</b> as he too sank down on a seat.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} going to take a ride why didn't you let me know?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "I'd like to run that car a bit before Dick goes back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't think why Geraldine didn't pick {{up with a}} smart {{young fellow}} like Granet instead of an old stick like Thomson," [...] <b>he</b> <b>grumbled.</b> [...] "I hate these Army Medicals, anyway." ...|$|E
60|$|Other people ricochetted {{from side}} to side of the car, {{reviving}} this, rediscovering that, anticipating t'other thing, which, sure enough, slid round the next curve to meet them, caring nothing if all the world knew they were home again; and the newly arrived Englishman with his large wooden packing-cases marked 'Settlers' Effects' had no more part in the show than a new boy his first day at school. But two years in Canada and one run home will make him free of the Brotherhood in Canada as it does anywhere else. <b>He</b> may <b>grumble</b> at certain aspects of the life, lament certain richnesses only to be found in England, but as surely as <b>he</b> <b>grumbles</b> so surely <b>he</b> returns to the big skies, and the big chances. The failures are those who complain that the land 'does not know a gentleman when it sees him.' They are quite right. The land suspends all judgment on all men till it has seen them work. Thereafter as may be; but work they must because there is a very great deal to be done.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{the more}} sorry," [...] said <b>he,</b> after <b>grumbling</b> at the allotted ten minutes, [...] "as we shall dine so late. You desired Norman to bring any friend he liked, did you not, Flora?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the closing}} chapter ("What the Listener Heard"), the authors discuss the listener's reactions. They {{view them as}} {{generally}} drawn {{to the idea of}} success, while against [...] "bureaucrats, Jews, congressmen, plutocrats, communists ... <b>He</b> <b>grumbles</b> against the foreigners who come to this country and get good jobs." [...] Löwenthal and Guterman emphasize that American agitators have historically failed to gain traction and are usually marginalized. They warn, however, that under certain circumstances, such as loss of security for the middle class, America should contemplate the [...] "possibility in which a situation will arise in which large numbers of people would be susceptible to his psychological manipulation".|$|R
