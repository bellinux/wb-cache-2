5|$|Chauncey Thomas died at {{his home}} in Shohola on October 5, 1882, sixteen years after the new bridge was repaired. Since Thomas had never written a will, estate and {{property}} were divided between his children and <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> A friend to the Thomas family, Stephen St. John Gardiner, became the administrator of the estate. With the job, Gardiner was able to buy the bridge. He became controller and majority of the bridge's stock.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of {{successful}} plays, Planché was never particularly wealthy, and he felt pressure from needing to support <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> Circumstances improved when in 1871 he was awarded a civil list pension of £100 per annum 'in recognition of his literary services'. Planché died {{at his home in}} Chelsea on 30 May 1880 at the age of 84. His wealth {{at the time of his}} death was under £1000.|$|E

Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E

5|$|As a {{constitutional}} monarch, his education was {{followed closely by}} the National Assembly, which demanded from Itanhaém progress reports concerning his studies. During this time, Pedro II was kept unaware of events occurring outside the palace, including political matters. News which did intrude upon the emperor and his sisters concerned deaths within their family. In December 1834, they learned of the early and unanticipated death of their father. A few months later their grandfather Francis II, who had shown great interest in <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> died (June 1835). These losses drew the emperor and his sisters closer together and strengthened their sense of family, {{despite the absence of}} their parents.|$|E

The conflict stemmed from the fact that Konstanty asked Jeremi to take care of <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> but their mother, Katarzyna Eugenia Tyszkiewicz, married Aleksander, who declared he is able and willing to take care of her children - and their estates. A year later, Katarzyna Eugenia decided to divorce Aleksander, and the matter was settled in favor of Jeremi.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian, who {{was married}} to the former Kathleen Davis, also became {{involved}} with medical causes later in life. Along with Mike and Cindy Parseghian, his son and daughter-in-law, he founded the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation in 1994. The foundation is seeking a cure for Niemann-Pick disease Type C, a genetic disorder affecting children that causes the buildup of cholesterol in cells, resulting in damage to the nervous system and eventually death. Three of <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> Michael, Marcia, and Christa Parseghian, died from the disease. He was also active in the cause {{to find a cure}} for multiple sclerosis; his daughter, Karan, was diagnosed with the disease.|$|E
5|$|After his accident, Kurosawa's health {{began to}} deteriorate. While his mind {{remained}} sharp and lively, {{his body was}} giving up, {{and for the last}} half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in Setagaya, Tokyo, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son Hisao Kurosawa who married Hiroko Hayashi and his daughter Kazuko Kurosawa who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> the actor Takayuki Kato and , became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime, Takashi Koizumi's After the Rain (1999) and Kei Kumai's The Sea is Watching (2002).|$|E

5|$|Following Temple's marriage, {{his father}} had {{invested}} in a farming venture by Edward Whalley who was the brother-in-law of Temple's stepsister - Mary Penistone. Sir Alexander apparently intended this to provide an inheritance for <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren</b> (the children of James Temple). As a younger son himself, Sir Alexander wanted to ensure suitable provision for his own younger son. This investment made by Temple's father {{for the benefit of}} his children had apparently become valueless when Edward Whalley fled to Scotland in the late 1630s. However, in the 1650s, Whalley had become a prominent and successful member of the Puritan establishment and there was a possibility of recovering some money. In the late 1650s, Temple and Whalley went to the Court of Chancery to determine what was due to Temple and his children. However, with the death of Oliver Cromwell and the subsequent restoration of Charles II, both regicides were faced with the possibility of execution and the case appears to have been unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud {{was born}} in South Kensington, London, the third of the four {{children}} and youngest of three sons of Frank Henry Gielgud (1860–1949) and his second wife, Kate Terry-Gielgud, née Terry-Lewis (1868–1958). The two elder boys were Lewis, who became a senior official of the Red Cross and UNESCO, and Val, later head of BBC radio drama; their sister Eleanor became John's secretary for many years. On his father's side, Gielgud was of Lithuanian and Polish descent. The surname derives from Gelgaudiškis, a village in Lithuania. The Counts Gielgud had owned the Gielgudziszki Castle on the River Niemen, but their estates were confiscated after they {{took part in a}} failed uprising against Russian rule in 1830–31. Jan Gielgud took refuge in England with his family; one of <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren</b> was Frank Gielgud, whose maternal grandmother was a famous Polish actress, Aniela Aszpergerowa.|$|E
5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The Nature of Things in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren</b> as his only true legacy.|$|E

5|$|On January 8, 1902, Philip Primrose married Lily Deane (June 3, 1877 – March 15, 1966). She was the {{daughter}} of Superintendent Richard Burton Deane of the North-West Mounted Police. Deane had served with the NWMP during the Riel Rebellion of 1885, tasked with guarding Riel and 50 other participants of the uprising in their prison cells. The Primroses had four children: Phyllis Jessie (1902–1975), Neil (1904–1904), Neil Philip (1905–1991), and Sybil E. (c. 1909–1946).

5|$|Visits to Spandau of {{half an hour}} {{per month}} were allowed, but Hess forbade his family to visit until December 1969, {{when he was a}} patient at the British Military Hospital in West Berlin for a {{perforated}} ulcer. By this time Wolf Rüdiger Hess was 32 years old and Ilse 69; they had not seen Hess since his departure from Germany in 1941. After this illness, he allowed his family to visit regularly. His daughter-in-law Andrea, who often brought photos and films of <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> became a particularly welcome visitor. Hess's health problems, both mental and physical, were ongoing during his captivity. He cried out in the night, claiming he had stomach pains. He continued to suspect that his food was being poisoned and complained of amnesia. A psychiatrist who examined him in 1957 deemed he was not ill enough to be transferred to a mental hospital. Another unsuccessful suicide attempt took place in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Being {{frozen in}} an iceberg {{for a hundred}} years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see <b>his</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> all of whom would be powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E
