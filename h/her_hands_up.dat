5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
500|$|A {{key element}} of Shakur's defense was medical {{testimony}} meant to demonstrate that she was shot with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> {{and that she would}} have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A neurologist testified that the median nerve in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger. Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper's testimony) [...] "would be anatomically impossible".|$|E
500|$|Aside from {{experts and}} {{security}} personnel, several eyewitnesses gave {{evidence to the}} inquest. Three witnessed parts of the shootings, and gave accounts which supported the official version of eventsâ€”in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while {{they were on the}} floor. Witnesses uncovered by the journalists making [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] also appeared: Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground. Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia's testimony had changed since she spoke to [...] "Death on the Rock", and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, a suggestion Celecia rejected; the SAS's lawyer further observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up,</b> after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car the Proettas saw was the one being driven by Inspector Revagliatte, carrying four uniformed police officers rather than plain-clothed soldiers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to [...] "Death on the Rock", Carmen Proetta was no longer certain that she had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown.|$|E

500|$|Maxie Proetta {{appeared}} on 22 September. He told the coroner {{that he had}} witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up,</b> after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and {{he believed that the}} shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car {{he and his wife had}} seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to [...] "Death on the Rock"; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown. Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was [...] "a bit confused". The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed and}} shook her head, and held <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> for inspection.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{she reached}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to his face, made brave {{to do it}} by the {{sheltering}} darkness.|$|E
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to his lips, but {{he caught}} it and {{covered it with}} kisses.|$|R
60|$|Obediently the Colonel {{took from}} her the glass, {{and as he}} sipped, she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> and stroked his head.|$|R
60|$|My mother, {{who until}} this time {{had made no}} change in her position, raised <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to my lips and stopped me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucius!" [...] And she put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up,</b> {{praying for}} mercy, {{though she could}} not explain to him how terribly severe were his words.|$|E
60|$|Ellen went on {{shelling}} peas {{for a few}} minutes. Then she suddenly put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her own face. There were tears in her black-browed eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no! Walter!' She shrieked, and put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her head, in an {{attitude}} of terror that transfixed him where he stood. 'Don't say that word!' ...|$|E
60|$|Looking askew at the questioner, Jenny stole <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to <b>her</b> friend's, {{and drew}} her friend down, {{so that she}} bent beside her on her knee.|$|R
60|$|At the moment, {{the bell}} rang loudly in the hall. He turned white, as she held <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> like an enchantress, at whose {{invocation}} the sound had come.|$|R
6000|$|She had put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to <b>her</b> breast, {{her face}} was colourless, her eyes widened by alarm. Then seeming to master herself, she {{inclined}} her head, and said: [...] "Very well." ...|$|R
60|$|At this {{outburst}} Mrs. Pendyce's face became rigid; {{only the}} flicker of her eyelids betrayed how her nerves were quivering. Suddenly she threw <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her ears.|$|E
60|$|She had {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> {{with that}} higher and better look, {{and now she}} turned again, and folded them round Lizzie's neck, and rocked herself on Lizzie's breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} hear it," [...] said she, rising {{from her seat}} on the sofa with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her forehead, but still coming nearer to him as she moved.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor thing!' thought Mrs. Pendyce; 'its mouth {{must be so}} sore, and it's quite unnecessary.' She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> {{through the}} trap. [...] "Please take me in a {{straight}} line. I don't like corners." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara held <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "When it accomplishes {{anything}} I do; but listen," [...] she said. [...] "That sound isn't the discord of purposeless haste. There's {{a rhythm}} in it. It's ordered and stately harmony." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} delighted to hear {{anything}} from you, Miss Stanbury," [...] said Camilla,--not without an air of bravado. Arabella said nothing, but she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> almost convulsively {{to the back of}} her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "My God--" [...] Lora put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up.</b> Conger cursed. He hadn't meant {{any of it}} for her. But {{it would}} wear off. There was only a half-amp to it. It would tingle.|$|E
60|$|FAITH. [With a slow smile] Yes. [She gives {{a sudden}} little twirl, and puts <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her hair before the mirror] My {{afternoon}} to-day. It's fine in the streets, after-being in there.|$|E
6000|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her cheeks, but {{her eyes}} seemed to look right into him. He had never before {{realised}} the depth and purity and touching faithfulness in those dew-bright eyes, and he stammered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not like you!" [...] said Mrs. Lovel, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to {{his brow}} and pushing away his hair. Was it {{possible}} that any girl should not like such a man as that, and he an earl? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{stay with}} Christy," [...] {{observed}} Jim; {{as much as}} to say that he had the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to <b>her</b> head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the other.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tatty,' {{said her}} young mistress, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> over <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{that the other}} might take it, 'Miss Wade almost frightened me when we parted, and I scarcely {{like to think of}} her just now as having been so near me without my knowing it. Tatty dear!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course;--it is {{everything}} that is bad. What a pity {{that you did not}} find it out last year! Oh dear, oh dear! what am I to do?" [...] Then she threw herself down upon the sofa, and put both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her temples.|$|E
6000|$|Going in, he was {{conscious}} of an abundant black skirt vanishing through {{the door into the}} restaurant, and of Annette with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her hair. It was the attitude in which of all others he admired her--so beautifully straight and rounded and supple. And he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know it!" [...] said Gregory. [...] "I {{am going}} away from here. I am going to-morrow {{as soon as}} I can arrange--as soon as I can get away. Good-night--I"--Clementina in her {{agitation}} put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to her face. [...] "Oh, don't cry--I can't bear to have you cry." ...|$|E
60|$|All of a suddent {{she thought}} she would hide it in the bread. She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> and pulled it hard and quick and broke the {{fastening}} and needed it right into the loaf. Then she put the loaf in the pan and set it in the oven.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, sir," [...] she said, {{pointing}} to the church. And she held <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> as if in reproof; but a sweet kindness beamed in her honest face. Ah, friendly young reader, wandering on the world and struggling with temptation, may you also {{have one or two}} pure hearts to love and pray for you! ...|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{turned her}} face away from the others, and perhaps it was only {{accident}} that she looked into a mirror hanging on the tent wall. Swiftly she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to feel a wide red welt on her cheek. Dorothy had been assiduously careful of her soft, white skin, and here was an ugly mark marring its beauty.|$|R
