50|$|Lacking {{from the}} {{camcorder}} is an optical viewfinder, headphone output, <b>focus</b> <b>ring</b> and full manual mode.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{change of}} the 'Merrill' DP cameras is the <b>focus</b> <b>ring</b> {{is now in the}} {{traditional}} location around the lens barrel.|$|R
5000|$|The current EF 50mm 1.8 II lens has {{a plastic}} lens mount. The manual <b>focusing</b> <b>ring</b> has been {{replaced}} by a very small thin <b>focusing</b> <b>ring</b> on the front tip of the lens. However the lens does not suffer from rotating front lens element and can be used with polarizing filters. The optics for both lenses are identical, with 6 elements in 5 groups and a 5 blade diaphragm. Nevertheless, some photographers think the original EF 50mm 1.8 is slightly better [...] Both lenses have a 52mm filter thread.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{features}} a weather resistant plastic exterior over plastic internals. It showcases recessed front lens element, <b>focusing</b> <b>ring,</b> and a matte black finish. On {{the side of}} the lens is a programmable focus-hold button.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{features}} a plastic exterior over plastic internals and a rubber focus ring. It showcases recessed front lens element, <b>focusing</b> <b>ring,</b> and a matte black finish. The lens {{is also one}} of Sony's only Full-Frame lenses lacking weather resistance.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{features}} a minimalist matte-black plastic exterior with a Zeiss badge {{on the side}} of the barrel and a rubber <b>focus</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thom Hogan praised {{its value}} and optical performance, but criticized its handling, noting a {{diminutive}} <b>focus</b> <b>ring</b> that rotates during focusing, with no manual override.|$|R
50|$|DMC-LX: compact {{high-end}} camera line, {{with full}} manual exposure and focus controls (with joystick control rather than <b>focus</b> <b>ring),</b> and RAW recording, unusual in compact cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} is the <b>focusing</b> <b>ring</b> around the body. This retains the {{compactness}} {{of the unit}} but requires two hands to operate and does not give particularly fast focusing. In some units, the ring can be stiff to operate.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{features}} a plastic exterior over plastic internals and a rubber focus ring, {{similar to that}} of the Sony FE 50mm F1.8 lens. It showcases recessed front lens element, <b>focusing</b> <b>ring,</b> and a matte black finish. The lens does not feature image stabilization.|$|E
5000|$|The EF 50mm 1.8 II {{replaced}} the EF 50mm 1.8 in 1991. The EF 50mm 1.8 II {{has lost the}} metal lens mount, the distance scale, the IR focusing label and the separate manual <b>focusing</b> <b>ring</b> {{that came with the}} original EF 50mm 1.8.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{front of}} a Kinaflex twin-lens reflex camera. The <b>focus</b> <b>rings</b> of the two lenses are coupled with gears around their {{circumference}} in this simple design.|$|R
50|$|In photography, manual focus override, {{also known}} as {{full-time}} manual focus, allows manual intervention in the autofocus acquisition process simply by turning the <b>focus</b> <b>ring</b> on a photographic lens.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical F-type ("Pre-AI") lens, the Nikkor 50mm 1:1.4 showing [...] "Nippon Kogaku Japan" [...] engravings, scalloped-metal <b>focus</b> <b>ring,</b> and old-style Meter Coupling Prong (clearly {{visible to}} the top right of photo).|$|R
50|$|The lens {{features}} a weather resistant plastic exterior over plastic internals with a matte black finish. It showcases recessed front lens element, <b>focusing</b> <b>ring,</b> and aperture ring. On {{the side of}} the lens is a programable focus-hold button, Autofocus-Manual focus switch, and the red G-Master branding.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the longer}} {{of the only}} two 1.2 lenses Canon makes, other being the 50mm 1.2L USM. This lens is {{constructed}} with a metal body and mount, and with rubber gripping and plastic extremities. It features a wide rubber <b>focusing</b> <b>ring</b> and a distance window with infrared index.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{features}} a weather resistant plastic exterior with a dedicated aperture ring, <b>focusing</b> <b>ring,</b> and detachable petal-type lens hood. It showcases a minimalist black exterior with a Zeiss badge {{on the side}} of the barrel. Given the 35mm lens' fast aperture of F1.4, it excels at low-light photography.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{because of}} its {{functions}}, {{it is as though}} the FZ20 has come down to size. The only functions that the FZ5 does not include is its manual <b>focus</b> <b>ring,</b> flash hotshoe, and ED lens-element.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical AI lens: A Nikkor 50mm 1:1.4 showing [...] "Nikon" [...] engravings, rubber <b>focus</b> <b>ring,</b> and new-style Meter Coupling Prong {{distinguished}} by its cutaway sections. The lens {{is mounted on}} a Nikon FE2 camera.|$|R
5000|$|The lens showcases {{a glossy}} black (or silver) plastic {{exterior}} with the Sigma Art [...] "A" [...] badge {{on the side}} of the lens. It features a large manual <b>focus</b> <b>ring</b> and a detachable barrel-type lens hood.|$|R
50|$|Control FreakThe Control Freak {{was modeled}} after the 3G, the lens allows the user to {{compress}} and bend the lens and then lock it in place once the desired focus is achieved. Once in locked position the focus can be adjusted with the three posts and the barrel <b>focusing</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Distance scale window: This {{feature is}} found on many EF lenses. This feature, while not a control or switch, {{is useful to}} the {{photographer}} for determining, or setting, the lens's focus distance. It is {{used in conjunction with}} the <b>Focusing</b> <b>ring.</b> When rotated, the distance scale will also rotate to show the changing focus distance. On some lenses the distance scale also has an infrared index. These are shown as red markings below the distance scale. This is used for making focus adjustments when the photographer is doing infrared photography, as lenses typically focus infrared light at a different point than visible light, and therefore achieving correct focus using visible light will result in an out-of-focus infrared image. To make an adjustment, first focus the subject, then turn the <b>Focusing</b> <b>ring</b> so it matches the corresponding infrared index mark.|$|E

Turn the focusing knob to eliminate parallax between the staff and reticle.|$|E
50|$|The lens has {{a weather}} {{resistant}} plastic construction with a matte-black finish and rubber zoom and <b>focus</b> <b>rings.</b> The {{barrel of the}} lens moves outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 28mm to 70mm.|$|R
50|$|M.Zuiko Digital lenses {{are offered}} as {{exchangeable}} lenses for the Micro Four Thirds system (MFT). The ED 8 mm f/1.8 Fisheye Pro is available since 2014. This lens has a <b>focussing</b> <b>ring</b> {{and it is}} water and dust proof.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Zone {{focusing}} fixes a {{depth of}} field, which can be read off of the DOF scale on the <b>focus</b> <b>ring,</b> as shown here - DOF is 1 meter to 2 meters, with aperture f/11 and focal plane at 1.4 meters.|$|R
5000|$|Later on, as body {{serial numbers}} {{approached}} the two million mark, more easily detectable changes were introduced; the shutter speed dial on chrome cameras became chrome finished with coarse patterned sides. All screws {{are of the}} crosshead variety. The take-up film spool got a grey four-tongued plastic moulding for film attachment. The lens got a scalloped <b>focusing</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The lens is [...] "focus by wire"- the <b>focusing</b> <b>ring</b> sends commands, {{while the}} actual {{actuation}} is via a motor, even for manual focus. The front element does not rotate, allowing the consistent use of polarized filters. The 46mm thread lets a Micro Four Thirds user share filters between it, the Panasonic 14mm, Panasonic Leica 25mm, and Panasonic Leica 45mm lenses.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{features}} a weather resistant plastic exterior with a matte black finish. The lens {{is currently the}} only Sony E-mount lens to feature an external <b>focusing</b> <b>ring,</b> which can be pulled up or down relative to the lens body to switch quickly between manual and autofocus. On {{the side of the}} lens are a pair of external switches controlling the lens' focusing range and image stabilization.|$|E
50|$|The HDR-FX1 {{includes}} three 1/3-inch 16:9 1.12 Megapixel gross CCDs. Each CCD measures 960 x 1080 pixels. It includes a 12x optical Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens, a 3.5-inch LCD screen, a zoom <b>ring,</b> <b>focus</b> <b>ring,</b> and an iris / aperture ring.|$|R
5000|$|AF-N â€” Indicates the [...] "New" [...] {{version of}} an AF lens. The change from plastic <b>focus</b> <b>rings</b> on early AF lenses to the a new [...] "rubber inset focus ring" [...] (RIFR) is often {{indicated}} by the AF-N designation. Introduced in 1990.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{features}} a solid aluminum {{body with a}} detachable cinema-style lens hood. The lens showcases a minimalist black exterior with an aperture de-click ring, aperture <b>ring,</b> and <b>focus</b> <b>ring.</b> Despite being a manual focus lens, the lens transmits full EXIF data to the camera body.|$|R
