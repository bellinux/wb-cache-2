Our aim with the dissertation was to test if such a linkage could be proven in Swedish MNCs. Also, indications spoke for ethnocentric tendencies in MNCs.

By a survey we concluded that there was not full consistency in the companies’ answers regarding which strategy and staffing policy they belonged to.

Specifically, we look at the monitoring, bonding, maladaptation, and bargaining costs of conducting activities in specific subsidiaries in a foreign country. We hypothesize that the transaction costs of using expatriates are lower than those generated by local employees, especially in the higher managerial echelons of foreign subsidiaries, but also that costs can be reduced as individuals become more experienced. We also conjecture that ex post transaction costs are influenced by cultural differences between the host and the home countries, and by characteristics of the companies and their subsidiaries. The framework is empirically corroborated by survey data on a sample of 145 Norwegian MNCs. <b>Human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>Staffing</b> decisions Multinational firms Transaction costs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Road traffic {{injuries}} {{are a major}} public health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Post-crash management can {{play a significant role}} in minimizing crash consequences and saving lives. Iran has one of the highest mortality rates from road traffic injuries in the world. The present study attempts to fill the knowledge gap and explores stakeholders' perceptions of barriers to – and facilitators of – effective post-crash management in Iranian regions. Methods Thirty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with medical services personnel, police officers, members of Red Crescent, firefighters, public-health professionals, road administrators; some road users and traffic injury victims. A qualitative approach using grounded theory method was employed to analyze the material gathered. Results The core variable was identified as "poor quality of post crash management". Barriers to effective post-crash management were identified as: involvement of laypeople; lack of coordination; inadequate pre-hospital services; shortcomings in infrastructure. Suggestions for laypeople included: 1) a public education campaign in first aid, the role of the emergency services, cooperation of the public at the crash site, and 2) target-group training for professional drivers, police officers and volunteers involved at the crash scene. An integrated trauma system and infrastructure improvement also is crucial to be considered for effective post-crash management. Conclusion To sum up, it seems that the involvement of laypeople could be a key factor in making post-crash management more effective. But system improvements are also crucial, including the integration of the trauma system and its development in terms of <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> (<b>staffing</b> and training) and physical resources as well as the infrastructure development. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what resources are available to general music teachers in distant and remote rural classrooms in Michigan. The areas of resources that were surveyed in this study included <b>Human</b> <b>Resources</b> (<b>staffing,</b> professional development), Contextual Resources (scheduling, facilities) and Instructional Resources (materials and equipment, curriculum), based on the National Association for Music Educators’ (NAfME) Opportunity-to-Learn Standards. Other data was gathered from teachers through open-ended questions that allowed teachers to describe the benefits, challenges, and greatest professional needs they experienced while teaching in a rural community. Specific research questions included: (a) What resources are available to teach elementary general music in rural public schools in the six areas of staffing and professional development; scheduling and facilities; and curriculum and materials and equipment? (b) How do the reported resources reflect the recommendations in the Opportunity-to-Learn Standards? The participants were public school elementary general music teachers who work in distant and remote rural locations in the state of Michigan. They were selected through a random sample of the schools listed on the Michigan Department of Education website in the distant and remote rural school categories. Participants were invited to complete an online survey that asked them to self-evaluate the quantity and quality of Human, Contextual and Instructional Resources at their school. Results from the survey were analyzed by category and revealed that while the data from this survey showed that more resources existed in rural schools than might be expected based on prior research, the types of resources (staffing, professional development, scheduling, facilities, materials and equipment, and curriculum) were available to varying degrees between schools. Music teachers in rural areas in Michigan reported little to no music-specific professional development offered by their school districts. While most school districts do not offer professional development specific to music education, teachers in rural schools feel isolated from the music education community because of the lack of music professional development. They also reported lacking music technology that their students could use to reinforce music concepts or that enable students to create and perform music. Finally, music teachers reported that old materials and equipment, and outdated curriculum were losing their value as resources, and that they had no budget to replace those resources. However, music teachers in rural areas also reported having abundant resources in their communities. The ability to know the students, their families, and the community members was reported as a valuable human resource and it ties in to the values of place-based theory—the theory that teachers thrive in communities that they connect with, and that their music programs thrive as well. While music teachers in all geographical locations lack various resources, it is important that we continue to study rural music education to continue to understand the challenges that arise from the lack of resources...|$|E
