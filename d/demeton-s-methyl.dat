The insecticides were applied at the complete-anthesis and milk stages (at 500 1 /ha) with a knapsack sprayer. On the basis of effectiveness of head bug control, grain yield and 1000 -grain mass, carbaryl (at 500 g a. i. /ha) was the most effective insecticide followed by fenvalerate (at 50 g a. i. /ha), and chlorpyrifos (at 250 g a. i. /ha).

40|$|ABSTRACT Six men {{packaging}} <b>demeton-S-methyl</b> concentrate developed organophosphorous poisoning. An {{account of}} {{the circumstances of the}} occurrence is given, together with the results of an investigation into the incidents. The clinical cases are described in outline and individual response to absorption of the pesticide considered. Some relevant issues on the use of protective clothing when working with organophosphorous compounds are discussed. <b>Demeton-S-methyl</b> is an organophosphorous com-pound that has been used commercially as a pesti-cide for well over 20 years. The pesticide is manu-factured in Britain but, as in this case, some is pro-duced abroad and imported in bulk. Despite its low volatility (boiling point 89 °C) it has a nauseating smell. It is used as a pesticide treatment for crops and is produced dissolved in xylene as a concentrate. The concentrate referred to in this paper contained 500 g of <b>demeton-S-methyl</b> per litre. Before appli-cation to the crop this would be diluted some one hundred to a thousand times with water. Circumstances of incident A chemical packaging company contracted to pack a bulk load of <b>demeton-S-methyl</b> concentrate into one-litre containers. The work was carried out using a weight-triggered bottle-filling machine, one worker filling the cans while a second fitted a seal and top (workers A and B). Further workers then labelled and packed the cans. Workers A and B rotated jobs, and the operation was carried out in an open yard. Gloves, overalls, and boots were worn, but there was frequent spillage and items of normal clothing had been left under the filling apparatus, giving ample opportunity for contamination of after-work garments. The operation took one full working day plus a few hours of the next morning. Worker A was admitted to hospital with organophosphorous poisoning in the evening of th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The 96 -h toxieity of four {{organophosphates}} (thio-meton, disulfoton, malathion, and <b>demeton-S-methyl,</b> the oxy-gen analogue of thiometon) in the freshwater bivalve molluse Dreissena polymorpha {{was tested}} using different nominal con-centrations ranging between 6 and 50 mglL. No mortalities were observed in musseis exposed to malathion and <b>demeton-S-methyl</b> (26 mglL and 6 mglL, respectively), and at the lowest eoncentrations of thiometon and disulfoton (6 and 10 mglL, respectively). At higher thiometon and disulfoton concentra-tions, mortalities occurred. At the highest concentrations of 50 mg thiometonIL and 30 mg disulfotonIL, mussei mortalities of 88 and 93 %, respectively, were determined. Organophosphate concentrations of up to a factor 10 times {{higher than in the}} ambient water were found in exposed musseis, irrespective of whether they were alive or dead. The search for organophos-phate metabolites via GCIMS analysis of mussei tissue extraets was negative, suggesting lacking or low oxidative activation of the insecticides used. The mollusc is highly resistant to toxie effects of organophosphate insectieides and their biologieal aetive oxygen analogues. On November 1, 1986, a pestieide storing facility at Sandoz in Basel (Switzerland) caught fire. In order to extinguish the fire, water was pumped at high volurnes from the nearby river Rhine. This water found its way back into the river Rhine due to overflowing sewage canals (Capel et al. 1988; Güttinger and Stumm 1992). Along with the fire-extinguishing water, pesticides stored in the affeeted facility were swept into the river. Among these pesticides were organophosphate insecti-eides, mainly thiometon and disulfoton, mereurial-based fungi-eides, and herbicides. Consequently, the river Rhine ecosyste...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{acetylcholinesterase}} (AChE) was {{extracted from}} two field-collected populations of Oxya chinensis (Xinxiang City, Henan Province and Changzhi City, Shanxi Province). AChE activities were decreased when concentrations of ATC increased, showing a characteristic phenomenon of substrate inhibition at high concentration in both populations. Such inhibition occurred at relatively low concentration for AChE from Xinxiang population but relatively high for AChE from Changzhi population. The kinetic {{study showed that}} {{there were no significant differences}} between the two populations in the Km values. The Km value in Changzhi population was only 1. 09 -fold higher than that in Xinxiang population. However, significant differences were observed between the two populations in Vmax values. The Vmax value in Changzhi population was 1. 32 -fold higher than that in Xinxiang population. The inhibition study in vitro showed that the AChE from both populations exhibited similar rank order in sensitivity to inhibition by three OPs, as determined by comparison of their bimolecular rate constants (ki), from the most potent inhibition to the least was chlopyrifos-oxon> paraoxon>demeton-s-methyl for AChE from the two populations and that the ki values in Xinxiang population were lower than those in Changzhi population.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of pesticides {{has resulted in a}} corresponding increase in concern for the effect they may have on the health of humans and other non-target organisms. The two main areas of concern are the toxicological effects that mixtures of pesticides may have as well as the endocrine disrupting effects. Although the individual pesticides may be present at concentrations below the levels deemed to be detrimental to health, {{it has been argued that}} their combined effect may still result in elevated health risks. Another important aspect of pesticide risk assessment requires a consideration of the breakdown products of pesticides and their effect on human health. There has been very little research into the effects of degradation products and this issue should be addressed as these could potentially pose a higher risk than their parent compounds. One of the most important bio-markers available for use is the ubiquitous enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This enzyme is responsible for one of the most important functions in the body; namely nerve impulse transmission, upon which all life depends. The inhibition of this enzyme indicates toxicity and as a subsequence, a threat to the organism’s well-being. Bioassays have also recently been developed to test chemicals for endocrine disrupting effects. These tests rely on a dose response equivalent to that of the most potent well known estrogen 17 -β estradiol. Any chemical that has a measurable response is deemed to display endocrine disrupting effects. This first aim of this study was to investigate the toxicological and endocrine disrupting effects of three organophosphorus pesticides; aldicarb, parathion and <b>demeton-S-methyl,</b> in addition to two breakdown products; aminophenol and p-nitrophenol. Two carbamate pesticides; carbaryl and carbofuran were also analysed. The toxicological effects of mixtures of the parent pesticide compounds were tested to assess if any antagonistic, additive or synergistic effects were observed. This data was then used in conjunction with an artificial neural network to assess if individual pesticides could be distinguished from mixtures of pesticides. A final objective was to sample various Eastern Cape water sources, utilising the enzymatic assay to determine the presence of any of these pesticides in these samples. There were several conclusions drawn from this study. AChE was successfully used as an assay to test the toxicity of the pesticides under investigation, based on their inhibition of this enzyme. An important factor for consideration throughout the study was the need to establish basal and monitor AChE activity (i. e. the need to monitor AChE activity in the absence of any pesticide). This ensured accurate comparison of the results obtained. It was found that <b>demeton-S-methyl</b> was the most potent of these pesticides followed by carbaryl, parathion, aldicarb and finally carbofuran, and that carbofuran could potentiate AChE. The results indicated that pesticide mixtures generally exhibited an additive inhibitory effect on AChE, although at some concentrations of pesticides, synergistic and antagonistic effects were noted. From the data using mixtures of pesticides, a feed forward neural network was created that was successfully able to distinguish individual pesticides from mixtures within its training parameters. None of the pesticides tested displayed endocrine disrupting properties in the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES), T 47 D-KBluc and MDA-kb 2 bio-assays. Other studies reported mixed results in this regard and thus no final conclusions could be drawn. The Blaauwkrantz River, Kariega River, Sundays River, Swartkops River and Kowie River were all tested for pesticides and although positive results were recorded, conventional methods indicated that there were no pesticides in the rivers. There were, however, trace metals present which are known to inhibit AChE, thus causing a false positive result. These results indicated that AChE can be used as a high throughput initial pre-screening tool, but that it cannot serve as a substitute for more accurate conventional testing methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum head bug, Calocoris angustatus Leth. (Hemiptera: Miridae) {{is a major}} pest {{of grain}} sorghum in India. Studies were {{conducted}} to estimate economic injury levels (EILs) for the sorghum head bug on resistant (IS 17610 and IS 21443), a moderately susceptible (IS 9692) and a commercial cultivar (CSH 11) using different protection levels at the half-anthesis, complete-anthesis, milk and dough stages of panicle development. Data were recorded on bug numbers and grain yield. Two to four sprays of <b>demeton-S-methyl</b> (Metasystox) controlled the bugs on CSH 11 and IS 9692, whereas one spray was sufficient on IS 17610 and IS 21443. Maximum grain yield was obtained with four insecticide sprays on CSH 11 and IS 9692, whereas one and two sprays resulted in maximum yield on IS 17610 and IS 21443, respectively. Avoidable losses were greatest in IS 9692 (66 %), followed by CSH 11 (38. 4 and 55. 7 % during 1988 and 1989, respectively), IS 21443 (29. 1 %), and IS 17610 (8. 2 %). Cost: benefit ratios were > 1 : 3. 4 with four insecticide sprays on CSH 11, IS 9692 and IS 21443; however, it was not economical to spray insecticides on the bug-resistant cultivar, IS 17610. Economic injury levels wer[URL] 0. 2 – 0. 9 bugs per panicle for CSH 11 at the half-anthesis and complete-anthesis stages, respectively, compared with 0. 8 – 4. 2 bugs for IS 9692, 10 – 50 bugs for IS 17610 and 0. 5 – 1. 3 bugs for IS 21443.

40|$|Organophosphates and carbamates are potent inhibitors of the {{neurotransmitter}} acetylcholinesterase. This inhibition {{results in}} the blocking of nerve signal transference into the post synaptic neuron leading to loss of muscle action and death. Because of the universal mechanisms of signal transduction in animals, these inhibitors {{have been widely used}} as agricultural pesticides as well as chemical warfare agents (nerve agents). Health issues associated with pesticide usage result from the fact that both the pesticides and their breakdown products often end up in water and food sources {{as well as in the}} soil. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of studies aimed at the detection of these pesticides in the environment. One popular research area is enzyme based biosensor construction. Some important criteria for consideration during the construction of biosensors are the importance of a suitable solid support as well as the enzyme immobilisation method. Recently, there has been increased interest in using nano-scale material e. g. using nanoparticles as enzyme support material. This is largely due to their advantages such as large surface area to volume ratio as well as reduced mass transfer resistance. Electrospinning is a straight forward and cost effective method for producing nanofibres from any soluble polymer(s). The applications of electrospun nanofibres have been reported in clinical studies, biofuel production as well as bioremediation. In this study two polymers were selected: nylon for its mechanical stability and chitosan for its biocompatibility and hydrophilicity, for the fabrication of electrospun nanofibres which would function as immobilisation support material for acetylcholinesterase. The first objective of this study was to electrospin nanofibres from a nylon- 6 and chitosan blend solution. A binary solvent system consisting of formic acid and acetic acid (50 : 50) successfully dissolved and blended the polymers which were subsequently electrospun. Scanning electron microscopy characterisation of the nanofibres showed that (i) a nylon- 6 : chitosan ratio of 16 %: 3 % resulted in the formation of bead free nanofibres and (ii) the fibres were collected in non-woven mats characterised by different size nanofibres with average diameters of 250 nm for the main fibres and 40 nm for the smaller nanofibres. Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) analysis of the nanofibres indicated that a new product had been formed during the blending of the two polymers. The second aim of the study was to carry out a facile immobilisation of electric eel acetylcholinesterase via glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linking. Glutaraldehyde solution 5 % (v/v) resulted in the immobilisation of 0. 334 mg/cm² of acetylcholinesterase onto the nanofibres. The immobilisation procedure was optimised with reference to acetylcholinestease and crosslinker concentrations, incubation time and the cross-linking method. A comparative investigation into the optimum pH and temperature conditions, pH and thermal stabilities, substrate and inhibition kinetics was then carried out on free and immobilised acetylcholinesterase. The final objective of this study was to determine the storage stabilities of the immobilised and free enzymes as well as the reusability characteristics of the immobilised acetylcholinesterase. Several conclusions were drawn from this study. Acetylcholinesterase was successfully immobilised onto the surface of nylon- 6 :chitosan nanofibres with retention of its activity. There was a shift in the pH optimum of the immobilised acetylcholineseterase by 0. 5 units towards a neutral pH. Although both free and immobilised acetylcholinesterase exhibited the same optimum temperature, immobilised acetylcholinesterase showed enhanced thermal stability. In terms of pH stability, immobilised acetylcholinesterase showed greater stability at acidic pH whilst free acetylcholinesterase was more stable under alkaline pH conditions. Relative to free acetylcholinesterase, the immobilised enzyme showed considerable storage stability retaining ~ 50 % of its activity when stored for 49 days at 4 °C. Immobilised acetylcholinesterase also retained > 20 % of its initial activity after 9 consecutive reuse cycles. When exposed to fixed concentrations of carbofuran or <b>demeton-S-methyl</b> sulfone, immobilised acetylcholinesterase showed similar inhibition characteristics to that of the free enzyme. The decrease in enzyme activity observed after immobilisation to the nanofibres may have been due to several reasons which include some enzyme molecules being immobilised in structural conformations which reduced substrate access to the catalytic site, participation of the catalytic residues in immobilisation and enzyme denaturation due to the reaction conditions used for acetylcholinesterase immobilisation. Similar observations have been widely reported in literature and this is one of the major drawbacks of enzyme immobilisation. In conclusion, nylon- 6 :chitosan electrospun nanofibres were shown to be suitable supports for facile acetylcholinesterase immobilisation and the immobilised enzyme has potential for use in pesticide detection. Future recommendations for this study include a comparative study of the GA cross-linking method for AChE immobilisation which will lead to more intensely bound enzyme molecules to prevent non-specific binding. An investigation into the effect of inhibitors on stored immobilised AChE, as well as reactivation and reuse studies, may also be useful for determining the cost-effectiveness of reusing immobilised AChE for pesticide detection in environmental water samples. Several models have been designed for the determination of the kinetic parameters for immobilised enzymes. These take into account the mass transfer resistance as well as the overall charge of the immobilisation matrix. The use of these models to analyse experimental data will give a clear understanding of the effects of immobilisation on enzyme activit...|$|E
