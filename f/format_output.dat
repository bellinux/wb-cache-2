For the vortex-separated flow, the calculation is based on the method of suction analogy. The effect of vortex breakdown is accounted for by an empirical method.

50|$|Comparisons between FOCAL and BASIC were {{inevitable}} {{since both}} languages were common on smallish computers {{of the same}} era. FOCAL lacked inherent support for strings as data elements which could be assigned to variables. This is generally {{thought to be a}} serious deficiency as compared to the string capabilities in most BASICs. This deficiency, while serious, was not as utterly crippling as it might sound. A surprising amount of string usage in FOCAL programs is devoted to <b>formatting</b> user <b>output.</b> Since FOCAL output was character-stream-oriented, outputting two strings sequentially could sometimes substitute for concatenating them, and procedural tools could be written for performing complex <b>formatted</b> <b>output.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{process model}} is being {{developed}} for a mountain region of North Wales which regularly experiences destructive flood events. SAGA-GIS plays {{a central role in}} this model. A 50 m gridded digital elevation model is loaded into SAGA, and the Kirkby wetness index calculated. Geology and land use maps have been prepared using Mapmaker software, then transferred to SAGA in Arc View shape file <b>format.</b> <b>Output</b> from SAGA is transferred in Arc Info grid format to a hillslope modelling program. By combining wetness index with geology/land use, a grid of hydrologically similar soil zones has been generated using the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology HOST classification scheme. Infiltration and run-off parameters can then be assigned from field evidence...|$|E
40|$|Summary: High-throughput {{sequencing}} currently {{generates a}} wealth of small RNA (sRNA) data, making data mining a topical issue. Processing of these large data sets is inherently multidimensional as length, abundance, sequence composition, and genomic location all hold clues to sRNA function. Analysis can be challenging because the formulation and testing of complex hypotheses requires combined use of visualization, annotation and abundance profiling. To allow flexible generation and querying of these disparate types of information, we have developed the shortran pipeline for analysis of plant or animal short RNA sequencing data. It comprises nine modules and produces both graphical and MySQL <b>format</b> <b>output.</b> Availability: shortran is freely available and can be downloaded fro...|$|E
30|$|The DataTank uses {{a simple}} model {{based on a}} single table, similar to a CSV file or a {{database}} table. For most published datasets, this model is sufficient and generally preferred, {{as it can be}} well understood by users wanting to publish data in various formats. Data that would not fit in a table model (such as a nested JSON format, where the data has a tree-form) should be avoided. The DataTank has supports various formats: CSV, ESRI Shape file, XML, JSON, MySQL, RDF, XLS, … Additional formats can be supported by coding a transformer to/from the desired <b>format.</b> <b>Output</b> formats focus on web applications: CSV, (Geo)JSON, XML, maps, PHP, WKT… The published datasets are also available as a DCAT stream, as described above, which can be ingested by other tools.|$|E
