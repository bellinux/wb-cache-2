5|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013. It was <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> an episodic format in mind, for reasons both {{financial}} and creative. The developers conducted field {{research on the}} setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles.|$|E

These disagreements, in part, led to an incident in a Louisville, Kentucky hotel dining room between Stivetts and McCarthy.

Low-sulfur coal was once mined at three locations within the Pine Creek watershed, {{and there is a}} coal deposit between the headwaters of Upper Pine Bottom and Lower Pine Bottom Runs. Below this is the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is <b>formed</b> <b>with</b> grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate.|$|E

By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier.
