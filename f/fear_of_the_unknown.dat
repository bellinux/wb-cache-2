25|$|Central to the goddess's visual {{identification}} is the makara, {{which is also}} her vahana, or mount. An ancient symbol in India, it pre-dates all appearances of the goddess Ganga in art. The makara has a dual symbolism. On the one hand, it represents the life-affirming waters and plants of its environment; on the other, it represents fear, both <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown</b> it elicits by lurking in those waters and real fear it instils by appearing in sight. The earliest extant unambiguous pairing of the makara with Ganga is at Udayagiri Caves in Central India (circa 400 CE). Here, in Cave V, flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and Yamuna appear atop their respective mounts, makara and kurma (a turtle or tortoise).|$|E

500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated {{as if they were the}} same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions.

40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This meta-synthesis {{aimed to}} {{identify}} key elements contributing to FOC derived from women's own reports. BACKGROUND: <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> childbirth (FOC) encompasses fear or anxiety about giving birth, which can resemble a phobic response. FOC holds implications for women's antenatal and postnatal wellbeing, and decisions {{made about the}} birth but a clear definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construct does not exist. METHOD: A meta-synthesis was conducted by searching databases (Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, EBSCO, Medline, PsychInfo, and PsychArticles) for qualitative studies describing women's perspectives with respect to fear, anxiety, concerns, phobia or stress about birth. A total of 25 papers, reporting findings from 24 studies, fulfilled eligibility criteria and {{were included in the}} synthesis. RESULTS: Six key elements of FOC were identified; <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown,</b> potential for injury, pain, capacity to give birth, losing control, and adequacy of support from care providers. A single overarching theme linking all elements was 'the unpredictability of childbirth'. Three moderators of FOC were also identified; awareness of negative birthing experiences, information received about birth, and support received from care providers. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> uncertainty in <b>the</b> birthing process as an overarching theme underpinning women's <b>fears.</b> Enhancing tolerance <b>of</b> uncertainty may be a way to reduce women's FOC. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements and moderators of FOC provide an insight into the potential mechanisms that contribute to women's fears, which can be used to inform methods of identifying women with FOC or a basis upon which to base supportive strategies to reduce women's fears for giving birth.

This thesis takes <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States' oldest subway system-Boston's T-and explores how and why its spaces and regulations over their appropriate use have changed over time in response to public perceptions, political battles, and broader social forces. I use data collected from historical newspaper archives, published reports, and official agency records to detail how the city's subway authorities-first the Boston Elevated Railway Company, then the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), and presently the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) -have sought to manage and shape these unique underground spaces and simultaneously maintain an image of order and control within them. My research reveals and more closely examines three major factors that have influenced the changing controls over subway space usage in Boston: (1) the highly specific design constraints and unique physical aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's subway spaces; (2) evolving values and ideologies embedded within the transit agencies that are continuously seeking to promote a positive image of themselves; and (3) persisting public perceptions of subway spaces, many of which revolve around historical <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown</b> and unfamiliar. By highlighting these complex hidden processes at work within Boston's underground realm, this thesis promotes a careful reexamination of a heavily used yet underappreciated urban space for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> better understanding our experiences with and connections to the city. by Holly Bellocchio Durso.

2500|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown</b> or irrational fear {{is caused}} by {{negative}} thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear like any other fears share common neural pathway that engages to mobilize bodily resources {{in the face of}} threat. Many people are scared of the [...] "unknown". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years, or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use False Evidence Appearing Real as a definition. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. E.g. Continuation of scholarly education, most educators perceive this as a risk that may cause them fear and stress and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research, this can lead to habits such as laziness and procrastination. The ambiguity of a situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety, other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly. E.g. War-ridden or Conflict places, Terrorism, Abuse ...etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate children's psyche development or personality. E.g. Parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment that it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required. Developing [...] a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.|$|E

The investigator identified {{the need for}} a fear alleviation program to reduce this apprehension and prevent trauma to the children. During medical check-ups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child Health and Disability Prevention Program, the investigator observed and documented that many children were nervous, and some actually visibly fearful. Therefore, this fear alleviation project was researched and designed and implemented to meet this need. It was found by informing the children about the procedures in each stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical check-up, allowing the children to express their feelings, and providing an opportunity to master the procedures they would encounter, led to less apprehension. Truthfully and factually informing the children about the check-up banished their <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown</b> and encouraged trust between the children and staff. Allowing the children to role-play the exam also helped them understand the procedures and thereby gain mastery over the situation. To implement these fear alleviation methods, an educational program was developed. The program included a slide tape program depicting models experiencing a check-up. The slide show informed the children about the check-up and also provided modeling of fearless behavior. Next, a medical play session was introduced allowing the children to handle and use medical instruments from the check-up, gain mastery by acting out the procedures, and express their feelings. A research questionnaire was formulated and chi-square analysis and t-test were used to measure <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program with regard to comparing results generated by a control and experimental group. The results were evaluated to determine if there were significant differences between the control and experimental group and if the program met its objectives. The program was basically found to be effective in reducing children's <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> check-up. This program could effectively be used by the CHDP medical staff to prepare children before their clinic visit. The fear alleviation methods incorporated here could be utilized by medical staffs to prepare children for out-patient clinic visits or any medical treatments.
