30|$|To analyze non-hierarchically {{structured}} data, cross-classified multilevel {{regression analyses}} are appropriate (Snijders and Bosker, 1999). We used Iterative Generalized Least Squares (IGLS) estimation techniques from {{the statistical analysis}} program MLwiN to estimate models (Browne, 2003). Although originally designed to fit hierarchical models, IGLS can also be adapted to non-hierarchical data structures. IGLS {{is based on an}} iterative procedure which provides point estimates for all parameters, including their standard deviations. We make use of a <b>double</b> <b>comparative</b> design (cf. Van Tubergen, 2006; Levels et al., 2008), that models variance between origin countries and variance between destination countries simultaneously. This is necessary in order to disentangle the various macro-level effects. An additional advantage of this <b>double</b> <b>comparative</b> multilevel approach is that the variation of (unmeasured) factors, unique to each destination or origin country, are captured by the random intercept at the origin and destination levels and thus does not cause much bias in the parameters of the measured variables.|$|E

30|$|As a {{consequence}} of the <b>double</b> <b>comparative</b> design, native pupils cannot be included in our analysis, since for native pupils the origin country equals the destination country. However, in order to account for the fact that in some destination countries the average performance of all pupils is higher than in others (as an indicator of the general quality of schooling), the average science performance of natives per destination country is added as a variable to the analysis. This approach has been suggested by van Tubergen (2006) and was adopted by Levels et al. (2008). We apply this approach because in this analysis {{we do not want to}} explain differences in average performances of pupils (both natives and migrant) in different countries, but we focus on the differences in the performance of migrant pupils in these countriesj.|$|E

Both the ‘Original' and the ‘Optimized' procedure alternatives were {{the subject of a}} <b>double</b> <b>comparative</b> risk assessment using two different methods, namely, Bayesian Belief Networks using the HUGIN programme and Integrated Dynamic Decision Analysis (IDDA) using the SPACCO programme.

In addition, the adoption of the methods has shown a reduction of the overall failure probabilities considering the ‘Original' and ‘Optimized' procedural alternatives respectively. The results of the comparative cost effectiveness analysis between both alternatives suggest that the initial investment on developing and optimizing the procedure is easily compensated by direct savings in implementation costs, {{as well as by the}} further savings in delay risks, occupational safety risks and process safety risks.

In this work, I realized a preliminary analysis of the A-CDM implementation in the Barcelona - El Prat airport, using real traffic/operative data kindly offered by Aena (Week 14, 2015). To obtain a quantitative parameterization for this project, I performed an analysis based on the actual capacity of the airport, which {{is a function of}} the structure of the airside area, the number of aircrafts operating in the airport and their characteristics. The architecture of the active runways defines a result of 90 operations per hour. Moreover, based on the CDM analysis, I created useful parameters the values and characteristics of which can be used for the A-CDM to understand, quantify and evaluate and the implementation and the benefits of the new system. I quantified the benefits with a <b>double</b> <b>comparative</b> analysis: (i) an analysis based on the global traffic of the airport and (ii) based on timely flights with similar characteristics.

Finally, I estimated the emissions of the traffic and the environmental impact of the A-CDM implementation with a comparative analysis of the week 24 (2014 against 2015), adjusting for the delay due to the airport CDM restrictions.

40|$|Fear pervades {{popular culture}} and the news media. Whether used as a noun, verb, adverb, or adjective, an ongoing study finds that the word “fear” pervades news reports across all {{sections}} of newspapers, and is shown to move or “travel ” from one topic to another. The use of fear and the thematic emphases spawned by entertainment formats are consistent with a “discourse of fear, ” or the pervasive communication, symbolic awareness and expectation that danger and risk are a central feature of the effective environment. A qualitative content analysis of a decade of news coverage in The Arizona Republic and several other major American news media (e. g., the Los Angeles limes, and ABC News) reveals that the word “fear ” appears more often than it did several years ago, particularly in headlines, where its use has more than <b>doubled.</b> <b>Comparative</b> materials obtained through the Lexis/Nexis information base also reveals that certain themes {{are associated with a}} shifting focus of fear over the years (e. g., violence, drugs, AIDS), with the most recent increases associated with reports about children.

40|$|This {{case study}} is based on audio {{recordings}} of the inaugural address of President Trump and on three simultaneously interpreted versions into Spanish. The Aristotelian concept of « ethos » is used to investigate the image the speaker builds of himself in his speech. Although Aristotle condemned {{the use of this}} non-rational means to persuade the audience, he nevertheless acknowledged its rhetorical efficiency. The analysis further takes into account the appeal to emotions (pathos) and the use of arguments (logos). It also examines how these three pisteis interact with various stylistic features to enhance persuasion. In addition, some theoretical insights from Amossy’s integrated approach (2010) are also used to describe the speaker’s identity construction. Next, the interpreted versions are examined in a descriptive and a <b>double</b> <b>comparative</b> approach. The qualitative analysis reveals that Trump’s retorical strategies are faithfully rendered by the interpreters and that the three versions present minor differences with the source text and among them. We can conclude from the corpus analysis that the three interpreters successfully re-presented the president’s ethos and that interpreting « Trumpese » was in this case not as challenging as it can be in impromptu speech (see interview with interpreter Tsuruta in The Japan Times, 15 / 02 / 2017). Against this background, this article suggests that the president’s rhetorical strategies and their renditions for foreign audiences should be further investigated across different speech genres.

40|$|Since {{the recent}} decades laser pulses {{have been used}} for micro {{material}} processing. Two regions of energy density have to be distinguished: the one where ablation of the material takes place and the resulting morphology can be observed by direct imaging techniques, and the other one where the fluence domain is characterized by physicochemical modifications of the substrate surface in the condensed state. The aim of this work was the documentation and analysis of the laser-material interaction in respect to resulting physicochemical processes. Methodologically, a <b>double</b> <b>comparative</b> approach is used: between two different pulse durations and between different chemical compositions. Nanosecond pulses in the ultraviolet wavelength range (t  =  10  ns, l  =  266  nm) and femtosecond pulses in the infrared region (t  =  130  fs, l  =  800  nm) were employed. These varying parameters lead to completely different results, common to all the treated materials. A high-tech glass (barium-alumo-borosilicate glass) and three non-oxide ceramics (aluminium nitride, silicon carbide and a composite of SiC-TiC-TiB 2) were used. All of them were not yet systematically investigated in respect to laser micro material processing. Only rare literature data exist for the electrical insulator AlN and the direct semiconductor SiC. The composite compound SiC-TiC-TiB 2 was developed and used for tribological applications. The laser treatments were undertaken with direct focussing at air. Surface analytical techniques - such as XPS, Nanoindenter, ESR, µ-Raman, EDX, XRD - were used to identify the chemical changes between untreated and laser-treated areas. Single-pulse irradiation led to material modifications in the condensed state in most instances. Only in a few cases, bubble formation could be detected, too. Multi-pulse results differed depending on the pulse duration. In the nanosecond case, melting of the surface and redeposited material - so called debris - were observed. With femtosecond pulses instead, only negligible melting and few debris could be detected. Additionally, periodic structures appeared - so called ripples. Laser treatment of binary work pieces exhibited preferential ablation of the lighter component. Crystal structure changes, metallization or oxidation processes of the irradiated surface as a consequence of laser-induced melting and resolidification could be observed. It was shown that for the ablation of inorganic chemical compounds, the pulse duration of the laser radiation had an influence on the physicochemical modification of the materials. The application of pulses with a duration less than a picosecond resulted in morphological and chemical changes of the treated area in a thickness range of several hundreds of nanometres. The nanosecond laser treatment instead yielded a bigger conversion layer of about one order of magnitude compared to the fs case. Technical consequences were discussed...|$|E

In order to further define the role of hDaxx and PML for HCMV replication, we generated either primary human fibroblasts with a stable, individual knockdown of PML or hDaxx (PML-kd and hDaxx-kd, respectively) or cells exhibiting a <b>double</b> knockdown. <b>Comparative</b> analysis of HCMV replication in PML-kd or hDaxx-kd cells revealed that immediate-early (IE) gene expression increased to a similar extent, regardless of which ND 10 constituent was depleted. Since a loss of PML, the defining component of ND 10, results in a dispersal of the entire nuclear substructure, the increased replication efficacy of HCMV in PML-kd cells could be a consequence of the dissociation of the repressor protein hDaxx from its optimal subnuclear localization. However, experiments using three different recombinant HCMVs revealed a differential growth complementation in PML-kd versus hDaxx-kd cells, strongly arguing for an independent involvement in suppressing HCMV replication. Furthermore, infection experiments using double-knockdown cells devoid of both PML and hDaxx illustrated an additional enhancement in the replication efficacy of HCMV compared to the single-knockdown cells. Taken together, our data indicate that both proteins, PML and hDaxx, mediate an intrinsic immune response against HCMV infection by contributing independently to the silencing of HCMV IE gene expression...|$|R

Every parturient was allowed to draw one card and grouped accordingly. Group A: Inj. Ondansetron (8 mg), Group B: Oral alprazolum (0. 25 mg) +inj. ondansetron (8 mg). After 20 minutes of pre-hydration under all aseptic precaution lumber puncture was performed with 25 gauge Quincke’s needle in the L 3 -L 4 or L 4 -L 5 space in sitting position and 0. 5 % Hyperbaric Bupivacaine 2. 5 ml (12. 5 mg.) was injected within 10 - 12 sec. Immediately after administration of spinal anaesthesia fetal heart rate was noted for any changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, rate of respiration, discomfort and occurrence of side effects: shivering, nausea, vomiting was recorded every 2 minute for first 10 minutes, then at 10 minutes interval for remainder of the operation...|$|R
40|$|AE 50 mg/日経口 12 ～ 16 週投与の前立腺肥大症に対する臨床効果の検討をCMA (chlormadinone acetate) を対照薬とする二重盲検法にて行なった. 1) 投与後顕著な排尿障害の改善と軽度の肥大結節縮小効果がみられ,有効率は両群間に有意差はみられなかった. 2) 投与前,後の比較において,超音波計測による肥大結節の縮小と尿道レ線像による膀胱底挙上の改善において,CMA群がAE群に比べ有意に優れていたが,それ以外の項目についてはその改善度に両群間で有意差はみられなかった. 3) 副作用として,性欲・ポテンツの低下など軽度のものが少数例にみられたのみである. AE群の発現率はCMA群に比べ低率傾向を示し,特に性欲・ポテンツの低下の発現は有意に低率であった. 4) 前立腺肥大症保存的薬物療法としてAEにCMAと同等の有用性があることを確認したA <b>double</b> blind <b>comparative</b> {{clinical}} trial was performed with allylestrenol (AE) and chlormadinone acetate (CMA) {{to investigate the}} clinical efficacy of AE on prostatic hypertrophy. Both drugs were administered orally for 12 - 16 weeks in a daily dose of 50 mg. With both drugs marked improvement of disorders of micturition and a slight decrease {{in the size of}} the hypertrophied prostatic node were observed. No significant difference was observed between the two drugs in the overall efficacy of the treatments. Significant improvement of practically all parameters used for evaluation of results was observed with both drugs following treatment. Ultrasonotomographic examination revealed diminution of the size of the prostatic node and x-ray examination of the ureter showed improvement in elevation of the fundus of the bladder. These improvements were better after CMA treatment than after AE treatment. With all other parameters used no significant difference was observed between the two drugs. Mild adverse effects such as loss of sexual desire and potency were observed in a few cases. The incidence of side-effects was lower following AE treatment, and the incidence of loss of sexual desire and potency was significantly lower after AE than after CMA. Taking into consideration efficacy and safety of the treatments, no significant difference was observed in usefulness between the two drugs, and we were able to confirm the usefulness of AE for the conservative treatment of prostatic hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} examine its {{effectiveness}} and safety, tobramycin was studied in urinary tract infections by the <b>double</b> blind <b>comparative</b> method using gentamicin as the control drug. Tobramycin or gentamicin was administered to hospitalized adult patients with urinary tract infections (cystitis or pyelonephritis) at the dosage of 60 mg b. i. d. for five to seven days. The number of evaluable cases was 86 for tobramycin and 95 for gentamicin, and the results obtained were as follows. (1) No significant difference was observed between the tobramycin group and gentamicin group in various background factors related to the characteristics of patients. (2) There {{was no significant difference}} between the two groups in overall efficacy (tobramycin 69 %, gentamicin 69 %). (3) Analyses were made as to various clinical parameters. In overall analyses, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in the improvement rate of any parameters. In stratified analyses, tobramycin showed a significantly better rate of defervescence than gentamicin in patients with complicated pyelonephritis without an indwelling catheter. In the analysis of the distribution of body temperature, tobramycin showed a significantly better result than gentamicin on Day 3 in all patients, patients with complicated pyelonephritis and patients with an indwelling catheter. In urinary bacterial counts, gentamicin showed significantly better result than tobramycin on Day 6 in patients without an indwelling catheter. In urinary leukocyte counts, tobramycin showed a tendency for better results than gentamicin on Day 6 in patients with complicated pyelonephritis. (4) No difference was observed between the two groups in the incidence of reported adverse effects (tobramycin 18. 6 %, gentamicin 19. 4 %) ...|$|R
