A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E
5|$|The {{climb up}} or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground.

5|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of {{subsequent}} projects {{to consolidate the}} piers and arches of the Pont du Gard. It has survived three serious floods over the last century; in 1958 {{the whole of the}} lower tier was submerged by a giant flood that washed away other bridges, and in 1998 another major flood affected the area. A further flood struck in 2002, badly damaging nearby installations.|$|E
5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway. A Bronze Age ring and a late Bronze Age sherd were excavated nearby. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of Bronze Age finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E

5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of what must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing {{in mind that the}} management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for {{a large part of the}} day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.|$|E

At least 28 {{people were killed and}} as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 in the crowded Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near the waiting area next to the travel office. Initially, another blast was reported in the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The {{capacity}} {{has changed}} frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion. Since then, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing places went away in 1998–99 {{in response to}} UEFA regulations which forbids standing at matches in the UEFA competition), countered to some extent by expansions. The latest capacity is 81,044 spectators. A plan to add a retractable roof has been announced. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest of the average attendances of European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of {{documented}} {{cases in}} which a female shark {{who has not been}} in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis.

The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E

5|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of {{incidents}} {{in recent years}} where the river has been polluted and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while {{they were working on}} the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that {{this was not the first}} time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout.|$|E
5|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of {{proposals}} {{to extend the}} O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due {{to the absence of}} an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E

Two were planned in Finland, in Kemijärvi and Ylitornio, but neither projects were realized after their inception in 2007. In Norway, prior to the renovation of Vikersund, there were serious talks about constructing a new ski flying hill at Rødkleiva in Oslo.
