NYET {{indicates that a}} split transaction is not yet complete, while ERR handshake indicates that a split transaction failed. A second use for a NYET packet <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the host that the device has accepted a data packet, but cannot accept any more due to full buffers. This allows a host to switch to sending small PING tokens to inquire about the device's readiness, rather than sending an entire unwanted DATA packet just to elicit a NAK.|$|E

Concetta has asked Father Pirrone to tell her father that she is in love with Tancredi and that she believes her feelings to be returned. The Prince ponders his fondness for Concetta, which is based in her apparent submissiveness and placidity. However, he thinks that Tancredi's ambitions may require more money than Concetta will bring as her dowry. Keeping his thoughts to himself, the Prince decrees that Father Pirrone <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Concetta that the Prince will discuss it with her later.|$|E

A larger power station was established in 1923 at a site in Marius Street, East Tamworth due to the high demand of electricity and the main building was demolished in 1982.

Brian pressures him to tell her the truth, but all he manages to do <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Lois how fat she is. Brian insists that Peter must look out for his family's welfare. With the word [...] "welfare" [...] in his mind, Peter soon applies for a government assistance at a welfare office. But a processing error creates a weekly check for $150,000. Telling Lois he received a big raise, Peter spends his money on many foolish and extravagant things, such as renting the Statue of David, treating Meg to cosmetic surgery and even {{going so far as to}} surround his house with a moat to protect them from the Black Knight.|$|E

High expresses {{surprise}} in Gangleri's {{lack of knowledge about}} Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set [...] "right {{at the beginning of the}} gods' settlement, when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall" [...] about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figured out who was responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.|$|E

Former Simpsons director Brad Bird has described him as [...] "the unsung hero" [...] of the show, while Vitti has stated to [...] "leave out Sam Simon" [...] <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> [...] "the managed version" [...] of The Simpsons history, because [...] "he was the guy we wrote for." [...] Writer Ken Levine called Simon [...] "the real creative force behind The Simpsons...The tone, the storytelling, the level of humor – that was all developed on Sam's watch." [...] Levine says that Simon [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that his [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon crafted {{much of the world}} of Springfield and designed the models for many of the show's recurring characters, including Mr. Burns, Dr. Hibbert, Chief Wiggum and Eddie and Lou, as well as many of the one-time and guest star roles, such as Bleeding Gums Murphy. One of his contributions to the show's character development was his proposal that Waylon Smithers should be gay, but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it; Smithers' sexuality became one of the show's longest-running gags. [...] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you just listen to the sound track, it works." ...|$|E

He also reassured Clough's family that the film would be a more sympathetic portrayal of Clough than in the book.

Another executive of the OPA had recently been assigned armed guards after receiving threats against his children and, in Chicago, a man involved with black market meat had recently been murdered by decapitation. Police considered the possibility the Degnan killer was a meat packer.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Perkins {{told her}} agent, Debi Allen, {{about the idea}} and a meeting with a BBC comedy {{commissioner}} followed shortly after.
