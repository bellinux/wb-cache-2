2500|$|A {{particularly}} well-known {{example is}} Arthur Conan Doyle's fictionalization of the Danites in A Study in Scarlet, the first Sherlock Holmes novel, published in 1887. In the story, the Danites constitute a brutal group of enforcing vigilantes {{operating under the}} direction of Brigham Young—and more particularly the fictional Sacred Council of Four, silencing criticism and questioning, and preventing dissenters from leaving the Salt Lake Valley. Doyle's embellishment of the folklore surrounding the original Missouri band transplanted to a romantic wild west setting, the established criminal notoriety of Rockwell, and rumors of Young's Avenging Angels made acceptance of the [...] "authoritative" [...] Sherlock story a simple matter for English readers.

2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will be the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E
2500|$|Such vows, it is obvious, are {{sometimes}} made impulsively or {{in moments of}} panic, desperation or some other strong emotion, and would be impossible, impractical, or ruinous to fulfill (e.g. the impetuous [...] "vow" [...] – נדר neder [...] — made by Jephthah, in Judges 11:30, to sacrifice his daughter in return for victory in battle; a [...] "self-imposed obligation" [...] (in the KJV [...] "binding oneself") – אסר osar [...] which is the term used repeatedly in Numbers chapter 30 to describe a sort of commitment a wife might make that the husband could nullify; the regretted [...] "oath" [...] – שׁבע shava [...] – made at Mizpah to cause the tribe of Benjamin to dwindle nearly to extinction, Judges 21:7; a similar shava [...] made by Saul, which {{would have resulted in}} his son's execution but for the acclamation of the entire army, First Samuel, chapt. 14, etc.). The next word (in some editions) [...] "consecration" [...] -חרמי haromay is used for things whose use is devoted (usually to the Temple) as in Leviticus 27:21 & 28. After this point Amram's Hebrew version ceases to list forms of vows and shifts to synonyms for the making of vows, the list in the present day Kol Nidre uses Aramaic non-Biblical synonyms for pledges, which do not have equivalents in Biblical Hebrew, such as קונמי konamay - used in the Talmud for a vow by which a tool or furnishing is forbidden for mundane use because pledged to Temple usage, and קנוסי kinusay - used in the Talmud as a synonym for konamay. Though these promises to God may have been ill-considered, the failure to keep them is a recurring offense – and acting as if promises made to God were so trifling that they could be thoughtlessly forgotten is a further offense; the only remedy is, <b>first,</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> these promises will never be fulfilled, by formally cancelling them – {{which is one of the}} purposes of the Kol Nidrei, and then to repent for them – which is the purpose of the Day of Atonement. It has even been suggested that Kol Nidrei includes vows that had been fulfilled, because the Torah forbids the making of vows, so that even those which were kept required atonement. There is also a kabbalistic or spiritual purpose to Kol Nidrei: God has vowed, in Scripture, to punish Jewry for its sins; therefore by demonstrating that we can and do cancel our own vows, we hope to induce God to cancel his own dire decrees.|$|E

60|$|But {{in spite}} of the obvious merit of such {{institutions}} as exist, misgivings would arise. To begin with, it must be remembered that it is necessary <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> children should be delivered up almost entirely to the State. Nominally, the mother still comes to see her child in these schools, but in actual fact, the drafting of children to the country must intervene, and the whole temper of the authorities seemed to be directed towards breaking the link between mother and child. To some this will seem an advantage, and it is a point which admits of lengthy discussion, but as it belongs rather to the question of women and the family under Communism, I can do no more than mention it here.|$|E

When Mary Jane arrives at the hospital, Dr. Buccieri calls Dr. Helgerson and informs him of what happened. This time, he becomes more involved, ordering a set of full-skeletal x-rays. Dr. Buccieri tries again to talk to Mary Jane, who has become mute, giving her a china doll and tells the child how, when she was young, she used to talk to her doll about her abusive parents.

60|$|Much {{has been}} said against Mr. Mill's strictures on society, and his {{withdrawal}} from it. If we realise {{the full force of}} all that he says of his own purpose in life, {{it is hard to see}} how either his opinion or his practice could have been different. He ceased to be content with 'seconding the superficial improvements' in common ways of thinking, and saw the necessity of working at a fundamental reconstitution of accepted modes of thought. This in itself implies a condemnation of a social intercourse that rests on the base of conventional ways of looking at things. The better kind of society, it is true, appears to contain two classes; not only the class that will hear nothing said hostile to the greater social conventions, including among these the popular theology, but also another class who will tolerate or even encourage attack on the greater social conventions, and a certain mild discussion of improvements in them--provided only neither attack nor discussion be conducted in too serious a vein. A new idea about God, or property, or the family, is handed round among the company, as ladies of quality in Queen Anne's time handed round a black page or a China monster. In Bishop Butler's phrase, these people only want to know what is said, not what is true. To be in earnest, to show that you mean what you say, to think of drawing blood in the encounter, is thought, and perhaps very naturally thought, to be a piece of bad manners. Social intercourse can only exist either pleasantly or profitably among people who share a great deal of common ground in opinion and feeling. Mr. Mill, no doubt, was always anxious to find as much common ground as he honestly could, for this was one of the most characteristic maxims of his propagandism. But a man who had never been brought up in the popular religion, and who had been brought up in habits of the most scrupulous fair dealing with his own understanding; who had never closed his mind to new truths from likely sources, but whose character was formed, and whose mind was made up, on the central points of opinion, was not in a position to derive much benefit from those who in all respects represent a less advanced stage of mental development. On the other hand, all the benefit which they were in a position to derive from him could be adequately secured by reading what he wrote. Perhaps there is nothing wiser among the wise things written in the Autobiography than the remarks on the fact that persons of any mental superiority, who greatly frequent society, are greatly deteriorated by it. 'Not to mention loss of time, the tone of their feelings is lowered: they become less in earnest about those of their opinions respecting which they must remain silent in the society they frequent: they come to look on their most elevated objects as unpractical, or at least too remote from realisation to be more than a vision or a theory: and if, more fortunate than most, they retain their higher principles unimpaired, yet with respect to the persons and affairs of their own day, they insensibly adopt the modes of feeling and judgment in which they can hope for sympathy from the company they keep' (p. 228). That a man loses something, nay, that he loses much, by being deprived of animating intercourse with other men, Mr. Mill would probably have been the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> Where <b>that</b> intercourse can be had, nothing is more fit to make the judgment robust, nothing more fit to freshen and revive our interests, and to clothe them with reality. Even second-rate companionship has some clear advantages. The question is, whether these advantages outweigh the equally clear disadvantages. Mr. Mill was persuaded that they do not.|$|R
