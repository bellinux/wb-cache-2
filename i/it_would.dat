5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} {{from the edge of}} the city at Yonkers to 14th Street. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a four-track line. The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then <b>it</b> <b>would</b> turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water.

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> still be the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be the speed of photons.|$|E
