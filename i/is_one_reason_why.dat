5|$|Cobalt-60 has a {{radioactive}} half-life of 5.27years. The loss of potency requires periodic {{replacement of the}} source in radiotherapy and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> cobalt machines have been largely replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{adhesion}} formation <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> vaginal {{delivery is}} usually considered safer than elective caesarean section {{where there is}} no medical indication for section for either maternal or fetal reasons.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists prize local {{knowledge}} and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Community archaeology projects {{are starting to}} become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by {{the public in the}} locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.|$|E

50|$|The {{too high}} price of the vehicle <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the serial {{production}} was not started. It cost 85% of the Masi and 50% {{of the price of}} Pasi.|$|R
25|$|Similarly with {{developmental}} dyslexia, {{there has been}} considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect {{can be hard to}} unravel. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> experts such as Moore have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD.|$|E
25|$|The {{accelerated}} {{growth in}} different body parts happens at different times, {{but for all}} adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities—the head, hands and feet—followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders. This non-uniform growth <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> an adolescent body may seem out of proportion.|$|E
25|$|A {{firewall}} {{can be used}} {{to detect}} outgoing connections made by connect-back shellcode as well as incoming connections made by bindshells. They can therefore offer some protection against an attacker, even if the system is vulnerable, by preventing the attacker from connecting to the shell created by the shellcode. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> socket re-using shellcode is sometimes used: it does not create new connections and therefore is harder to detect and block.|$|E

25|$|Europeans are {{concerned}} about antisemitism because, historically, societies with a large degree of antisemitism are self-destructive. Furthermore, the Jews of Europe have generally aligned themselves with Europe's democratic elite, a class whose future is uncertain according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said {{that the issue of}} European antisemitism was more important than many economic, financial, and market issues facing Europe.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{organizations}} and institutions, most Mexican artisans are impoverished with little access to quality materials or designs, {{because of lack}} of cultural knowledge. Artisans also must compete with goods manufactured in large factories and copies of Mexican artesania imported from places like China. This keeps prices down, and {{the time it takes to}} make authentic artesanía puts the Mexican craftsmen at an economic disadvantage. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> younger generations have less interest in the craft tradition.|$|E
25|$|Stronger {{magnetic}} {{effects are}} typically only observed when d or f electrons are involved. Particularly {{the latter are}} usually strongly localized. Moreover, {{the size of the}} magnetic moment on a lanthanide atom can be quite large as it can carry up to 7 unpaired electrons in the case of gadolinium(III) (hence its use in MRI). The high magnetic moments associated with lanthanides <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> superstrong magnets are typically based on elements like neodymium or samarium.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Frøland married Jorunn Ragnhild Bye, {{and they}} {{divorced}} in 1984. Frøland had one son, Ebbe, {{who died on}} 1 January 2002. This <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> he retired from public life.|$|R

25|$|The first {{reactions}} {{in the formation}} of plasmalogen in animal cells also occur in peroxisomes. Plasmalogen is the most abundant phospholipid in myelin. Deficiency of plasmalogens causes profound abnormalities in the myelination of nerve cells, which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> many peroxisomal disorders affect the nervous system. Peroxisomes also {{play a role in the}} production of bile acids important for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A and K. Skin disorders are features of genetic disorders affecting peroxisome function as a result.|$|E
25|$|For any finitely {{presented}} group {{it is easy}} {{to construct}} a (smooth) compact 4-manifold with it as its fundamental group. As there is no algorithm to tell whether two finitely presented groups are isomorphic (even if one is known to be trivial) there is no algorithm to tell if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> much of the work on 4-manifolds just considers the simply connected case: the general case of many problems is already known to be intractable.|$|E
25|$|Bacteriophages, {{the viruses}} which infect bacteria, can be {{relatively}} easily grown as viral plaques on bacterial cultures. Bacteriophages occasionally move genetic material from one bacterial cell {{to another in}} {{a process known as}} transduction, and this horizontal gene transfer <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> they served as a major research tool in the early development of molecular biology. The genetic code, the function of ribozymes, the first recombinant DNA and early genetic libraries were all arrived at using bacteriophages. Certain genetic elements derived from viruses, such as highly effective promoters, are commonly used in molecular biology research today.|$|E
50|$|The pinafore was {{a type of}} apron {{that was}} pinned over the dress and easily removed for washing. Buttons were {{frequently}} damaged by lye cleaning products, which <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> dresses <b>were</b> not laundered very often.|$|R
25|$|The {{conventional}} {{view is that}} {{availability of}} livestock <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why,</b> in the mid-17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a staging post where {{the port city of}} Cape Town is today situated. The initial origin of the Khoikhoi remains uncertain.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{cause of}} CPPD is unknown, {{although}} increased breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP; the molecule used as energy currency in all living things), {{which results in}} increased pyrophosphate levels in joints, is thought to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> crystals may develop.|$|R
25|$|Some {{forms of}} copper are not soluble in stomach acids and cannot be absorbed from the stomach or small intestine. Also, some foods may contain indigestible fiber that binds with copper. High intakes of zinc can {{significantly}} decrease copper absorption. Extreme intakes of Vitamin C or iron can also affect copper absorption, reminding {{us of the}} fact that micronutrients need to be consumed as a balanced mixture. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> extreme intakes of any one single micronutrient are not advised. Individuals with chronic digestive problems may be unable to absorb sufficient amounts of copper, even though the foods they eat are copper-rich.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996, Chianti is {{permitted}} to include as little as 75% Sangiovese, a maximum of 10% Canaiolo, up to 10% of the white wine grapes Malvasia and Trebbiano and up to 15% of any other red wine grape grown in the region, such as Cabernet Sauvignon. This variety of grapes and usage <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Chianti can vary widely from producer to producer. The use of white grapes in the blend could alter the style of Chianti by softening the wines with {{a higher percentage of}} white grapes, typically indicating that the wine is meant to be drunk younger and not aged for long. In general, Chianti Classicos are described as medium-bodied wines with firm, dry tannins. The characteristic aroma is cherry but it can also carry nutty and floral notes as well.|$|E
25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E

500|$|Fischer {{wanted to}} play in the Capablanca Memorial Tournament, Havana in August and September 1965. Since the State Department refused to endorse Fischer's {{passport}} as valid for visiting Cuba, he proposed, and the tournament officials and players accepted, a unique arrangement: Fischer played his moves from a room at the Marshall Chess Club, which were then transmitted by teleprinter to Cuba. Luděk Pachman observed that Fischer [...] "was handicapped by the longer playing session resulting from the time wasted in transmitting the moves, and that <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> he lost to three of his chief rivals." [...] The tournament was an [...] "ordeal" [...] for Fischer, who had to endure eight-hour and sometimes even twelve-hour playing sessions. Despite the handicap, Fischer tied for second through fourth places, with 15/21 (+12−3=6), behind former World Champion Vasily Smyslov, whom Fischer defeated in their individual game. The tournament received extensive media coverage.|$|E
50|$|Outgoing President Harry Truman's dismal {{approval}} rating <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> his party lost its House majority.
