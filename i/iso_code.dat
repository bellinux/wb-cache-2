5|$|Svalbard is an {{archipelago}} in the Arctic Ocean {{under the}} full sovereignty of Norway, but {{is subject to}} the special status granted by the Svalbard Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate <b>ISO</b> <b>code</b> for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E

25|$|From the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union until May 1992, the Soviet ruble circulated in Belarus alongside the Belarusian ruble. New Russian banknotes also circulated in Belarus, but they were replaced by notes issued by the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus in May 1992. The first post-Soviet Belarusian ruble was assigned the <b>ISO</b> <b>code</b> BYB and replaced the Soviet currency at the rate of 1 Belarusian ruble = 10 Soviet rubles. It took about two years before the ruble became the official currency of the country.|$|E
25|$|Since {{independence}}, the Montenegrin {{society has}} been divided among many issues. The independence supporters are advocating {{for the creation of}} a separate Montenegrin language, regarded before as a dialect of the Serbian language, including the creation of a new Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet which is basically the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet with the addition of two new letters. The Serbian population of Montenegro is opposed to the idea of a linguistic separation, just as they are opposed to the separation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church from the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Montenegrin language lacks <b>ISO</b> <b>code,</b> and the Montenegrin Orthodox church is canonically unrecognized.|$|E

25|$|Otomi is {{traditionally}} {{described as a}} single language, although its many dialects are not all mutually intelligible. The language classification of the SIL International's Ethnologue considers Otomi to be a cover term for nine separate Otomi languages and assigns a different <b>ISO</b> <b>code</b> {{to each of these}} nine varieties. Currently Otomi varieties are spoken collectively by c. 239,000 speakers — some 5 to 6 percent of whom are monolingual. Because of recent migratory patterns, small populations of Otomi speakers can be found in new locations throughout Mexico and in the United States. The Otomi languages are vigorous in some areas, with children acquiring the language through natural transmission (e.g. in the Mezquital Valley of Hidalgo and in the Highlands). However three varieties are now considered moribund: those of Ixtenco (Tlaxcala state), Santiago Tilapa and Acazulco (Mexico state), and Cruz del Palmar (Guanajuato state). In some municipalities the level of monolingualism in Otomi is as high as 22.3% (Huehuetla, Hidalgo) or 13.1% (Texcatepec, Veracruz). Monolingualism is normally significantly higher among women than among men.|$|E

2500|$|Otomi has {{traditionally}} {{been described as a}} single language, although its many dialects are not all mutually intelligible. SIL International's Ethnologue considers there to be nine separate Otomi languages, based on needs for literature and the degree of mutual intelligibility between varieties, and it assigns an <b>ISO</b> <b>code</b> to each of these nine. [...] INALI, the Mexican National Institute of Indigenous Languages, avoids the problem of assigning dialect or language status to Otomian varieties by defining [...] "Otomi" [...] as a [...] "linguistic group" [...] with nine different [...] "linguistic varieties", but for official purposes each variety is considered a separate language. Other linguists, however, consider Otomi to be a dialect continuum that is clearly demarcated from its closest relative, Mazahua. For the purposes of this article, the latter approach will be followed.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>ISO</b> <b>code</b> for renminbi (which {{may also}} be used for the yuan) is CNY (an {{abbreviation}} for [...] "Chinese yuan"), or also CNH when traded in off-shore markets such as Hong Kong.

[...] In Chinese texts the currency {{may also be}} indicated with the Chinese character for the yuan, [...] (or [...] informally). The renminbi is legal tender in mainland China, but not in Hong Kong or Macau. However, Renminbi is widely accepted in Hong Kong and Macau, and are easily exchanged in the two territories, with banks in Hong Kong allowing people to maintain accounts in RMB and withdraw RMB banknotes from ATM terminals.|$|E
