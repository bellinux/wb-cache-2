30|$|Proposition 3 {{forwards}} that actively traded Philippine Universal Banks {{can make}} more loans after hedging <b>downside</b> <b>risks</b> associated with information asymmetry. As the standard deviation of NPLs serves as a measure for information asymmetry, it is conceivable to hedge {{the amount of the}} <b>downside</b> <b>risks</b> of loans associated with asymmetric information to bring the put option premium closer to zero (0). The construction of a hedging portfolio is possible for assets and liabilities that are positively correlated, and in unison (Yoon and Smith 2002). As Philippine Universal Banks make loans from the deposits of savers, this study makes the same assumption as Yoon and Smith (2002). With hedging the value of the <b>downside</b> <b>risks</b> from each strategy (Eq. (9)), a bank may lower its associated exposure to NPLs. This strategy is conceivable in the current Philippine investment environment, as there exists a long standing money market industry, as well as a bond market, which may serve as sources for hedging instruments.|$|R

40|$|Purpose : This paper aims to {{identify}} and examine the determinants of <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> in Australian listed property trusts (LPTs). Design/methodology/approach : Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and lower partial moment-CAPM (LPM-CAPM) are employed to compute both systematic <b>risk</b> and <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk.</b> The methodology of Patel and Olsen and Chaudhry et al. is adopted to examine the determinants of systematic <b>risk</b> and <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk.</b> Findings : The results confirm that systematic <b>risk</b> and <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> can be individually identified. There is little {{evidence to support the}} existence of linkages between systematic risk in Australian LPTs and financial/management structure determinants. On the other hand, <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> {{is directly related to the}} leverage/management structure of a LPT. The results are also robust after controlling for the LPTs 2 ̆ 7 investment characteristics and varying target rates of return. Practical implications : Investors and real estate analysts should conscious with the higher returns from high leverage and internally managed LPTs. Although there is no evidence that these higher returns are related to higher systematic risk, there could be the compensation for higher <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk.</b> Originality/value : This study provides invaluable insights into the management of real estate risk in Australian LPTs with implications for REITs in other countries. Unlike previous studies of systematic risk in REITs or LPTs, this is the first study to assess <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> and explore the determinants of <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> in LPTs...|$|R

2500|$|Palin {{expressed}} {{her personal}} opinion {{as a private}} citizen against State Ballot Measure Four, known as Alaska's Clean Water Act, a week prior to a statewide election held August 26, 2008. Conflict among commercial fishing and environmental interests versus mining interests in Alaska's Bristol Bay prompted the ballot petition. Measure Four was defeated at the polls by 57% of Alaskan voters. [...] Anglo-American Mining Company is seeking to develop a gold and copper mine within proximity to Bristol Bay that could pollute the Bay's headwaters. [...] The initiative was to prevent waste materials from large-scale mining operations from seeping into salmon watersheds. Such development could threaten the spawning grounds for the largest remaining wild salmon run. [...] Experts say the mine could yield more than $300 billion in metals and hundreds of jobs. The commercial fishing from salmon at Bristol supplies $300 million per year to the Alaskan economy in its present environmental state and {{a feature of the}} state's heritage. Opponents pointed to existing state and federal environmental laws that already achieve the same health and wildlife protections requested under Measure Four. They also claim that the Measure as written was open to interpretation which could drive stricter environmental standards that shut down all new, large metallurgic mines in Alaska. [...] Despite this potential redundancy, there are claims that the enforcement of mining industry environmental regulations in Alaska and nationwide are imperfect and pollution outside acceptable limits periodically occurs at existing sites to varying degrees. Also, the <b>downside</b> <b>risk</b> of an environmental accident at the proposed Anglo-American site could permanently decrease fishing activity at Bristol.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{systematic}} risk {{have demonstrated the}} link between financial and management structure determinants and systematic risk. However, systematic risk is estimated by assuming return is normally distributed. This assumption is generally rejected for real estate returns. Therefore, <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> appears as a more sensible risk measure in estimating market-related risk. This study contributes to this body of knowledge by examining the determinants of <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> in Australian Listed Property Trusts (LPTs) over 1993 - 2005. The results reveal that systematic <b>risk</b> and <b>downside</b> systematic <b>risk</b> are empirically distinguishable.

5000|$|<b>Downside</b> <b>risk</b> {{was first}} modeled by Roy (1952), who assumed that an investor’s {{goal was to}} {{minimize}} his/her risk. This mean-semivariance, or <b>downside</b> <b>risk,</b> model {{is also known as}} “safety-first” technique, and only looks at the lower standard deviations of expected returns which are the potential losses. This is about the same time Harry Markowitz was developing mean-variance theory. Even Markowitz, himself, stated that [...] "semi-variance is the more plausible measure of risk" [...] than his mean-variance theory. Later in 1970, several focus groups were performed where executives from eight industries were asked about their definition of risk resulting in semi-variance being a better indicator than ordinary variance. Then, through a theoretical analysis of capital market values, Hogan and Warren demonstrated that 'the fundamental structure of the [...] "capital-asset pricing model is retained when standard semideviation is substituted for standard deviation to measure portfolio risk."' This shows that the CAPM can be modified by incorporating downside beta, which measures <b>downside</b> <b>risk,</b> in place of regular beta to correctly reflect what people perceive as risk. Since the early 1980s, when Dr. Frank Sortino developed formal definition of <b>downside</b> <b>risk</b> as a better measure of investment risk than standard deviation, <b>downside</b> <b>risk</b> has become the industry standard for risk management.|$|E

Our empirical evidence based on Shanghai A shares confirms that most stocks display nonnegligible tail dependence with the whole market, and, more importantly, such tail dependence risks can indeed provide additional information beyond beta and other factors for asset pricing. In cross-sectional regression, it is proved that this tail dependence does help to explain monthly returns on Shanghai A shares, whereas the time-series regression further indicates that mimicking portfolio returns for tail dependence can capture strong common variation of Shanghai A stock returns...|$|R

We show that the cross-section of stock returns reflects a premium for bearing undesirable exposures to these options, which we also show are rational interpretations for <b>downside</b> <b>risks.</b> The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which <b>downside</b> <b>risks</b> may affect asset prices.
