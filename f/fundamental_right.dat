40|$|As the EU's <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> regime reaches maturity, {{this book}} offers the first {{full-length}} {{overview of the}} historical development and current role of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the law and policy of the European Union. It analyses both the institutional aspects (the place of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the EU legal order and their role in decision-making procedures) and substantive dimensions (the range and scope of rights recognized as part of EU law). Part I traces the emergence of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> as {{a feature of the}} EU legal order, from the initial silence of the original Treaties to the development of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> as general principles of law safeguarded by the European Court of Justice, and the adoption of a number of legislative instruments linking the protection of certain <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> to the establishment of the internal market. Part II moves on to examine <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the current landscape of EU law and policy. It analyses the constitutionalization of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> through Treaty amendments and the development of an area of freedom, security and justice among the Member States. It examines the role of the EU Charter of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> and of the <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights</b> Agency; and the relationship between the EU and the Council of Europe in the protection of human rights on the European continent. Finally, Part III offers a critical analysis of the role of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the external relations of the EU. As a whole, the book offers an ideal introduction to understanding the European Union as a human rights organization, suitable for use by graduate students, and an invaluable reference point for academics and legal practitioners needing an overview of EU <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> law and policy...|$|R

5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form of}} a <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Right</b> itself, for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights, and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Right</b> in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E
40|$|This chapter explores how and {{for which}} {{societal}} governance purposes <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> are applied by national and European courts in cases concerning litigations between private parties.

This question is looked at from the background of a normative-individualistic understanding of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> The analytical part of this chapter includes the proposition of a new doctrine: the double indirect horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> This could help the Court of Justice develop its jurisprudence towards a better consideration of the non-economic human interests protected by EU <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> This chapter comes to the conclusion that, in applying <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> horizontally, both the Court of Justice and the national courts seem to regularly give preference to certain societal policies over others. However, {{this does not mean that}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> are instrumentalized.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the ‘horizontal effect’ of European <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the {{jurisprudence}} of the CJEU. It explores how the Court appies these rights in adjudicating litigations between private parties. It addresses three questions: (1) how the horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> operates, (2) which policy goals it serves, and (3) whether this use of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> is legitimate and desirable. The first section of this paper explains how the terms ‘European fundamental rights’ and ‘private law’ are used throughout the text, and outlines the difference between vertical and horizontal effect. The second section outlines the difference between direct and indirect horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> In its third section, this paper takes position in favour of a normative individualistic understanding of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> The fourth section makes some examples of direct horizontal application and the fifth section some examples of indirect horizontal application of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the CJEU jurisprudence. The sixth section analyses the horizontal effect of the Charter. Here, this paper proposes a new doctrine: the ‘double indirect horizontal effect’ of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> This doctrine helps explain the impact of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> on private relationships in the European multi-level system of court adjudication. It also encourages the Court of Justice to develop its jurisprudence towards a better consideration of the non-economic human interests protected by European <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> The subsequent sections identify the policies related to the horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> at the EU level (seventh section). The eighth section addresses the question whether the pursuit of these policies through court adjudication constitutes a legitimate use or an illegitimate instrumentalization of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> It assesses {{the extent to which}} both the above-mentioned national and European patterns of horizontal effect correspond to the normative individualistic perspective outlined in the fourth section.

40|$|Originally, {{private law}} was {{considered}} to be immune from the effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights,</b> the function of which was limited to being individual defences against the vigilant eye of the state.

The relationships between private parties under private law have started losing their immunity from the effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> The major question at present is no longer whether <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> may have an impact on private law, but to what extent this will occur, and {{the answer to this question}} will determine the future of private law.

5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v.

5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right,</b> strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
40|$|It {{seems to}} be undisputed today that the {{harmonization}} of private law in Europe cannot take place without taking <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> into account. Yet many questions still exist as to how {{and to what extent}} EU and national private law can and should be influenced by <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> enshrined in the EU Charter of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights.</b> This contribution aims to explore gateways to the EU constitutionalization of private law, constraints thereon, and challenges posed thereby, with a particular focus on contract law in the consumer, employment, and financial services context. After a methodological introduction explaining the special nature of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> protection in the EU legal order (s. 1), the authors develop a general framework within which the EU constitutionalization of private law takes place (s. 2). Subsequently, they proceed to examine the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> scrutiny of EU law and national laws within the scope of EU law (s. 3), the interpretation and application of EU law and national law within its scope in conformity with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> (s. 4), as well as the controversial concepts of the positive obligations to protect <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in private relationships (s. 5) and the direct horizontal effect of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> (s. 6). The contribution concludes with some final observations (s. 7) ...|$|R

Going beyond the classical notion of civil rights as purely defensive rights against the state, though, article 35 also mandates the authorities to give meaning to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in their legislative and executive acts, and to actively protect <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> even to some degree against non-state actors.

Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage licenses, the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such licenses, and the clerks of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing licenses due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E
5|$|After Indian Independence in 1947, all the non-princely {{states were}} subject to a test of {{religious}} majority in which the Muslim majority areas formed the Dominion of Pakistan, while the other regions formed the Dominion of India. Murshidabad (the capital city for both, the Nawabs of Bengal and the Nawabs of Murshidabad) {{became a part of}} East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. However, it became a part of India on 17 August 1947. The Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop the palace. The Nawabs, after the takeover by the British had no actual power and after merging with India too, they had yielded power, as the Government of India took over control of all the areas that merged with India. Furthermore, with the promulgation of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, the Dominion of India was transformed into the Republic of India, and the Article 18 of the Indian Constitution (which {{is a part of the}} Right to Equality, a <b>fundamental</b> <b>right</b> in India), titles were abolished. The Article prevents the state from confirming any title except those titles given by the Government to those who have made their mark in military and academic fields. Such titles and awards include the Bharat Ratna, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan (the Supreme Court of India, on 15 December 1995, upheld the validity of such awards). Thus, with the promulgation of the Constitution, the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad was abolished. And although, the Nawab Waris Ali Meerza held titles such as Raes ud-Daulah, they were not officially or legally recognised.|$|E

40|$|Following Opinion 2 / 2013, in the Union’s {{legal order}} {{the status of}} the {{principle}} of mutual trust versus the Charter of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> should be reconsidered: the Opinion holds that the principle’s incompatibility with the ECHR’s obligations to protect <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> par ricochet is a major obstacle to the Union’s accession to the Convention, whereas <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> are equally laid down in the Charter, which shares the same legal value of the Treaties.

Next, it discusses the growing role of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> in the later judgments of the Luxembourg Court in mutual trust cases, to conclude that, put to test, mutual trust seems far from ranking higher than the Charter.

40|$|Award date: 28 November 2014 Supervisor: Professor Claire Kilpatrick, European University InstituteThe thesis {{engages in}} a {{comprehensive}} legal study of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionalities as introduced in the 2014 - 2020 European Structural and Investment Funds normative framework. It focuses on three general ex ante conditionalities {{in the area of}} antidiscrimination, gender equality and disability. Conditionality in <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> is a long-standing EU policy tool, used mainly to enforce compliance with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> values on third countries. The 2013 Cohesion policy reform marks a strong transition of <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionality to internal policy. The development stirred a great interest as the tool addresses directly the EU Member States. It conditions the access to funding on a prior fulfilment of specifically prescribed <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> criteria. In this context, the thesis inquires what is the nature and reach of the novel <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionalities. To facilitate a robust understanding of the newly introduced tool, the thesis firstly undertakes a conceptual analysis of conditionality. It further takes an evolutivecomparative approach, locating the <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionalities in the broader context of EU conditionality policy {{as well as in the}} context of European Structural and Investment Funds framework. Tested against the two areas, the research finds that the analysed ex ante conditionalities endorse the novelty claim, but, at the same time, they present similarities with the EU general use of conditionality in <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights.</b> Equally, <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionalities build harmoniously on the prior arrangements of European Structural and Investment Funds. The thesis concludes with a general assessment of the novel <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> conditionalities’ potential and limits, primarily with regards to Cohesion policy and secondly with regards to the overall EU goal of promoting equality and combating status discrimination...|$|R

This thesis {{places the}} debate on the {{relationship}} between <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> and the internal market outside the field of negative integration (where it is usually takes place) into the field of positive integration. It examines the extent to which there is an internal market competence to deal with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> and analyses new mechanisms for <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> protection outside the Courts. Against this backdrop, this thesis analyses the existing harmonisation practice in the EU through the lens of four fundamental rights: (i) data protection, (ii) freedom of expression, (iii) <b>fundamental</b> labour <b>rights</b> [the right to collective bargaining and the right to fair and just working conditions] and (iv) the right to health. The research reveals that there is a considerable amount of internal market legislation dealing with <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> (even pre-existing the EU Charter of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Rights)</b> but that most of it is not couched in <b>fundamental</b> <b>rights</b> terms. This thesis identifies the determinants, which account for the current prevalent conceptualisation and assesses the consequences of such approaches both for the substantive content of legislation and for its judicial review.
