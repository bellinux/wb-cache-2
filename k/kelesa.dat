The hydrocarbon source rock potential is a fine grained clastics within the Late Eocene <b>Kelesa</b> and Oligocene Lakat Formations. The <b>Kelesa</b> Formation source rock has a TOC value of 2. 31 – 9. 63 %, with hydrocarbon content of a good to excellent categories (6. 23 – 70. 72 kg/ton rock), whereas the Lakat Formation has a TOC value of 0. 67 – 3. 46 %, with hydrocarbon content of a poor to excellent categories (1. 21 – 37. 38 kg/ton rock). Source rock thermal maturation of the <b>Kelesa</b> Formation ranges from a late immature to early mature, with kerogen type of I and II, whereas the Lakat Formation ranges from a late immature, with kerogen type of I, II, and III. Diagenetic stage of the hydrocarbon source rock of the <b>Kelesa</b> Formation is included to Mudrock Stage II which is equivalent to a mesogenetic mature “A”. This diagenetic proccess was due to the burial history with the depth of up to 3000 m, resulted in a paleotemperature of 95 C. The Lakat Formation is, however, included to Mudrock Stage I equivalent to the mesogenetic immature level. Burial history which occurred at the paleo temperature up to 65 C, with the depth of burial up to 1500 m, led to the diagenetic process...|$|E
