5000|$|Yeang {{pursuit of}} <b>eco-architecture</b> and eco-masterplanning theories, {{concepts}} and ideas {{have been carried}} out in parallel with an exploration for an 'ecological aesthetic', in questioning [...] "...What a green building and masterplan should look like?" ...|$|E
50|$|Yeang {{contends that}} an {{ecological}} architectural aesthetic should resemble a living system, looking natural, verdant and hirsute with nature and its processes {{visible in the}} bio-integration of the synthetic builtform's physical constituents (abiotic) with the native fauna, flora (the biotic constituents) and the environmental biological processes of the land. He contends that much of existent architecture and masterplans that lay claim by other elsewhere to be sustainable are simply commonly-styled or iconically-styled builtforms stuffed internally with eco-engineering gadgetry and with occasional vegetation in its upper open courts. Yeang contends that an <b>eco-architecture</b> and an eco-city should be 'alive' as a living system, analogous to a constructed ecosystem and not 'de-natured' nor look predominantly inorganic, artificial and synthetic. He adopts these assertions {{as the basis for}} his <b>eco-architecture.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{theoretical}} rigorousness underpins his work. His earlier Cambridge {{doctoral dissertation}} (1975) presents a unifying comprehensive theoretical model for eco-design defining the prime factors in eco-design in {{four sets of}} interdependent 'environmental interactions', assembled in a mathematical 'partitioned-matrix'. This theoretical model continues {{to serve as the}} underlying guiding framework for his present <b>eco-architecture</b> and eco-masterplanning work.|$|E

5000|$|Yeang {{contends that}} <b>eco-architecture</b> and eco-masterplans demand their own {{identifiable}} 'style'. It is this distinctive green vegetated eco-aesthetic in Yeang's architecture and masterplans that brought international {{attention to his}} work. His eco-aesthetic {{does not have the}} shape or form that in any way resemble existent architectural styles. This aesthetic is an independent aesthetic that encompasses eco-design holistically and which comes from an interpretation, an understanding and the inclusion of ecological constituents and processes of its locality in its built form. This can be regarded as an emergent ecological aesthetic, where its shapes and forms have a nexus with adjoining ecosystems, which harmonise with the site's ecology, enhance local biodiversity, besides having other eco performance features such denying negative consequences, avert polluting emissions, be more energy and water efficient and carbon neutral than conventional buildings, and other eco-design attributes. He sees the <b>eco-architecture</b> as designed like a 'constructed living system'. Lord Norman Foster of Thames Bank refers to Yeang's eco-aesthetics, [...] "Ken Yeang has developed a distinctive architectural vocabulary that extends beyond questions of style to confront issues of sustainability and how we can build in harmony of the natural world." [...] (2011).Yeang's work in his relentless pursuit of an original bio-integrated 'ecological aesthetic' can be regarded as Yeang's other contribution to this field.|$|E

5000|$|The oldest known living {{examples}} of woody plant shaping are the aeroponically cultured living root bridges {{built by the}} ancient War-Khasi people of the Cherrapunjee region in India. These are being maintained and further developed today {{by the people of}} that region. Aeroponic growing was first formally studied by W. Carter in 1942. Carter researched air culture growing and described [...] "a method of growing plants in water vapor to facilitate examination of roots". Later researchers, including L. J Klotz and G. G. Trowel, expanded on his work. In 1957, F. W. Went described [...] "the process of growing plants with air-suspended roots and applying a nutrient mist to the root section", and in it he coined the word 'aeroponics' to describe that process. In 2008, root researcher and craftsman Ezekiel Golan described and secured a patent for a process which allows the roots of some aeroponically grown woody plants to lengthen and thicken while still remaining flexible. At lengths of perhaps 6 m or more, the soft roots can be formed into pre-determined shapes which will continue thickening after the shapes are formed and as they continue to grow.Newer techniques and applications, such as <b>eco-architecture,</b> may allow architects to design, grow, and form large permanent structures, such as homes, by shaping aeroponically grown plants and their roots.|$|E

"BedZED is located among boring development of London suburbs in post-industrial areas. When I ask a pedestrian how to get there, he smiles — you are bound to miss it'. He is right, 'the last thing we want is all the eco-buildings to be the same'—writes Keith Hall, Green Building editor. BedZED is a proof that <b>eco-architecture</b> {{is not going to}} be boring. An interesting shape of oval roofs, intimate streets with bridges, intriguing steps leading to the roof houses create a friendly atmosphere. Each, even the smallest flat has its own character and a small garden — here greenery becomes an ornament. One can argue that the urban planning of the residential area is very simple. However, this is the strategic sense of this venture — its proves that <b>eco-architecture</b> can be ordinary or regular and at the same time 'luxurious' and — what's important — it can be densely developed, which is a significant requirement contemporary urban planners need to face. Naturally, more and more <b>eco-architecture</b> appears in the world. The uniqueness of Dunster's project lies in the fact that his project proves eco-construction doesn't have to be an exception, but an economically viable standard, provided we put some effort into it.

40|$|About the book: Culture, Environment and Ecopolitics brings {{together}} {{a series of}} new reflections on historical and current ecological and environmental predicaments. By way of critical interventions in environmental thought, and through engagements with literary, visual, architectural, philosophical, and more general cultural studies scholarship, this collection of essays by an international panel of writers breaks new interpretative ground. While techno-science has in some quarters been elevated to a master discourse of humanity’s salvation, charged with providing a magical ‘fix’ for planetary ecological dilemmas, {{the focus of our}} volume is on the importance of cultural reflection for bringing matters of local and global import to light. Moving from the abstractions of eco-critical utopianisms to the concrete identity of the land in the poetry of John Clare, from British Petroleum’s attempts to re-brand climate change to examples of <b>eco-architecture,</b> and much more besides, these essays exemplify ways in which eco-political thought and practice might now be theorized. The collection is framed by a substantial editors’ introduction which offers but one contextualization of the ideas and critical trajectories that follow. Culture, Environment and Ecopolitics will allow readers to discover original intersections and argumentative cross-references across contested terrains in a world increasingly troubled by ecological crises. ...|$|E

It is a structure housing a bar, a box office and a small pier for a mini-cruise service, in a view of promoting a sustainable tourism in Trevignano area. Up to now, according to the local legislation, only electrically powered navigation is allowed in Bracciano lake: the mini-cruise service, utilizing a boat used no longer by coast guard and carrying 20 people at most, will be equipped with an electrical device of 8. 6 kWp integrated with {{the roof of the}} building. The architecture and plant designs of the wooden building are based on new envelope technologies solutions with a large use of local natural materials and pre-fabricated systems. According to the Italian regulation on the building energy classification, the designed building is classified “A+”, the best efficiency class, due to a highly performing wooden envelope system associated with a remarkable production of electrical and thermal solar energy.

40|$|Increasing colour {{variety in}} {{photovoltaics}} {{can improve the}} uptake of this renewable technology, which {{is vital to the}} creation of sustainable architecture. However, the introduction of colour into photovoltaics often involves increased cost and decreased efficiency. A method was found to add colour to photovoltaics, using luminescent materials: fluorescent organic dyes (BASF Lumogen). These selectively absorb and emit light, giving a good balance between colour addition and electricity production from underlying photovoltaic cells. Very small amounts of Lumogen dye were added to a silicone encapsulant (Dow Corning Sylgard 184), which was then used hold photovoltaic cells in place between sheets of painted glass. When making sufficient quantities of dyed encapsulant for a 600 x 450 mm testpiece, the dye colours faded, with low levels of fluorescence, although some colour was retained. Improvement of the method, including testing of alternative encapsulant materials, is required, to ensure that the dyes continue to fluoresce within the encapsulant. Although the Lumogen dyes are quite stable when compared to other dye molecules, in general organic dyes are not yet sufficiently durable to make this technology viable for installations that are to last for more than 20 years: the guaranteed lifetime of standard photovoltaic modules. Dye replenishment, or replacement of materials, will be required; or a product with a shorter ‘useful’ lifetime identified. This method opens up a wide variety of architectural glass design opportunities that incorporate photovoltaics, providing an example of one new medium to make <b>eco-architecture</b> more aesthetically pleasing, whilst generating electricity...|$|E

But at the same time, Bandung is not prepared both planning and control tools to support the city activities. Consequently Bandung city have decreased quality of physical, environmental or social. These problems appear to reduction of green open land, reduced soil bearing capacity with the change of green land converted to land up. Cikapundung river as the main river through the city of Bandung, did not escape from the problems. The mounting garbage, liquid/solid waste, soil erosion has made a sub-optimal functioning of the function that should. One of the areas in the watershed of Cikapundung is Pelesiran. This area as the rear of trade center Cihampelas. This region has gradually changes from a green area into slums even the squatters turned into a riverbank settlement. Its convenient location but the absence of planning and control device that anticipates the development of the region, resulting in a region experiencing a decrease in the quality of the physical, environmental and social.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>eco-architecture</b> project {{in a public}} green space of the Ladispoli Municipality, located on the Italian shorelines close {{to the city of}} Rome. The purpose of the project is the creation of a multifunctional urban green space, where social relations, sports, environmental awareness education and other activities can take place in a natural context. The final aim of the project, which includes a requalification of the surrounding areas, is to obtain an ecofriendly interaction between the urban public space and the built space, with sustainable mobility principles and the conservation of the natural environment. The project offers different outdoor activities for all ages and includes the design of a building which contains two multipurpose playgrounds, a gym, supporting functions, a bar and public toilets. The building design includes a green roof, for preserving space to nature and for guaranteeing a harmonious integration with the surrounding environment. In order to enlarge the green area, to bring it up to the contiguous buildings and to create a closer connection between the housing areas {{on both sides of the}} ditch and the park itself, a tunnel for the vehicular traffic was created. The project improves the usability of the green space through the introduction of: pedestrian and cycle paths connected to the existing ones, wooden bridges, new functions and services. The distinctive feature of the whole project is an integration of different best available technologies for obtaining an optimization of the performances in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, aiming to achieve at the same time, a reduction of operating costs and the preservation of local biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|A {{debate about}} ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ {{definitions}} of sustainability {{in the form}} of a theatre play. Socrates meets various enthusiasts of <b>eco-architecture</b> to discuss how to interpret the concept of sustainability, which was famously defined by Brundtland Commision in ‘Our Common Future’. The article shows how different data and concepts of embodied energy, life-time analyses or insulation properties could be manipulated in order to prove eco-friendliness of various products and building methods. The debate illustrates the claim made by Layard and Davoudi, who differentiates between ‘strong’ sustainable development, which encompasses both the need to restrict and to maintain ethical standards, and ‘weak’ sustainable development, which is satisfied with just a few changes within the present system. The article debates which concept is closer to the original definition of ecology coined in 1866 by Ernst Haeckel in Generelle Morphologie, where he described ecology as a science focusing on relations between organisms and their surroundings. Various examples, tables and statistics show that even products which are harmful to the environment could be presented as eco-friendly if quantitative data are manipulated. On the one hand, these types of easy-to-measure information couldbe very seductive. On the other hand, however, they are misleading and constitute source of confusion for the building industry. Socrates takes on a stand that is very philosophical: ‘Not everything that can be counted, counts. Not everything that counts can be counted’. He points out the consequences of a paradigm change as defined by Thomas Kuhn. Socrates suggests that when talking about energy and buildings, psychological aspects must also be taken into consideration. We should consider not only how many KW/h are needed per m 2, but also how much happiness can be created by one m 2. ([URL]...|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaic {{cells can}} be {{integrated}} into decorative glass, providing a showcase for this renewable technology, whilst assisting {{in the creation of}} sustainable architecture through generation of electricity from the building surface. However, traditional, opaque, square, crystalline-silicon solar cells contrast strongly with their surroundings when incorporated into translucent, coloured glazing. Methods of blending photovoltaic cells into their surroundings were developed, using traditional glass painting techniques. A design was created in which opaque paint was applied to the areas of glass around underlying photovoltaic cells. Translucent, platinum paint was used on the glass behind the photovoltaic cells. This covered the grey cell backs whilst reflecting light and movement. The platinum paint was shown to cause a slight increase in power produced by photovoltaic cells placed above it. To add colour, very small amounts of Lumogen F dye (BASF) were incorporated into a silicone encapsulant (Dow Corning, Sylgard 184), which was then used hold photovoltaic cells in place between sheets of painted glass. Lumogen dyes selectively absorb and emit light, giving a good balance between colour addition and electricity production from underlying photovoltaic cells. When making sufficient quantities of dyed encapsulant for a 600 x 450 mm test piece, the brightness of the dye colours faded, and fluorescence decreased, although some colour was retained. Improvement of the method, including testing of alternative encapsulant materials, is required, to ensure that the dyes continue to fluoresce within the encapsulant.

Daedalus - the designer of Icarus’ wings {{is considered to be}} the first mythical architect. What would happen if he and his son did not end up with the epic disaster of Icarus drowning in the Ionic Sea? What would happen if Icarus and Daedalus survived until today? What would happen if they were exposed to modern architectural education? This article {{takes the form of a}} Socratic Dialog and adds new pages to this Greek myth. Today – in the article – Daedalus, who was always more attached to earth, promotes heavy earth architecture. His sustainable architecture is made out of simple natural materials, it creates no waste, it is easy to build but unfortunately it lacks the lightness which is so much expected by critics rooted in modern architectural world. “Can <b>Eco-architecture</b> be beautiful at all?” – asks Icarus who has always been an enthusiast of lightness. Today Icarus has become a fashionable light-tech architect who likes to deconstruct and dematerialise architecture and believes that it is a key to new aesthetics. Icarus claims that the whole history of architecture is a story of making buildings lighter, and he sees the introduction of glass in modernism as a highlight of architectural genius. “Lightness determines progress. ” Just like Buckminster Fuller, he claims that the new style could be distinguished from the old by ‘weight’. Daedalus is fascinated with Zygmunt Bauman’s ideas and the dangers of liquid modernity. He sees the idea of dematerialisation as a fashionable, dangerous and fundamentally flawed concept which detached people from their roots. He is afraid that this idea could backfire in the long run and produce people who are so desperate to reconnect with their own culture that they could even turn to terrorism. This exchange of arguments, which is full of intellectual twists, gives an overview of the battle between different architectural ideas: dematerialisation and lightness versus materialisation and heaviness...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the career of}} the Egyptian architect, Hassan Fathy (1900 - 1989). Part one deals with Fathy's biography. It contains an account of his family background, his childhood and education, the influences of the Egyptian vernacular and Islamic architecture which helped shape his identity and the influences of modem architectural movements on his early works. It also outlines the development of his nationalistic attitude and personal architectural approach {{within the context of}} Egypt's cultural and intellectual history. An examination of his work and theories during the period from 1957 to 1962 when he worked with Doxiadis Associates in Athens; the events surrounding the establishment of Fathy's Institute for Appropriate Technology in 1976 and an assessment of his architecture {{at the time of his}} death are also included. The fifth and sixth chapters examine the formal vocabulary of his buildings and projects and the design principles of his village planning. Chapter seven focuses on the complexity of Fathy's architecture and the richness and range of its theoretical intentions. It also assesses Fathy's attitudes towards modernism and the International Style, issues such as auto colonialism and symbolism in architecture and critical responses to his works and philosophy. The relationship of his philosophy to movements such as Post-modernism, community architecture and self-help building, <b>eco-architecture</b> and sustainability and tendencies such as neo-vernacular and earth building are also examined. This reveals the significance of Fathy's approach while placing him within the wider perspective of twentieth-century architecture. The thesis argues that Fathy is one of the most important architects of the twentieth century, whose works have had a widespread influence on the architecture of the Islamic world and whose ideas have extended to the Western world. Chapter eight {{examines the}} ways in which architects in both the Western and non-western worlds view Fathy's ideas and works. It distinguishes those architects who have opted to use literal references from his work in an eclectic fashion from those who have made more considered responses to his ideals and principles.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a current design research project that explores how designers can intervene sensitively within local urban food growing cultures {{by providing a}} design thinking and crafting that may help to sustain these initiatives and catalyse larger positive changes in the surrounding environment. MetaboliCity is the name for {{a vision of a}} city that metabolizes its resources and waste to supply its inhabitants with all the nourishment they need and more. This one-year (October 2008 – October 2009) participatory design research project on urban agriculture is based at Central Saint Martins, School of Art and Design and funded by the Audi Design Foundation. The aim of the project is to design an urban grow-kit accompanied by a set of guidelines to be tested and developed at a selection of sites in London, UK. This is a design-service system that integrates both traditional and hi-tech industrialized agricultural techniques into the fabric of the built environment whilst simultaneously being rooted in permaculture thinking. Permaculture is defined as an ‘ecological design system’ that empowers city-dwellers to create ‘sustainable human habitats by following nature’s pattern’. (Robert Hopkins, 2008, p 203) The complex nature of the project calls for a Metadesign approach. Metadesign can be described as ‘a shared design endeavour aimed at sustaining emergence, evolution and adaptation’. It creates ‘open-ended and infinite interactivity capable of accommodating always-new variables’. (Giaccardi, 2005) Metabolicity will test and adapt collaborative tools and processes that have been developed {{as a part of the}} ‘Benchmarking Synergy Levels within Metadesign’, AHRC funded research project, at Goldsmiths, University of London (2005 - 2008). The project is facilitated by a design and research team, the participants are amateur food producers based at four different sites in London. There are special advisors on hand from the fields of plant science, permaculture, cooking, farming, wildlife and <b>eco-architecture.</b> The participatory nature of the project is informed by the notion of ‘Citizen Science’ (Irwin, 1995), where amateurs and specialists are engaged in a non-hierarchical process. The project explores how designers can work in multiple ways, taking on different roles within an interdisciplinary context, mediating between experts and amateurs in the field of urban agriculture. The role of the designers is to cultivate shared processes of envisioning, weaving and growing within each of these local contexts...|$|E
