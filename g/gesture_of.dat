5|$|Among al-Muttaqi's first {{actions as}} Caliph was the {{confirmation}} of Bajkam as amir al-umara. Despite al-Muttaqi's <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> support, Bajkam still faced opposition among the semi-autonomous provincial governors, including al-Baridi.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Poland was {{undergoing}} yet more upheaval: in 1978, John Paul II was elected Pope, providing a national figurehead of world importance; in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland as a <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> {{solidarity with the}} artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, as a <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, {{he was awarded the}} Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.|$|E

They are structured communication systems that include gestures that function as words, which are combined to form sentences, and are used to describe situations beyond the here-and-now.|$|R

5|$|In the four-armed form, a {{right hand}} holds a parashu (axe) and another makes an abhaya mudra (<b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> reassurance), {{or one of}} the right arms is {{slightly}} bent and rests on the head of Shiva's bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture. Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (<b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E
5|$|On January 29, 1909, the {{sovereign}} government of Cuba was restored, and José Miguel Gómez became president. No explicit evidence of Magoon's corruption ever surfaced, but his parting <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> issuing lucrative Cuban contracts to U.S. firms was a continued point of contention. Several months later, Magoon received an official commendation from President Taft for his excellent service in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E

5|$|Discovering {{that many}} of his satraps and {{military}} governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E
5|$|Edward's body lay at Wareham for a {{year before}} being disinterred. Ælfhere {{initiated}} the reinterment, perhaps as a <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> reconciliation.

He recovered, and began to paint a number of portraits of his friends, including one of Dr Tom Honeyman, the Director of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum from 1939 until 1954. Honeyman, at the time an art dealer, had assisted Hunter in developing his career, and painting the portrait {{may have been a}} <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> thanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi {{was among}} a {{delegation}} of Sudanese notables who went to London to congratulate King George V of England on the British victory in the war.

5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel feature triangle tracking (FTT) algorithm {{to track the}} eyes, mouth and head <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> a fatigued driver. The proposed method uses the motion information to localise the face region at an YCrCb colour space to determine the locations of eyes and mouth. According to geometrical relationships of facial components and various head <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> a driver, the system derives from both the isosceles feature triangle and the right feature triangle. The FTT algorithm effectively removes the confusing triangle from the tracking of the video sequence. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm precisely tracks the various head <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> a fatigued driver in real-time video frames...|$|R

5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E
5|$|Since {{exiting the}} Premier League, Eddie Davies, the then {{owner of the}} club revoked his {{investment}} into the club. This led to published debts of almost £200m and bought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to HMRC. As a <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped {{a significant proportion of}} debt the club owed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gestures</b> <b>of</b> Resistance aims {{to respond}} to our current general mood of {{political}} anxiety and alienation by opening up socio-political critique in order to resist the palpable feeling of disempowerment. Rather than accepting the non-choice of the neoliberal setup of Greece or current right-wing politics both in America and Europe, the artists <b>of</b> <b>Gestures</b> <b>of</b> Resistance reflect on {{the current state of}} our political condition, our current housing situation, the state of education and art, liberalism, diversity and pluralism in this moment of historical crisis, whereby the state of today seems to have strong links to the state of the past. As part <b>of</b> <b>Gestures</b> <b>of</b> Resistance, artworks by sixteen international contemporary artists will be exhibited at the Romantso Cultural Centre in Athens during Documenta 14. From photographs and collages to sculptures and installations, each artist has an agenda and political take – some subtle and cryptic, some openly confrontational. <b>Gestures</b> <b>of</b> Resistance also extends outside the gallery space with an artists’ procession on 22 April. The exhibition is curated by Jean Wainwright...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{mathematical}} definition <b>of</b> <b>gesture</b> {{is given}} in the paper [...] "Formulas, Diagrams, and Gestures in Music" [...] (Journal of Mathematics and Music, Vol 1, Nr. 1 2007) by Guerino Mazzola (University of Minnesota) and Moreno Andreatta (IRCAM in Paris). A gesture is a configuration of curves in space and time. More formally, a gesture is a digraph morphism from a [...] "skeleton" [...] of addressed points to a [...] "body", a spatial digraph of a topological category (in the musical case: time, position and pitch). Since the set <b>of</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> given skeleton and topological category defines a topological category, one may define <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestures,</b> so-called hypergestures.|$|R
