5|$|The {{proteasome}} and its subunits are {{of clinical}} significance {{for at least}} two reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases, and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies. An improved and comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future.|$|E

5|$|While the {{long-term}} potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems {{to provide an}} elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning {{at the level of}} the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from in vitro studies.

Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.|$|E
5|$|Mandarin and Malay, in particular, {{the local}} variety of Malay, that is, Sarawakian Malay or Bahasa Sarawak, are widely spoken here. English is spoken to some extent, with most Mirians being {{incapable}} of speaking English with impeccable grammar. The respective ethnic groups also speak their own languages. Indigenous groups speak languages such as Berawan, Bruneian/Kedayan, Miriek, Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and Kelabit. Meanwhile, the Chinese would speak Mandarin, Hakka Chinese, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, Hainanese, and the Fuzhou dialect. However, {{the younger generation}} in Miri tends to use lingua francas (Mandarin and Malay) rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit), {{with the exception of}} Iban, which is widely used here, or Chinese dialects (Hokkien and Foochow), and an <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> made to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.|$|E
