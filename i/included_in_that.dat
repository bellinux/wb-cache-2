In the seven months of the Gallipoli Campaign they had 127 dead; fourteen of those died of illness and 113 were killed in action. Another forty-six, not <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> total, were reported missing believed dead. The {{two years of the}} Sinai and Palestine Campaign accounted for another 127 dead. At the same time 466 men were debilitated or wounded in action at Gallipoli, and another 254 were wounded during the later campaign, a total of 720 wounded for both campaigns.|$|E

In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation {{is dependent on the}} virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E

5|$|Preliminary casting {{began in}} March 1987, with Justman and Berman {{in charge of}} the process. In May, the actors who were to receive star billing were announced. In the initial press release, only three actors were discussed; {{primarily}} LeVar Burton as La Forge, due to the actor's appearances in the mini-series Roots. Also <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> release were the announcements of Patrick Stewart, a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company as Captain Picard, and Jonathan Frakes formerly of the North and South miniseries. Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby were cast as Masha Hernandez and Deanna Troi respectively, but Roddenberry decided to switch the roles, at which point Hernandez became Yar.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{administration}} {{was influenced by}} principles stated in the ancient text arthashastra. The praje gavundas mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities {{similar to those of}} the village elders (gramavriddhas) mentioned by Kautilya. Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked. The kingdom was divided into Rashtra (district) and further into Visaya (consisting of possibly 1000 villages) and Desa. From the 8th century, the Sanskrit term Visaya was replaced by the Kannada term Nadu. Examples of this change are Sindanadu-8000 and Punnadu-6000, with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division or the number of villages <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> territory.|$|E

5|$|The two teams' {{defenses}} {{also performed}} statistically well during the game. Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd led all defenders by recording 11 tackles during the game. <b>Included</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> total were four tackles for loss, including one sack. That performance {{was his best}} in terms of quantity during the season, and his four tackles for loss moved him into sixth place on Cincinnati's list of career tackles for loss leaders. For the Hokies, Dorian Porch had eight tackles, leading all Tech players. Cody Grimm, Orion Martin, Stephan Virgil, and Kam Chancellor each recorded one interception. The four interceptions were a Tech bowl-game record, and Chancellor's catch gave him six for the season, tying him with Victor Harris for the most on the team. It {{was the first time}} since 1968 that two Virginia Tech players had six interceptions apiece. Cincinnati's sole interception came at the hands of Brandon Underwood, who tallied his third of the season.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the events}} finally {{stabilized}} during the 2000–01 season, the USAD administration changed dramatically that {{year when the}} program's executive director, James Alvino, resigned. Alvino had written a religious article that had been <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year's Super Quiz Resource Guide. His critics and the USAD Board regarded the inclusion as a conflict of interest, as the material was a persuasive essay that heavily pushed Alvino's point of view. The season was also significant {{in that it was}} the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to the national competition. (Small schools are currently classified as those schools with fewer than 650 students.) However, this practice was short-lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season. Instead, a small school e-Nationals was introduced during the 2005–06 school year. The medium school e-Nationals was established two years later for those schools with between 650 and 1,300 students. In 2010, California Academic Decathlon announced that a large school e-Nationals would be held for the second-highest performing school in each state.|$|E
