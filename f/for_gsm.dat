25|$|In {{contrast}} to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, recent Federal Communications Commission documentation {{has shown that}} the iPhone 4 contains a penta-band 3G UMTS antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple. According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100MHz. The 800MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple. However, the 800MHz band is a subset of the 850MHz band, which probably explains why the device is advertised as quad-band. The chip-sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions and Infineon <b>for</b> <b>GSM</b> version.|$|E
25|$|The iPhone 4 is {{structured}} around {{a stainless steel}} frame that wraps {{around the edge of}} the phone, acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone 4's antennas. This metal band features two slits on the GSM version of the phone, one at the lower left, and one at the top (and a fake slit along the lower right, to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left) that divide the band into two antenna sections: the left section of the band serves as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS antenna, and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna <b>for</b> <b>GSM</b> and UMTS connectivity.|$|E
30|$|As noted previously, {{approximately}} {{one in every}} four visas issued through GSM and Employer Sponsored categories was re-allocated from the GSM to the Employer Sponsored category between 2005 and 2009. Furthermore, the employment rate observed <b>for</b> <b>GSMs</b> in 2005 is approximately 0.8, whereas for Employer Sponsored migrants it is close to 1.0. Hence, all else being equal, the shift in weight toward demand-driven Employer Sponsored visas should have increased employment rates by around 5 percentage points (= 0.2 × 0.25). As the treatment effects calculated <b>for</b> <b>GSMs</b> are significantly greater than 5 percentage points, augmenting the regression sample to include Employer Sponsored migrants dampens {{the magnitude of the}} estimated treatment effects.|$|R

30|$|As {{noted in}} Section 3.4, we allow for {{important}} compositional differences between our treatment and control populations by including in all regression specifications controls for marriage, dependent children, employed spouses, and onshore visa applicants, {{in addition to}} full interactions with a gender dummy. Beyond this basic set of controls, the only characteristics included in specification 1 are the dummy variables that are required for a DiD analysis. This restricted specification is designed to identify a “full” measure {{of the effects of}} policy on employment rates on the assumption that policy drives all other temporal variation in underlying characteristics between Family Stream and Skill Stream migrants. The estimates reported in Table  3 for specification 1 indicate full treatment effects of approximately 14 percentage points <b>for</b> <b>GSMs</b> in isolation and 12 percentage points <b>for</b> <b>GSMs</b> pooled with Employer Sponsored migrants.|$|R
25|$|Later, American {{scientists}} {{outlined a}} theoretical attack against SIM cards used <b>for</b> <b>GSM</b> mobile phones. Together with hackers from the Chaos Computer Club, Floricic successfully created a working clone {{of such a}} SIM card, thus showing the practicability of the attack. He also engaged in cloning the German phonecard and succeeded. While Floricic only wanted to demonstrate the insecurity of the system, the proven insecurity was also abused by criminals {{which led to the}} attention of law enforcement agencies and the German national phone operator Deutsche Telekom. After Deutsche Telekom changed the system, Floricic tried to remove a complete public card phone from a booth by force (using a sledgehammer) on 3 March 1995 in order to, as he told, adapt his phonecard simulators to the latest changes. He and a friend were, however, caught by the police upon this attempt. Floricic was later sentenced to a prison term of 15 months which was suspended to probation.|$|E

2500|$|In Australia, {{the variety}} (known there as Mataro) {{has had a}} long history in the country with plantings dating back to the mid-19th century.

While historically the variety was used mainly as an anonymous blending grape in fortified wines, the variety saw a rise in interest in the 1990s as producers started receiving acclaim <b>for</b> <b>GSM</b> (Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre) [...] blends (many from the surviving, low yield old vine plantings). With a slight increase in planting there were more than 1000 ha of Mataro in Australia by the mid-2000s.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{international}} telephone network, {{the format of}} telephone numbers is standardized by ITU-T recommendation E.164.

For most countries, {{this is followed by}} an area code or city code and the subscriber number, which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange. ITU-T recommendation E.123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print, starting with a plus sign ("+") and the country code. When calling an international number from a landline phone, the + must be replaced with {{the international}} call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made from.
