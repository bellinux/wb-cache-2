50|$|Little {{is known}} on the matting and {{reproduction}} behaviors of Red fruit bats. What is known is that males show {{a tendency to}} mate <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> rather than <b>the</b> rainy seasons. Females will mate year round, showing that females are polyestrus. Seasons also affect embryo size. Smaller embryos appear more <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>seasons</b> than <b>during</b> rainy seasons.When pups are born they are covered in fur, the face is pink and has no hair, and their eyes are open. At birth they are 45 mm long, forearm length of 29.4 mm, and have a wingspan of 201 mm.|$|R

5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant mouse lemur {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.|$|E

Hybridization in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in the genus Dendrocygna.|$|E
40|$|We used traps baited {{with fruit}} {{to examine how}} the {{temporal}} variation of butterflies within primary forest in Sabah, Borneo differed between species. In addition, we compared patterns of temporal variation in primary and selectively logged forest, and we tested the hypothesis that selective logging has different recorded impacts on species diversity of adults <b>during</b> <b>the</b> wet monsoon period and <b>the</b> <b>drier</b> remaining half of the year. Species of Satyrinae and Morphinae had significantly less-restricted flight periods than did species of Nymphalinae and Charaxinae, which were sampled mainly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>drier</b> <b>season.</b> especially in primary forest. Species diversity of adults was significantly higher <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>drier</b> <b>season</b> in primary forest, but did not differ between seasons in logged forest. As a consequence, logging had opposite recorded impacts on diversity during wetter and drier seasons: primary forest had significantly higher diversity than logged forest <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>drier</b> <b>season</b> but significantly lower diversity than logged forest <b>during</b> <b>the</b> wetter monsoon season. The {{results of this study}} have important implications for the assessment of biodiversity in tropical rain forests, particularly in relation to habitat disturbance: short-term assessments that do not take account of seasonal variation in abundance are likely to produce misleading results, even in regions where the seasonal variation in rainfall is not that great...|$|R

5|$|The {{species is}} found in several microhabitats, but most often on rocks. Although {{predominantly}} ground-dwelling, {{it is a good}} climber.

The Noronha skink is oviparous (egg-laying), like many Trachylepis, but unlike Mabuya, which are all viviparous (giving live birth).|$|E
5|$|Among the {{agricultural}} activities practised <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> which halts {{work in the}} rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E

5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While they {{sometimes}} live solitarily, {{they are more}} commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist {{of as many as}} 50 or 100 individuals <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season</b> when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b> Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited Port Moresby in June 1942, {{and noted}} that the {{garrison}} had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off it <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season,</b> and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.|$|E

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse lemurs, such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
