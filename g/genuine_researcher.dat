This study reports the results of a semester-long ethnography of a writing-intensive textile and apparel management class that uses personal academic argument. Tracing the changing definition of the personal through the writing assignments, and examining the professor's evaluation of papers showed that personal writing was used to teach students the critical thinking necessary for careers in textile and apparel management. Student interviews show that students enjoy personal writing but do not always understand why it is important, and tend to see research as an imposition on personal writing. The writing itself reveals that in blending the personal and the academic, students were able to adopt the position of a <b>genuine</b> <b>researcher,</b> gain self-awareness, and acquire a sense of their own social and cultural constructions. Finally, the study shows how the assignments in the class alleviated many of the problems commonly associated with personal writing, and concludes that personal writing has a rightful place in the composition curriculum because of the nuanced ways it is being used in writing across the curriculum...|$|E

All of the pottery fragments found {{so far are}} small or miniature shards. Part of the controversy {{is that some of}} the [...] "shards" [...] are natural geofacts and others lack any proof of any connections, as with the dated pieces of wood, with the purported [...] "ruins" [...] found by NIOT researchers. In addition, their small size also raises the possibility that the real shards have been transported from elsewhere by local, strong tidal currents. But if the pottery is <b>genuine,</b> <b>researchers</b> say it should show some similarities to Harappan pottery, which is typically red and black and stamped with seals. Based on the current pottery collection, a stylistic continuity of Harappan civilization isn't evident. The small size of the artifact collection makes it difficult to analyse the pottery conclusively.|$|R

The children’s own activity in the research of the “milk path” (grass-cow-milk-dairy-dairy products-ice cream-shop) is presented. The first part of the theoretical part summarises what natural science for children should be like, presents learning according to High/Scoop’s preschool curriculum, and describes the closed-ended research method. The second part touches upon the living environment and the meaning of a healthy diet, milk and dairy products to be exact. The empirical part includes the research data in which 64 preschool children participated in the age group from 5 to 6 years. The questions in the questionnaire are structured to reveal their perceptions of the importance of milk for the human organism, where we get milk from, what dairy products are, etc. The practical part includes active participation and getting the children acquainted with the close and wider social and living environment. Following the introductory activity (a surprise box), children were introduced to the research problem and were completely motivated for their research and game. They became <b>genuine</b> little <b>researchers</b> who found themselves in a multitude of information. Through the project, they became acquainted with the work on a farm, the animals that give milk, the work in dairies, different dairy products, and, last but not least, the entire path “from grass to ice cream”. In the process of research, they developed a sense of mutual cooperation and the ability of critical evaluation, and gained new knowledge and information. Children’s curiosity, their innate desire to explore and their own activity led them to new findings. This was also demonstrated by the final questionnaire given to the children, because their perception changed drastically after the completed activities. ...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{commercialization of}} {{research}} with {{its effect on}} the ethical conduct of researchers, and the advancement of scientific knowledge with {{its effect on the}} welfare or otherwise of patients, are areas of pressing concern today and need a serious, thorough study. Biomedical research, and its forward march, is becoming increasingly dependent on industry-academia proximity, both commercial and geographic. A realization of the commercial value of academic biomedical research coupled with its rapid and efficient utilization by industry is the major propelling force here. A number of well-intentioned writers in the field look to the whole development with optimism. But this partnership is a double-edged sword, for it carries with it the potential of an exciting future as much as the prospect of misappropriation and malevolence. Moreover, such partnerships have sometimes eroded public trust in the research enterprise itself. Connected to the growing clout of industry in institutions is concern about the commercialization of research and resolving the 'patient or product' loyalty. There is ambivalence about industry funding and influence in academia, and a consequent 'approach-avoidance' conflict. If academia has to provide the patients and research talent, industry necessarily has to provide the finances and other facilities based on it. This is an invariable and essential agreement between the two parties that they can walk out of only at their own peril. The profound ethical concerns that industry funded research has brought center-stage need a close look, especially as they impact patients, research subjects, public trust, marketability of products, and research and professional credibility. How can the intermediate goal of industry (patient welfare) serve the purpose of the final goal of academia is the basic struggle for conscientious research institutions /associations. And how best the goal of maximizing profits can be best served, albeit suitably camouflaged as patient welfare throughout, is the concern of the pharmaceutical industry. A very great potential conflict of interest {{lies in the fact that}} academia needs the sophisticated instruments that only big funding can provide, while at the same time resists the attempts of the fund provider to set the agenda of research, protocol, design, publication, the works. Conflicts arise at many steps and levels of functioning, and are related to the expectations, competing interests, and conflicting priorities of the different entities involved, whether they are the academic medical centers, the funding agencies, the patients and their families, or the investors and venture capitalists. The public expects access to new treatments. Its appetite for innovation has been bolstered by the constant attention given by the press to new treatments and by the implicit promise from researchers of continuing advances. Similarly, patients demand privacy and control over information about themselves. It makes greater sense for <b>genuine</b> <b>researchers</b> to associate with large long-term industry players who have a track record of genuine hard-core discoveries, even if the process is slow (maybe), and the funding less (may not be). The element of control venture capitalists exert over the pharmaceutical industry is an under researched area for obvious reasons. But it needs further probing, for that will lay bare the pulls and pressures under which industry works. It makes sense for ethically minded researchers and institutions not to fall in the trap of stocks and equity investments in industry, howsoever attractive they appear, and get rid of them as soon as possible if they have them. If at all they want, it makes more sense to own stocks of larger well established concerns, for the stock upheavals being less, the pressure of the market-place, and of venture sharks, is likely to be lower too. While active participation by the researcher in the commercialization process may be greatly desired by industry, ostensibly in the name of creating value, academia must realize it is a bait it might find hard to swallow in the long run. It makes more sense for the researcher and institution to forego such temptations and/or walk out of such investments as soon as possible. While mainstream medicine and research are booming, as is connected industry, concerns about professional commitment to patient welfare are growing too. Increasing corporate influence is challenging certain long held and fundamental values of patient care, which will have far reaching implications for biomedical care and the future progress of mainstream medicine...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there is}} {{increasing}} recognition {{of the need for}} research in developing countries where disease burden is high. Understanding the role of local factors is important for undertaking ethical research in developing countries. We explored factors relating to information and communication during the process of informed consent, and the approach that should be followed for gaining consent. The study was conducted prior to a family-based genetic study among people with podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) in southern Ethiopia. We adapted a method of rapid assessment validated in The Gambia. The methodology was entirely qualitative, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews. Discussions were conducted with podoconiosis patients and non-patients in the community, fieldworkers, researchers, staff of the local non-governmental organisation (NGO) working on prevention and treatment of podoconiosis, and community leaders. We found that the extent of use of everyday language, the degree to which expectations of potential participants were addressed, and the techniques of presentation of information had considerable impact on comprehension of information provided about research. Approaching podoconiosis patients via locally trusted individuals and preceding individual consent with community sensitization were considered the optimal means of communication. Prevailing poverty among podoconiosis patients, the absence of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local NGO were identified as potential barriers for obtaining <b>genuine</b> informed consent. <b>Researchers</b> should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes in providing appropriate information in a comprehensible manner and in supporting voluntary decision-making on a study-by-study basis...|$|R
40|$|Chlorine is broadly {{used for}} water {{disinfection}} {{at the final}} stage of water treatment because of its high performance to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms, its lower cost compared to other well-known disinfectants and its simple operational needs. However, reaction of chlorine {{with a wide range of}} organic and inorganic substances in water causes its decay and formation of chlorinated by-products, which are in some cases carcinogenic and harmful to human health. The major challenge is balancing the risk from these with the cost of operation needed to mitigate the impact. These challenges highlights the importance of having a robust modelling approach for chlorine decay in bulk water as a pre-required step to model the chlorine decay and formation of its by-products in the whole distribution system. In this study, initially, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate and evaluate all existing modelling approaches for chlorine decay prediction especially in bulk water. Among all existing modelling schemes, three models were paid more attention due to their popularity and/or fundamentally valid background. They are first order model, second order model and parallel second order model. During the literature review, comparing the effectiveness of the second order model (SOM) proposed by Clark (1998) with the parallel second order model (PSOM) offered by Kastl et al., (1999), the author found that these two models are both fundamentally sound, although the PSOM had better capability in terms of data fitting, and representing the chlorine decay behaviour is much better than SOM. However, non-existence of analytical solution for PSOM was found to be the major negative point for wide adaptation of PSOM compared to SOM. Trying to understand the basic principles of both models, it was understood that the formulation of SOM was <b>genuine</b> and the <b>researchers</b> who claimed that Clark (1998) made a mistake in deriving the analytical solution were proved wrong. This resulted in having the first publication as a comment in Water Research (Fisher et al., 2010 b; Appendix A 3). Further study was performed on how SOM was formulated and attempts were made to apply the same methodology to PSOM in order to arrive at an analytical solution. Consequently, making a reasonable assumption, an analytical solution for the parallel second order model was formulated and evaluated against the existing numerical method. As the case study of this research, initially, the previous chlorine decay data from Pilbara Water Treatment Plant was fitted to a first order reaction scheme and it was proved that the data did not comply with it. This was an expected result and the need for other model was validated. For further analysis, fresh water samples were collected from Pilbara Water Treatment Plant to perform chlorine decay tests. Temperature effect on the behaviour of chlorine decay in the bulk water was investigated by integrating Arrhenius equation with PSOM. Three methods of temperature analysis were compared and the best one was recommended for practical application. It was shown that the model was capable enough to properly display the chlorine decay profile when temperature varies. The thesis consists of eight chapters. In chapter 1, a brief description of the research background and the overall objectives of the research are given. Chapter 2 focuses on providing a comprehensive literature review about all involved aspects as well as chlorine decay modelling background. Chapter 3 discusses the methodology and analytical methods for conducting laboratory experiments. Chapter 4 gives a prove that the first order decay model does not show accurate results for chlorine decay prediction and the parallel second order model is much more accurate in predicting chlorine concentration. In Chapter 5, the main part of this research, an analytical solution for the parallel second order model is developed. Chapter 6 evaluates the effectiveness of the parallel second order model against the first and second order model. Within chapter 7, temperature effect on the chlorine decay behaviour and the selected modelling approach is evaluated and chapter 8 gives a brief conclusion and recommendation...|$|R
40|$|Private {{investment}} in biomedical research has {{increased over the}} last few decades. At most places it has been welcomed as {{the next best thing to}} technology itself. There are significant costs involved too. Major areas of conflict of interest especially applicable to biomedical research have arisen, as academia interacts with industry. Pharma image stinks because of a number of errors of omission and commission. A recent example is suppression of negative findings about Bayer's Trasylol (Aprotinin) and the marketing maneuvers of Eli Lilly's Xigris (rhAPC). A voluntary moratorium over pharma spending to pamper drug prescribers is necessary. The integrity of industry-sponsored clinical research has come under increasing scrutiny. The basic shizm is between the value system of a patient welfare driven professional and that of a profit driven industry. While one wants to avoid control but wants the dough, the other wants to exercise the control by supplying the dough. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are considered important as they guide diagnostic/therapeutic regimen of a large number of medical professionals and hospitals and provide recommendations on drugs, dosages and criteria for selection. Besides clinical trials, they are another area of growing influence by the pharmaceutical industry. For example, in a recent survey it was found that about 60 % of 192 authors of clinical practice guidelines reported they had financial connections with the companies whose drugs were under consideration. This finding casts serious doubt on the credibility of this important pillar of modern clinical practice. It needs urgent reparative action. One of them is prospective and retrospective disclosure of financial conflict of interest by authors of CPGs. A Conference on Guideline Standardization (COGS) was convened in April 2002 'to define a standard for guideline reporting that would promote guideline quality and facilitate implementation'. It includes items for standardization, conceptual issues, up gradation, conflict of interest, patient interest and systematization. Even items for individual preferences, choice or values are not neglected. Special mention must be made of items that specify disclosure of conflict of interest both in the Developer (including the organization that develops and the individuals involved in the guideline's formulation), as well as in the sponsor or funding source (and its role in developing and/or reporting the guideline). Recommendations of CPGs and CDR panels are conflicting. One considers effectiveness, the other cost-effectiveness. However, CPGs do not adhere to established methodological standards; critical information that would attest to validity is regularly absent; explicit criteria to grade scientific evidence that supports their recommendations is absent from 82 % of guidelines; 87 % are not in a position to report whether a systematic literature search was performed; 67 % do not describe the type of professionals used in guidelines development; and there is marked variation in the quality of guidelines. Moreover, CPG guideline layers often are conflicted in their interests. The problem can be resolved to a large extent by taking a simple step: making CPG panelists go into cost effectiveness along with recommending Guidelines. What then happens is they have to consider not only effectiveness but also costs. Effectiveness can be fudged, cost cannot. Why? Because, what is the cost is well known. Therapies in Guidelines should be recommended and graded according to whether they are Most, Moderately or Least Cost Effective. For that CPGs will have to perform an economic analysis as well. This will meet with resistance for obvious reasons. Since guideline groups cannot be kept on the straight and narrow path and till we find fool proof ways of keeping them thus, we have no option but to stress that under no circumstances they can mislead, or get misled themselves, in the name of patient advocacy, to recommend costly new therapies which have still not proved their effectiveness conclusively, nor get away with conflicted recommendations, which it is still not obligatory to reveal. A simple rider like making it mandatory for guideline groups to go into both effectiveness and cost effectiveness takes care that this is ensured. The AGREE Collaboration (AGREE stands for Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation) has created and validated tools by which clinicians can themselves rate guidelines by identifying factors that determine their quality. To facilitate this process, a body like the GAC (Guidelines Advisory Committee) applies the AGREE criteria to individual guidelines and rates and endorses the best possible guideline. Clinical Practice Guidelines are another example of an excellent idea likely to go to seed due to sponsor manipulation and forces of the market place camouflaging as evidence based medicine. The need to weed out conflicted experts and make the process of therapy selection transparent must go hand in hand with laying down clear-cut criteria for guideline formulation and rejection of conflicted submissions by vigilant journal publication policies and editors. A number of disease-specific foundations are heavily funded by industry that creates serious conflict of interest likely to result in favourably recommending therapies of sponsors. The case of Alteplase and the American Heart Foundation is a recent example. Whistle blowing papers and research to expose misdemeanours must be undertaken and journals and their editors should welcome such papers as legitimate research, without encouraging a witch-hunt. The USP of journals and researchers is credibility. Credibility can be marketed, but it can't be bought. Sponsors will be forced to seek such credibility without allowing them to compromise it. Such is the game journal publishers/editors and <b>genuine</b> <b>researchers</b> will have to play with sponsors. But they can do so only if they are thoroughly competent and have abiding faith in an uncompromising set of ethical values. The Task Force of the AAMC, in its two reports of 2001 and 2002, recognises the necessity and inevitability of the academia-industry connect, but wants to avoid its undesirable influence on the integrity of research and the welfare of human research subjects. It is specially concerned that public, activist and governmental control and concern does not cast a spanner in the works of a potentially promising relationship. Constant pampering by sponsors has dulled most drug prescribers' critical capabilities. Sponsorship is a potent anaeasthetic to many ethical concerns. It can blunt the thrust of many a sabre-rattling critic. Both medical associations and research journal editors are getting concerned with individual and institutional conflicts of interest in the conduct of clinical research and documents are now available which address these issues. Edits are concerned with whether academic medicine is for sale (Angell, in N Engl J Med 2000); what are the controlling interests of research (Editorial, CMAJ, 2002 a); how the invisible hand of the marketing department works (Editorial, CMAJ, 2002 b); how contracts affect institutions and academic freedom (Drazen in N Engl J Med, 2002); what are the choices for the academic medical center in collaborating with industry - (Moses et al in N Engl J Med, 2002); how does one ensure integrity of scientific research (Editorial, Lancet, 2002); how one maintains public trust in clinical research (Kelch in N Engl J Med, 2002); how does one ensure academic freedom in clinical research (Nathan and Weatherall, editorial, in N Engl J Med 2002); how to maintain the integrity of the scientific record (Smith R. : [editorial]. BMJ 2001); and is the university-industrial complex going out of control? (Nature, 2001). The 2001 ICMJE revision call for full disclosure of the sponsor's role in research, as well as assurance that investigators are independent of sponsors, are fully accountable for the design and conduct of the trial, have independent access to all trial data and control all editorial and publication decisions. ICMJE has taken an important step in ensuring greater accountability in the research process, its publication and preventing possible malevolent impact on gullible readers. However the findings of a 2002 study suggest that academic institutions routinely participate in clinical research that does not adhere to ICMJE standards of accountability, access to data and control of publication. An issue of major concern is protection of the interests of research subjects because patients agree to become research subjects not only for personal medical benefit but, as an extension, to benefit the rest of the patient population and also advance medical research. These interests are hardly served if research data is doctored or concealed, as can happen to protect industry interests or if industry dictates the terms and conditions of research contracts. The progress of biomedical research depends on ready availability of research subjects. But such ready availability depends on ethical practices by researchers and sponsoring agencies. The clear-cut power to protect research subjects' interests should be inbuilt in the contract process. Establishment of Best Practice Guidelines for researchers and academic medical centers and Good Publication Practice for sponsoring pharmaceuticals are two important developments worth a close study and replication to assess feasibility across diverse geographical areas. Another area of concern is pharma's focus on the marketability rather than usefulness of products. There is an inevitable slant to produce not necessarily useful but marketable products which ensure profitability of industry and research grants outflow to academia. A disturbing but very relevant finding in this connection is that drugs which can be called "substantial improvements" over available treatments is only, mark the finding, a measly 6 %. Industry supports new therapies, not traditional therapy, irrespective of what is effective. Whatever traditional therapy is supported is also most probably because the industry concerned has a product with a big stake there, which has remained a 'gold standard' or which that player thinks still has some 'juice' left. The larger issue of benefit to society also concerns us here when we realize that industry sponsorship is mainly for potential medications, not for trying to determine whether there may be non-pharmacological interventions that may be equally good, if not better. This is the reason why methods like yoga, psychotherapy, meditation, non-medicated non-mechanised relaxation will not find industry sponsors readily and will never be proved useful apart from anecdotal reporting. In the paradigm shift towards biological psychiatry, the role of industry sponsorship is not overt but probably more pervasive than many have realized or the right thinking may consider good for the health of the branch in the long run. Ask yourself a simple question: Why should industry sponsor psychotherapeutic research? And why should industry not sponsor biological research? Which of the two will give rise to drugs? How will the profits pour in? The answer is simple enough. Essentially, there are four types of drugs. First, drugs that work and have minimal side-effects; second, drugs which work but have serious side-effects; third, drugs that do not work but have minimal side-effects; and fourth, drugs which work minimally but have serious side-effects. Pharma's major propelling force can only be producing the first type. They accept the second type only till they can lay their hands on the first and, in any case, never project or accept them as the first. The third type can be occasionally played around with to shore up profits, but never by projecting them as the first type. The fourth type are the laggards, a real threat to credibility and therefore do not deserve any market hype or promotion. What makes pharma adopt even questionable means to make profits? Reasons are mainly three: one, pharma business cannot depend only on genuine discoveries; second, newer drugs with no effect are also with no, or little, side-effects - and that helps; and third, image building needs to balance profit with shored up credibility. Industry players have to strike the right balance between profit making and credibility. In profit making, the marketing champions play their role. In credibility ratings, researchers and paid spokes-persons play their role. All is hunky dory till marketing is based on credibility. When there is nothing available to make for credibility, something is projected as one and marketing carried out, in the calculated hope that profits can accrue, since that must continue endlessly. That is what makes pharma adopt even questionable means to make profits. The process of self-correction set into motion due to greater clout of conscientious researchers, unrelenting expose by medical journalists and supportive editors, patients right activism and law suits against industry will, hopefully, help tilt the balance towards value-based advance, even if belated, and done grudgingly. Major industry players may soften the offensive of such self-correction only by playing the game according to the rules. The earlier the major players understand this, the better it is for all concerned...|$|R
