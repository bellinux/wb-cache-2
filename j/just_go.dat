5|$|Meanwhile, Victor and {{his mother}} scream at each other because she had had sex with Oscar, {{and because of that}} Victor had {{informed}} the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should <b>just</b> <b>go</b> kill himself.|$|E

She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should <b>just</b> <b>go.</b> Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E
5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll <b>just</b> <b>go</b> elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|After her {{exit from}} The Hills, Montag auditioned for the {{replacement}} of Megan Fox in the third installment of the Transformers series, but was ultimately not featured in the film. In June 2010, she and producer Steve Morales commenced work on her unreleased second studio album. The following month, Montag filed for divorce from Pratt, citing irreconcilable differences in the petition. However, they called it off in September after confessing that the action was intended to boost Montag's ailing career. In November, they renewed their vows in Carpinteria, California. In February 2011, Montag made her feature film debut as Kimberly in <b>Just</b> <b>Go</b> with It. Later that year, she appeared on the VH1 reality television series Famous Food, where she competed against other celebrities for a partnership stake in a restaurant in which they worked to open. In October, Montag began writing a memoir. The following year, she released her third extended play Dreams Come True.|$|E

5|$|Drug use {{is often}} portrayed in {{conjunction}} with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries. Jimbo and Cartman both use the term hippie pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should <b>just</b> <b>go</b> to a Grateful Dead concert, to which Mackey says he can't since Jerry Garcia is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching Teletubbies while high on marijuana or in rehab. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented with the drug.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{receives}} a text from Robert California (James Spader) inviting {{him on the}} trip to Tallahassee.

The final team includes Cathy, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Jim, infuriating Dwight. At first he tries to convince the members to change their minds, but after realizing they all have excellent ideas for the project, he is content with the team.|$|E

25|$|A cricket ball is not {{a perfect}} sphere. The seam of the ball is the {{circular}} stitching which joins {{the two halves of}} the cricket ball. Hence, the seam joining the pieces of leather is circumferential and the stitching is noticeably raised. If the ball is bowled {{in such a way that}} the seam hits the pitch when it bounces, this irregularity can cause the ball to deviate sideways in its path. It may move in any direction, or <b>just</b> <b>go</b> straight. The batsman has to see how the ball moves after pitching to select his shot.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson {{discusses}} an experimental school Quest 2 Learn. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming.

This model, according to Davidson, has the potential {{to address the needs of}} children who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as ADHD or autism, allowing them to learn in ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements.|$|E
