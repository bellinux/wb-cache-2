500|$|... "The Transformation" [...] first {{aired on}} February 3, 2009 in the United States, and was watched by an {{estimated}} 12.78 million viewers. The episode earned a 5/6.5 ratings share among viewers aged 18–49, {{meaning that it}} was seen by 5.0 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6.5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television {{at the time of}} broadcast. This rating meant it ranked eighth for the week among all the major networks. Sarah Stegall of SFScope attributed this ratings success to its lead-in show, the highly-rated American Idol, and observed that [...] "with episodes like this one, mixing action, horror, and a few tender moments, it looks like Fringe <b>is</b> <b>hitting</b> its stride with viewers." ...|$|E

Murray thought the climax was [...] "so exciting" [...] that he was willing [...] "to forgive {{the fact that this is}} the third week in a row that Walter's big idea has involved some kind of communication with the unconscious".

Fickett expressed worriment that Fringe would eventually become too formulaic, much like the first season of Smallville, and concluded his review by calling Fringe [...] "a solid show, but [...] exceptional yet".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{focus on}} {{emotions}} was sparked by Chen, {{who felt that}} {{the primary purpose of}} entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. Chen tried to make the game focus more on emotions than on a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt there was a message of promoting green energy in the game. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. He summarized this view by saying that the only gameplay mechanic <b>is</b> <b>hitting</b> a flower to trigger a new event. The team specifically cut out deeper gameplay elements because these would have added [...] "challenge" [...] to the game, which, while fun, would not have been relaxing. Sony Santa Monica contracted with Bluepoint Games to create ports of the game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the PlayStation 4. [...] An iOS version was released in September 2017, published by Annapurna Interactive.|$|E
