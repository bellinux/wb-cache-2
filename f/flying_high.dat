5|$|Florida State University {{is one of}} two collegiate {{schools in}} the country to have a circus. The FSU <b>Flying</b> <b>High</b> Circus is a three-ring circus that has {{performances}} during the Fall semester (for Parents' Weekend) and Spring semester (their annual homeshow). The circus, founded in 1947 by Jack Haskin, in an extracurricular activity under the Division of Student Affairs that any FSU student may join. Student performers in the circus practice daily, much like any other school sport. The performers help rig their equipment and sew their own costumes. Performances occur in April under the Big Top circus tent.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's old injury {{continued}} to trouble {{him and he}} found <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> performance aircraft like the Spitfire extremely painful. RAF medics gave him two options; he could have an operation that would correct the problem, but this meant he would miss the Battle of Britain, or becoming a training instructor flying the light Tiger Moth. Johnson opted for the operation. He had hoped for discreet treatment, but word soon reached the CO, and Johnson was taken off flying duties {{and sent to the}} RAF Hospital at Rauceby. He did not return to the squadron until 28 December 1940. CO Burton took Johnson up for a test flight on 31 December 1940 in Miles Magister L8151. After the 45-minute flight, Johnson's fitness to fly was approved.|$|E
5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} seen <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
5|$|Finucane took {{leave in}} early September and his award {{for a second}} Bar was gazetted on 9 September. Circus 100B was flown on 20 September 1941. A three pronged attack was planned {{involving}} 23 squadrons and 270 Spitfires with bomber units acting as decoys. The Kenley wing was to provide escort for bombers hitting marshalling yards at Abbeville. 452 {{was one of three}} squadrons <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> cover. Immediately after crossing the coast at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme they were engaged by enemy aircraft. Finucane hit a Bf 109 which exploded forcing him to fly through the debris but within minutes 452 had lost three Spitfires. Finding himself and his wingman, Sergeant Chisholm alone he shot down a Bf 109 that attempted to attack his squadron-mate. He followed it briefly and it caught fire while emitting white smoke. Another Bf 109 turned in to attack Finucane but was shot down by Chisholm. Fighting their way back to the Channel Finucane dived and shot down a Bf 109 which went into a spin before he lost sight of it at approximately 500ft. Three successes had inflated Finucane's tally to 17.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{championship}} win, Palace {{started their}} second {{season as a}} club in the Southern League First Division, placing 19th {{at the end of}} the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating Rotherham County in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to Newcastle United in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another championship. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Crystal Palace scored through Horace Astley against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock 1–0 win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of Fulham and Brentford respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club Everton, currently <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4–0 winners.|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
25|$|In the April 1957 West Freugh {{incident}} in Scotland, {{named after the}} principal military base involved, two unidentified objects <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> over the UK were tracked by radar operators. The objects were reported to operate at speeds and perform maneuvers beyond the capability of any known craft. Also significant is their alleged size, which– based on the radar returns – was closer {{to that of a}} ship than an aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Sęp {{was cleared}} for cloud <b>flying,</b> <b>high</b> speeds and basic {{aerobatics}} with comparable performance with foreign contemporaries {{such as the}} DFS Weihe and its derivative the Slingsby T.34 Sky. Tests were satisfactory and the prototype (markings SP-443) {{was taken to the}} international glider meet held at Samedan, Switzerland in July 1947. The glider met with an interest there, being one of the first new postwar designs, and Adam Zientek achieved eighth place, winning a speed task on a closed circuit.|$|E
60|$|Again Pereira loaded. By {{the time}} that he was ready more geese were approaching, this time in a {{triangle}} of seven birds, their leader being at the point of the triangle, which was <b>flying</b> <b>higher</b> than those that had gone before. He fired, and down came not one bird, but two, namely, the captain and the goose to the right of and a little behind it.|$|R
60|$|By now {{the geese}} were coming thick, {{for the flight}} was at its full. Only, either because some of those that had already passed had sighted the Kaffirs {{collecting}} the fallen birds and risen--an example which the others noted from afar and followed--or because in an unknown way warning of their danger had been conveyed to them, they were <b>flying</b> <b>higher</b> and faster than the first arrivals.|$|R

25|$|While patrolling between Cap Bon and Cap Mustafà on 20 April 1943, Italian fighters {{spotted a}} large enemy {{formation}} 35km (22mi) west of Pantelleria. The Italians started {{to close in}} to the aircraft of Nos. 1, 92, 417, and 601 SAAF Squadrons, which were flying at low level, but were surprised by six Polish pilots of 145 Squadron <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> cover. These were joined by other Spitfires, and the 33 Macchis found themselves in combat with up to 60 Spitfires (mainly Mk VCs, and possibly Mk VIIIs and IXs). The Italian pilots claimed 15 victories (one by Maresciallo Baschirotto, who fired 500 rounds), with 14 Spitfires downed in the sea and another over African soil.|$|E
25|$|It {{became evident}} that the new fighters could make long, steep dives and that the fixed, {{synchronised}} machine gun was aimed by aiming the aircraft. The machine gun was belt-fed, unlike the drum-fed Lewis guns of their opponents. The Fokker pilots took to <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> and diving on their quarry, usually out of the sun, firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range. If the British aircraft had not been shot down, the German pilot could climb again and repeat the process. Immelmann invented the Immelmann turn, a zoom after the dive, followed by a roll when vertical, to face the opposite way, after which he could turn to attack again.|$|E
25|$|Bill Harkins Field at the Manley R. Whitcomb Band Complex is an {{artificial}} turf with rubber fill field built near the <b>Flying</b> <b>High</b> Circus on Chieftain Way. The field is an exact replica of what Bobby Bowden field looked like on game {{days at the}} time of the field's construction. Since then several alterations have been made to the actual field. Bill Harkins, head coach of the men's lacrosse team from 2004 to 2013, donated $350,000 towards the construction of the new field. Previously the space was a grassy field that often alternated between dusty and muddy. The Florida State University Marching Chiefs have primary use of the field and use it for their daily practices. The football team and lacrosse teams have secondary use of the field with the lacrosse team using the field for practices and games. The football team sometimes uses the practice field in anticipation of games at stadiums with artificial turf.|$|E
50|$|Atmosphere — In {{order to}} {{minimize}} gravity drag the vehicle should begin gaining horizontal speed as soon as possible. On an airless body such as the Moon this presents no problem, however on a planet with a dense atmosphere this is not possible. A trade-off exists between <b>flying</b> <b>higher</b> before starting downrange acceleration, thus increasing gravity drag losses; or starting downrange acceleration earlier, reducing gravity drag but increasing the aerodynamic drag experienced during launch.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s when {{supersonic}} transport (SST) designs were being actively pursued, {{it was thought}} that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by <b>flying</b> <b>higher.</b> This assumption was proven false when the North American B-70 Valkyrie started flying, and {{it was found that the}} boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000 m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.|$|R
50|$|The {{computer}} system monitors stability and the vehicle {{has only two}} controls, one for speed and direction {{and the other for}} altitude.

25|$|The opening {{match was}} a tag team match between the {{brothers}} Chris and Alan Stone {{taking on the}} regular team of Ricky Marvin and Sombra de Plata in a high <b>flying,</b> <b>high</b> speed opening match. The first fall ended when both Stone brothers were counted {{out of the ring}}, following a couple of high flying moves from Marvin and Sombra de Plata to the floor. The second match saw Alan Stone pin Sombra de Plata and Chris pinned Ricky Marvin to tie the match at one fall a piece. In the third fall Ricky Marvin pinned Chris Stone, followed by Alan Stone being counted out after a dive out of the ring ended up hurting him. With the count-out Ricky Marvin and Sombra de Plata won the match, two falls to one in 18 minutes and 29 seconds. The second match of the night, the first six-man tag team match, the most common match type in Lucha Libre, especially in CMLL, featured the tecnico team of Tony Rivera, El Felino and Safari taking on the experienced rudo team of Violencia, Bestia Salvaje and Fuerza Guerrera. In the first of a total of three falls Tony Rivera pinned Bestia Salvaje to take the first fall for himself, Felino and Safari. In the second fall Fuerza Guerrera used underhanded tactics to gain the advantage, pinning El Felino to even the score between the two teams. The match lasted 21 minutes and 15 seconds before Fuerza Guerrera repeated his feat in the second fall and pinned El Felino once more to win the match for his team.|$|E
25|$|Kepford's {{next big}} day arrived on 19 February. VF-17 was {{assigned}} fighter escort duty, shepherding single engine bombers to strikes on Lakunai Airfield. Kepford was again assigned as division leader, {{this time for}} one of two groups <b>flying</b> <b>high</b> cover. His wingman had engine problems and was quickly forced to return to Piva. Arriving at the target site, Kepford decided there was enough fighter cover {{and that he was}} too vulnerable without a wingman, so he too headed back for home base. En route, he spotted a Rufe flying low on the water. Kepford pounced on the vulnerable float plane and easily shot it down. Immediately after, a mass of 20 or so enemy fighters spotted Kepford flying alone beneath them and dove on the vulnerable pilot. He was quickly penned in by four enemy aircraft and forced to head north, away from his base. He used his plane's water injection—a new feature installed on a small number of Corsairs—to help him pull as far ahead of the enemies as possible, but the device worked fitfully. He tried to lose them flying low over land, without success. Deciding he was moving too far afield to return to base on remaining fuel reserves, Kepford quickly cut to the left and reversed direction south over the water. The plane following Kepford on the left side attempted to turn inside to shoot him down, but the pilot misjudged his altitude and struck his wing into the water below, crashing. Those on the right side lost too much ground when Kepford reversed, so they gave up the chase.|$|E
