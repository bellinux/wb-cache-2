5|$|Lemuriforms are {{currently}} {{thought to have}} evolved <b>in</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the Paleocene (66 to 55mya). Stem lemuriforms, including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri, have been found <b>in</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, Plesiopithecus, a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, {{is thought to be}} most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, Djebelemur, ‘Anchomomys’ milleri, and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.|$|E

5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates <b>in</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E

In July of that year, while assigned to the East Asia Division, Bussard and Falke assisted in the suppression of Mata'afa Iosefo's revolt in Samoa, along with a British corvette.
