Holes were cut through the barge to allow 26 {{hoisting}} cables to pass through. The team manufactured 26 giant <b>cable</b> <b>reels</b> to hold the more than [...] of cable {{to be used to}} raise the ship. The giant <b>cable</b> <b>reels</b> fed 26 huge hydraulic strand jacks, each mounted on a computer-controlled, pressurised pneumatic heave compensator powered by hydrogen gas that automatically adjusted for sea waves.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical motion {{tracking}} systems like Gametrak use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in three-dimensional space in real time. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> {{and a small}} tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a ball joint such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure {{the rotation of the}} spool drum for the retracting <b>cable</b> <b>reel,</b> and calculating how far the cable is extended.|$|R

40|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> {{assembly}} {{is described}} which is particularly adapted for, {{but not limited}} to, a system for providing electrical connection of power and data signals between an orbiter vehicle, such as a space shuttle, and a recovered satellite. The assembly is comprised of two mutually opposing ring type structures having 180 deg relative rotation {{with one of the}} structures being held in fixed position while the other structure is rotatable. Motor controlled berthing latches and umbilical cable connectors for the satellite are located {{on the rim of the}} rotatable ring structure. The <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> assembly is fed in two sections from the orbiter vehicle into the outer rim portion of the fixed ring structure where they are directed inwardly and attached to two concentrically coiled metal bands whose respective ends are secured to inner and outer post members of circular sets of guide pins located on opposing circular plate members, one rotatable and one fixed. The cable sections are fed out as three output cable sections through openings in the central portion of the circular plate of the rotatable ring structure where they are directed to the latches and connectors located on its rim...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} stress distribution of side plates on the logging truck’s <b>cable</b> <b>reel,</b> {{and find the}} cause of side plates cracking, an elastic-plastic finite element model of three-dimension is set up. Based {{on a series of}} computations, the distributions of displacement and equivalent stress under the working conditions are analyzed, as well as the influence of the number of side plate floors on stress distribution. The results indicate the maximum equivalent stress is on the outside connection between side plate and <b>cable</b> <b>reel,</b> and the floors take the most part loads from steel cables. When the number of floors is greater than 11, increasing the floor number will not decrease the maximum equivalent stress obviously. The conclusion provides useful method and foundation for resolving floor cracking on logging trucks...|$|R
