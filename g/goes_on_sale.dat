500|$|Groupon and Travelzoo offered {{discounted}} {{tickets for}} the shows in London, Manchester and Birmingham. Rene Freling from Travelzoo explained that [...] "promoters are thinking, instead of shows being 90% sold out, they'd rather have it full and promote it to a wider audience." [...] 238 tickets were sold through Groupon within minutes of the offer, and 5,000 tickets were sold for the UK shows {{by the time the}} offer expired. The move divided opinions in the music industry of the United Kingdom: festival organizer Melvin Benn said that discounted tickets work [...] "particularly well for an awful lot of concerts. It's definitely emerging. In tough economic times people will look at varying ways of pricing their tickets." [...] Independent promoter John Rostrum called it [...] "very short-term" [...] and [...] "incredibly damaging for shows because in the future when a show <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>sale</b> people will sit back and go, 'I won't buy until the week before'". The October 30, 2011 concert in Birmingham was her first in the English Midlands since The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004.
