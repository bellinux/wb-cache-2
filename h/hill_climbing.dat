5|$|Weather {{conditions}} typically {{vary greatly}} depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive {{very little in}} low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid frost formation. As a result, gritting and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start {{and end of the}} snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes <b>hill</b> <b>climbing</b> demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high torque transmission systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight hairpin turns found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.|$|E

25|$|Achieving full {{acceleration}} or <b>hill</b> <b>climbing,</b> {{while avoiding}} engine speeds {{higher than a}} certain limit (e.g. 3000 or 4000 RPM), is difficult since it requires avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch. Avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch requires a good feel of the throttle pedal, but use of full throttle can still be achieved with a little sensitivity as the kick-down button is only activated beyond the normal full opening of the accelerator pedal.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{points of}} Lagrangians occur at saddle points, {{rather than at}} local maxima (or minima). Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as <b>hill</b> <b>climbing,</b> gradient descent, some of the quasi-Newton methods, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation to ensure that it's a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing {{the square of the}} gradient of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an optimization technique that finds stationary points (such as Newton's method without an extremum seeking line search) and not necessarily extrema.|$|E

25|$|Simple {{heuristics}} like <b>hill</b> <b>climbing,</b> which move {{by finding}} better neighbour after better neighbour and stop {{when they have}} reached a solution which has no neighbours that are better solutions, cannot guarantee to lead {{to any of the}} existing better solutions â€“ their outcome may easily be just a local optimum, while the actual best solution would be a global optimum. Metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solutions space, and although they prefer better neighbours, they also accept worse neighbours in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time.|$|E

50|$|A <b>hill</b> <b>climb</b> is a cycling event, {{as well as}} a basic {{skill of}} the sport. As events a <b>hill</b> <b>climb</b> may either be an {{individual}} time trial (which forbids cooperation, drafting, or team tactics) or a regular road race. A <b>hill</b> <b>climb</b> usually represents an event which gains altitude continuously, usually terminating at a summit. Well known <b>hill</b> <b>climbs</b> include the Mt. Evans <b>Hill</b> <b>Climb</b> and the Mount Washington Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb. The Cycle to the Sun race is a young race run on a volcano in Maui, Hawaii. <b>Hill</b> <b>climbs</b> occasionally feature in major professional races, such as the Tour de France, but they are usually referred to as mountain time trials, and are not necessarily from the bottom {{to the top of a}} hill, although they usually are (they can simply be a time trial over hilly terrain).|$|R

2500|$|Wildland {{firefighting}} requires {{vehicles that}} can easily negotiate difficult terrain and high-gradient roads, be self-reliant, and have high clearances for wheels and suspension. These wildland fire engines are traditionally smaller than standard fire apparatus and are primarily used for vegetation fires or wildland fires. They may also respond to emergencies in rough terrain where other vehicles cannot respond. Most wildland engines feature four-wheel drive capability to improve <b>hill</b> <b>climbing</b> and rough terrain capability. Some wildland apparatus can pump water while driving (compared to some traditional engines which must be stationary to pump water), allowing [...] "running attacks" [...] on vegetation fires to minimize the rate of spread.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier <b>hill</b> <b>climbing.</b> [...] All gears were vanadium steel running in an oil bath.|$|E
