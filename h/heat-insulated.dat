This paper presents a numerical study on the anti-freezing behavior of a cold region tunnel (the Dege tunnel) with <b>heat-insulating</b> layers. A numerical model based on the temperature field coupling theory is firstly proposed and validated using field test data of the Dege tunnel. Subsequently, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the influences of <b>heat-insulating</b> layers on the temperature characteristics of airflows inside the tunnel, the surrounding rock, and the tunnel lining. Furthermore, a numerical investigation based on the proposed numerical model is carried out to propose reasonable design parameters of <b>heat-insulating</b> layers for different velocities of mechanical ventilation, and different <b>heat-insulating</b> materials for cold region tunnels. The numerical results show that using the <b>heat-insulating</b> layer can effectively reduce the heat transfer between the surrounding rock and the airflow inside the tunnel.

The authors notice that from the heat-engineering viewpoint the variant with exterior side winterization is the most favourable. However, utilizing micromodules as <b>heat-insulating</b> layers screened with leafing aluminum makes it necessary to account for the screens reflecting power. It allows reducing the irradiating component in the combined value of thermal transport through the enclosure and consequently raises the structure thermal resistance or, with parity of these values, leads to lower thickness of the <b>heat-insulating</b> layer. The known data applied for calculating the total heat transmission helps demonstrate reduction of the general heat flux value by 1. 4 times, and the heat transmission resistance by 1. 76 m 2 deg. /W. This allows reducing thickness of the <b>heat-insulating</b> layer (with regard of two screens) by 0. 07 m. Computations illustrate the fact that account for the radiant reflectance of screening enables lowering the rated heat flux passing through the enclosure. Which again allows decreasing the structure thermal resistance and its general thickness (by 70 mm) at the expense of small thickness {{of the heat}} insulation of micromodules. The humidity regime calculations establish good acceptability of the enclosure service conditions in winter. The period will see no real water vapour condensation.
