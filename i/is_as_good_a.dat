500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{announcement}} of the name, Brown noted that it is unusual to be allowed to name an object without being acknowledged as its official discoverer but declared that he is pleased with the outcome and that he [...] "think this <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> resolution as we'll get". He did get full recognition for the discovery of the two moons, Hiiaka and Namaka. On the fifth anniversary of the discovery he wrote a blog post with his thoughts on the importance of the discovery, but did not mention any events regarding the controversy.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{three out of}} five stars, Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone {{summarized}} that the messages on the album are dour, but complimented Madonna for talking about the then-current situation of the nation. Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album sounds good, but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises than what it delivers, {{and that it is}} better in theory than practice. Kelefa Sanneh from Blender awarded the album three stars out of five. [...] "Just as disjointed as Music and much more severe... Without a compelling back story, her songs seem diminished". Dorian Lynskey from Q magazine also rated it three out of five, stating [...] "'Nothing Fails', the album's centerpiece, <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> showstopper as 'Live to Tell'... it's no wonder that a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused".|$|E
500|$|Herc, in {{his review}} for Ain't It Cool News, praised the {{reliability}} of Jeffrey Combs as Shran, but thought {{that there were no}} major surprises. [...] Herc did say that the biggest shock was the revelation that the Romulans were behind the bombing of the Human Embassy. He gave it a rating of three out of five. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, calling it an [...] "absolutely gripping episode" [...] except for the [...] "ludicrousness of the ending". She made the admission about the ending that, [...] "I suppose the Romulans had to show up at some point, I guess Vulcan <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> place as any." [...] She thought that the torture scenes were [...] "pointless", but was pleased with the characterisation seen in Archer, T'Pol and Tucker. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] said that the episode was [...] "not perfect, but good" [...] with an [...] "intriguing" [...] ending. He also praised Jeffrey Combs as Shran, and thought that the torture screens were potent but that the ending was rushed. He gave the episode a rating of three out of four. The first home media release of [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] was in the season four DVD box set of Enterprise, originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.|$|E

500|$|Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch who {{praised the}} iPhone 5S {{as the best}} {{smartphone}} available said [...] "looks may not {{be different from the}} iPhone 5, but the internal components have a dramatic impact on day-to-day activities normal for a smartphone user," [...] and went into detail explaining the impact of the improved camera and specifications on the phone. Etherington suggested that the 64-bit A7 processor will not reach its full potential until developers create applications supporting it. Myriam Joire of Engadget found that the iPhone 5S could benefit significantly from the A7 if developers created applications optimized for the 64-bit processor. Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised the phone's A7 processor, describing it as [...] "seriously impressive", and stated that it was the most [...] "futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if you are {{one of those people who}} likes to hold onto their device for a while - the iPhone 5S <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> starting point as any." [...] Scott Lowe of IGN also speaking highly of its 64-bit processor, [...] "which has a substantial lead in processing power over the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4, accounting for a graphics boost of up to 32% and 38% in CPU benchmarks." [...] The debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 processor took rival Android smartphone makers by surprise, particularly Qualcomm whose own 64-bit system-on-chip was not released until 2015.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the season}} got underway, {{newspapers}} asked the question: [...] "Is Michigan Coming Back?" [...] One wire service account noted: [...] "Frank Steketee, {{a member of}} the 1918 team, and who was given the position of fullback on Walter Camp's All-American eleven, will be back on the line-plunging job this year.

2500|$|Rodman taught English {{and was a}} {{vocational}} counselor at Wadleigh High School for Girls in New York City. [...] Opposed to the school board's restrictive policies on married women teachers, she married a psychologist friend, Herman de Fremery (aka Herman Defrem), in February 1913, and announced it to the press, saying, [...] "If the married state affects a woman's work, the authorities can mark her accordingly. [...] If it does not affect her work, and if she <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> teacher as she was before, she deserves promotion, {{if it comes to}} her." [...] She also referred to the Board of Education, in print, as [...] "mother baiters." [...] She was suspended according to New York City Board of Education policy; a well-publicized and lengthy appeal followed, serving Rodman's purpose by keeping the issue in headlines.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of {{the first}} issue were largely positive, noting Cornell's solid {{characterization}} and tight plotting {{as well as the}} vein of black comedy that runs through proceedings and the smooth transition from his Wisdom limited series, despite the differences in the scale of the action, which may make the issue [...] "a little new reader unfriendly." [...] Comic Book Resources called it [...] "a splendid new series," [...] Comics Bulletin conclude [...] "I haven't read a stronger first issue than this in a long time" [...] and IGN agreed, stating [...] "Captain Britain And MI: 13 #1 <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> debut to a superhero story as I can remember." [...] Given the good reviews and the tie-in with Secret Invasion (the first issue of which sold an estimate quarter of a million copies) the sales were high, with the first printing selling out immediately and being followed by a second printing with a variant cover based in Kirk's interior art which, in turn, sold out requiring a third printing.|$|E
2500|$|Sharpe also {{excelled in}} other sports. [...] He was {{referred}} to in 1919 as [...] "the best all around athlete Yale has produced, having won his varsity letter when at Yale, in three branches of sport -- football, baseball and crew." [...] In addition to football and basketball, Sharpe was also a fine baseball player and a skilled gymnast. [...] In 1900, The New York Times noted that [...] "Sharpe of Yale <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> first baseman as he is a halfback, which is saying a good deal." [...] In 1915, Dr. A.C. May, a noted athletic trainer, rated Sharpe as [...] "the greatest living all round athlete today." [...] May supported his selection as follows:"Look at him once {{and you will see}} the reason for his success. [...] He is 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weights 196 pounds. [...] He is evenly proportioned and owes his build, not to athletics, but in gymnastics, and he owed his athletic success not to his build so much as his ability to handle his body, which he developed in the gymnasium. [...] He can handle himself on the bars and rings and other apparatus with as much skill as he can play football or other sports. [...] He can turn a backward and forward flip and he knows the other tricks of a gymnast. ... Sharpe could row, run a fine relay, jump, put the shot, and, in fact, do about anything on the athletic field." ...|$|E
