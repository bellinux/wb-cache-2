5|$|In {{addition}} to donations from individuals, the BSA receives extensive donations from major corporations. In 2010, their top corporate donors were, in order, Intel, Emerson, Verizon, 3M, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Pfizer, Valero, UPS, U.S. Bank, Eli Lilly, GE, and Monsanto. However, <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> UPS cut funding to BSA in 2012.|$|E
5|$|SuperSpeed (SS) rate of 5.0Gbit/s. The written USB3.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} by <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> its partners in August 2008. The first USB3.0 controller chips were sampled by NEC in May 2009, and the first products using the USB3.0 specification arrived in January 2010. USB3.0 connectors are generally backward compatible, but include new wiring and full-duplex operation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> SiliconSystems (acquired by Western Digital in 2009) {{used the}} term write {{amplification}} in their papers and publications as early as 2008. Write amplification is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system. Without compression, write amplification cannot drop below one. Using compression, SandForce has claimed to achieve a typical write amplification of 0.5, with best-case values as low as 0.14 in the SF-2281 controller.|$|E
50|$|QRAM updated to 2.02 for <b>intel</b> 80286 <b>and</b> <b>intel</b> 8088 systems.|$|R

5|$|Write {{amplification}} {{was always}} present in SSDs before {{the term was}} defined, {{but it was in}} 2008 that both <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> SiliconSystems started using the term in their papers and publications. All SSDs have a write amplification value and it is based on both what is currently being written and what was previously written to the SSD. In order to accurately measure the value for a specific SSD, the selected test should be run for enough time to ensure the drive has reached a steady state condition.|$|E
5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|By April 2008, Ezarik {{had largely}} reduced her lifecasting {{productions}} {{to a less}} frequent basis. She had resumed pursuit of her web designer and video editor career and was living in Carnegie. Her new equipment by Nokia enabled her to lifecast and produce streaming video live without a computer connection. She continued to make weekly appearances on her own iJustine website at www.ijustine.tv. Still a Carnegie resident at the time, Ezarik planned to be vacationing in North Carolina when the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 and hoped to find an AT wireless store to upgrade while on vacation. That June, Ezarik was named by <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> its PR firm Ogilvy & Mather to a 10-member social media strategy advisory board. In late 2008, she relocated her base of operation from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California.|$|E

5|$|On September 3, 2013, Microsoft {{agreed to}} buy Nokia's mobile unit for $7 billion. Also in 2013, Amy Hood became the CFO of Microsoft. The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was {{launched}} in October 2013 and Microsoft {{was part of the}} coalition of public and private organizations that also included Facebook, <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> Google. Led by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. In line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions by function: Operating System, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions were diluted into new divisions without any workforce cuts.|$|E
25|$|A case of {{industrial}} espionage arose in 1995 that involved both <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> AMD. Bill Gaede, an Argentine formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel's Arizona plant, {{was arrested for}} attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and P5 Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers. Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> mailed it to AMD, which immediately alerted <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> authorities, resulting in Gaede's arrest. Gaede was {{convicted and sentenced to}} 33 months in prison in June 1996.|$|E
25|$|A joint {{development}} at <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> Micron {{will allow the}} production of 32-layer 3.5 terabyte (TB) NANDflash sticks and 10TB standard-sized SSDs. The device includes 5 packages of 16 Ã— 48GBTLC dies, using a floating gate cell design.|$|E

50|$|The early {{microprocessors}} <b>Intel</b> 4004 <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> 8008 had {{specific instructions}} to set {{as well as}} reset the carry flag explicitly. However, the later <b>Intel</b> 8080 (<b>and</b> Z80) did not include an explicit reset carry opcode as this could be done equally fast via one of the bitwise AND, OR or XOR instructions (which do not use the carry flag).|$|R
25|$|Some Integrated Device Manufacturers {{that have}} their own {{fabrication}} facilities like <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> Texas Instruments outsource some of their production to TSMC. At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP-portfolio.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> Infineon Technologies {{announced}} that Intel would acquire Infineon's Wireless Solutions business. Intel {{planned to use}} Infineon's technology in laptops, smart phones, netbooks, tablets and embedded computers in consumer products, eventually integrating its wireless modem into Intel's silicon chips.|$|E
25|$|After college, McGeady was a {{software}} engineering manager at Ann Arbor Terminals and Oregon based Tektronix. In 1985 he joined <b>Intel,</b> <b>and</b> in 1991 he co-founded the Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro. In 1993, {{he was promoted}} to a vice president position at the company.|$|E

50|$|The Intel 8255 (or i8255) {{programmable}} {{peripheral interface}} (PPI) chip was developed <b>and</b> manufactured by <b>Intel</b> {{in the first}} half of the 1970s for the <b>Intel</b> 8080 microprocessor <b>and</b> is a member of the MCS-85 Family of chips. The i8255 was also used with the <b>Intel</b> 8085 <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> 8086 <b>and</b> their descendants and found wide applicability in digital processing systems. It was later cloned by other manufacturers. It is available in 40-pin DIP and 44-pin PLCC packages. The 82C55 is a higher-speed CMOS version.|$|R
50|$|Piezoelectric {{fans are}} often quieter than {{rotating}} fans and may consume less power,. <b>and</b> <b>Intel,</b> Murata <b>and</b> others have recently done development {{on use of}} piezoelectric fans in desktop PCs.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, Intel {{filed suit}} against AMD and Cyrix Corp. for misuse of the term MMX. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD {{acknowledging}} MMX as a trademark owned by <b>Intel,</b> <b>and</b> with Intel granting AMD rights to market the AMD K6 MMX processor.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his Ph.D, {{he moved to}} California, working for Apple Computer in Cupertino, California. He worked in research laboratories at Apple Computer until they closed 10 months later and then at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, and held visiting positions at <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> Stanford University.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft, {{in their}} {{response}} to McGeady's testimony, {{made the point that}} his testimony contained several pro-Microsoft threads, and that Intel practiced similar cross product subsidization, distributing free Intel Architecture Labs software funded by microprocessor revenues. They also claimed that Microsoft's influence over <b>Intel</b> <b>and</b> its microprocessors was unrelated to the downstream software segment.|$|E
50|$|The {{motherboard}} {{uses the}} <b>Intel</b> H110 chipset <b>and</b> supports <b>Intel</b> Core i3, Intel Core i5, Intel Core i7, <b>Intel</b> Celeron <b>and</b> <b>Intel</b> Pentium processors.
