A set of experimental data using ceramic cutting tools, composed approximately of Al 2 O 3 (70 %) and TiC (30 %) on AISI 4340 heat treated to a hardness of 60 HRC was obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>design</b> boundary: cutting speeds (175 - 325 m/min), feed rate (0. 075 - 0. 125 m/rev), negative rake angle (0 to- 12) and depth of cut of (0. 1 - 0. 15) mm. The output data is used {{to develop a new}} model in predicting the tooling cost using in terms of cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and rake angle.

The approach chosen for SIIUE [1] can be summed up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>design</b> principles: 1. Use a Logic Programming basis for dening both structure and data. The LP di-alect used for this purpose is known as the Information System COnstrution language (ISCO), and is partially described in [1]. 2. Structure the information in an object-oriented, multiple inheritance scheme. This approach allows for a good re-use of information and is quite intuitive in specifying complex class hierarchies as is inevitable in the case of SIIUE. 3. Specify constraints between data in the Logic Description language. Especially when associated with a form of Constraint Programming (such as constraints over nite do-mains), Logic Programming can be a very effective tool to specify a problem declar-atively. 4.

40|$|Today {{more and}} more {{students}} take online courses because they offer flexibility and convenience the traditional classroom does not. The development of online courses first began in haste, but educators have since regrouped from the initial absence of strategic planning. However, the visual design of online courses continues to be ignored in online courses seeing that most online course developers {{do not have a}} background in design. This study establishes the importance of using principles of good design in online courses {{while at the same time}} creates a design guide for online course developers. The research conducted in visual design is applied to designing a new prototype for an online course. Surveys were used to gain knowledge about the visual design of online courses, and to make a comparison between the original course and the prototype <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>design</b> areas: typography, color, image, and visual organization/layout.

40|$|Manuscript copy. "Thesis for {{the degree}} of {{bachelor}} of science in civil engineering. "In the use of reinforced concrete {{for the construction of}} buildings, it is of importance that the structure be made as light as is consistent with strength. Especially is this true of concrete floors in concrete or steel structures where the dead load of the floor is an important item; being usually a large per cent of the designed working load. The cost of forms in the placing of concrete is one of the very important items in the construction of concrete floors. This is especially true for floors at elevated heights, such as the higher floors of office buildings, factories and warehouses. Where such floors are of "monolithic" or solid construction, the forms must be built in place and all material hoisted and poured into them. As these tight forms are often difficult to remove without injury, they can only be used a few times. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>design</b> of floor system, some of these difficulties are eliminated. The beams and columns are constructed in place, much the same as in the monolithic system, while the slabs may be built at any time or place and later hoisted into position. These slabs may be manufactured in sets of standard forms which can be used over and over again. When convenient, the slab's may be made at some locality other than the building site, and then be hauled or even shipped to the place of construction.

The aim is to define the Threshold of entry from the South of Pretoria, passing the University of South Africa and via Elandspoort Road and Mears Street. An Urban Design and Centre for Media + Image form the final resolution for the proposal. Education and Display are explored in creating a facility for the University of South Africa and a public and visual venue for Pretoria. Connection and Communication are the theoretical concepts carried through into the design. This is done in order to fully integrate design within a context both locally and internationally. Visual interaction with the building <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>design</b> is a major factor. This {{is due to the}} dynamics surrounding the site and already existing movement channels and patterns creating an Urban Environment. The work of Bill Hillier has been consulted in relation to Architecture and Movement. The design approach is one of aknowleding our place in time. This is reflected in the programme for the facility and in the environment and technologies incorporated. Tilt-Up Construction, Post-Tensioned Slabs and Steel Construction are the main building methods. Steel, Glass and Concrete make up the material palette in conjunction with technological advances such as nanotechnology and smart surfaces.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{challenges that}} can emerge when implementing innovations at organizations. As the conducted case study showed, many variables {{come into play}} when implementing new technology. Specific within IT is the implementation complexity at the back-end; large new software applications often need to be embedded into the existing IT landscape of the client. This landscape is a complex infrastructure of various IT processes and systems. During implementation of new software, changes in one area of the landscape can have major consequences for IT processes {{on the other end}} of the infrastructure. The party responsible for maintaining the IT landscape is the Operations department of the client’s organization. This department has the responsibility of keeping the current system stable. A challenge within innovation is the conflicting mind-set between Development and Operations; one is in favor of change, while the other strives for stability. During the innovation process, stakeholders from both the Business and IT Operations should become involved to contribute their knowledge and function as a Champion within their organization to generate support. The knowledge boundaries that exist between the different disciplines should therefore be addressed by applying the right boundary object. This has resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>design</b> statement: ‘To design a work method that supports collaboration between Business, Development and IT Operations and creates a shared vision for the innovation process. ’ This challenge has been addressed by designing three facilitated sessions that can be held during the innovation process. ‘SPARK’ is an ideation session, where opportunities and product ideas are generated and a shared vision is created. ‘MONITOR’ is a risk assessment session, where the impact of the innovation on the IT landscape of the client is discussed and a shared roadmap is created. ‘CHECK’ is a frequent risk management session where the majority of risks are exposed and to define concrete objectives to address these. To overcome the knowledge barriers between the three stakeholders, the sessions make use of Lego Serious Play (LSP) and Innovation Roadmapping. While LSP provides the stakeholders with the means to express themselves and observe complex innovation challenges from different angles, Innovation Roadmapping aligns the objectives between the different parties.
