40|$|Summary: This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} accelerometry-measured <b>higher</b> <b>impacts</b> resulting from habitual weight-bearing activity on lower limb bone strength in older women. Despite <b>higher</b> <b>impacts</b> being experienced rarely in this population-based cohort, positive associations were observed between <b>higher</b> vertical <b>impacts</b> and lower limb bone size and strength. Introduction: We investigated whether the benefit of habitual weight-bearing physical activity (PA) for lower limb bone strength in older women is explained by exposure to <b>higher</b> <b>impacts,</b> as previously suggested by observations in younger individuals. Methods: Four hundred and eight women from the Cohort for Skeletal Health in Bristol and Avon (COSHIBA), mean 76. 8 years, wore tri-axial accelerometers at the waist for a mean of 5. 4 days. Y-axis peaks were categorised, using previously identified cutoffs, as low (0. 5 – 1. 0 g), medium (1. 0 – 1. 5 g), and higher (≥ 1. 5 g) impacts. Mid and distal peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of the tibia and radius were performed, as were hip and lumbar spine Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Regressions between (log transformed) number of low, medium and <b>high</b> <b>impacts,</b> and bone outcomes were adjusted for artefact error grade, age, height, fat and lean mass and impacts in other bands. Results: Eight thousand eight hundred and nine (4047, 16, 882) low impacts were observed during the measurement week, 345 (99, 764) medium impacts and 42 (17, 106) <b>higher</b> <b>impacts</b> (median with 25 th and 75 th quartiles). <b>Higher</b> vertical <b>impacts</b> were positively associated with lower limb bone strength as reflected by cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) of the tibia [0. 042 (0. 012, 0. 072) p = 0. 01] and hip [0. 067 (0. 001, 0. 133) p = 0. 045] (beta coefficients show standard deviations change per doubling in impacts, with 95 % confidence interval). <b>Higher</b> <b>impacts</b> were positively associated with tibial periosteal circumference (PC) [0. 015 (0. 003, 0. 027) p = 0. 02], but unrelated to hip BMD. Equivalent positive associations were not seen for low or medium impacts. Conclusions: Despite their rarity, habitual levels of <b>higher</b> <b>impacts</b> were positively associated with lower limb bone size and strength, whereas equivalent relationships were not seen for low or medium impacts...|$|R

Data on biodiversity are necessary to assist in establishing protected areas for conservation objectives to be met. Toward that effect, we investigated reef biodiversity patterns in three large-scale coastal regions of Brazil. The study areas comprised of an upwelling region, an adjacent <b>high</b> <b>impacted</b> region, and a more distant marine park. We surveyed four reef sites in each study region. Fish species and abundance, substrate relief, and water temperature were recorded during the surveys. Biodiversity was estimated using Simpson’s and Shannon’s indices on species richness and abundance. Fish diversity was highest at the upwelling area. No difference in diversity was observed between the <b>high</b> <b>impacted</b> region and the marine park. No substrate relief patterns were found. Temperature readings showed higher frequency of low temperature episodic events at the upwelling region. Our results favor the upwelling region for establishment of a Marine Protected Area. Moreover, the similar diversity between the <b>high</b> <b>impacted</b> region and the marine park showed evidence of spillover effects from the upwelling into the <b>high</b> <b>impacted</b> region, further demonstrating {{the importance of the}} upwelling region for conservation...|$|R
