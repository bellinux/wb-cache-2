This problem was already pointed out {{in one of the}} IIHS's earliers tests, to which Tesla responded they would improve their safety belt design, which, according to the IIHS's latest tests, has not been done. The IIHS also gave the Model S the worst possible rating for its headlights. The report caused Tesla to lose 6.4% of its stock value.|$|E
25|$|EyeSight is Subaru's {{active safety}} system that uses twin CCD cameras, {{simulating}} stereoscopic vision. It {{was first introduced}} in Japan only as Active Driving Assist (ADA) in 1999. When activated, it actively monitors the road through the windshield-mounted cameras, and can react to driving conditions and possibly avert collisions. Models equipped with EyeSight earned the highest possible rating in the IIHS <b>front</b> <b>crash</b> safety test. Unlike other manufacturers offering stereoscopic cameras for drivers-asset purposes, the Eyesight system's cameras are not bonded to the windshield. Thus, if the windshield is dirty on the inside, it may affect the system's performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTraffic {{accidents}} {{cause to}} a large quantity of personnel casualty and economic loss every year. The safety in vehicle crash {{has been one of}} important criterions in vehicle design. The driver seat pillow can provide a protection to human heads and cervical spines during automobile crash process, and the pillow-related structural design of vehicle seats is one part in the driver seat design of modern exclusive cars. In this study, according the relevant design statute requirements of driver seats, the three-dimensional finite element model of a simplified human head and a seat with pillow was established and then simulations were conducted for simulating the process of the human head crashing the seat pillow in both of front direction and rearward direction. The results show that the pillow board and the pillow bracket are the main endergonic components during the <b>front</b> <b>crashing</b> process and the pillow bracket is the main endergonic component during rearward crashing process. The results also show that the crash protection structure of seat pillow is satisfied with the relevant requirements and this study can provide a reference for structural design of driver seat pillows...|$|R
