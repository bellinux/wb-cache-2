50|$|Certain diazo compounds, such as diazomethane, {{can react}} with olefins to produce cyclopropanes in a 2 step manner. The first step {{involves}} a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition {{to form a}} pyrazoline which then undergoes <b>denitrogenation,</b> either photochemically or by thermal decomposition, to give cyclopropane. The thermal route, which often uses KOH and platinum as catalysts, {{is also known as}} the Kishner cyclopropane synthesis after the Russian chemist Nikolai Kischner and can also be performed using hydrazine and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The mechanism of decomposition {{has been the subject of}} several studies and remains somewhat controversial, although it is broadly thought to proceed via a diradical species. In terms of green chemistry this method is superior to other carbene based cyclopropanations; as it does not involve metals or halogenated reagents, and produces only N2 as a by-product. However the reaction can be dangerous as trace amounts of unreacted diazo compounds may explode during the thermal rearrangement of the pyrazoline.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine an aspect of the thermal cycling of organic nitrogen in sediments and metasediments. The cycling of organic nitrogen is important because sedimentary organic matter is a shuttle of nitrogen from the atmosphere to the lower crust and thermal decomposition of organic matter is a critical step in the recycling of nitrogen between the different nitrogen pools. Abundance and isotopic composition of organic nitrogen were determined in the particular case of two low sulfur Westphalian anthracites series from Pennsylvania and Bramsche Massif. They represent good examples of Euramerica coals spanning the whole range of anthracitization in single fields. Gold cell experimental simulation of the <b>denitrogenation</b> process was conducted at moderate pressure to show that both suites make ideal metamorphic profiles without any shift due to change of facies or to hydrothermal disturbance. During anthracitization, organic nitrogen content decreases rapidly while organic nitrogen isotopic composition does not change with rank increase.

DCS results from nitrogen gas bubble formation in body tissues and venous blood. <b>Denitrogenation</b> achieved through lengthy staged decompression protocols has been the mainstay of prevention of DCS in space. Due to the greater number and duration of EVAs scheduled for construction and maintenance of the International Space Station, more efficient alternatives to accomplish missions without compromising astronaut safety are desirable. ^ This multi-center, multi-phase study (NASA-Prebreathe Reduction Protocol study, or PRP) was designed to identify a shorter <b>denitrogenation</b> protocol that can be implemented before an EVA, based on the combination of adynamia and exercise enhanced oxygen prebreathe. Human volunteers recruited at three sites (Texas, North Carolina and Canada) underwent three different combinations (“PRP phases”) of intense and light exercise prior to decompression in an altitude chamber. The outcome variables were detection of venous gas embolism (VGE) by precordial Doppler ultrasound, and clinical manifestations of DCS. Independent variables included age, gender, body mass index, oxygen consumption peak, peak heart rate, and PRP phase. Data analysis was performed both by pooling results from all study sites, and by examining each site separately. ^ Ten percent of the subjects developed DCS and 20 % showed evidence of high grade VGE. No cases of DCS occurred in one particular PRP phase with use of the combination of dual-cycle ergometry (10 minutes at 75 % of VO 2 peak) plus 24 minutes of light EVA exercise (p = 0. 04). No significant effects were found for the remaining independent variables on the occurrence of DCS. High grade VGE showed a strong correlation with subsequent development of DCS (sensitivity, 88. 2 %; specificity, 87. 2 %). In the presence of high grade VGE, the relative risk for DCS ranged from 7. 52 to 35. 0. ^ In summary, a good safety level can be achieved with exercise-enhanced oxygen <b>denitrogenation</b> that can be generalized to the astronaut population. Exercise is beneficial in preventing DCS if a specific schedule is followed, with an individualized VO 2 prescription that provides a safety level that can then be applied to space operations. Furthermore, VGE Doppler detection is a useful clinical tool for prediction of altitude DCS. Because of the small number of high grade VGE episodes, the identification of a high probability DCS situation based on the presence of high grade VGE seems justified in astronauts. ...|$|E

These analytical techniques showed that nitrogen atoms are present in the 6 -membered rings located at the edges of condensed polyaromatic systems as pyridine-like sp 2 nitrogen (N 1 or N 2) or in the inte¬rior, where nitrogen replaces one carbon atom and is bonded to three carbon neighbors (N 3). The occurrence of a species (N 2) hypo¬thetically related to a pyridinic cycle bearing oxygen substituents or intracyclic oxygen atoms could be correlated with the degree of oxidation of the carbon surface. Assuming that a relative N 3 increase is indicative of aromatization and that the reverse, correlated with a N 2 increase, is indicative of surface oxidative <b>denitrogenation,</b> the ratio between these nitrogen species revealed that aromatization and oxidative <b>denitrogenation</b> processes occur sequentially or simultaneously to different extents according to the type of carbon activation and to the burn-off degree. Physical activation involves thermal aromatization reactions during the carbonization stage and the subse¬quent isothermal activation one. In this second activation stage, co-occurring thermal oxidation reactions lead to a less intense denitro¬genation during CO 2 activation than during steam activation. H 3 PO 4 activation induces the largest nitrogen retention in the final product in a double process of aromatization and ‘‘auto-activation'' producing a moderate oxidative attack of nitrogen. However, an increase of the H 3 PO 4 ratio fostered the oxidation of the carbon surface and consequently enhanced nitrogen gasification during the subsequent activation...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonically {{detected}} microbubbles {{were more}} {{abundant in the}} pulmonary artery of dogs intravenously injected with 10 ml of saline than in the same noninjected control during 10, 000 ft (3, 048 m), 20, 000 ft (6, 096 m), and 40, 000 ft (12, 121 m) exposures. Continuous intravenous (i. v.) drip infusions also introduced many small bubbles. Since they may serve as 'nuclei' for visible intravascular bubble formation, are sometimes associated with decompression sickness, and are additionally considered undesirable, it would appear prudent to minimize i. v. injections immediately before flights. However, a 10 -min delay before ascent wil reduce their number and a 60 -min delay will insure their almost complete absence. Also, slow ascent, a 1 -h <b>denitrogenation</b> time, or use of a degassed solution will help reduce their total number...|$|E
