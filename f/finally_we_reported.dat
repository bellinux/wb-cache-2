40|$|Abstract — Satellite {{communication}} {{is one of}} the most popular next generation communication technologies for global communication networks in parallel to terrestrial communication networks. In modern age military intelligence, navigation & positioning, weather forecasting, digital video Broadcasting (DVB), and broadband internet services, are the few demanding applications of Satellite communication. Although Satellite {{communication is}} cost effective solution for such long distance communication application, However security over the link is still a major concern in satellite communication. Due to limitations such as high bit error rate, power control, large distance between end nodes, high link delays because of large round trip times, and link availability, common security techniques incorporate a lot of issues in implementation of proper secure communication over the satellite links. In this survey paper, we explore the importance of security, trivial and currently deployed security tools, and the limitations to be considered while deploying such security techniques and protocols for securing satellite communication. <b>Finally</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> some future research space in process to further optimize the security tools and measures for the proper security frame work over the satellite communication infrastructure...|$|E
30|$|Discussion First, {{we found}} that {{clinical}} and biological factors associated {{with the need for}} a NIV bi level positive airway pressure were similar of those associated with the need for IV previously described [2]. We can hypothesize that patients at risk of severe bronchiolitis and NIV failure are actually better identified with prompt modification of ventilation parameters and a greater tolerance for permissive hypercapnia under NIV support. All of these factors lead to a reduction of the rate of intubation [1]. Secondly, patients hospitalized seemed to be less severe according to biological parameters (apH and PaCO 2) and the decreased need for IV all along the three seasons studied. This could be in relation with an earlier recognition of critically illness patients and no delayed respiratory support treatment. This could also be related to an increased administration of HFNCT to patients usually treated with standard oxygen treatment. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> factors associated with HFNCT failure. Even if HFNCT is not actually recommended in the first line treatment of bronchiolitis, some authors described its efficiency in this pathology, with similar results as nCPAP and superiority to standard nasal oxygen with reduced respiratory rate, respiratory work, length of stay and level of oxygenation.|$|E

40|$|Thrombospondin- 1, a multi-modular {{matrix protein}} {{is able to}} {{interact}} {{with a variety of}} matrix proteins and cell-surface receptors. Thus it is multifunctional. In this work, we examined the role of thrombospondin- 1 in ceramide-induced thyroid apoptosis. We focused on the VVM containing sequence localized in the C-terminal domain of the molecule. Primary cultured thyroid cells synthesize thrombospondin- 1 depending on their morphological organization. As it leads thyrocytes to organize into monolayers before inducing apoptosis ceramide can modulate this organization. Here, we established that C(2) -ceramide treatment decreased thrombospondin- 1 expression by interfering with the adenylyl cyclase pathway, thus leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the thrombospondin- 1 -derived peptide 4 N 1 (RFYVVMWK) abolished ceramide-induced thyroid cell death by preventing intracellular cAMP levels from dropping. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> that 4 N 1 -mediated inhibition of ceramide-induced apoptosis was consistently associated with a down-regulation of the caspase- 3 processing.

40|$|Abstract—In current, typical {{software}} development projects, hundreds of developers work asynchronously {{in space and}} time and may introduce anti-patterns in their software systems because of time pressure, lack of understanding, communication, and–or skills. Anti-patterns impede development and maintenance activities by making the source code more difficult to understand. Detecting anti-patterns incrementally and on subsets of a system could reduce costs, effort, and resources by allowing practitioners to identify and take into account occurrences of anti-patterns as they find them during their development and maintenance activities. Researchers have proposed approaches to detect occurrences of anti-patterns but these approaches have currently four limitations: (1) they require extensive knowledge of anti-patterns, (2) they have limited precision and recall, (3) they are not incremental, and (4) they cannot be applied on subsets of systems. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SMURF, a novel approach to detect anti-patterns, based on a machine learning technique—support vector machines—and taking into account practitioners ’ feedback. Indeed, through an empirical study involving three systems and four anti-patterns, we showed that the accuracy of SMURF is greater than that of DETEX and BDTEX when detecting anti-patterns occurrences. We also showed that SMURF can be applied in both intra-system and inter-system configurations. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> that SMURF accuracy improves when using practitioners ’ feedback.

40|$|Although {{habituation}} is {{ubiquitous in}} the animal kingdom, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we began to explore the molecular cascades underlying short-term habituation in the leech Hirudo medicinalis. In H. medicinalis, a training paradigm, consisting of low-frequency repetitive electrical stimulation of the skin, produces a gradual increase in the latency to swim that spontaneously recovers within 20 – 30 min. As first step in determining the molecular pathways in short-term habituation, we examined the role of Ca 2 +. Both Ca 2 + influx through voltage-gated channels and Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores were found to contribute to short-term habituation. The analysis of the downstream targets of elevated cytosolic Ca 2 + revealed that the activation of the phosholipase A 2 was required for the induction of short-term habituation. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> that the recruitment of arachidonic acid metabolites, generated by the 5 -lipoxygenase pathway, was also necessary for the induction of swim induction habituation. These results {{provide the framework for}} a comprehensive characterization of the molecular underpinnings of habituation.

The clinical and genetic features of 12 unrelated Italian patients with CINCA syndrome are described, focusing on the possible influence of the presence of CIAS 1 /cryopyrin mutations on the phenotype of the disease and on its prognosis. Methods. The clinical features of 12 Italian CINCA patients were evaluated. Genomic DNA of the patients was sequenced using specific primers for CIAS 1 and ASC genes. Results. Our patients shared typical CINCA characteristics and, sometimes, remarkable perinatal events, peculiar of CIAS 1 -mutated patients. Seven patients carried CIAS 1 missense mutation, localized within the nucleotide binding domain of cryopyrin. Four previously described mutations and three new heterozygous CIAS 1 missense mutations were identified.

The {{purpose of this paper}} was to investigate quantitatively the catch-up saccades occurring during sustained pursuit. We used a ramp-step-ramp paradigm to evoke catch-up saccades during sustained pursuit. In general, catch-up saccades followed the unexpected steps in position and velocity of the target. We observed catch-up saccades {{in the same direction as}} the smooth eye movement (forward saccades) as well as in the opposite direction (reverse saccades). We made a comparison of the main sequences of forward saccades, reverse saccades, and control saccades made to stationary targets. They were all three significantly different from each other and were fully compatible with the hypothesis that the smooth pursuit component is added to the saccadic component during catch-up saccades. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed on the saccadic component to find the parameters determining the amplitude of catch-up saccades. We found that both position error and retinal slip are taken into account in catch-up saccade programming to predict the future trajectory of the moving target. We also demonstrated that the saccadic system needs a minimum period of approximately 90 ms for taking into account changes in target trajectory. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> a saturation (above 15 degrees /s) in the contribution of retinal slip to the amplitude of catch-up saccades...|$|E

With these data, defect prediction software can try to estimate the defect proneness of a software module, with the objective of assisting and guiding software practitioners. With timely and accurate defect predictions, practitioners can focus their limited testing resources on higher risk areas. This paper reports the results of three empirical studies that uses an automated genetic defect prediction framework. This framework generates and compares different learning schemes (preprocessing + attribute selection + learning algorithms) and selects the best one using a genetic algorithm, with the objective to estimate the defect proneness of a software module. The first empirical study is a performance comparison of our framework with the most important framework of the literature. The second empirical study is a performance and runtime comparison between our framework and an exhaustive framework. The third empirical study is a sensitivity analysis. The last empirical study, is our main contribution in this paper.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, there has been {{significant}} progress {{in the understanding of}} the pathogenetic mechanisms of the Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). However, despite important advances in elucidating molecular mechanisms, the treatment of AML has not improved significantly, remaining anchored at the standard chemotherapy regimen " 3  +  7 ", with the prognosis of patients remaining severe, especially for the elderly and for those not eligible for transplant procedures. The biological and clinical heterogeneity of AML represents the major obstacle that hinders the improvement of prognosis and the identification of new effective therapeutic approaches. To date, abundant information has been collected on the genetic and molecular alterations of AML carrying prognostic significance. However, not enough is known on how AML progenitors regulate proliferation and survival by redundant and cross-talking signal transduction pathways (STP). Furthermore, it remains unclear how such complicated network affects prognosis and therapeutic treatment options, although many of these molecular determinants are potentially attractive for their druggable characteristics. In this review, some of the key STP frequently deregulated in AML, such as PI 3 k/Akt/mTOR pathway, GSK 3 and components of Bcl- 2 family of proteins, are summarized, highlighting in addition their interplay. Based on this information, we reviewed new targeted therapeutic approaches, focusing on the aberrant networks that sustain the AML blast proliferation, survival and drug resistance, aiming to improve disease treatment. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> the approaches aimed at disrupting key signaling cross-talk overcoming resistances based on the combination of different targeting therapeutic strategies...|$|E

This cluster includes the FADS 1 and FADS 2 genes encoding, respectively, for the Delta 5 - and Delta 6 -desaturases involved in polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. A third gene, named FADS 3, has recently been identified but no functional role has yet been attributed to the putative FADS 3 protein. In this study, we investigated the FADS 3 occurrence in rat tissues by using two specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of rat FADS 3. Our results showed three potential protein isoforms of FADS 3 (75 kDa, 51 kDa, and 37 kDa) present in a tissue-dependent manner.

40|$|Attempts {{to harness}} mouse type I NKT cells in {{different}} therapeutic settings including cancer, infection, and autoimmunity have proven fruitful using the CD 1 d-binding glycolipid alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer). In these different models, {{the effects of}} alpha-GalCer mainly relied on {{the establishment of a}} type I NKT cell-dependent immune cascade involving dendritic cell, NK cell, B cell, or conventional CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell activation/regulation as well as immunomodulatory cytokine production. In this study, we showed that gamma delta T cells, another population of innate-like T lymphocytes, displayed a phenotype of activated cells (cytokine production and cytotoxic properties) and were required to achieve an optimal alpha-GalCer-induced immune response. Using gene-targeted mice and recombinant cytokines, a critical need for IL- 12 and IL- 18 has been shown in the alpha-GalCer-induced IFN-gamma production by gamma delta T cells. Moreover, this cytokine production occurred downstream of type I NKT cell response, suggesting their bystander effect on gamma delta T cells. In line with this, gamma delta T cells failed to directly recognize the CD 1 d/alpha-GalCer complex. We also provided evidence that gamma delta T cells increase their cytotoxic properties after alpha-GalCer injection, resulting in an increase in killing of tumor cell targets. Moreover, using cancer models, we demonstrated that gamma delta T cells were required for an optimal alpha-GalCer-mediated anti-tumor activity. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> that immunization of wild-type mice with alpha-GalCer enhanced the adaptive immune response elicited by OVA, and this effect was strongly mediated by gamma delta T cells.

Human leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E) is an immune-tolerant nonclassical HLA class I molecule {{that could be}} involved in HBV progression. To measure soluble (s) HLA-E in patients with chronic HBV hepatitis (CHB). We tested the potential association of HLA-E* 01 : 01 / 01 : 03 A > G gene polymorphism to CHB. Our cohort consisted of 93 Tunisian CHB patients (stratified in CHB with high HBV DNA levels and CHB with low HBV DNA levels) and 245 healthy donors. Plasma sHLA-E was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer. No association between HLA-E* 01 : 01 / 01 : 03 A > G polymorphism and HBV DNA levels in CHB patients was found. G/G genotype is less frequent in CHB patients without significance. sHLA-E is significantly enhanced in CHB patients compared with healthy controls (P = 0. 0017). Stratification according to HBV DNA levels showed that CHB patients with low HBV DNA levels have higher sHLA-E levels compared with CHB patients with high HBV DNA levels. CHB patients with G/G genotype have enhanced sHLA-E levels compared with other genotypes (P = 0. 037).

40|$|Tracheal glands (TG) {{may play}} a {{specific}} role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease due to mutations in the cftr gene and characterized by airway inflammation and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. We compared the gene expression of wild-type TG cells and TG cells with the cftr DeltaF 508 mutation (CF-TG cells) using microarrays covering the whole human genome. In the absence of infection, CF-TG cells constitutively exhibited an inflammatory signature, including genes that encode molecules such as IL- 1 alpha, IL-beta, IL- 32, TNFSF 14, LIF, CXCL 1 and PLAU. In response to P. aeruginosa, genes associated with IFN-gamma response to infection (CXCL 10, IL- 24, IFNgammaR 2) and other mediators of anti-infectious responses (CSF 2, MMP 1, MMP 3, TLR 2, S 100 calcium-binding proteins A) were markedly up-regulated in wild-type TG cells. This microbicidal signature was silent in CF-TG cells. The deficiency of genes associated with IFN-gamma response was accompanied by the defective membrane expression of IFNgammaR 2 and altered response of CF-TG cells to exogenous IFN-gamma. In addition, CF-TG cells were unable to secrete CXCL 10, IL- 24 and S 100 A 8 /S 100 A 9 in response to P. aeruginosa. The differences between wild-type TG and CF-TG cells were due to the cftr mutation since gene expression was similar in wild-type TG cells and CF-TG cells transfected with a plasmid containing a functional cftr gene. <b>Finally,</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> an altered sphingolipid metabolism in CF-TG cells, which may account for their inflammatory signature.

40|$|Purpose Cadaveric {{study at}} our {{institution}} {{has demonstrated that}} optimal basaplate fixation of a reversed shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) could be achieved with screws in three major columns. Our aim was to review our early rate of aseptic glenoid loosening {{in a series of}} baseplate fixed according to this principle. Material and Methods Between 2005 and 2008, 48 RSA (Aequalis Reversed) were implanted in 48 patients with an average age of 74. 4 years (range, 56 to 86 years). There were 37 women and 11 men. Twenty-seven primary RSAs were performed for cuff tear arthropathy, 3 after failed rotator cuff surgery, 6 for failed arthroplasties, 7 for acute fractures and 5 after failed ORIF. All baseplate fixation were done using a nonlocking posterior screw in the spine, a nonlocking anterior screw in the glenoid body, a locking superior screw in the coracoid and a locking inferior screw in the pillar. All patients were reviewed with standardized radiographs. The number of screws were reported. We measured the position of the screws in relation to the scapular spine and the coracoid process in two different views. We defined screw positions as totally, partially or out of the target. <b>Finally</b> <b>we</b> <b>reported</b> glenoid aseptic loosening which was defined as implant subsidence. Results Four patients were lost to follow-up. Thus, 44 shoulders could be reviewed after a mean follow-up of 13 months (range, 6 to 32 months). All baseplates were fixed with 4 screws. Thirty-seven (84 %) screws were either partially or totally in the spine. Thus, 7 (16 %) scapular spine screws were out of the target. No coracoid screw was out the target. Two (4. 5 %) patients had glenoid loosening. Both had a scapular spine and a coracoid screw partially in the bone. Conclusion Early aseptic glenoid loosening occurred before the two years follow-up and is most of time related to technical problems and/or insufficient bone stock and bone quality. Our study demonstrate that baseplate fixation according to the three columns principle is a reproducible technique and a valuable way to prevent early glenoid loosening...|$|E
