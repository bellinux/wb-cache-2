40|$|Resistance to {{quaternary}} ammonium compounds (QAC) in staphylococci {{is common in}} hospital environments and has been described in the food industry. Little is known about staphylococcal QAC resistance associated with animal disease, although such disinfectants are widely used in veterinary medicine. In order to investigate the occurrence of QAC resistance in staphylococci isolated from QAC-exposed animals, 32 penicillin- and tetracycline-resistant and 23 penicillin- and tetracycline-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from milk from cows with mastitis during a 4 -year period were selected for QAC susceptibility studies and genetic characterization. The isolates originated from four different herds that used a common pasture with a <b>joint</b> <b>milking</b> parlor in the summer. During the pasture season, a teat cream containing the QAC cetyltrimethylammonium bromide had been used daily for more than 10 years for mastitis control. Three of the penicillin- and tetracycline-resistant isolates, which were recovered from three different cows during a 20 -month period, were resistant to QAC. Plasmid analysis, PCR, and DNA sequencing revealed a novel plasmid of 2, 239 bp containing the smr gene. The plasmid, designated pNVH 99, has similarities to small, smr-containing staphylococcal plasmids previously found in human and food isolates. pNVH 99 is a new member of the pC 194 family of rolling-circle replication plasmids. The three QAC-resistant isolates, as well as 28 of the 29 remaining penicillin- and tetracycline-resistant isolates, were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The study indicates that the occurrence and spread of QAC-resistant S. aureus among dairy cows may be a problem that needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} examines {{determinants of}} farmers' decision behavior to approve or disapprove process quality schemes in food production. A key methodology {{used in this}} study is discrete choice experiments (DCE) that are applied to reveal farmers' preferences and willingness-to-accept for production schemes. Although many people are critical towards modern agricultural practices and some consumers are willing to pay price increments for certain process qualities, the availability of milk that is produced without using GMO and high-welfare meat remain limited. The private sector as well as the German government responds with the establishment of production schemes and standards to meet consumers’ demand. However, there is a perception that incentives for farmers are not sufficient to encourage the desired changes of farming practices. This study examines farmers’ acceptance of milk production without GM-feedstuff (Chapter 2), as well as improved housing conditions and animal-friendly livestock handling in dairy and pig farming (Chapter 3 and 4). Furthermore, estimates of consumers’ willingness-to-pay for high welfare cutlets were used to simulate markets for pork produced in accordance with defined farm animal welfare standards (Chapter 4). In addition, farmers’ support of cooperation between dairies {{in the form of the}} <b>joint</b> <b>milk</b> collection to the production of cost-effective and more environmentally friendly was subject of the study in Chapter 5. The results of the case studies show that not only economic indicators are relevant for a farmers’ decision making, but also "soft factors", such as the general attitude towards animal welfare or genetic engineering and also the perception of the supplier relationship quality between the dairy company’s management and the farmer. This information can be used to design production concepts more efficient and thus achieve a greater degree of acceptance...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} factors that limit plant productivity. Oxidative stress is a secondary event in many unfavorable environmental conditions. Intracellular proteases have a role in the metabolism reorganisation and nutrient remobilization under stress. In order to under stand the relative significance of oxidative stress and proteolysis in the yield reduction under drought, four varieties of Triticum aestivum L. with different field drought resistance were examined. Methods: A two-year field experiment was conducted. Analyses were performed on the upper most leaf of control plants and plants under water deficitat the stages most critical for yield reduction under drought (from <b>jointing</b> till <b>milk</b> ripeness). Leaf water deficit and electrolyte leakage, malondyaldehyde level, activities and isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, leaf protein content and proteolytic activity were studied. Yield components were analyzed. Results: A general trend of increasing the membrane in stability and accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides was observed with some differences among varieties, especially under drought. The anti-oxidative enzyme activities were progressively enhanced, as well as the azocaseinolytic activities. The leaf protein content decreased under drought at the last phase. Differences among varieties were observed in the parameters under study. They were compared to yield components` reduction under water deprivation...|$|R

40|$|A {{suitable}} planting {{pattern and}} irrigation strategy {{are essential for}} optimizing winter wheat yield and water use efficiency (WUE). The study aimed to evaluate the impact of planting pattern and irrigation frequency on grain yield and WUE of winter wheat. During the 2013 - 2014 and 2014 - 2015 winter wheat growing seasons in the North China Plain, the effects of planting patterns and irrigation frequencies were determined on tiller number, grain yield, and WUE. The two planting patterns tested were wide-precision and conventional-cultivation. Each planting pattern had three irrigation regimes: irrigation (120 mm) at the jointing stage; irrigation (60 mm) at both the jointing and heading stages; and irrigation (40 mm) at the <b>jointing,</b> heading, and <b>milking</b> stages. In our study, tiller number was significantly higher in the wide-precision planting pattern than in the conventional-cultivation planting pattern. Additionally, the highest grain yields and WUE were observed when irrigation was applied at the jointing stage (120 mm) or at the jointing and heading stages (60 mm each) in the wide-precision planting pattern. These results {{could be attributed to}} higher tiller numbers as well as reduced water consumption due to reduced irrigation frequency. In both growing seasons, applying 60 mm of water at jointing and heading stages resulted in the highest grain yield among the treatments. Based on our results, for winter wheat production in semi-humid regions, we recommend a wide-precision planting pattern with irrigation (60 mm) at both the jointing and heading stages...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{open top}} chamber (OTC) method {{was used in}} a {{farmland}} to study the influence of different levels of O 3 concentrations (40 ppb, 80 ppb and 120 ppb) on the enzymatic activity and metabolite contents of the antioxidation system of the winter wheat leaves during the <b>jointing,</b> heading and <b>milk</b> stage. The protective effect of exogenous spermidine (Spd) against the antioxidation of winter wheat under the O 3 stress was investigated. With the increasing O 3 concentrations and fumigation time, the injuries of the winter wheat leaves were observed to be more serious. For instance, when the O 3 concentration reached 120 ppb, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and nitrate reductase (NR) in the jointing stage decreased by 50. 3 %, 64. 9 %, 75. 5 % and 92. 9 %, respectively; peroxidase (POD) and glutathione reductase (GR) increased by 45. 1 % and 80. 5 %, respectively; the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) increased by 314. 3 %, 8. 4 % and 31. 7 %, respectively; and the soluble protein (SP) content decreased by 47. 5 %. The O 3 stress also had {{significant impact on the}} contents of proline (Pro), NO 3 ––N and NH 4 +–N of the winter wheat leaves. During the heading stage, when the O 3 concentration was 40 ppb and 80 ppb, the content of Pro was 163. 9 % and 173. 2 % higher than that in the control group, respectively. But under 120 ppb, it was decreased by 42. 4 %. Exogenous application of Spd increased the activities of SOD, POD, CAT, APX and GR, as well as the contents of GSH and SP, but decreased the contents of MDA and AsA. This indicates that Spd is an effective antioxidant to relieve the O 3 stress on winter wheat leaves, thereby might be applicable to protect winter wheat from the harm of O 3...|$|R
