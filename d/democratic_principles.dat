5|$|The Act of February 16 {{proclaimed the}} {{re-establishment}} (atstatyti) of the Lithuanian state, {{making it the}} successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (sudaryti) of a Lithuanian state. However, it was {{made clear that the}} new state would be quite different from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands (except for the Vilnius region which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by <b>democratic</b> <b>principles,</b> as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish-Lithuanian union.|$|E
5|$|The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party at {{one point}} had agreed to join as well, seeing that the ARF's {{political}} ideology was socialism. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not Marxist enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in Tiflis, Russian Empire, in 1892. At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized modus operandi according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based on the <b>democratic</b> <b>principles</b> of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and agrarian reform.|$|E
40|$|This article aims at {{reflecting}} {{upon the}} connection, evident at first sight, between the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> {{and the right}} to decide. However, the article highlights some of the contradictions in which some supporters of such connection fall, and defends that the relationship between the principle {{of the rule of law}} and the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> cannot give either preeminence over the other. The reason lies in the idea that the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> cannot be understood as the mere sum of particular wills from a specific community, but rather as an expression of the conditions that ensure the formation of a rationally political will. The <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> can only be understood from a normative, and not factual, conception of sovereign power...|$|R

40|$|IS IT WRONG TO ALLOW IDEOLOGY to pervade {{political}} decisions on software procurement, {{or is it}} inevitable that governments profess a particular conception of the good with respect to every aspect of societal life? This article advances a normative framework, based upon a broad conception of the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle,</b> to advocate that Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) be adopted and have its development encouraged and carried out by democratic governments. More than an aspiration, formal and substantial reasons ground the understanding advocated in this article that striving towards comprehensive FLOSS policies is a duty of every state that purports to be a democratic one. After a brief introduction of my propositions in Part 1, and a conceptualization of FLOSS in Part 2, Part 3 describes different governmental FLOSS policies around the world. These policies, I show, are often based upon normative values that, beyond stereotypes, would be better assessed within a thorough conception of the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle.</b> Part 4 portrays the Brazilian government’s particular history of expressly linking FLOSS policies to the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle.</b> Part 5 analyzes different dimensions of the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> in the information age. Part 5 begins by conceptualizing the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> in light of its relation with technology, in general, and FLOSS, in particular, and then evaluates the importance of FLOSS for the fulfillment of cultural, ethical, political, and economic dimensions of the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle.</b> In Part 6, the article concludes with a particular understanding of the commitment assumed in the Tunis round of the World Summit on the Information Society and reinforces this vision of the deontological character of governmental policies towards FLOSS. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

25|$|The Nazi {{government}} executed {{her husband}} for treason, he having discussed with the Kreisau Circle group {{the prospects for a}} Germany based on moral and <b>democratic</b> <b>principles</b> that could develop after Hitler.

25|$|After {{two more}} preparatory {{conferences}} in 1933 and 1934, the First Plenary Assembly, held in Geneva in August 1936, established the World Jewish Congress {{as a permanent}} and democratic organization.

5000|$|In Western European {{political}} science, {{the term}} polyarchy (poly [...] "many", arkhe [...] "rule") {{was used by}} Robert Dahl to describe a form of government in which power is invested in multiple people. It {{takes the form of}} neither a dictatorship nor a democracy. This form of government was first implemented in the United States and France and was gradually adopted by many other countries (Dahl, p. 234, 1989) Including Canada after the signing of the NAFTA agreement by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in 1994. According to Dahl, the fundamental <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> is “the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens, considered as political equals” with unimpaired opportunities (Dahl, 1971). A polyarchy is a state that has certain procedures that are necessary conditions for following the <b>democratic</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|R

Päts also founded the Tallinn Technical Institute on 15September 1936 as the second university in Estonia. Losing the Supreme Court and some faculties in the university definitely reduced the importance of Tartu in Southern Estonia - the town that had historically been supportive to Päts's opponent Jaan Tõnisson.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{significance}} of Hamdija Pozderac {{for the history}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina is today still debated among historians.

As a result, he was criticized for contributing to the continued presence of Pozderac family on the political scene in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|On 19 January 1944, the Gestapo arrested von Moltke’s {{husband for}} warning an {{acquaintance}} of that person’s impending arrest. She was allowed to visit him under benign conditions and found that he could continue to work and receive papers. On 20 July 1944 there was an attempt on Hitler's life, which the Gestapo used as a pretext to eliminate perceived opponents to the Nazi regime. In January 1945, Helmuth von Moltke was tried, convicted, and executed by a Gestapo “People's Court” for treason, having discussed with the Kreisau Circle group {{the prospects for a}} Germany based on moral and <b>democratic</b> <b>principles</b> that could develop after Hitler.|$|E

25|$|In response, the Republicans {{appealed to}} <b>democratic</b> <b>principles.</b> Samuel Smith of Maryland {{argued that the}} {{presidency}} ought to be as closely accountable to the people as possible. As such, having three candidates in a contingency election is far better than having five, because {{it is possible to}} have the fifth best candidate become President otherwise. Also, designation itself would drastically cut down the number of elections that would reach the house, and the President is then {{much more likely to be}} the people’s choice. Another of Smith’s arguments was simply the election of 1800. William Cocke of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was simply out of self-interest.|$|E

The three nations of the Eorzean Alliance—Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah—play a smaller role in the story compared to A Realm Reborn, as does their adversary, the Garlean Empire. Players are also able to explore Dravania, the homeland of the dragons, and islands floating in the Sea of Clouds above the Abalathia's Spine mountain range. In Dravania, the ruined remains of Sharlayan, a city-state which had been evacuated during the first Garlean invasion, have given rise to Idyllshire, a free city founded by goblins upon <b>democratic</b> <b>principles.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{contract}} of employment can always create better terms than statutory minimum rights. But to increase their bargaining power to get fair terms, employees organize labor unions for collective bargaining. The Clayton Act of 1914 guarantees all people the right to organize, and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 creates rights for most employees to organize without detriment through unfair labor practices. Under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, labor union governance follows <b>democratic</b> <b>principles.</b> If a majority of employees in a workplace support a union, employing entities {{have a duty to}} bargain in good faith. Unions can take collective action to defend their interests, including withdrawing their labor on strike. There are not yet general rights to directly participate in enterprise governance, but many employees and unions have experimented with securing representation on corporate boards.|$|E
40|$|The Lisbon Treaty (Article 11) {{recognises}} {{the provision}} on participatory democracy as a <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> of the European Union (EU), thus constitutionally legitimising {{the involvement of}} civil society in European governance. However, at least three issues relating to the democratic dimension of this practice remain unresolved. First, {{it is not possible}} to specify precisely how the participation of civil society relates to democracy. Second, having established representative democracy as the founding <b>democratic</b> <b>principle</b> of the EU (Article 10), the Lisbon Treaty does not allow assessing the provision on participatory democracy as an independent source for democracy. Third, the putative democratising potential of participation would not be construed independently, not only because representative democracy is defined as the founding principle of the EU but also because participation cannot be thought of as independent from the form of the consultation regime, the constitutional framework and the managerial and technocratic styles of policy-making...|$|R
