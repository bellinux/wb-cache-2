40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown (1, 2, 3) that the addition of methylene blue, or similar reversibly oxidized and reduced dyes, increases the oxygen consumption of cell suspensions. It was also demonstrated that correlated wath this increase, there is {{a decrease in the}} aerobic glycolysis * as shown by a diminished lactic acid formation (4). It was furthermore suggested (5) that the effect of the dye seemed to be proportional to the <b>fermentative</b> <b>power</b> of. the cell. To test the validity of this hypothesis, use has been made of the fundamental researches of Warburg (6) on the metabolism of normal tissues and tumors. Warburg has shown there is a sharp difference between the metabolism of tumors and that of normal adult tissues. While in general normal adult tissues possess a high respiration, sufficient to check the appearance of the fermentative processes, tumors, on the other hand, have a low respiration, and consequently part of the energy necessary for the performance of cellular activities has to be provided by fermentation...|$|E
40|$|Torulaspora delbrueckii is a non-Saccharomyces yeast with {{interesting}} metabolic {{and physiological}} properties of potential use in oenology. This work examines the fermentative behaviour of five strains of T. delbrueckii in sequential fermentations with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, analysing {{the formation of}} aromatic compounds, polyalcohols and pigments. The <b>fermentative</b> <b>power</b> of these five strains ranged between 7. 6 and 9. 0 % v/v ethanol; the associated volatile acidity was 0. 2 e 0. 7 g/l acetic acid. The production of glycerol was inferior to that of S. cerevisiae alone. The mean 2, 3 -butanediol concentration reached in single-culture S. cerevisiae fermentations was 73 % {{higher than in the}} five sequential T. delbrueckii/S. cerevisiae fermentations. However, these fermentations produced larger quantities of diacetyl, ethyl lactate and 2 -phenylethyl acetate than single-culture S. cerevisiae fermentation. 3 -ethoxy propanol was produced only in the sequential fermentations. The five sequential fermentations produced smaller quantities of vitisin A and B than single-culture S. cerevisiae fermentation. In tests performed prior to the addition of the S. cerevisiae in the sequential fermentations, none of the T. delbrueckii strains showed any extracellular hydroxycinnamate decarboxylase activity. They therefore produced no vinyl phenolic pyranoanthocyanins...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} both {{the chemical and}} antioxidative characteristics of wheat flour added with 10, 20 and 30 % immature chalssalbori flour; further, the quality characteristics of bread dough during yeast fermentation were assessed. As the addition rate of chalssalbori flour into wheat flour increased, the DPPH radical scavenging capacity, water absorption index, water solubility index and viscosity were all increased. Moreover, the bread dough with an increased addition rate of chalssalbori flour demonstrated an increased pH, reduced <b>fermentative</b> expansion <b>power</b> and a darker yellowish color. The bread dough added with chalssalbori flour after mixing showed higher hardness, gumminess and adhesiveness, but lower cohesiveness and springiness compared to the control; however, these texture characteristics were changed during fermentation. In the present study, the mixed flour with 10 % immature chalssalbori flour conveyed similar pasting characteristics to those of wheat flour; moreover, its bread dough showed higher springiness and fermentativ...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{the use of}} {{selected}} commercial yeasts (LSA) from Saccharomyces species "sensu stricto" is widespread, because it allows to minimize risks in the production process, to standardize the winemaking procedure and ensure {{the quality of the}} final product. On the other hand, the widespread use of starter cultures in the wine industry has resulted in a loss of wine sensory characteristics and in a flattening of those differences crucial to distinguish wines of different cultivars. For this reason, the research is focused on studying new selected yeast cultures that can give a final product enrich of those aromatic compounds which enhance the character of the wine. It is known that the production of many of this aromatic molecules occurs due to the presence of non-Saccharomyces yeasts, found on the grapes and must. These non-Saccharomyces yeast strains predominate in {{the first phase of the}} alcoholic fermentation, are able to release metabolites and enzymes, responsible of the aromatic complexity of the wine. Indeed, experimental tests have shown the positive role of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in the fermentation, improving the behavior of the starter and increasing the complexity of the composition of the wine, in particular, the chemical and sensory properties. The biochemical transformation of flavour-inactive grape juice constituents into aromatic components has emerged, as an important, additional mechanism whereby yeasts substantially impact on wine aroma and flavour and facilitate greater expression of grape varietal character. In addition to ethanol, produced of the primary alcoholic fermentation, there are numerous compounds such as esters, higher alcohols, aldehydes, acids, terpenes, ketones, that determine the final quality of the product. The yeasts have the ability to produce these compounds, but it is the quantitative level that determines the difference between the different species and then, within the same species, between different biotypes. The wine yeasts for starter culture development have been sourced from grapes, winery environment or old cellars and spontaneous fermentations that have given wines of acceptable or unique quality. They are selected based on characteristics such as vigor <b>fermentative,</b> alcoholigenous <b>power</b> and they should be tolerant to the antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds, produce minimal foam, as well as produce a balanced array of flavour metabolites, without undesirable excess of volatile compounds and produce enzymes that transform the neutral compounds in flavor active component. Glycosidases and esterases are some of the enzymes produced by yeasts that can make a significant contribution to the aroma of the wine. In particular, the non-Saccharomyces yeasts have more enzymatic activities respect to yeasts S. cerevisiae. The aim of this work was the selection and use of autochthonous yeast strains isolated from cultivars of "Vitis Vinifera" of southern Italy and their impact on aroma profile of wines. We have tested different combination of autochthonous yeasts (S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces) to improve the quality and organoleptic characteristics of the final product but also to emphasize its link with the territory and the ancient wine cultivars. In order to evaluated the aromatic profile, the different wine samples were characterized by Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Crhomatography/Mass Spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS technique) ...|$|R
40|$|Lipid binding {{in fresh}} and stored soured started breads {{formulated}} with nonfat [sodium carboxy-methylcellulose (CMC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), fungal -amylase- and fat–monoglycer-ides (MGL), diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono-diglycerides (DATEM) and {{sodium stearoyl lactylate}} (SSL) ] additives were determined. Results were correlated with dough and bread technological performance during breadmaking and storage. A preferential binding of the added SSL to the starch with a concomitant displacement of endogenous polar lipids from starch to gluten was observed. Monoglycerides partly bound to the starch and partial remained in the pool of free lipids with displacement of endogenous polar lipids from gluten to starch and free fractions. Addition of DATEM induced similar changes as SSL in association pattern and as MGL in polar lipid translocation. Hydrocolloids showed preferential bindings to the gluten (CMC) and to the starch (HPMC) respectively, associated to a significant displacement of endogenous neutral gluten-bounded lipids to the starchy fraction (CMC) and to a significant release of both starch- and gluten-bonded lipids (HPMC). Addition of -amylase promoted both a release of endogenous bonded lipids and a binding of glycolipids to the starch whereas the sourer starter induced disaggregation of the starch – and gluten–lipid complexes.

The raising power activity (CO 2 evolved / g yeast cell/h) and improvement of protein content, viability and decrease of the ash content as to meet the specification of conventional Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in baking purposes. To achieve these objective the effects of duration time of ethanol production as well as ethanol concentration in fermentation mash were studied {{in order to identify}} suitable parameters necessary to avoid the adverse effects of ethanol on the viability and physiological state of yeast cells. Promising results have been attained for improving the raising power as well as remarkedly decreasing the ash contents of cells by application of five successive washing on the yeast cells after removal of the ethanol production fermentors. Furthermore, significant increases in yeast yield, total viable cells, total solid matter (TSM), protein content raising <b>fermentative</b> <b>power,</b> accompanied by marked reduction in ash content of cells were gained when the cells were resuspended in 1 % (w/v) total sugars cane molasses after final washing and allowed to grow for 24 hrs. Comparative studies and chemical analysis on the revived resulting cells have shown that the new product exhibited typical baker`s yeast properties with regard to levening power, protein and ash content of cells as well as the number of the active viable cells per gram of the product. The obtained results were discussed in the light of application feasibilities in production of baker`s yeast in alcohol distillation factories...|$|E
40|$|Non-Saccharomyces yeasts are a {{heterogeneous}} microbial group {{involved in the}} early stages of wine fermentation. The high enzymatic potential of these yeasts makes them a useful tool for increasing the final organoleptic characteristics of wines in spite of their low <b>fermentative</b> <b>power.</b> Their physiology and contribution to wine quality are still poorly understood, with most current knowledge being acquired empirically and in most cases based in single species and strains. This work analyzed the metabolic potential of 770 yeast isolates from different enological origins and representing 15 different species, by studying their production of enzymes of enological interest and linking phylogenetic and enzymatic data. The isolates were screened for glycosidase enzymes related to terpene aroma release, the β-lyase activity responsible for the release of volatile thiols, and sulfite reductase. Apart from these aroma-related activities, protease, polygalacturonase and cellulase activities were also studied in the entire yeast collection, being related to the improvement of different technological and sensorial features of wines. In this context, and in terms of abundance, two different groups were established, with α-L-arabinofuranosidase, polygalacturonase and cellulase being the less abundant activities. By contrast, β-glucosidase and protease activities were widespread in the yeast collection studied. A classical phylogenetic study involving the partial sequencing of 26 S rDNA was conducted in conjunction with the enzymatic profiles of the 770 yeast isolates for further typing, complementing the phylogenetic relationships established by using 26 S rDNA. This has rendered it possible to foresee the contribution different yeast species make to wine quality and their potential applicability as pure inocula, establishing species-specific behavior. These consistent results allowed us to design future targeted studies on the impact different non-Saccharomyces yeast species have on wine quality, understanding intra and interspecific enzymatic odds and, therefore, aiming to predict the most suitable application for the current non-Saccharomyces strains, as well as the potential future applications of new strains. This work therefore contributes to a better understanding of the concept of wine microbiome and its potential consequences for wine quality, as well as to the knowledge of non-Saccharomyces yeasts for their use in the wine industry...|$|E
