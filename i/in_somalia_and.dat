5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta.

5|$|On 25 March, the Belgo-Congolese {{battalion}} and the {{two companies}} of the 2/6 KAR occupied Gambela.

That same month the troops of the 2/6th KAR were withdrawn to the Dabus River to link up with the rest of their unit to contain the Italian garrison in Mendi.|$|E
