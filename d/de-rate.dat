50|$|These {{may be an}} {{alternative}} where {{the issue at hand}} is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.) An oversized static converter can remove the need to <b>de-rate</b> the motor, but at an increased cost.|$|E

This was largely the result of a very short rear hood housing the electrical cabinet, whereas electrical cabinets were normally located in the long hood on most road switcher designs. In order to make the locomotive suitable for weight-restricted light rail branch lines, MLW spread the weight over the rail surface using A1A-A1A trucks (2 powered axles, 1 unpowered axle) which were manufactured by Dominion Foundries and Steel (DOFASCO); this same truck was also adopted for the MLW RSC-13.

40|$|The {{popularity}} {{of green and}} renewable energy has risen sharply in recent years, and hydropower has consistently been {{the most common form}} of renewable energy in both the US and the state of New Hampshire. As a result of this strong green movement, government organizations have seen increased pressure to produce figures to the public detailing the amount of hydropower potentially available in the country. Often these figures will depict very attractive numbers for the untapped hydropower potential in the country, yet the data do not seem realistic to anyone familiar with hydropower generation. This paper will attempt to <b>de-rate</b> these general estimates made for hydropower potential by government organizations, specifically in New Hampshire. It will be determined if these parties are ignoring basic hydropower design challenges in their estimations, such as system efficiency, generator capacity factors, and the economic feasibility of the projects themselves.

The BMS often quantifies SoH based on capacity (SoHE) and power fade (SoHP) without diagnosing the root causes.

These techniques were applied to four parallelised LIBs loaded with a constant current profile for 500 cycles. Loss of active material and loss of lithium ions were identified to be the most relevant degradation modes for this experiment. Moreover, a linear relationship between the intensity of the peaks of the IC and DV curves were identified with respect to the SoHE. This result may enable the future estimation and prediction of SoHE in a simple way. Overall, the outcomes of this work may support novel strategies to control SoHE within the BMS, so that the rate of battery degradation can be reduced...|$|E
30|$|The {{reliability}} assessment, which {{described in}} Sect. 3, incorporates <b>de-rating</b> of PV outputs into the calculations; however, {{it is not}} modelled within the Markov process of the PV system directly.

Alternatively, the Markov model given in Fig.  4 can also be extended to incorporate the <b>de-rated</b> state of the PV system; however; it will further complicate the stochastic transitional matrix, demanding an increased processing time for calculating the reliability indices.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a techno-economic {{analysis of the}} capture and storage of CO 2 from a single coal fired boiler with extensions to a fleet of coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric and wind generating stations. AspenPlusâ„¢ was used to simulate a 500 MW coal boiler c/w steam cycle and MEA absorption process. The energy required by the absorption process resulted in a ~ 30 % <b>de-rate</b> in the generating station output. 14, 000 tonnes/day of pure CO 2 captured and compressed from the boiler was transported and injected into a saline aquifer approximately 125 km from the generating station and at least 800 m beneath the earthâ€™s surface under supercritical conditions, (31. 1 Â°C, 7. 38 MPa). The cost to transfer CO 2 from the boiler and inject it underground is ~ 10 US$/tonne of CO 2. The extension from a single boiler to the entire fleet of generating stations was formulated as an MILP and implemented in GAMS. A 3 % fleet-wide reduction in CO 2 emissions was achieved by fuel-balancing alone. Deeper reductions, however, required a combination of CO 2 capture and storage, fuelswitching and new capacity including IGCC, NGCC and nuclear.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundClinical studies provide formalised {{experience}} for evidence-based medicine (EBM). Many people consider a controlled randomised trial (CRT, identical to a {{randomised controlled trial}} RCT) to be the non-plus-ultra design. However, CRTs also have limitations. The problem is not randomisation itself but informed consent for randomisation and masking of therapies according to today's legal and ethical standards. We {{do not want to}} <b>de-rate</b> CRTs, but we would like to contribute to the discussion on clinical research methodology. SituationInformed consent to a CRT and masking of therapies plainly select patients. The excellent internal validity of CRTs can be counterbalanced by poor external validity, because internal and external validity act as antagonists. In a CRT, patients may feel like guinea pigs, this can decrease compliance, cause protocol violations, reduce self-healing properties, suppress unspecific therapeutic effects and possibly even modify specific efficacy. DiscussionA control group (comparative study) is most important for the degree of evidence achieved by a trial. Study control by detailed protocol and good clinical practice (controlled study) is second in importance and randomisation and masking is third (thus the sequence CRT instead of RCT). Controlled non-randomised trials are just as ambitious and detailed as CRTs. RecommendationWe recommend clinicians and biometricians to take high quality controlled non-randomised trials into consideration more often. They combine good internal and external validity, better suit daily medical practice, show better patient compliance and fewer protocol violations, deliver estimators unbiased by alienated patients, and perhaps provide a clearer explanation of the achieved success...|$|E
40|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{is expected to}} grow at a rate of 4 - 5 % in the next 20 years. Such a growth rate may have important impacts on local air quality, climate change and community noise. This work assesses selected technologies and operational procedures aimed at improving the environmental performance of future airplanes. Two different studies are presented: estimating turbine durability benefits from jet engine water injection and evaluating improvements in fuel burn and operating costs from using advanced technology, high bypass ratio engines and varying the design cruise speed. Water injection in commercial airplane engine combustors lowers operating temperatures and can lead to significant reductions in NO, and soot emissions, potentially improving engine hot section life. With increasing fuel prices and possible introduction of emissions trading in the future, fuel burn may become a more critical aircraft design driver. Increasing engine bypass ratio and lowering cruise speed can lead to reduced fuel consumption. The dominant mechanisms of failure in turbine blades are low cycle fatigue, creep and oxidation. The Universal Slopes method is used to evaluate possible fatigue life benefits from water injection for three representative blade materials. (cont.) For a 67 K change in turbine inlet temperature, metal temperature changes up to 47 K are expected. Life improvement with a 47 K change in metal temperature is possible up to a factor of 1. 90 for Inconel 625, up to 1. 46 for Inconel 706 and up to 2. 85 for Ren 80 depending on the strains imposed. Blade life effects of creep and oxidation for varying temperatures are presented based on a literature review. The absolute value of possible benefits strongly depend on material properties, metal and gas temperatures (internal and external to the blade) and stress levels. In addition, a maintenance cost analysis is performed to evaluate and compare benefits resulting from engine <b>de-rate</b> and water injection using an engine cycle program (GasTurb) and airline data for a typical 1970 's technology mixed flow turbofan engine. A 67 K change in Tt 4 from water injection corresponds to an average <b>de-rate</b> value of 8. 4 %. Material maintenance costs in 2004 dollars are reduced by 16. 52 % to 2. 86 % for a 1 -hour and 12 -hour flight length respectively. Results show that shorter range flights, with more takeoffs per day, experience larger benefits. (cont.) Engine durability analysis capabilities of a numerical simulation design tool - the Environmental Design Space (EDS) are examined. EDS currently does not have the capability for durability analyses and given the inherent difficulty in finding reliable physics-based models for part life prediction that do not require proprietary data, it seems unlikely that EDS will be able to develop such a capability. The engine bypass-ratio and cruise speed trade study is conducted for a 737 -sized future airplane using Boeing internal tools and data. At higher cruise speeds a clear optimum bypass ratio value for minimizing fuel burn is found; for the UEET engines this optimum BPR is about 14. As cruise speed is lowered, fuel burn continually decreases with increasing bypass ratio for the engines examined. At a fixed bypass ratio, flying slower seems most beneficial for very high fuel prices for minimizing both fuel burn and operating costs. by Anuja Mahashabde. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} use {{of power}} electronic devices and other non-linear loads in the power system has raised concerns about damaging effects of voltage and current harmonics, {{both in terms of}} their magnitude and frequency. In the power grid, transformers are the key components which interconnect different parts of the system at different operating voltage levels. Harmonic contamination in the electricity networks can generate excessive losses and associated temperature rise in transformer. Any transformer failures will cause major outage and threaten the power supply reliability. Thus, it is important to accurately determine the impacts of harmonics on transformer life. Current standard provides an empirical approach to <b>de-rate</b> transformer capacities when transformers are subjected to non-sinusoidal load currents. The method was proposed based on some assumptions. The eddy current loss in transformer winding was taken to be proportional with square of the RMS current as well as the harmonic order, and the other stray loss in transformer structure was assumed to vary with square of harmonic current and a harmonic exponent factor. Furthermore, the standard ignored the effect of voltage harmonics on the transformer iron loss and temperature rise. In other words, the core loss was not considered in the de-rating process. The thesis focuses on practical assessment of voltage harmonics on transformer losses and temperature rise, specifically in oil-filled distribution transformers. Results demonstrated significant increase of transformer core loss under voltage harmonic contamination. An equation to calculate the resistance corresponding to the eddy-current loss was developed from empirical assumptions about losses in oil-filled transformer. Heat-run tests under voltage harmonic pollution were carried out on full- iv sized transformers. The temperature rise at different locations within the transformer was monitored by optical fibre temperature sensors. The analysis of winding temperature rise revealed increase of temperature as compared to the harmonic-free rated condition. Finite element computational method using COMSOL Multiphysics and heat transfer theory was also applied in the study. The simulation revealed the hottest-spot temperature which was validated with IEC standard, as well as the complex patterns of oil circulation inside the transformer...|$|E
40|$|Under a {{contract}} with CH 2 M Hill Hanford Group, Inc., PNNL has performed {{a review of the}} NDE technology and methods for examination of the concrete dome structure of Hanford’s double-shell tanks. The objective was to provide a matrix of methodologies that could be evaluated based on applicability, ease of deployment, and results that could provide information {{that could be used in}} the ongoing structural analysis of the tank dome. PNNL performed a technology evaluation with the objective of providing a critical literature review for all applicable technologies based on constraints provided by CH 2 M HILL. These constraints were not mandatory, but were desired. These constraints included performing the evaluation without removing any soil from the top of the tank, or if necessary, requesting that the hole diameter needed to gain access to evaluate the top of the tank structure to be no greater than approximately 12 -in. in diameter. PNNL did not address the details of statistical sampling requirements as they depend on an unspecified risk tolerance. PNNL considered these during the technology evaluation and have reported the results in the remainder of this document. Many of the basic approaches to concrete inspection that were reviewed in previous efforts are still in use. These include electromagnetic, acoustic, radiographic, etc. The primary improvements in these tools have focused on providing quantitative image reconstruction, thus providing inspectors and analysts with three-dimensional data sets that allow for operator visualization of relevant abnormalities and analytical integration into structural performance models. Available instruments, such as radar used for bridge deck inspections, rely on post-processing algorithms and do not provide real-time visualization. Commercially available equipment only provides qualitative indications of relative concrete damage. It cannot be used as direct input for structural analysis to assess fitness for use and if necessary to <b>de-rate</b> critical components. There are currently no tools that automatically convert the NDE data to formats compatible with structural analysis programs. While radiographic techniques still provide significant advantages in spatial resolution, non-ionizing techniques are still preferred. Radar imagining in the 1 – 5 GHz has become the most useful. Unfortunately the algorithms and underlying assumptions used in these reconstructions are proprietary, and it is not possible to assess the quality and limitations of the analytical methods used to generate the derived structural data. The hypothesis that water intrusion may contribute to potential rebar corrosion of the tank domes provided the primary guidance in reviewing and evaluating available NDE technologies. Of primary concern is the need to employ technologies that provide the best opportunity for visualizing the rebar and providing quantitative data that can be integrated into structural analysis efforts to better understand and quantify the structural capacity of the domes. The conclusion is that an imaging system capable of locating and quantifying the distribution and conditions of the cement, aggregate, and rebar will provide the most valuable baseline upon which to build a case for the integrity of the structure. If successful, such a system would fulfill the need to incorporate valuable data into current structural load capacity analysis...|$|E
40|$|This project {{encompassed}} the design, development, {{and demonstration}} of integrated online optimization systems at Dynegy Midwest Generation's Baldwin Energy Complex (BEC) located in Baldwin, Illinois. The overall project {{objective was to}} improve coal-based generation's emission profile, efficiency, maintenance requirements and plant asset life {{in order to enhance}} the long-term viability of the United States abundant coal resources. Five separate but integrated optimization products were developed, addressing combustion, sootblowing, SCR operations, overall unit thermal performance, and plant-wide availability optimization. Optimization results are inherently unit-specific and cannot be known for a particular generating unit in advance. However, NeuCo believed that the following were reasonable targets for the completed, integrated set of products: Furnace NOx reduction improvement by 5 %, Heat rate improvement by 1. 5 %, Increase of annual Available MWh by 1. 5 %, Commensurate reductions in greenhouse gases, mercury, and particulates; and Commensurate increases in profitability from lower costs, improved reliability, and greater commercial availability. The goal during Phase I was to establish each system and demonstrate their integration in unified plant optimization. Efforts during Phase I focused on: (1) developing, deploying, integrating, and testing prototypes for each of the five products; (2) identifying and addressing issues required for the products to integrate with plant operations; and (3) systematically collecting and assimilating feedback to improve subsequent product releases. As described in the Phase II continuation application NeuCo successfully achieved the goal for Phase I. The goal of Phase II was to improve upon the products installed and tested in Phase I and to quantify the benefits of the integrated system. As this report documents, NeuCo has also successfully achieved the goal for Phase II. The overall results of the project, compared with the project goals, are: (1) NOx Reduction: The 5 % target for NOx reduction was exceeded with average CEMS and SCR Inlet (furnace) NOx reduction of between 12 % and 14 %. (2) Heat Rate Improvement: The optimization systems delivered an average heat rate improvement of between 0. 67 % and 0. 7 %. This falls short of the 1. 5 % heat rate improvement target largely because Cyclone Stability (availability) and CEMS and SCR Inlet NOx were prioritized over heat rate in the event they needed to be traded-off with one another. A different prioritization of objectives could have driven a different balance, thereby meeting the target of 1. 5 % improvement. There were also several factors that could have been masking greater heat rate improvements such as the decrease in fuel density {{over the course of the}} project and the impact of actions taken as a result of advice provided by the optimizers that are difficult to quantify. (3) Increased Annual Available MWh: Although difficult to measure precisely, the target of increasing available MWh's by 1. 5 % was met by providing prioritized alerts and knowledge-based diagnostics for a wide array of plant equipment and process anomalies; helping the plant to move from high sulfur, high Btu Illinois coal to PRB and run that fuel at low stoichiometries without derates; and improved management of cyclone flame quality as well as improved vigilance with respect to cyclone conditions which avoided some degree of temporary <b>de-rate</b> due to cyclone slag build up. (4) Commensurate Reductions in Greenhouse Gases, Mercury, and Particulates: Reductions in all three of these indices can be associated directly with the optimization leverage observed in the heat rate and NOx reductions. (5) Commensurate Increases in Profitability from Lower Costs, Improved Reliability, and Greater Commercial Availability: Commensurate improvements in costs, reliability and availability resulted from the previously described benefits. Also playing a role were the sustained operation of the cyclones while using more available, less expensive but off-design fuel; more effective catalytic reduction of NOx; and the reduced time required to discover, prioritize and diagnose plant equipment issues. The total annual dollar value of the benefits associated with the products installed, refined, and commercialized at BEC are estimated to range from $ 1. 8 to $ 3. 2 million dollars per-unit, and $ 7. 2 to $ 8. 1 million dollars per year plant-wide depending on whether CO{sub 2 } benefits are included. In summary, the NeuCo project at BEC was successfully completed and has demonstrated that advanced optimization technologies can play an important role in improving the environmental footprint of coal-based power generation while achieving other important operating objectives...|$|E
