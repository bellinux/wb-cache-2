40|$|Trivalent boron species readily {{react with}} protonated phosphopeptides to give {{addition}} products {{with the loss}} of boron ligands. In the present study, trimethoxyborane (TMB), diisopropoxymethylborane (DIPM), and <b>diethylmethoxyborane</b> (DEMB) were allowed to react with four phosphopeptides, VsSF, LSsF, LsGASA, and VSGAsA (lower-case s indicates phosphoserine). Each of the phosphopeptides contains one serine that is phosphorylated and one that is not. Under collision-activated dissociation (CAD) conditions, the boron-derivatized peptides give fragmentation patterns that differ significantly from that of the protonated phosphopeptide. The patterns vary, depending on the number of labile (i. e., alkoxy) ligands on the boron. In general, boron derivatization increases the yield of phosphate-containing sequence ions, but dramatic effects are only seen with certain reagent/peptide combinations. However, the suite of reagents provides a means of altering and increasing the information content of phosphopeptide CAD spectra...|$|E
40|$|Mass Spectrometry {{has emerged}} as a {{powerful}} analytical tool for the characterization of unknown molecules. Molecular weight information and chemical formulas of the unknowns can be derived by measuring the m/z value of the ionized analyte. In addition, structural information can be obtained via tandem mass spectrometry methods such as collision-activated dissociation (CAD). However, CAD does not always guarantee unambiguously assignment of chemical structures, therefore, additional tandem mass spectrometric methods such as ion-molecule reactions were developed. In this dissertation, both CAD and ion-molecule reactions were used to elucidate the structure of deprotonated analytes. Currently, most existing neutral regents are designed to react with protonated analytes, making them suboptimal for the acidic analytes that are more sensitive when detected under negative ion mode. The identification of analyte ions containing phenoxide, carboxylate, and phosphate functionality was achieved by using a novel ion-molecule reaction setup that allowed two neutral reagents, <b>diethylmethoxyborane</b> (DEMB) and water, to be introduced into the ion trap. Using DEMB as the sole reagent, reactions between phenoxide, carboxylate, sulfate, and phosphate containing analytes and DEMB were studied. By pulsing in water, a new reagent, diethylhydroxyborane (DEHB), was generated inside the ion trap, allowing the reactions between phenoxide, carboxylate, sulfate, and phosphate containing analytes and DEHB/H 2 O to be studied as well. Reaction mechanisms were explored via isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations. The above mass spectrometry method allowed the differentiation of phenoxide, carboxylate, phosphate, and sulfate containing analyte and was successfully coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography for the analyses of a biomass conversion product mixture and drug metabolite mixture. In addition, ion-molecule reactions with thionyl chloride were explored as a mean to differentiate deprotonated benzendiol isomers that were not discernable via CAD. Finally, HPLC-MSn with CAD were used to analyze complex mixtures related to lignin, including organosolv lignin and microbial converted biomass...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} plays a {{major role}} in the identification of mixture components. This has been made possible by tandem mass spectrometric techniques, such as collision-activated dissociation, H/D exchange reactions and others. Though these techniques provide useful structural information, they rarely allow the unambiguous identification of unknown compounds. However, this may be achieved by ion-molecule reactions other than H/D exchange. Gas-phase ion-molecule reactions provide a powerful technique for obtaining molecular weight, structural, and chemical reactivity information for various species, such as small organic molecules, biomolecules, and polymers. The first five chapters in this thesis address the issue of identifying the functional groups present in protonated organic molecules. Boron reagents have been identified as the neutral reagent of choice for these studies due to their unique chemical properties. The first study involves the identification of functional groups present in protonated bifunctional oxygen-containing compounds by allowing them to react with trimethylborate (TMB). This approach also allows the counting of OH-groups in polyols. The method is shown to be specific for bifunctional oxygen-containing analytes based on the examination of reactions of nitrogen containing compounds and other analytes with TMB. However, this method cannot always differentiate hydroxyketones from hydroxyethers. The second study addresses this problem by solution derivatization of the analytes prior to mass spectrometric analysis. The third study extends the applicability of TMB for the differentiation of protonated regioisomers in the gas-phase. The fourth study involves the identification of functional groups present in negatively charged analytes. Examination of reactions of three different boron reagents, TMB, <b>diethylmethoxyborane</b> (DEMB) and triisopropylborate (TIPB), with deprotonated analytes, such as carboxylates, deprotonated carboxylate esters and alkoxides, suggests that TIPB and TMB can be used to differentiate these functional groups. The final study in this thesis presents a novel method for the sequencing of small neutral peptides, evaporated by laser-induced acoustic desorption (LIAD), by chemical ionization with +P(OCH 3) 2 ions followed by CAD. This approach has the potential to provide useful sequence information for peptides. ...|$|E
