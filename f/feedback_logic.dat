40|$|The {{conceptual}} system developed in optimal control theory for technical purposes {{is used as}} a philosophical instrument applied to cyclic information processes, which are expected to be the basis of noosphere. Noosphere was perceived by the founding fathers of this concept, Vladimir Vernadsky, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, e. a. as an outgrowth of the evolutionary process, which begins with cosmogenesis and proceeds through geosphere and biosphere. We attempt to apply the optimal control concepts to all three levels — geospheric, biospheric, and noospheric — due to their having a common structure of information processes (or entropic processes considered as proto-information). These processes include homeostasis, accumulation and expenditure of information, formation of hierarchical information structures, evolution involving the breaks of homeostasis etc. In noosphere, controlled system may have the same informational capabilities as controlling system, so that the term “dialog” is more adequate; in this case, we extend optimal control description to game theory. The cyclic, <b>feedback</b> <b>logic</b> of optimal control seems better adapted to noospheric processes than usual cause-eff ect logic. The fi rst part of the paper considers the geospheric and biospheric level. We introduce the basic notions characterizing optimal control cycle: duality of observation and control, hierarchy of models, active sounding, balance of information infl ow and outfl ow, optimized criterion, networked (distributed) control, etc. Then, natural homeostases at the geospheric level are considered as a form of self-regulation having specifi c optimized criteria. The constitutive feature of this level is the absence of information processing in the strict sense: its place is taken by entropic processes. Therefore, no goal can exist at this level, and we consider it as a part of cosmogenesis, which is allegedly goalless/meaningless. We discuss the anthropic principle as a means to overcome this limitation and its possible impact on understanding of geosphere. Next, we consider the biospheric level as one with genetic information accumulation but without refl ection. Interaction between genetic and phenetic structures is described in optimal control terms. Phylogenesis is described as restructuring of genetic “models”, and the problem of origin of life is considered as a specifi c case of information paradox called “loan from the future”.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Ultra-high-speed (> 10 GS/s), medium-resolution (5 6 bit), {{low-power}} (< 50 mW) {{analog-to-digital converter}} {{can find it}} application {{in the areas of}} digital oscilloscopes and next-generation serial link receivers. There are several challenges to enable a successful design, however. First, the time-interleaved architecture is required in order to achieve over 10 GS/s sampling rate, with the trade-off of the number of the channels and the sampling rate in each channel. Phase misalignment and channel mismatch must be considered too. Second, timing accuracy, especially dynamic jitter of sampling clock becomes a major concern at ultra-high frequency, and certain techniques must be taken to address it. Finally, to achieve low power consumption, Flash architecture is not suitable to serve as the sub-ADC, and a low-power sub-ADC that can work at relatively high speed need to be designed. A single channel, asynchronous successive approximation (SA) ADC with improved feedback delay has been fabricated in 40 nm CMOS. Compared with a conventional SA structure that employs a single quantizer controlled by a digital <b>feedback</b> <b>logic</b> loop, the proposed SA-ADC employs multiple quantizers for each conversion bit, clocked by an asynchronous ripple clock that is generated after each quantization. Hence, the sampling rate of the 6 -bit ADC is limited only by the six delays of the Capacitive-DAC settling and each comparator’s quantization delay, as the digital logic delay is eliminated. Measurement results of the 40 nm-CMOS SA-ADC achieves peak SNDR of 32. 9 dB at 1 GS/s and 30. 5 dB at 1. 25 GS/s, consuming 5. 28 mW and 6. 08 mW respectively, leading to FoM of 148 fJ/conversion-step and 178 fJ/conversion-step, in a core area less than 170 µm by 85 µm. Based on the previous work of sub-ADC, a 12 -GS/s 5 -b 50 -mW ADC is designed in 40 nm CMOS with 8 time-interleaved channels of Flash-SA hybrid structure each running at 1. 5 GS/s. A modified bootstrapped switch is used in the track-and-hold circuit, introducing a global clock signal to synchronize the sampling instants of each individual channel, therefore improve the phase alignment and reduce distortion. The global clock is provided by a CML buffer which is injected by off-chip low-noise sine-wave signal, so that the RMS dynamic jitter is low for better ENOB performance. Measurement results show that the 12 GS/s ADC can achieve a SNDR of 25. 8 dB with the input signal frequency around DC and 22. 8 dB around 2 GHz, consuming 32. 1 mW, leading to FoM of 237. 3 fJ/conversion-step, in a core area less than 800 µm by 500 µm...|$|E
