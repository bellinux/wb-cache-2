These are some limited standard physical wedges (15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °),or creating an arbitrary wedge angle, like motorized wedge or dynamic wedge, [...] . The new formulation is presented by the combination of wedge fields for determining an arbitrary effective wedge angles. The isodose curves also are derived for these wedges. Materials and Methods: we performed the dosimetry of Varian Clinac 2100 C/D with Scanditronix Wellhofer water blue phantom, CU 500 E, OmniPro-Accept software and 0. 13 cc ionization chamber for 6 Mv photon beam in depth of 10 cm (reference depth) for universal physical wedges (15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 °) and reference field 10. 10 cm 2. By combining the <b>isodose</b> <b>curve</b> standard wedge fields with compatible weighting dose for each field, the effective <b>isodose</b> <b>curve</b> is calculated for any wedge angle.

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays,  considerable {{developments}}  in  the field  of  radiotherapy have  been  achieved.   They  include  the  advances  made  in  the  equipments  and  treatment  planning  techniques  which  require  {{highly complex}} calculations. Such achievements {{have made it}} possible to treat cancer patients not only  with  higher  radiation  dose  but  also  with  higher  precision  and  consequently  increasing  the  chance  of  curing the cancer. However, the conventional techniques requiring physical wedge are still being used  but with a lesser frequency. One of the wedge parameters needed to be measured is the wedge angle. It is  the angle that the horizontal line creates with the tilted <b>isodose</b> <b>curve</b> at a specific depth and for a certain  field size.   In this study, the variation of wedge angle for different field sizes was evaluated using dosimetric and  mathematical method.   Material and Methods: For the wedge fields with a dimension of 6 × 6 to 20 × 20 cm 2, the wedge angle  for  two  photon  energies  of   6  and   18  MV  was  measured  by  the  dosimetric  method.  For  these  measurements, the conventional wedges having the nominal wedge angle of 15, 30, 45 & 60 were used.   The theoretical method suggested by Saw et al. is also used to indirectly calculate the slope of isodose  curve  by  the  dose  profile  and  percent  depth  dose  data.  The  dose  profile,  percentage  depth  dose  and  isodose curves were drawn for all the field sizes and the tilt of <b>isodose</b> <b>curve</b> at 10 cm depth, according to  international definition, is considered as the wedge angle. The data were obtained using the theoretical  equation of wedge angle and it was compared to the dosimetric data.   Results: The result obtained in this work shows that the wedge angle increases with the field size. For a  6 × 6 cm 2 field size, the calculated wedge angle has the highest difference in comparison to the nominal  wedge angle. The difference is equal to 14. 7 degree for a 45 ° wedge and a 6 MV photon. The highest  difference for a 45 ° wedge angle, a field size of 10 × 10 cm 2 and a 6 MV photon is 9. 2 degree. Comparing  the calculated and measured wedge angles shows a maximum difference of 4 degree for 6 and 18 MV  photon beams.   Discussion  and  Conclusion:  The  wedge  angle  varies  with  field  size.  In  order  to  get  a  better  dose  distribution in the conventional radiotherapy, it is necessary to use the appropriate wedge angle which  generates the desired slope for the isodose line and for the specific field size...|$|E

This study aims at examining the variation in rectal and bladder doses when {{the same set of}} orthogonal films was given to different observers. Five physicists were given 35 pairs of orthogonal films obtained from patients who had undergone HDR brachytherapy. They were given the same instructions and asked to plan the case assuming the tumor was centrally placed, using the treatment-planning system, PLATO BPS V 13. 2. A statistically significant difference was observed in the average rectal (F = 3. 407, P = 0. 01) and bladder (F = 3. 284, P = 0. 013) doses and the volumes enclosed by the 100 % <b>isodose</b> <b>curve</b> (P < 0. 01) obtained by each observer. These variations may be attributed to the differences in the reconstruction of applicators, the selection of source positions in ovoids and the intrauterine (IU) tube, and the differences in the selection of points especially for the rectum, from lateral radiographs. These variations in planning seen within a department can be avoided if a particular source pattern is followed in the intrauterine tube, unless a specific situation demands a change.

A new clinical dose calculation algorithm, Monte Carlo, will allow accurate calculation of the radiation transport both within and beyond hip prostheses. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate, for both phantom and patient geometries, the capability of various dose calculation algorithms to yield accurate treatment plans. Dose distributions in phantom and patient geometries with high atomic number prostheses were calculated using Monte Carlo, superposition, pencil beam, and no-heterogeneity correction algorithms. The phantom dose distributions were analyzed by depth dose and dose profile curves. The patient dose distributions were analyzed by <b>isodose</b> <b>curves,</b> dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and tumor control probability/normal tissue complication probability (TCP/NTCP) calculations. Monte Carlo calculations pre-dicted the dose enhancement and reduction at the proximal and distal prosthesis interfaces respectively, whereas superposition and pencil beam calculations did not. However, further from the prosthesis, the differences between the dose calculation algorithms diminished. Treatment plans calculated with superposition showed similar <b>isodose</b> <b>curves,</b> DVHs, and TCP/NTCP as the Monte Carlo plans, except in the bladder, where Monte Carlo predicted a slightly lower dose.

This method is time consuming. AimAs an alternative method, a matrix shift based technique was applied to simulate a stepping source for brachytherapy. Materials and methodsThe stepping source of GZP 6 brachytherapy unit was simulated. In a matrix shift method, it is assumed that a radiation source is stationary and instead the data matrix is shifted {{based on the number of}} steps. In this study, by running MCNPX program for one point and calculation of the dose matrix using the matrix shift method, the <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> for the esophageal cancer tumor lengths of 4 and 6 cm were obtained and compared with the <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> obtained by running MCNPX programs in each step position separately (15 and 23 steps for esophageal cancer tumor lengths of 4 and 6 cm, respectively).

The Monte Carlo technique was employed to calculate the dose distribution along the x-, y- and z-axes when a single shot with opening of all 201 sources was delivered at the centre of a simulated water phantom with a diameter of 160 mm. Collimator helmets with dierent size of the Gamma Knife unit were verified. Good consistency (typical discrepancy less than 2 %) was obtained between the results of Monte Carlo and GammaPlan. Small discrepancies, however, were obtained by GafChromic films. Discrepancies, as great as 10 % when using the 4 mm collimator helmet, at the low percentage <b>isodose</b> <b>curve</b> along the z-axis of the measurement results were {{probably due to the}} small energy dependency of the GafChromic films. Significant discrepancies were not observed along x- and y-axes because such small discrepancies were easily over-washed by other gamma beams coming from the x- and y-directions. Similar results showing the discrepancies between the GafChromic films and GammaPlan were obtained when using the 8, 14 and 18 mm collimator helmets. However, the discrepancies along the z-axis became smaller as scattering eect increased when using larger collimator sizes.

An important contribution to this process has been a proper dosimetry method to guarantee the accuracy of delivered dose to the tumor. In brachytherapy (BT) of gynecological (Gyn) cancer it is usual to insert a combination of tandem and ovoid applicators with a complicated geometry which makes their dosimetry verification difficult and important. Therefore, evaluation and verification of dose distribution is necessary for accurate dose delivery to the patients. Materials and Methods The solid phantom was made from Perspex slabs as a tool for intracavitary brachytherapy dosimetric QA. Film dosimetry (EDR 2) was done for a combination of ovoid and tandem applicators introduced by Flexitron brachytherapy system. Treatment planning was also done with Flexiplan 3 D-TPS to irradiate films sandwiched between phantom slabs. <b>Isodose</b> <b>curves</b> obtained from treatment planning system and the films were compared with each other in 2 D and 3 D manners. Results The brachytherapy solid phantom was constructed with slabs. It was possible to insert tandems and ovoids loaded with radioactive source of Ir- 192 subsequently. Relative error was 3 - 8. 6 % and average relative error was 5. 08 % in comparison with the films and TPS <b>isodose</b> <b>curves.</b> Conclusion Our results showed that the difference between TPS and the measurements is well within the acceptable boundaries and below the action level according to AAPM TG. 45.

The dose values resulting from the polymer gel measurements at the reference points were compared with those from the common calculation method at the same points. In addition, the <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> resulting from gel dosimetry were compared with those from a brachytherapy treatment planning system (Flexiplan). Results: The average of the dose values measured with the gel at the reference points was 62. 75 % higher than those calculated at the same points. Investigating the <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> revealed that the maximum distance to agreement (DTAmax) between the isodoses resulting from the gel and those obtained from the treatment planning system was less than 3 mm at different dose levels. Discussion and Conclusion: Although the MAGICA gel indicates a higher absolute dose value than those calculated commonly, it can give the relative dose values accurately. Therefore, it can be recommended to be used for the assessment of dose distributions for the treatment of tissues as well as quality control of the treatment planning systems...|$|R

A method using electronic tissue compensator (ETC) has been implemented in Eclipse 3 -D TPS (V 7. 3, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) at our center. The ETC was tested for head and neck conformal radiotherapy planning. The {{purpose of this study}} was to verify the feasibility of DMLC and SMLC in head and neck field irradiation for delivering homogeneous dose in the midplane at a pre-defined depth. In addition, emphasis was given to the dosimetric aspects in commissioning ETC in Eclipse. A Head and Neck Phantom (The Phantom Laboratory, USA) was used for the dosimetric verification. Planning was carried out for both DMLC and SMLC ETC plans. The dose calculated at central axis by eclipse with DMLC and SMLC was noted. This was compared with the doses measured on machine with ion chamber and thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). The calculated <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> and profiles were compared with the measured ones. The dose profiles along the two major axes from Eclipse were also compared with the profiles obtained from Amorphous Silicon (AS 500) Electronic portal imaging device (EPID) on Clinac 6 EX machine. In uniform dose regions, measured dose values agreed with the calculated doses within 3 %. Agreement between calculated and measured isodoses in the dose gradient zone was within 3 mm. The <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> and the profiles were found to be in good agreement with the measured curves and profiles. The measured and the calculated dose profiles along the two major axes were flat for both DMLC and SMLC. The dosimetric verification of ETC for both the linacs demonstrated the feasibility and the accuracy of the ETC treatment modality for achieving uniform dose distributions. Therefore, ETC can be used as a tool in head and neck treatment planning optimization for improved dose uniformity...|$|R

The plaques consist of a thin film of 106 Ru, a beta emitter, encapsulated in pure silver. The present work proposes a new mathematical eye model for ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry. This new model includes detailed description of internal structures, allowing dose determination in different regions of the eye for a more adequate clinical analysis. In the present work, we have used MCNP 4 C code to calculate relative dose in a new human eye model. The <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> and dosimetric characteristics for two 106 Ru eye applicators have been determined.

This method has been satisfactorily applied for predicting OAR in case of 60 Co &# 947; -rays and high energy X-rays.

40|$|Purpose: This work {{investigated}} {{the accuracy of}} prowess treatment planning system (TPS) in dose calculation in a homogenous phantom for symmetric and asymmetric field sizes using collapse cone convolution / superposition algorithm (CCCS). Methods: The measurements were carried out at source-to-surface distance (SSD) set to 100 cm for 6 and 10 MV photon beams. Data for {{a full set of}} measurements for symmetric fields and asymmetric fields, including inplane and crossplane profiles at various depths and percentage depth doses (PDDs) were obtained during measurements on the linear accelerator. Results: The results showed that the asymmetric collimation dose lead to significant errors (up to approximately 7 %) in dose calculations if changes in primary beam intensity and beam quality. It is obvious that the most difference in the <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> was found in buildup and the penumbra regions.

40|$|Physical wedges {{still can}} be used as missing tissue compensators or filters to alter the shape of <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> in a target volume to reach an optimal {{radiotherapy}} plan without creating a hotspot. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the dosimetric properties of physical wedges filters such as off-axis photon fluence, photon spectrum, output factor and half value layer. The photon beam quality of a 6 MV Primus Siemens modified by 150 and 450 physical wedges was studied with BEAMnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code. The calculated present depth dose and dose profile curves for open and wedged photon beam were in good agreement with the measurements. Increase of wedge angle increased the beam hardening and this effect was more pronounced at the heal region. Using such an accurate MC model to determine of wedge factors and implementation of it as a calculation algorithm in the future treatment planning systems is recommended...|$|R

40|$|In {{conformal}} moving beam {{therapy with}} fast neutrons, the contributions to dose from the direct beam, scattered radiation and the gamma component {{vary with the}} position in the phantom. To determine this variation in radiation quality, microdosimetric measurements of energy deposition spectra were performed at different positions in a therapy phantom. Fixed beam irradiation at different incidence angles showed strong changes in the lineal energy spectrum. An increase of slow protons (20 < y < 110 keV. mum(- 1)) and a decrease of fact protons (2 < y < 20 keV. mum(- 1)) was seen for irradiation outside the direct beam. During moving beam irradiation, different positions on the same <b>isodose</b> <b>curves</b> (55 % or 35 %) showed differences in (y) over bar (D) of up to 5 %. Variations in the quality parameter. R, determined by applying an empirical biological weighting function, were of similar magnitude.

40|$|The goal of IMRT is {{to achieve}} an isodose {{distribution}} conformed to the tumor while avoiding the organs at risk. For these tasks several gantry angles are selected, each one containing a series of different leaf configurations for the multileaf collimator ~MLC! ~segments!. Verifying the relative distributions {{as well as the}} absolute doses is an important step for quality assurance issues. We have observed that an accurate modeling of the transmission of the primary x-ray fluence through the jaws and MLC as well as the head scatter is crucial for a precise calculation of relative doses and monitor units. Also, an inaccurate calculation of the output factor for small size segments can lead to important differences in the absolute dose for points under these segments. Incorrect models could lead to systematic errors of around 5 % to 10 % in the calculated monitor units and a shift in the <b>isodose</b> <b>curves.</b> © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{computational}} {{system was}} developed for this paper in the C++ programming language, to create a 125 I radioactive seed entry file, based on the positioning of a virtual grid (template) in voxel geometries, {{with the purpose of}} performing prostate cancer treatment simulations using the MCNPX code. Methods: The system is fed with information from the planning system with regard to each seed’s location and its depth, and an entry file is automatically created with all the cards (instructions) for each seed regarding their cell blocks and surfaces spread out spatially in the 3 D environment. The system provides with precision a reproduction of the clinical scenario for the MCNPX code’s simulation environment, thereby allowing the technique’s in-depth study. Results and Conclusion: The preliminary results from this study showed that the lateral penumbra of uniform scanning proton beams was less sensitive In order to validate the computational system, an entry file was created with 88 125 I seeds that were inserted in the phantom’s MAX 06 prostate region with initial activity determined for the seeds at the 0. 27 mCi value. <b>Isodose</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained in all the prostate slices in 5 mm steps in the 7 to 10 cm interval, totaling 7 slices. Variance reduction techniques were applied in order to optimize computational time and the reduction of uncertainties such as photon and electron energy interruptions in 4 keV and forced collisions regarding cells of interest. Through the acquisition of <b>isodose</b> <b>curves,</b> the results obtained show that hot spots have values above 300 Gy, as anticipated in literature, stressing the importance of the sources’ correct positioning, in which the computational system developed provides, in order not to release excessive doses in adjacent risk organs.
