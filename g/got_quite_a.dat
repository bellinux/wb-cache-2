[...] "He {{was an unusual}} person. He was not like the other graduate students. He was much more focused about his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth," [...] said professor Peter Duren. [...] "It {{is not enough to}} say he was smart," [...] said George Piranian, another of his Michigan math professors. During his time at Michigan, Kaczynski earned 5 B's and 12 A's in his 18 courses. However in 2006, he said his [...] "memories of the University of Michigan are NOT pleasant... the fact that I not only passed my courses (except one physics course) but <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few A's, shows how wretchedly low the standards were at Michigan." ...|$|E
500|$|LeMond {{broke his}} {{collarbone}} on April 11, 1982, while racing the cycling classic Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The injury forced LeMond {{to ride a}} reduced schedule before entering the World Championships, which were in Goodwood, England that year. In the men's road race competition LeMond broke for the line but was out-sprinted by Italian Giuseppe Saronni. Following the race LeMond's American teammate Jacques Boyer accused LeMond of chasing him down in the final 800 meters. Saronni was very strong {{at the end of}} the race and flew past Boyer and LeMond, winning by 5 seconds over LeMond, with another 5 seconds back to Kelly. Boyer placed tenth. Bronze medalist Sean Kelly, a favorite to win the race, was with Saronni when he caught LeMond with about 200 meters to go, but he could not hold his wheel. Said Kelly: [...] "I don't think that Boyer was fading...He <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> good gap. Nobody wanted to go after him...Yes, LeMond chased down Boyer. Boyer was the only man up the road." ...|$|E
500|$|Edler {{was largely}} unknown during his NHL Draft year, unranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau the entire season. He {{was brought to}} the {{attention}} of the Vancouver Canucks by the team's head scout in Sweden, Thomas Gradin, who saw Edler playing with Jämtlands HF. Although Gradin would refer to the team's level of play as little more than beer-league-calibre, he was impressed with Edler and encouraged Canucks management to draft him (Edler's number 23 with the Canucks would later be chosen by team trainers in honour of Gradin). The Canucks traded up in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft to acquire the Dallas Stars' third-round draft pick in exchange for their own third-round pick in the 2005 Draft, and used the pick to select Edler 91st overall. The deal was made with the Stars in lieu of speculation that the Detroit Red Wings had a high interest in Edler and wanted to draft him in the third round as well. Detroit had discovered Edler in Sweden through their European scout Håkan Andersson, who was responsible for such previous Red Wings late-round picks as Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk. At the time of his draft, Canucks General Manager Dave Nonis described Edler as a [...] "smooth skater [...] big guy." [...] Nonis added that, [...] "He needs some time , but in terms of raw skill, he's <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit of it." ...|$|E

In volume 6 of the manga, Tanemura states, [...] "Actually, I'm not even a quarter of the way into the whole series yet. I often get questions asking me how long the series will run for.

2500|$|MacGowan {{had decided}} to name the song after J. P. Donleavy's 1973 novel A Fairy Tale of New York, which Finer was reading {{at the time and}} had left lying around the {{recording}} studio. In the same Melody Maker interview MacGowan expressed regret that the song had not been completed in time to be released for Christmas that year, and hinted that the track would appear on an EP that The Pogues were due to record shortly. In January 1986 the group recorded the song during the sessions with Costello that would produce the Poguetry in Motion EP, with bass player Cait O'Riordan singing the female part. Costello suggested naming the song [...] "Christmas Eve in the Drunk Tank", after the song's opening lines: the band were scornful of the suggestion, with MacGowan pointing out to Costello that a song with such a title was unlikely to be favourably received and played by radio stations. The majority of the lyrics had been written while MacGowan was recovering in a bed in Malmö after being struck down with double pneumonia during a Pogues tour of Scandinavia in late 1985 – he later said, [...] "you get a lot of delirium and stuff, so I <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few good images out of that". However, despite several attempts at recording it, the group were unhappy with the results and the song was temporarily put aside, to be returned to at a later date. Guitarist Philip Chevron later said, [...] "It was not quite there. It needed to have a full-on, confident performance from the band, which it lacked." [...] The producer of the final version, Steve Lillywhite, diplomatically described the version recorded with O'Riordan's vocals as not [...] "fully realised". Extracts from these earlier versions can be heard on the 2008 box set Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say... POGUEMAHONE!!.|$|E
2500|$|Material for a {{follow-up}} to Pretty. Odd. dates back to at least April 2008, just {{one month after the}} release of the record. Former guitarist and primary songwriter Ryan Ross told NME the band had [...] "nine or ten new songs going right now," [...] which picked up in the same direction of Pretty. Odd. [...] "It was pretty much the same with the last record," [...] bassist Jon Walker said. [...] "We haven't stopped writing songs since we stopped recording Pretty. Odd., because {{we have a lot to}} write about [...] It's sounding 'pretty awesome,' which is probably what we're going to call the next record," [...] Ross joked. [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few new ideas and songs we've been working on, and we're hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year." [...] The article explained that Walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music. In June 2009, singer Brendon Urie revealed the band had been writing for [...] "roughly half a year now" [...] at Ross' Topanga Canyon, California home, and continued to take the band [...] "further down the sun-dappled, retro-pop path [...] began exploring on Pretty. Odd.": [...] "We've always been a pop band. We've always been fans of pop music, whether it's The Beatles – which is, like, the beginning of pop music – we've always been fans of good catchy melodies and lighthearted music." [...] Spencer Smith, drummer, added, [...] "We moved to California since the last record, so that's inspiration. We started surfing, too, so maybe we'll get a little Beach Boys vibe on this one." [...] During this time, Smith moved in with Urie, while Ross began writing his own material with Walker at his home.|$|E

50|$|The {{size of the}} Earth was an {{important}} question to the Ancient Greeks. Eratosthenes attempted to calculate its circumference by measuring {{the angle of the}} sun at two different locations. While his numbers were problematic, most of the errors cancelled themselves out and he <b>got</b> <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> accurate figure. Since the distance from the Atlantic to India was roughly known, this raised the important question of what was in the vast region east of Asia and to the west of Europe. Crates of Mallus proposed that there were in fact four inhabitable land masses, two in each hemisphere. In Rome a large globe was created depicting this world. That some of the figures Eratosthenes had used in his calculation were considerably in error became known, and Posidonius set out to get a more accurate measurement. This number actually was considerably smaller than the real one, but it became accepted that the eastern part of Asia was not a huge distance from Europe.|$|R
