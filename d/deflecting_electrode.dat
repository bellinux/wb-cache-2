Utilising the wide-spread technique of continuous ion extraction, {{in conjunction with a}} <b>deflecting</b> <b>electrode</b> (ion gate) for the selection of ions, the experimental method is carefully evaluated in light of the observation of interfering, artefact signals which have been established as resulting from delayed ionization of fullerenes.

40|$|A new {{ionization}} gauge for {{measurement of}} total gas pressures between 10 /sup - 12 / torr and 10 /sup - 14 / torr is described. The gauge's main features are {{a pair of}} collimating slots below the grid structure, two concentric hemi-spherical <b>deflecting</b> <b>electrodes</b> and a channel electron multiplier which detects low-energy ions passing through the deflector system. The detection of low-energy ions allows discrimination against desorbed ions (which are more energetic), while spurious signals due to X-rays may also be rejected. The channel electron multiplier leads to gauge sensitivities which are much {{higher than those of}} ordinary ionization gauges. The gauge has been tested down to 4 * 10 /sup - 13 / torr and found to have sensitivities of 1. 5 * 10 /sup 17 / and 8 * 10 /sup 16 / counts/s. A. torr for N/sub 2 / and H/sub 2 / respectively. For a channel electron multiplier gain of 10 /sup 7 / the gauge sensitivity is thus approximately= 10 /sup 5 //torr. (17 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{separation of}} heavy minerals in beach sands of Galicia using several newly developed devices is described. Preconcentration {{is achieved by}} {{a new type of}} centrifugal hydroclassifier with adjustable slope of the various revolutions of a flexible spiral, and remarkably well by an ”autopulsating hydroclassifier”, which treats up to 3 tons of ill-sorted material per hour with a recuperation of up to 90 % in an apparatus weighing 40 kg and driven by a current of (sea) water with a pressure of 1 atm. Electrostatic separation into conductive and isolating minerals was made more selective by using a high-tension generator equipped with an oscillator of variable frequency and by installing a generator of radiation with controlled wave-length between inducing and <b>deflecting</b> <b>electrodes</b> in the electrostatic separator. In this way it is possible, e. g., to separate zircon from quartz. Magnetic separation was improved by the development of a ”magnetic vibroclassifier” in which the grains are transported on a vibrating metallic plate through a magnetic field generated between a stationnary electromagnet and a rotating disc. Two flow sheets are given, the first for the treatment of material rich in magnetite and the second for the concentration of zircon...|$|R
40|$|The Spiral 2 driver uses a slow chopper {{situated}} in the common section of the low energy beam transport line to change the beam intensity, {{to cut off the}} beam in case of critical loss and to avoid hitting the wheel structure of rotating targets. The device has to work up to 10 kV, 1 kHz repetition frequency rate and its design is based on standard power circuits, standard vacuum feed-through and custom alarm board. The paper summarizes the design principles and describes the test results of the final device, which has been installed on the beam line test bench. THE CHOPPER IN THE LEBT LINE The low energy beam transport (LEBT) line carries continuous wave (CW), high intensity beams of protons (5 mA), deuterons (5 mA) and ions (1 mA) with m/q= 3 from the sources to the radiofrequency quadruple. The source voltage for the three different particles are 20, 40 and 60 kV respectively, to match the RFQ input energy of 20 keV/A. The layout of the injector LEBT is shown in Fig. 1. The slow chopper [1] is placed just before the beam stop in the common section of the line. Figure 1 : The injector low energy lines and the slow chopper position. The proton/deuteron line section and the common one are presently installed at CEA Saclay to be tested before being installed in the SPIRAL 2 building. The slow chopper system was moved to Saclay in June 2011 and is going to be tested with the beam in the next few months. The device assembled on the line is shown in Fig. 2. The yellow arrow, in frame A, shows the beam direction. The beam stop and the micro channel plate are shown in frame B and the <b>deflecting</b> <b>electrodes</b> in frame C. REQUIREMENTS AND DESCRIPTION The chopper will be used to progressively increase the beam power during accelerator tuning, to avoid hitting th...|$|R
