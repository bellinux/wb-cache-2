40|$|The free-piston Stirling <b>power</b> <b>convertor</b> is a {{promising}} technology for high efficiency heat-to-electricity power conversion in space. Stirling <b>power</b> <b>convertors</b> typically utilize linear alternators for converting mechanical motion into electricity. The linear alternator {{is one of}} the heaviest components of modern Stirling <b>power</b> <b>convertors.</b> In addition, state-of-art Stirling linear alternators usually require the use of tuning capacitors or active power factor correction controllers to maximize <b>convertor</b> output <b>power.</b> The linear alternator to be discussed in this paper, eliminates the need for tuning capacitors and delivers electrical power output in which current is inherently in phase with voltage. No power factor correction is needed. In addition, the linear alternator concept requires very little iron, so core loss has been virtually eliminated. This concept is a unique moving coil design where the magnetic flux path is defined by the magnets themselves. This paper presents computational predictions for two different low inductance alternator configurations, and compares the predictions with experimental data for one of the configurations that has been built and is currently being tested...|$|R

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{need for}} smart and wearable electronic systems are driving new electronics technology paradigms in miniaturization, functionality and cost. The operating voltages and power levels for devices in these systems {{are becoming increasingly}} varied with increased diversity of devices to serve these heterogeneous functions. <b>Power</b> <b>convertor</b> technologies are incorporated into various parts of these systems to step-up or step-down battery voltages and currents to address these diverse needs. Hence, multiple power converters, each requiring several passive components, are used to create stable power-supplies. This is placing significant challenges in ultra-miniaturized and ultra-efficient power management technologies. A typical <b>power</b> <b>convertor</b> consists of magnetic components such as inductors perform the basic energy storage and delivery functions from the source to the load. These power components are still at microscale in lithography and milliscale in component size. They occupy a large volume fraction of the <b>power</b> circuitry. <b>Power</b> <b>convertors</b> therefore, are a major bottleneck to system miniaturization. There is, thus, a need for ultra-miniaturized and high-performance power inductors for scaling down such <b>power</b> <b>convertors.</b> The critical parameters governing the size and performance of power inductors are its inductance density and power handling capability. These parameters are limited by the magnetic properties of the present inductor core materials. A new approach to inductor cores that achieves the best magnetic properties and yet allows integration of power inductors into ultra-thin substrates to meet the emerging needs for performance and size is therefore required. The objective {{of this research is}} to model, design and synthesize a novel multilayered ferromagnetic-polymer composite structure for inductor cores with high permeability and saturation magnetization. The multilayered composite structure consists of thin magnetic layers interspersed with ultra-thin polymers. A fabrication approach to integrate the composite structure in inductor devices is also demonstrated. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|A free-piston Stirling <b>power</b> <b>convertor</b> {{is being}} {{considered}} as an advanced power-conversion technology for future NASA deep-space missions requiring long-life radioisotope power systems. The NASA Glenn Research Center has identified key areas where advanced technologies {{can enhance the}} capability of Stirling energy-conversion systems.

Current power-conversion technology for Glenn-tested Stirling systems consists of an engine-driven linear alternator generating an alternating-current voltage controlled by a tuning-capacitor-based alternating-current peak voltage load controller. The tuning capacitor keeps the internal alternator electromotive force (EMF) in phase with its respective current (i. e., passive power factor correction). The alternator EMF {{is related to the}} piston velocity, which must be kept in phase with the alternator current in order to achieve stable operation.
