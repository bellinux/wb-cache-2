Especially in the case of social preferences, public choice theory has failed to produce the set of alternatives from which collective choices are made.   The book presents empirical findings achieved by the authors in their efforts to predict the outcome of government formation processes in European parliamentary and semi-presidential systems.   Using data from the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), the authors propose a new approach that reinterprets error in the coding of CMP data as ambiguity in the actual political positions of parties on the policy dimensions being coded. The range of this error establishes parties’ fuzzy preferences. The set of possible outcomes in the process of government formation is then calculated on the basis of both the fuzzy Pareto set and the fuzzy maximal set, and the predictions are compared with those made by two conventional approaches {{as well as with the}} government that was actually formed. The comparison shows that, in most cases, the fuzzy approaches outperform their conventional counterparts. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo nonstandard {{modes of}} inference, {{confirmation}} and denial, {{have been shown}} by Bandler and Kohout to be valid in fuzzy propositional and predicate logics. If denial is used in combination with modus ponens, the resulting inference mode (“augmented modus ponens”) yields more precise bounds on the consequent of an implication than are usually called for in approximate reasoning. Similar results hold for augmented modus tollens constructed from confirmation and conventional fuzzy modus tollens. Two simpler modes of inference, presumption and prejudice, are also valid under the same assumptions as confirmation and denial. Prejudice imposes an upper bound on the truth value of the consequent of a fuzzy implication regardless of the truth value of the antecedent; presumption imposes a lower bound on the truth value of the antecedent regardless of that of the consequent. Some {{of the consequences of}} presumption and prejudice cast doubt on the suitability of fuzzy propositional and predicate logics for use in expert systems that are designed to process real-world data. A logic based directly on fuzzy sets is explored as an alternative. <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> <b>logic</b> supports fuzzy modus ponens and modus tollens but does not entail the more problematic modes of confirmation, denial, presumption, and prejudice.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a consistent theory for structuring and representing how concepts combine and interact {{is one of the}} main challenges for the scholars involved in cognitive studies. All traditional approaches are still facing serious hindrances when dealing with combinations of concepts and concept vagueness. One of the main consequences of these difficulties is the existence of borderline cases which is hardly explainable from the point of view of classical (<b>fuzzy</b> <b>set)</b> <b>logic</b> and probability theory. Resting on a quantum-theoretic approach which successfully models conjunctions and disjuncions of two concepts, we propound a quantum probability model in Fock space which accords with the experimental data collected by Alxatib and Pelletier (2011) on borderline contradictions. Our model allows one to explain the occurrence of the latter contradictions in terms of genuine quantum effects, such as contextuality, superposition, interference and emergence. In particular, we claim that it is the specific mechanism of `emergence of a new concept' that is responsible of these deviations from classical logical thinking in the cognitive studies on human thought. This result seems to be compatible with a recent interesting application of quantum probabilistic modeling in the study of borderline vagueness (Blutner, Pothos & Bruza, 2012), and analogies and differences with it are sketched here.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to correlate the nonlinear invariants’ {{with the changing}} conditions of a drilling process {{through a series of}} condition monitoring experiments on small diameter (1 mm) drill bits. Run-to-failure tests are performed on these drill bits, and vibration data are consecutively gathered at equal time intervals. Nonlinear invariants, such as the Kolmogorov entropy and correlation dimension, and statistical parameters are calculated based on the corresponding conditions of the drill bits. By intervariations of these values between two successive measurements, a drop–rise table is created. Any variation that is within a certain threshold (+- 20 % of the measurements in this case) is assumed to be constant. Any fluctuation above or below is assumed to be either a rise or a drop. The reduct and conflict tables then help eliminate incongruous and redundant data by the use of rough sets (RSs). Inconsistent data, which by definition is the boundary re-gion, are classified through certainty and coverage factors. By handling inconsistencies and redundancies, 11 rules are ex-tracted from 39 experiments, representing the underlying rules. Then 22 new experiments are used to check the validity of the rule space. The RS decision frame performs best at predicting no failure cases. It is believed that RSs are superior in dealing with real-life data over <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> <b>logic</b> in that actual measured data are never as consistent as here and may dominate the monitoring of the manufacturing processes as it becomes more widespread...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of fuzzy-sets into social science has potentially improved {{our ability to}} study diversity {{by means of the}} so-called partial memberships. As a consequence, social phenomena can be studied empirically as a matter of degree and not longer as fixed types. A fuzzy-set is a set with elements whose membership grades can have any real value between 0 and 1. In order to illustrate the capacities of the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> <b>logic</b> and also to make the discussion less abstract, it will be applied to the study of welfare state reforms. The 'grading capacity' of fuzzy-sets makes it possible to study welfare states as partial members of different welfare state regimes at the same time. This approach reveals the diversity of welfare reforms better than traditional ways which are often inclined to picture a case as representative of one particular type which is a too crude classification. Fuzzy-sets are designed to capture the diversity in a way that leaves more room to map individual cases without falling into the trap of idiosyncrasy. An equally important ability of fuzzy-sets is to analyse causal relationships in a small-n design. The fuzzy-set logic can be used to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for an outcome. This takes the form of expressions which reveal multiple-conjunctural causation patterns. In this paper the conditions for welfare cutbacks and the effects on socio-economic performance will be examined. © Springer 2005...|$|E

40|$|Semi-autonomous revenue {{authorities}} (ARAs) {{have been}} established {{all over the world}} as a distinctive institutional model outside the traditional public service aimed at enhancing tax administration, and thereby raising tax revenues. In order to boost the robustness of their operations, substantial expenditures have gone towards modernising ARAs. Expenditures have been guided by medium-term corporate-wide plans, and the results monitored, assessed and reported using performance measures. Performance measurement has proved challenging for ARAs to implement and sustain in practice. Some of the challenges evolve around weak capacity, implementation costs, issues to do with quantification, competing demands {{from a wide range of}} constituents, the inappropriate selection of measures and a bias towards performance measures that focus on finances. As a means for enhancing performance measurement, there are practices, lessons and theoretical perspectives that can be discerned from the broadspectrum of literature on performance measurement in the public sector and ARAs from around the world. This thesis explores how performance measurement in African ARAs can be more strategic, efficient and effective by ascertaining which key factors shape its adoption.

40|$|We perform two {{experiments}} {{with the aim}} to investigate the effects of negation on the combination of natural concepts. In the first experiment, we test the membership weights of a list of exemplars with respect to two concepts, e. g., Fruits and Vegetables, and their conjunction Fruits And Vegetables. In the second experiment, we test the membership weights of the same list of exemplars {{with respect to the}} same two concepts, but negating the second, e. g., Fruits and Not Vegetables, and again their conjunction Fruits And Not Vegetables. The collected data confirm existing results on conceptual combination, namely, they show dramatic deviations from the predictions of classical (<b>fuzzy</b> <b>set)</b> <b>logic</b> and probability theory. More precisely, they exhibit conceptual vagueness, gradeness of membership, overextension and double overextension of membership weights with respect to the given conjunctions. Then, we show that the quantum probability model in Fock space recently elaborated to model Hampton's data on concept conjunction (Hampton, 1988 a) and disjunction (Hampton, 1988 b) faithfully accords with the collected data. Our quantum-theoretic modeling enables to describe these non-classical effects in terms of genuine quantum effects, namely `contextuality', `superposition', `interference' and `emergence'. The obtained results confirm and strenghten the analysis in Aerts (2009 a) and Sozzo (2014) on the identification of quantum aspects in experiments on conceptual vagueness. Our results can be inserted within the general research on the identification of quantum structures in cognitive and decision processes.

The {{large amount of}} data from the systems and their environment is important informa-tion which objectively and truthfully reflects the nature of complex dynamic systems. Currently the advanced digital technology has made the digitized data easy to capture and cheap to store. However, raw digital data is rarely useful in practice and the capability to extract information from raw data is extremely important for description and understanding dynamic phenomenon of the data source. The description and control of complex dynamic systems without traditional mathematical mechanism models require new methods that can utilize the existing knowledge, human experience and data. In this paper, applying <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>Set</b> <b>logic</b> and Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), we propose an inno-vative data based description and control of complex dynamic systems, which is totally different from the tradition mechanism mathematical model based approaches. In the FCM framework, all necessary information for description {{and control of the}} systems is directly extracted from the raw data and human experiences.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to apply a {{mathematical}} method of formal concept analysis (FCA) to facilitate evaluation of potential partners, and to select the most appropriate partner for horizontal strategic alliances. Horizontal collaboration between ship design firms is important in relation to business cyclicality in the industry. The workload in ship design firms drops during the troughs of the shipbuilding cycle and increases dramatically during the peaks of the cycle. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed method of partnership selection applies FCA, which is based on mathematical lattice theory. FCA allows firms to evaluate and select the best suitable partners for horizontal interfirm cooperation from several possible candidate firms. Utilization of FCA allows a firm to visually analyze a potential partner for a horizontal strategic alliance. Findings – The contribution of this study to the literature is twofold. First, it contributes to the literature on the application of FCA in management field. Second, this study contributes to the partner selection literature. The contribution of the study is an alternative quantitative method for partner selection based on FCA. FCA compliments qualitative approaches in the process of alternatives evaluation and decision-making regarding partner selection for horizontal collaboration. Practical implications – Practitioners from ship design firms can use the FCA tool to facilitate decision-making relating to the screening of potential partners for horizontal cooperation with regard to pre-specified selected criteria. Originality/value – FCA has been marginally applied to aid managerial decision making. The FCA tool is valuable for practitioners from ship design firms to manage the selection of partners for horizontal collaboration.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{urban development}} is a subject of interest for regional policy makers and it needs appropriate assessment based on futile instruments for research, and for practical reasonsl (planning and decision making). Even if the sustainability’s attainment is a research topic field for academia and urban planners and managers and, as well, an ambitious goal for any resource administrator, {{yet there is no}} precise way of defining and measuring it. The sustainability of the urban development policy implies multiple and diversified aspects from rational exploitation of the local resources and well-structured workforce to environmental issues, endowment of modern urban facilities and infrastructure elements. As the urban sustainability is measured using a multitude of basic indicators, needing proper information to make long term management decision and planning, the subject is treated with fuzzy setsseen as an appropriate manner to deal with ambiguity, subjectivity and imprecision in the human reasoning when processing large volumes of data, eventually unstructured and complex. The paper proposed a modeling approach based on fuzzy sets inspired by the SAFE (Sustainability Assessment by Fuzzy Evaluation), a model which provides a mechanism for measuring development sustainability. The papers intends presenting a quantitative methodology in assessing the potential sustainability of urban development (in terms of adequacy) by pointing the failures in pursuing trends that are associated to a robust growth in the urban areas. The advantages of such approach are derived from taking into account the multi-criteria and uncertainty facets of the phenomenon; also, having in mind that the sustainability remains a non-straight-cut concept, being vaguely defined it implies a non-deterministic character by using the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> <b>logic.</b> The proposed model is designed to assess the divergence from desired trajectories, the weak point in reaching indicators’ target (as they are commonly regardedd as appropriate in what is understood as a good practices), it may then be addressed for policy makers in indicating some action measures in urban administration as they intendenly strive towards increasingly sustainable development on the long term. sustainability, urban management, indicators, fuzzy approach. ...|$|E
