40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} translational diffusion on the NMR linewidth and relaxation in lyotropic systems with finite aggregates has been studied. Here the molecular rotation {{induced by the}} translational motion of the molecule along a curved surface strongly modulates the intramolecular dipolar coupling. The corresponding autocorrelation functions are evaluated for rigid spherical, cylindrical and discotic micelles. The dependence of the NMR linewidth and relaxation rates T- 11 and T- 1 1 ρ on the micellar shape and in particular on its anisotropy (i. e. <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> and flatness of the disc) is calculated. The expressions for the frequency and angular dependence of both relaxation rates are derived. The effect of Brownian micellar rotation, which is in some cases an important competing slow relaxation mechanism, is estimated as well. The possible application of NMR for the determination of micellar shape, anisotropy and orientational order is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} result of an {{experiment}} measuring the wake flow behind a curved circular cylinder at Re= 3900 in water. The measurement technique used was Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The cylinder is a convex configuration with a quarter of a ring with a straight <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> in each end. It was mounted with one of the elongations perpendicular to the incoming flow, and the other elongation pointing downstream. Many of the trends in the results of this thesis are in good agreement with the results by Gallardo et al (2014) [6], such as the velocity fluctuations, average flow fields and vortex dislocations. The recirculation length measured in this thesis was longer than the results by Gallardo et al (2014) [6], probably due to the difference between the numerical setup and the experimental setup. Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements were also used, but gave inaccurate results. Further work will be to examine the measurement limits for the LDV in the Circulation Water Tunnel (CWT) with respect to direction and velocity magnitude. </p...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{centrosome}} is {{the principal}} microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of animal cells [1]. Accurate centrosome duplication is fundamental for genome integrity and entails <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> one procentriole next to each existing centriole, once per cell cycle. The procentriole then elongates to eventually reach {{the same size as}} the centriole. The mechanisms that govern <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centriolar <b>cylinder</b> and their potential relevance for cell division are not known. Here, we show that the SAS- 4 -related protein CPAP [2] is required for centrosome duplication in cycling human cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CPAP overexpression results in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> abnormally long centrioles. This also promotes formation of more than one procentriole in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> such overly long centrioles, eventually resulting in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> supernumerary MTOCs. This in turn leads to multipolar spindle assembly and cytokinesis defects. Overall, our findings suggest that centriole length must be carefully regulated to restrict procentriole number and thus ensure accurate cell division...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> primary aim <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} is to advance <b>the</b> current {{understanding}} <b>of</b> astronauts' capabilities and limitations in space-suited extravehicular activity (EVA) by compiling a detailed database <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torques needed to bend <b>the</b> joints <b>of</b> a space suit, developing models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanics <b>of</b> space suit joints based on experimental data, and utilizing these models to estimate a human factors performance metric, the work envelope for space suited EVA work. A detailed space suit joint torque-angle database is compiled {{in a novel}} experimental approach that uses space-suited human test subjects to generate realistic, multi-joint motions, which are used to drive an instrumented robot to measure the torques required to accomplish the motions in a pressurized space suit. Based on the experimental data, a mathematical model using the Preisach hysteresis modeling technique is developed to predict joint torque from the joint angle history. Two physics-based models describing the bending load-deflection characteristics of pressurized fabric cylinders were compared to the experimental space suit data. The beam model assumes that bending deflections are completely attributable to <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabric <b>cylinder</b> wall, while <b>the</b> membrane model assumes that the fabric never stretches. (cont.) The experimental data corresponds closely with the membrane model, implying that space suit joint stiffness is primarily determined by volume changes as the joint bends and <b>the</b> resulting compression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas inside the space suit. The space suit models were applied in a computational work envelope analysis to determine the volume in which a space-suited astronaut can comfortably work. A new method that uses inverse kinematics and the space suit model to calculate a work envelope based on visibility constraints and human strength limits is developed. Sensitivity analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work envelope indicates that improving shoulder mobility and upward and downward visibility enlarge the space-suited work envelope. by Patricia Barrett Schmidt.
