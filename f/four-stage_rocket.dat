50|$|The XRM-90 Blue Scout II was {{a rocket}} of the U.S. Air Force's System 609A Blue Scout family. The XRM-90 was a <b>four-stage</b> <b>rocket,</b> which {{used the same}} stages as the basic NASA Scout. It was {{nevertheless}} not identical to the latter, because the 4th stage was hidden in a payload fairing with the same diameter as the 3rd stage, and the first stage nozzle used a flared tail skirt between the fins. Externally, the XRM-90 was indistinguishable from the XRM-89 Blue Scout I.|$|E
50|$|The Athena II is a <b>four-stage</b> <b>rocket,</b> {{consisting}} of solid first, {{second and third}} stages, and a monopropellant liquid-fuelled fourth stage.

5000|$|January 31, 1958: The first American satellite, Explorer 1, was {{launched}} into Earth's orbit on a Juno I <b>four-stage</b> booster <b>rocket</b> from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Aboard Explorer 1 were a micrometeorite detector and a cosmic ray experiment designed by Van Allen and his graduate students, the satellite {{deployment of the}} sensor package supervised by Ernst Stuhlinger, who also had an expert cosmic ray background. Data from Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 (launched March 26, 1958) were used by the Iowa group to make [...] "the first space-age scientific discovery": [...] "the existence of a doughnut-shaped region of charged particle radiation trapped by the Earth’s magnetic field".|$|R
40|$|On April 27, 1961 at 1502 EST a <b>four-stage</b> {{research}} <b>rocket</b> {{was fired}} from Wallops Island, Virginia, to measure the ionospheric electron density distribution by means of Seddon's CW propagation technique. This experimental technique {{is based upon the}} dispersive Doppler effect measured at two harmonically related frequencies, in this case f = 12. 267 Mc and 6 f = 73. 6 Mc. The electron density profile measured above the peak of the F 2 region is representative of a diffusive-equilibrium distribution in an isothermal ionosphere having a temperature of 1640 deg +/- 90 deg K. This result, when compared with satellite and other data, indicates that the upper ionosphere is in thermodynamic equilibrium...|$|R
50|$|The Ariane 4 AR 40 was {{the basic}} version, with three stages: 58.4 m high, a {{diameter}} of 3.8 m, a liftoff mass of 245 t and a maximum payload of 2100 kg to GTO or 5000 kg to Low Earth orbit (LEO). Main power was provided by four Viking 2B motors, each producing 667 kN of thrust. The second stage was powered by a single Viking 4B motor, and the third stage was equipped with an HM7-B liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen motor. The Ariane 4 AR 44L, which was outfitted with the maximum additional boost of four liquid fuel rocket strap-ons, was a <b>four-stage</b> <b>rocket,</b> weighing 470 t and capable of transferring a payload of 4730 kg to GTO, or alternatively 7600 kg to LEO.|$|E
50|$|The launch was to {{take place}} on November 16, 1996 on a Proton 8K82K/11S824F rocket. This is a <b>four-stage</b> <b>rocket</b> in a {{configuration}} which had flown only twice before, both times to launch Phobos spacecraft towards Mars in 1988. The first three stages were to burn to fuel depletion. The fourth stage, called the Block D-2, would then ignite to place it and the spacecraft into a parking orbit around the Earth. Later it was to re-ignite to begin the trans-Mars injection maneuver. After the fourth stage shut-down, the spacecraft was to separate, deploy its antennae, and use its propulsion unit to complete the burn. After this was complete, the spacecraft was to deploy its solar panels and the PAIS science platform.|$|E
50|$|In this work, Gussalli advocates using a <b>four-stage</b> <b>rocket,</b> {{the last}} stage for {{landing on the}} Moon and then flying back to Earth. Astronauts were {{supposed}} to travel in a thermically insulated capsule with an air supply system like a submarine. To avoid the sensation of free-falling the capsule would spin on itself and the astronauts would walk on the padded inside walls. The rotation system would make them feel 'as if they were lying in bed in a supine position'. As a propulsion system Gussalli suggested his 'double-reaction engine', consisting in a jet engine equipped {{with a sort of}} 'afterburner', i.e. exhaust fumes were diverted by the blades of a turbine powered by another engine, so as to boost its power. The second turbine, according to further research by Gussalli, was to be fuelled electrically, and the electrical power was to be transmitted to the capsule wirelessly from Earth, {{in order to reduce the}} paying load of the rocket. This last suggestion is a startling premonition of what is now called 'direct energy transmission', a possibility explored with the aim of realizing 'climbers' on space elevators.|$|E
2500|$|The {{satellite}} {{was successfully}} delivered into its target orbit {{about twenty minutes}} after launch. The <b>four-stage</b> PSLV <b>rocket</b> flew in the CA, or [...] "Core Alone" [...] configuration, with no strap-on solid rocket boosters. PSLV-C10, as the rocket used to launch TecSAR was designated, was the second flight of a PSLV-CA, and the twelfth overall for the PSLV series. Launch was contracted by the Antrix Corporation, the commercial department of the Indian Space Research Organisation, ISRO. The TecSAR represents the first Israeli use of the Indian PSLV launcher. This made possible an orbit {{that could not be}} reached from Israel, with an altitude of 450-580 kilometers and inclination of 41 degrees. As a result, TecSAR cruises from west to east, unlike all the other surveillance satellites launched from Israel itself.|$|R

40|$|The film {{describes}} {{preparation and}} launch of five satellites and two space probes during 1958. On January 31, a Jupiter vehicle launched Explorer I into space. Data from this satellite {{was used to}} identify the van Allen radiation belts. On March 17, a Vanguard I rocket launched an Earth satellite with solar batteries. Data from the mission {{was used to determine}} that the Earth is slightly pear-shaped. On March 26, Explorer III was launched to further study the van Allen belts, micrometeoroid impacts, and internal and external temperatures. Explorer IV, launched on July 26, was intended to study radiation and temperature data. A lunar probe, ABLE I, was intended to measure radiation, magnetic fields of Earth and the Moon, density of micrometeoric matter, and internal temperatures. A <b>four-stage</b> <b>rocket</b> was used in the launch. However, a turbo-pump failed and the liquid oxygen pump stopped, resulting in a failed mission. On October 10, Pioneer I was launched by an ABLE vehicle. First and second stage velocity was less than desired and the probe did not leave Earth orbit. Attempts to attain escape velocity were unsuccessful. On December, a Jupiter boost vehicle was used to launch Juno II, with Pioneer III as the payload. Escape velocity was reached and Pioneer III left Earth's atmosphere. Failed launches, such as those of Vanguard boost vehicles and several Explorer satellites, also added to scientific knowledge...|$|E

50|$|The Rheinbote was a <b>four-stage</b> {{solid fuel}} <b>rocket.</b> The slender body {{measured}} in at 11.4 m tall and could carry {{a relatively small}} payload over a distance of approximately 200 km. Each of the four stages fired in succession with the first stage getting the rocket off the ground, {{the second and third}} stages lifting it further aloft, and the fourth stage lifting it to its maximum altitude. It was a ballistic missile with relatively low accuracy. Upon detonation the warhead produced no fragment damage and produced a crater no larger than 1.5 m across. The accuracy of the Rheinbote was found impossible to calculate after tests, because the craters proved too small to find.|$|R
