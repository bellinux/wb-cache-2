40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe 1998 Department of Defense (DoD) Logistics Strategic Plan directed a sweeping program {{to reform the}} "business" of the DoD. A key component of the plan is that inventories be established at the lowest possible levels and be positioned to permit rapid delivery to the customer. In response, the Marine Corps has established a "virtual float" concept that seeks to reduce inventory levels for secondary repairables (SecReps). We show through a simulation model that the Marine Corps should not expect large savings from a virtual <b>float</b> <b>operating</b> with a lateral transfer inventory policy. For the items we selected, additional transportation costs for lateral transfers almost entirely eliminated savings due to reduced inventory. We also address organizational issues involved with a centralized system[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{developed}} a real time algorithm that determines physical or biological {{features in the}} water column and updates the control system of a Lagrangian float for adaptive profiling. This allows the Lagrangian <b>float</b> to selectively <b>operate</b> in areas of interest, both biological and physical, to improve data collection. The algorithm is meant to determine the location of phytoplankton layers or patches and update the control system to allow the <b>float</b> to <b>operate</b> within them. This will help expand the knowledge of phytoplankton layer or patch formation, duration, and size. The algorithm was tested in both controlled and field environments. This adaptive algorithm adds to the potential of novel research techniques using Lagrangian systems in coastal waters. ...|$|R

30|$|In situ {{observations}} made by autonomous oceanic profiling floats {{have been}} used to investigate the oceanic response to a typhoon in previous studies. Wada et al. (2009 b) found that vertical water temperature profiles obtained at 10 -day intervals were clearly affected by the passage of a typhoon and that the change was dependent on the position of the profiling float relative to the typhoon track. Baranowski et al. (2011) found that the passage of two consecutive typhoons, Hagupit and Jangmi, in 2008, caused changes in the oceanic mixed layer. The in situ observations that showed these changes were made by an autonomous oceanic profiling <b>float</b> <b>operating</b> on a cycle with a period of approximately 1  day, and the authors showed that more frequent profiling (at least once a day) is required to allow variations in the water temperature and salinity in the upper ocean caused by the passage of a TC to be studied.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Households and {{businesses}} in the U. S. prefer to use check payment over less costly, electronic means of payment. Earlier {{studies have focused on}} check “float, ” i. e., the time lag between receipt and clearing, as a potential explanation for the continued popularity of checks. An underlying assumption of these studies is that check <b>float</b> <b>operates</b> as a pure transfer from payee to payor. We construct a simple general equilibrium model in which payments are made by check. In general equilibrium, check float need not act as a transfer. If float can be priced into market transactions, then it has no effect on equilibrium allocations. If float is not priced into market transactions, then it acts as distorting tax. Consistent with earlier studies, we show that float can also lead to inefficiencies if banks engage in costly activities designed to accelerate check presentment. Our analysis is consistent with view that float is a significant factor behind the continued popularity of check payment. Our analysis also consistent with recent data that indicate that the average value of float (per check) is small...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{and circulation}} changes brought by increasing atmospheric CO 2 will have profound but unpredictable {{impacts on the}} natural ocean biological carbon pump, a process that naturally transports ~ 10 Pg C y- 1 to waters below 100 m. The stability of the pump is in question. Prediction of future changes in the ocean carbon cycle requires cost-effective all-weather all-season observations of biotic carbon flows on appropriate time and space scales. This presentation describes work to close the space/time gap in observations of biologically driven ocean carbon cycle processes. The ARGO program with 1000 's of low-cost Lagrangian profiling <b>floats</b> <b>operating</b> at sea is providing sea-truth for simulations and forecasts of the climate state of the ocean. We have adapted floats for carbon observations. Since 2001, a dozen low-cost long-lived robotic Carbon Explorers (CE, optics and telemetry enhanced ARGO floats) have been deployed return real-time information on the daily variation of particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration and systematic changes in POC sedimentation to kilometer depths in the ocean (Bishop et al., 2002, 2004). 7 years of data now exist from the worlds most remote and stormy locations.

40|$|Labrador Sea Water (LSW), a dense water mass {{formed by}} {{convection}} in the subpolar North Atlantic, {{is an important}} constituent of the meridional overturning circulation. Understanding how the water mass enters the deep western boundary current (DWBC), {{one of the primary}} pathways by which it exits the subpolar gyre, can shed light on the continuity between climate conditions in the formation region and their downstream signal. Using the trajectories of (profiling) autonomous Lagrangian circulation explorer [(P) ALACE] <b>floats,</b> <b>operating</b> between 1996 and 2002, three processes are evaluated for their role in the entry of Labrador Sea Water in the DWBC: 1) LSW is formed directly in the DWBC, 2) eddies flux LSW laterally from the interior Labrador Sea to the DWBC, and 3) a horizontally divergent mean flow advects LSW from the interior to the DWBC. A comparison of the heat flux associated with each of these three mechanisms suggests that all three contribute to the transformation of the boundary current as it transits the Labrador Sea. The formation of LSW directly in the DWBC and the eddy heat flux between the interior Labrador Sea and the DWBC may play leading roles in setting the interannual variability of the exported water mass. 1.
