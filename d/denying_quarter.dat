5000|$|Prior to 7 June 1944, Meyer had incited troops {{under his}} command to <b>deny</b> <b>quarter</b> to {{surrendering}} Allied soldiers.|$|R
50|$|In 1651 Limerick was besieged and O'Brien urged a {{resistance}} that infuriated the Ormondists and Parliamentarians. Following surrender he was <b>denied</b> <b>quarter</b> and protection. Major General Purcell, Father Wolf and O'Brien were brought before a court martial and ordered for execution by General Henry Ireton.|$|R
50|$|In the end 7,377 Saxons and Russians {{had been}} killed and over 7,300 taken {{prisoner}} where of 2,000 of them were wounded. Sweden suffered some 400 killed, (amongst them, commander of the Kronoberg Regiment, colonel Gabriel Lilliehöök) and 1,000 wounded. Schulenburg managed to escape, despite having suffered a bullet wound to his hip. 71 banners, the whole Saxon artillery, 11,000 rapiers and equally as many muskets had also been captured. Rehnskiöld executed about 500 Russian prisoners; it is debated whether he did this in retaliation for Russian atrocities in Courland or because he believed their inside-out coats were an attempt {{to be recognized as}} Saxons, who were given better terms in captivity. Hiding your own identity and claiming to be something else was frowned upon at the time, and sometimes considered reason enough to be <b>denied</b> <b>quarter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, as Cromwell was aware, Drogheda had not {{fallen to}} the Irish rebels in 1641, or to the Irish Confederate forces {{in the years that}} followed. The {{garrison}} was in fact English as well as Irish and comprised Catholics and Protestants of both nationalities. The first Irish Catholic troops to be admitted to Drogheda arrived in 1649, as part of the alliance between the Irish Confederates and English Royalists. Historian John Morrill has argued that in fact it was English Royalist officers who were singled out for the most ruthless treatment—being <b>denied</b> <b>quarter,</b> executed after being taken prisoner and whose heads were publicly displayed on pikes. From this viewpoint, he argued that by [...] "barbarous wretches" [...] Cromwell meant the Royalists, who in Cromwell's view had refused to accept [...] "the judgement of God" [...] in deciding the civil war in England and were needlessly prolonging the civil wars.|$|R
50|$|The USCIS {{releases}} and updates a dataset {{on the number}} of applications received, approved, and <b>denied</b> by <b>quarter</b> for SIJS. According to this data set, the usage of the program has been steadily increasing, and the rate of petition processing has not completely kept pace, resulting in {{an increase in the number}} of pending applications at any given point in time. Note that counts of petitions received, approved and denied are during the period in question, whereas counts of petitions pending are at the end of the period.|$|R
50|$|Rivers threw {{two touchdowns}} to Royal {{and spread the}} ball to {{multiple}} receivers to lead San Diego to a 22-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills. The Chargers' defense held the Bills to just 19 yards and forced a safety in their first four series in the fourth <b>quarter,</b> <b>denying</b> Buffalo their third 3-0 start since 1993.|$|R
50|$|In {{an early}} August {{committee}} meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, {{the governor was}} able to get the committee to pass a bill to grant money for the building of barracks. These barracks would accommodate up to one thousand troops. The barracks were built and all that had to be done was convince Loudoun to obey the procedures set by parliament. Everything went smoothly until two recruiting officers complained to governor Pawnall of Massachusetts that they were <b>denied</b> <b>quarters</b> in Boston. The response was that it was illegal to quarter in private homes in Boston and the committeemen suggested that they stay at the newly built barracks at Castle William. The timing of this new meeting with Lord Loudoun was extremely unfortunate. He was currently suffering losses in northern New York while trying to hold off the French and Indians. When he heard of what happened with the committeemen he argued that the current military crisis made it acceptable to quarter troops in private homes. A bill was then brought to the governor to sign that said troops could be quartered in homes but innkeepers had the right to complain to a judge if they felt too many soldiers were there. Loudon was enraged with this and threatened to force troops upon civilians again. By the end of December, the Massachusetts legislature {{was able to get}} Loudoun to agree to quarter his troops at Castle William, which meant through the long process the colonists, were able to uphold their legal rights.|$|R
40|$|The {{debate over}} whether {{same-sex}} couples {{should be allowed to}} enter into civil marriages continues in the United States. Forty-nine adolescents and emerging adults (ages 14 – 29) with lesbian, gay, and bisexual parents were interviewed for the current exploratory study, which examined how individuals perceived themselves and their families as being affected by marriage (in) equality, as well as the factors that shaped their perspectives. More than two thirds of participants voiced unequivocal support for marriage equality, citing numerous legal and symbolic beneﬁts that their families were <b>denied.</b> One <b>quarter</b> of participants articulated critical perspectives of marriage or the ﬁght for marriage equality, while also acknowledging the beneﬁts associated with marriage. As the ﬁrst study to examine the perspectives of individuals with lesbian, gay, and bisexual parents with regard to marriage (in) equality, this research has important implications for the marriage equality debate and provides a springboard for future studies on this topic...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{with the}} plaintive Russian melody of the Eastern Orthodox Troparion of the Holy Cross (also known as [...] "O Lord, Save Thy People") played by four cellos and two violas, the piece moves through {{a mixture of}} {{pastoral}} and martial themes portraying the increasing distress of the Russian people {{at the hands of}} the invading French. This passage includes a Russian folk dance, At the Gate, at my Gate ("U Vorot, Vorot"). At the turning point of the invasion—the Battle of Borodino—the score calls for five Russian cannon shots to counter a fragment of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem. A descending string passage represents the subsequent retreat of the French forces, followed by victory bells and a triumphant repetition of O Lord, Save Thy People as Moscow burns to <b>deny</b> winter <b>quarters</b> to the French. A musical chase scene appears, out of which emerges the anthem God Save the Tsar! thundering with eleven more precisely scored shots. The overture utilizes counterpoint to reinforce the appearance of the leitmotif that represents the Russian forces throughout the piece. A total of 16 cannon shots are written into the score of the Overture.|$|R
50|$|With {{the growing}} worries of illegal {{quartering}} by the British, the Pennsylvania Assembly met and <b>denied</b> any <b>quartering</b> bill that guaranteed citizens could deny soldiers {{to stay in}} private homes. When the Assembly finally passed the quartering bill, the passage stating how soldiers could or could not be quartered in homes was omitted and it only outlined how the soldiers were to be quartered in public houses. That winter’s harsh conditions led the British commander, Col. Henry Bouquet, to order the colonists to quarter his troops in other places than just private homes. Bouquet felt his troops couldn’t survive the winter without better living conditions. Bouquet {{wrote a letter to}} the governor of Pennsylvania telling him to issue a warrant to allow the quartering of his troops in private homes. The governor issued the warrant but left it blank instead of directly listing what Col. Bouquet could or could not do. The Pennsylvania Assembly was outraged when they learned what their governor had done. But instead of asking for a veto on the warrant they asked for a review on how many troops could be quartered in a single home at a time. But the only response they received was that the king’s troops must and will be quartered. In response to this the Assembly met on a Sunday for the first time. There they {{wrote a letter to the}} governor asking why their constitutional rights were being violated when The British Parliament laws favored the colonists.|$|R
