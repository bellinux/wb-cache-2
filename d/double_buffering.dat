2500|$|Some late DOS-era [...] "wavetable" [...] sound cards such as Sound Blaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound {{featured}} dedicated DSPs, {{which were}} {{borrowed from the}} digital music instruments. These cards featured local memory {{which could be used}} for buffering multiple audio streams and mixing them on board, thus offloading the CPU and greatly improving the sound quality. However this was only possible in DOS by directly programming the hardware, and full-featured [...] "hardware acceleration" [...] from the local memory was never implemented on these cards, due to complexities of <b>double</b> <b>buffering.</b> Later cards such as Sound Blaster Live!, Audigy and X-Fi are capable of accessing the system memory buffers directly.|$|E

40|$|The future {{satellite}} positioning/navigation systems (both GPS and Galileo) {{will provide}} civil signals on multiple frequencies, {{similar to that}} currently available only for military use. The multiple distinct frequencies will provide many advantages to users of the navigation systems. This paper presents a direct RF sampling front end design well suited for multiple frequency satellite navigation receiver design. No frequency down conversion is necessary, rather the particular frequency bands of interest are intentionally aliased using a wide band ADC. The resulting samples are passed, via a <b>doubling</b> <b>buffering</b> FPGA design, to the memory space of a host PC for storage as well as eventually processing of the multiple frequency transmissions. This paper describes {{the design of the}} front-end, validates its concept with collected data, and discusses the variations on the design of a generic multiple frequency GPS front end.

5000|$|The term <b>double</b> <b>buffering</b> is {{used for}} copying data between two buffers for direct memory access (DMA) transfers, not for {{enhancing}} performance, but to meet specific addressing requirements of a device (esp. 32-bit devices on systems with wider addressing provided via Physical Address Extension).

In each graph, time flows from left to right. Note that 3 shows a swap chain with three buffers; the original definition of triple buffering would throw away frame C as soon as frame D finished, and start drawing frame E into buffer 1 with no delay. Set 4 shows {{what happens when a}} frame (B, in this case) takes longer than normal to draw. In this case, a frame update is missed. In time-sensitive implementations such as video playback, the whole frame may be dropped. With a three-buffer swap chain in set 5, drawing of frame B can start without having to wait for frame A to be copied to video memory, reducing the chance of a delayed frame missing its vertical retrace.|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{robustness}} {{is evidenced}} when single-gene mutations do {{not result in}} an obvious phenotype. It {{has been suggested that}} such phenotypic stability results from 'buffering' activities of homologous genes as well as non-homologous genes acting in parallel pathways. One approach to characterizing mechanisms of phenotypic robustness is to identify genetic interactions, specifically, <b>double</b> mutants where <b>buffering</b> is compromised. To identify interactions among genes implicated in posterior patterning of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, we measured synthetic lethality following RNA interference of 22 genes in 15 mutant strains. A pair of homologous T-box transcription factors (tbx- 8 and tbx- 9) is found to interact in both C. elegans and C. briggsae, indicating that their compensatory function is conserved. Furthermore, a muscle module is defined by transitive interactions between the MyoD homolog hlh- 1, another basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, hnd- 1, and the MADS-box transcription factor unc- 120. Genetic interactions within a homologous set of genes involved in vertebrate myogenesis indicate broad conservation of the muscle module and suggest that other genetic modules identified in C. elegans will be conserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{extends the}} model for Ca {{movement}} in the cardiac ventricular cell from the diadic cleft space to the entire sarcomere. The model predicts the following: 1) Shortly after SR release there is a [Ca] gradient > 3 orders of magnitude from cleft center to M-line which, 50 ms after release, is still > 30. Outside the cleft, 40 ms after cessation of release, the axial gradient from Z to M-line is > 3. 2) At the end of SR release, > 50 % of the total Ca released is bound to low-affinity inner sarcolemmal phospholipid binding sites within the cleft. 3) Halving the SR release almost doubles the fraction of release removed from the cell via Na/Ca exchange and reduces average sarcomeric free [Ca] by 70 %. 4) Adding 100 μM fluo- 3, which <b>doubles</b> the <b>buffering</b> capacity of the cytoplasm, reduces peak average sarcomeric [Ca] by > 50 % and increases the initial half-time for [Ca] decrease by approximately twofold. 5) A typical Ca “spark” can be generated by an SR release 20 % of maximum (4 × 10 − 20 moles) over 2 ms. Fluo- 3 (100 μM) significantly “shrinks” the spark. 6) The “spark” {{is a consequence of}} elementary events within the diadic cleft space. For example, removal of cleft binding sites would cause average sarcomeric Ca to increase by > 10 fold, fall 10 times more rapidly, decrease latency for appearance of the spark by > 20 times, and reduce spark duration by 85 %. 7) Dividing SR Ca release between cleft and corbular SR produces a secondary [Ca] peak and a “flattening” of the sarcomeric [Ca] transient. These changes probably could not be resolved with current confocal microscopic techniques...|$|R

5000|$|A {{software}} implementation of <b>double</b> <b>buffering</b> has all drawing operations store their results in some region of system RAM; any such region {{is often called}} a [...] "back buffer". When all drawing operations are considered complete, the whole region (or only the changed portion) is copied into the video RAM (the [...] "front buffer"); this copying is usually synchronized with the monitor's raster beam {{in order to avoid}} tearing. <b>Double</b> <b>buffering</b> necessarily requires more memory and CPU time than single buffering because of the system memory allocated for the back buffer, the time for the copy operation, and the time waiting for synchronization.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} a novel buffering technique {{for increasing the}} A-scan rate of swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) systems employing low duty cycle swept source lasers. This technique differs from previously reported buffering techniques in that it employs a fast optical switch, capable of switching in 60 ns, instead of a fused fiber coupler {{at the end of}} the buffering stage, and is therefore appreciably more power efficient. The use of the switch also eliminates patient exposure to light that is not used for imaging that occurs {{at the end of the}} laser sweep, thereby increasing the system sensitivity. We also describe how careful management of polarization can remove undesirable artifacts due to polarization mode dispersion. In addition, we demonstrate how numerical compensation techniques can be used to modify the signal from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) clock obtained from the original sweep to recalibrate the buffered sweep, thereby reducing the complexity of systems employing lasers with integrated MZI clocks. Combining these methods, we constructed an SSOCT system employing an Axsun technologies laser with a sweep rate of 100 kHz and 6 dB imaging range of 5. 5 mm. The sweep rate was <b>doubled</b> with sweep <b>buffering</b> to 200 kHz, and the imaging depth was extended to 9 mm using coherence revival. We demonstrated the feasibility of this system by acquiring images of the anterior segments and retinas of healthy human volunteers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work conducted in Tasks 2 - 4, which together {{make up the}} Electrokinetic Modeling carried out in this project. The modeling was divided into three main sections: thermal analysis, chemical species transport, and electrode geometry and soil heterogeneity issues. The thermal modeling consisted of development of the governing equations to incorporate Joule heating associated with electro-osmosis, heat conduction and convection, and temperature dependencies of electrical conductivity and electro-osmotic permeability. To model the transport of chemical species in the Lasagna{sup TM} process, a one-dimensional model was developed. This model is based on previous models, but includes additional mechanism to account for charge transfer in the <b>double</b> layer, pH <b>buffering</b> of the soil, and zeta potential dependency on pH and ionic strength. The results of this model and the corroboration by experimental measurement support some key assumptions made in the thermal model. An analysis was also conducted to compare the use of cylindrical electrodes to the plate geometry used in Phase I. In summary, cylindrical electrodes may be appropriate for anodes, because the do not intercept the flow. If used as cathodes, a planar treatment zone in their vicinity would probably be required. The cylindrical electrodes can operate at reasonable current densities without boiling water. Because the hottest region is at the electrode, cooling schemes {{could be used to}} operate at higher current densities. If iron anodes are used, they will have to be quite massive, and may not be economical compared to planar models. An example of soil heterogeneity was investigated when it was discovered that a steel pt was buried {{in the vicinity of the}} pilot test. There is some distortion of the field near the pit, but its effects on the test zone between the electrodes are minimal...|$|R

50|$|When {{it is not}} {{feasible}} to set each pixel only once, <b>double</b> <b>buffering</b> can be used.
