40|$|The SICO engine {{concept was}} {{proposed}} by Per-Arne Sigurdsson. The engine comprises of two main cylinders for combustion implementing a two-stroke cycle operation {{and a single}} help cylinder running at twice the engine speed. At the end of combustion, the burned gases from the main cylinder are transferred to the help cylinder where the second stage expansion occurs simultaneously along with the main cylinder. The cylinders {{are considered to be}} thermally insulated and along with the parallel expansion cylinder aims to derive a higher engine efficiency. The charged induction of air is done by means of a compressor cylinder/radial compressor. The engine concept is evaluated for a power generation application where the engine efficiency at a single operating speed is essential. Consequently, the scavenging and friction models were augmented to better suit the model. Different aspects like the heat <b>insulation,</b> <b>valve</b> timings, cylinder dimensions, cylinder phasing, compression ratio of the main and help cylinders, charged induction using a radial compressor and compression cylinder were evaluated and optimized for the necessary application. Additionally, the SICO concept was compared with existing concepts that implement similar strategies such as the five-stroke engine concept that aims in utilizing exhaust energy for a four stroke cycle operation. The final SICO engine model is a 3. 14 L engine, producing a peak power of 81. 5 kW at 1500 rpm. At this operating point the engine runs at an efficiency of 41. 3 %. Simulations show that the implementation of the help cylinder contributes to around a 7 % brake efficiency increase and the effect of heat insulation is not of large significance for the break efficiency. Based on the preliminary evaluation of the concept by means of simulations, the engine efficiency of the concept is comparable to existing modern diesel engines and thus the SICO concept’s operation and implementation can be further pursued...|$|E

This was in contrast to earlier practice where {{little more than the}} pressure vessel was delivered and the ancillary components were fitted on-site.|$|R
25|$|The newer concentric-float {{fill valve}} {{consists}} of a tower which is encircled by a plastic float assembly. Operation is otherwise {{the same as a}} side-float fill valve, even though the float position is somewhat different. By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank <b>insulation,</b> flush <b>valve,</b> and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float fill valve is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by making much more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float fill valve, which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.|$|R
5000|$|Dead Weight : It is {{the self}} weight of pipe {{including}} fluid, {{weight of fittings}} & other inline components (say <b>valve,</b> <b>insulation</b> etc.). This type of loads act throughout {{the life cycle of}} pipe. These Loads cause bending and the bending moment is related to normal and shear stresses. Pipe bending is caused mainly due to two reasons : distributed weight load (e.g. fluid weight) and concentrated weight load (e.g. valve weight).|$|R

Also, the priority investment projects realized by JSC "Termocom" are being presented. The company had implemented an automated monitoring system for the heat power production, transportation and distribution. For many years, the company used bellows pipes with polyurethane <b>insulation,</b> ball <b>valves</b> and plate heat exchangers. 14 out of 21 district heating boiler stations were upgraded 10 were completely automated having as a result no further need in full-time duty personnel there. The experience gained in the implementation of capacity banks and frequency inverters, summarizing the benefits and achieved results, is also presented in the current paper. It is to be underlined that in 2011 the company achieved decrease in electricity consumption by about 30 % in comparison with 2005...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{household}} in Latvia {{is the most}} energy capacious sector – 40 % of the final total energy consumption has been consumed by {{household in}} 2008. According to that the energy demands in household as well as energy conservation potential are very important parts of the management and development of energy sector. The paper presents the latest development in Building sector and in Energy Efficiency in Building sector involved Legislative aspects, Framework changes, which influence building renovation process in Latvia. Methods Refurbishment projects focused on the large stock of apartment buildings built before 1990. The standardized buildings comprise 65 % of the building stock. District heating is widespread in Latvia. For the whole building sector estimated saving potential of 30 - 50 % resulting in 15 PJ. For the public buildings estimated saving potential 20 - 60 % resulting in 2. 052 PJ. Refurbishment projects Latvia suggests a rehabilitation strategy in 3 groups with first groups of more simple and inexpensive measures and the last group for major rehabilitations. Group 1 : Water receiving devices adjustments and heat meters installation. Windows and doors packing/renovation, loggias glazing, change heat substations. (20 - 30 % savings/ 4. 5 years pay back). Group 2 : Insulation external walls and balks covering, ventilation in bathrooms and kitchens. (15 % savings additionally). Group 3 : Windows/doors replacement, individual heat meters, and thermo controller <b>valves,</b> <b>insulation</b> of cellars coverings, side walls, and gable roofs. (Savings 50 - 60 % with group 1 - 3. medium/long pay back). The paper also describes different financing schemes for the Building Refurbishment Projects, regulatory frameworks {{of this kind of}} Projects, Projects evaluation by the performance indicators (Investments volume, Energy savings, CO 2 Reductions etc.) Conclusions The paper presents potential for energy saving in building sector in Latvia and the results from the realized projects of building refurbishment when building envelope element U-values have been reduced significantly by external insulation measures, and internal heating system have been rebuild. The project’s results illustrate optimal energy saving measures for different types of buildings...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} study was to propose measures to decrease the facility’s energy demand and to calculate the payback time for these suggestions. By means of using simulation software along with data from practical measurements different configurations in the facility were tested. The study resulted in suggestions consisting of an increase of the temperature in the freezing room and the temperature in LTB 1. Those suggestions increases the facilities COP and decreases the energy consumption. Proposals to curb the ice growth are the insulation of components such as pipes and <b>valves.</b> <b>Insulation</b> results in a small decrease in energy demand but greatly increases the accessibility and also decreases the risk of corrosion. Through load tests conducted on the compressors it showed that the compressors were not driven in the optimal load range, suggestions were made for operation in a more favourable load range. Thus increasing the efficiency and cutting the maintenance costs. From the results it is shown that the facility is well built and dimensioned against thermal transmission. Though it turned out that the floor heating accounts for a disproportionate amount of the thermal transmission. ...|$|R
