50|$|An {{alternate}} form {{of color}} bars is the 100% Color Bars pattern, or RGB pattern (sometimes <b>called</b> <b>full</b> field <b>bars),</b> {{which consists of}} eight vertical bars of 100% intensity, and {{does not include the}} castellation or luminance patterns. Like the SMPTE standard ("75%") pattern, the color order is white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue, but with an additional column of saturated black. This pattern is used to check peak color levels and color saturation as well as color alignment. The 100% pattern is not as common or as useful as the SMPTE standard 75% pattern, but many pieces of test equipment generate both patterns, and can be selected to generate either one. Many professional cameras can be set to generate a 100% pattern for calibration to broadcast or recording equipment, especially in a multi-camera installation where all camera signals must match. There is another 75% pattern that consists of the same eight columns as the 100% pattern, but at 75% intensity. This pattern is very seldom used.|$|R
