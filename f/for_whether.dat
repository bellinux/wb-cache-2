5|$|Newton's {{derivation}} of Proposition 43 {{depends on}} his Proposition 2, derived {{earlier in the}} Principia. Proposition 2 provides a geometrical test <b>for</b> <b>whether</b> the net force acting on a point mass (a particle) is a central force. Newton showed that a force is central {{if and only if}} the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center.|$|E
5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks <b>for</b> <b>whether</b> the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E

5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar.

Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E

These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.|$|E

25|$|Individuals may {{migrate from}} their birth or founded colony {{to take up}} {{residence}} in another. This is most common during the pre-emergence phase and when there are around forty to fifty adults on the home nest. Migrant wasps {{are more likely to be}} accepted while they are younger, which is generally less than six days old. Age has been shown to be the determining factor <b>for</b> <b>whether</b> the resident wasps react with hostility or tolerance. Age might be an indicator of ovarian development (reproductive threat) or of other important qualities such as plasticity for role specialization. Multiple-foundress colonies are preferentially selected by migrant wasps, despite the fact that individuals are more successful at becoming a queen in a single-foundress colony. Young migrants become fully integrated into the new colony, becoming foragers and sometimes taking over the role of queen.|$|E
25|$|For {{the fifth}} {{edition of the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), {{there has been a}} {{tremendous}} amount of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which includes the GID, qualifies as a mental disorder. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID should not be considered a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of reliable and valid evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, <b>for</b> <b>whether</b> GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents. Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not give recognition to the individual’s discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Dual meets {{usually take}} place on evenings during the school week (Monday through Friday); on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings; or even on Sunday mornings or afternoons during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. No weight {{allowances}} are made for dual meets and multiple-day dual meets. Wrestlers are also examined by a physician or a certified athletic trainer for any communicable skin diseases. If a student-wrestler does not make weight, he is ineligible for that weight class and a forfeit is scored. If there are any communicable skin diseases, it is a ground for disqualification. The wrestler's coach or athletic trainer can provide written documentation from a physician that a skin infection of a wrestler would not be communicable. The final judgement <b>for</b> <b>whether</b> a wrestler {{would be allowed to}} compete lies with the meet physician or athletic trainer on site. In all cases, after determining the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet, the referee will call the wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the visiting captains will call a disk toss. The colored disk will then fall to the floor and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position {{at the start of the}} second period and 2) which one of the team's members is to appear first on the mat when called by the referee for each weight class. The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. For example, the 125lb, 141lb, 157lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 133lb, 149lb, 165lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 285lb.|$|E
