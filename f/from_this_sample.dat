Benefiting <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>sampling</b> method, the approximation of fusion results is obtained through random particles.

2500|$|The Catskill Formation (Upper Devonian, Famennian Stage), {{located in}} Tioga County, Pennsylvania, {{is the site}} of a large sample of small {{individuals}} of Bothriolepis. The sample was collected from a series of rock slabs that consisted of partial or complete, articulated, external skeletons.

A morphometric study performed by Jason Downs and co-authors highlights certain characteristics that indicate juvenility in Bothriolepis, including a moderately large head and moderately large orbital fenestra—both of which are characteristics also recognized by Erik Stensio in 1948 in the smallest B. canadensis individuals. Several other features that Stensio marked indicative of young individuals can also be seen exhibited in the Catskill sample. These features include [...] "delicate dermal bones with ornament consisting of continuous anastomosing ridges rather than tubercles, a dorsal trunk shield narrower than long and with a continuous and pronounced dorsal median ridge, and a pre-median plate that is wider than it is long".|$|E
2500|$|Accidental {{sampling}} (sometimes {{known as}} grab, convenience or opportunity sampling) {{is a type}} of nonprobability sampling which involves the sample being drawn from that part of the population which is close to hand. That is, a population is selected because it is readily available and convenient. It may be through meeting the person or including a person in the sample when one meets them or chosen by finding them through technological means such as the internet or through phone. The researcher using such a sample cannot scientifically make generalizations about the total population <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>sample</b> because it would not be representative enough. For example, if the interviewer were to conduct such a survey at a shopping center early in the morning on a given day, the people that he/she could interview would be limited to those given there at that given time, which would not represent the views of other members of society in such an area, if the survey were to be conducted at different times of day and several times per week. This type of sampling is most useful for pilot testing. Several important considerations for researchers using convenience samples include: ...|$|E
