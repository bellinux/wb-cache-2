5000|$|The more {{powerful}} versions {{will be developed}} by Amédée Gordini from the original engine. The machining of the <b>inclined</b> <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> allows for a greater range but leaving intact the camshaft spindle, improved cylinder head cooling, and the engine is fitted with a new 32 mm Solex carburettor [...] This, {{in conjunction with the}} increase in compression ratio, results in a maximum power of 37 hp SAE at 5,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 62.8 Nm at 3500 rpm. This engine made its debut in the fall of 1957, then, in 1959, it underwent further modifications and its power was increased to 40 hp SAE. The [...] "Sorcerer" [...] then makes a small preparation, thus the Dauphine Gordini (type R1091) is born in 1957.|$|R

40|$|Risk-based {{inspection}} methods enable {{estimation of}} the probability of failure on demand for spring-operated pressure relief valves at the United States Department of Energy&#x 27;s Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. This paper presents a statistical performance evaluation of soft seat spring operated pressure relief valves. These pressure relief valves are typically smaller and of lower cost than hard seat (metal to metal) pressure relief valves and can provide substantial cost savings in fluid service applications (air, gas, liquid, and steam) providing that probability of failure on demand (the probability that the pressure relief valve fails to perform its intended safety function during a potentially dangerous over pressurization) {{is at least as}} good as that for hard <b>seat</b> <b>valves.</b> The research in this paper shows that the proportion of soft seat spring operated pressure relief valves failing is the same or less than that of hard <b>seat</b> <b>valves,</b> and that for failed <b>valves,</b> soft <b>seat</b> <b>valves</b> typically have failure ratios of proof test pressure to set pressure less than that of hard <b>seat</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the {{optimization}} of the spool and housing geometry {{in a small}} hydraulic <b>seat</b> <b>valve</b> to enable {{the reduction of the}} axial flow forces to a minimum value is described. Non-optimized hydraulic valve geometry is usually the main cause for many problems related to response time, actuation force and energy consumption. To overcome these limitations and problems we have done a thorough numerical and experimental analysis of a <b>seat</b> <b>valve.</b> The main influential geometry parameters of the <b>seat</b> <b>valve</b> are defined for numerical analyses. In the next step the basic theory of the numerical simulation, including the 3 D modelling, meshing and parameterization, is explained. The reduction of the flow forces in a small hydraulic <b>seat</b> <b>valve</b> is treated in detail by using a commercial simulation tool, Ansys CFX. The validation of the numerical fluid model of the valve is done by comparing simulation and experimental results obtained with the test rig for axial flow force measurement. With the validated numerical fluid model of the valve new fluid models are built taking into account all influential geometry parameters of the valve for the purpose of the final optimization of the valve geometry. The results of the simulation analyses show that the axial component of the flow forces can be reduced significantly just by modifying the geometry of the valve spool and housing. Thus the valve dynamic characteristics, such as response time, are significantly improved while the necessary actuation force and power consumption are reduced...|$|R
5000|$|The {{steel housing}} of the <b>seat</b> <b>valve</b> pump {{contains}} four hydraulically controlled <b>seat</b> <b>valves,</b> two suction and two delivery valves {{for the two}} hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that {{the contents of the}} delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the [...] "sucking" [...] piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.|$|R
50|$|An angle <b>seat</b> piston <b>valve</b> is a pneumatically-controlled valve with a piston {{actuator}} providing linear actuation {{to lift a}} seal off its seat.

Angle <b>seat</b> piston <b>valves</b> are particularly suited to applications where high temperatures and large flowrates are required, such as steam or water. When used in reverse some models of angle <b>seat</b> piston <b>valve</b> will eliminate water hammer when operated.|$|R

50|$|<b>Seat</b> <b>valve</b> {{pumps are}} {{suitable}} for an especially even pumping of media with a solids content of up to 50% and for the high-pressure pumping of paste-like industrial media such as sludges.

40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} annular <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> that defines an annular valve orifice between {{the edges of}} the annular <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> an annular <b>valve</b> plug sized to cover the valve orifice when the valve is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving the annular valve plug on and off the annular <b>valve</b> <b>seat.</b> The use of an annular orifice reduces the characteristic distance between {{the edges of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>seat.</b> Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between the annular valve plug and the annular <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> for the <b>valve</b> to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of the annular valve plug. The use of a valve-plug holder that is under independent control to move the annular valve plug between its open and closed positions is important for achieving controllable fast operation of the valve...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> may be {{improperly}} positioned or machined. These include incomplete seating during the press fitting-step, distortion of the nominally circular <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces such they deviate unacceptably from perfect roundness or waviness, tilt of the machined surfaces relative to the valve guide hole axis, deviation of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces from concentricity with the valve guide holes, and deviation of the machined conical section of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> from the cone angle that is required to match the valve surface. Automated quality control of inserted and machined <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> has traditionally been very difficult to achieve until the advent of digital holography which has enabled high-definition metrology for measuring all of these listed deviations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{problem with the}} CVH is the {{tendency}} to drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> which most often happens in vin number P engines, due to the steel PM <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts in the aluminum head. (the 2000-2004 Ford Focus with the 2.0L CVH/SPI SOHC engine and also seen in 1991-2002 Ford Escorts). These engines usually drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> with no warning, even if the engine has been well maintained. In most cases, a seat drops on the number 4 cylinder, with the next most common being the number 2 cylinder (this peculiarity {{may have something to}} do with the engines secondary harmonics) [...] With the factory <b>valve</b> <b>seats,</b> the typical life of the 2.0L SPI in a Focus is about 100 to 120k miles, but it can happen as early as 70k miles. When the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> drops out of the cylinder head, it falls into the cylinder and damages the piston and cylinder head. In some cases, the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> is drawn from its cylinder through the intake manifold into another cylinder until it is obliterated.

40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts {{are one of}} {{the vital}} part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. <b>Valve</b> and <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method.
