6000|$|Advancing to {{the nearest}} <b>dinner</b> <b>tray,</b> [...] Tapping the {{shoulder}} of the nighest guest, [...] With a peculiar smile, which, by the way, [...] Boded no good, whatever it express'd, [...] He ask'd the meaning of this holiday; [...] The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd [...] His question, much too merry to divine [...] The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine, ...|$|E

[...] "Noo aboot the dinner o' they twa turtle-doves in the parlor?" [...] he continued, directing {{his attention to}} the <b>dinner</b> <b>tray.</b> [...] "I maun joost see that the cook's 's dune her duty--the creatures are no' capable o' decidin' that knotty point for their ain selves." [...] He took off one of the covers, and picked bits, here and there, out of the dish with the fork, [...] "Eh! eh! the collops are no' that bad!" [...] He took off another cover, and shook his head in solemn doubt. [...] "Here's the green meat. I doot green meat's windy diet for a man at my time o' life!" [...] He put the cover on again, and tried the next dish. [...] "The fesh? What the de'il does the woman fry the trout for? Boil it next time, ye betch, wi' a pinch o' saut and a spunefu' o' vinegar." [...] He drew the cork from a bottle of sherry, and decanted the wine. [...] "The sherry wine?" [...] he said, in tones of deep feeling, holding the decanter up to the light. [...] "Hoo do I know but what it may be corkit? I maun taste and try. It's on my conscience, as an honest man, to taste and try." [...] He forthwith relieved his conscience--copiously. There was a vacant space, of no inconsiderable dimensions, left in the decanter. Mr. Bishopriggs gravely filled it up from the water-bottle. [...] "Eh! it's joost addin' ten years to the age o' the wine. The turtle-doves will be nane the waur--and I mysel' am a glass o' sherry the better. Praise Providence for a' its maircies!" [...] Having relieved himself of that devout aspiration, he took up the tray again, and decided on letting the turtle-doves have their dinner.|$|E
5000|$|As times changed, so did {{construction}} techniques, {{and today}} TV tray tables are often manufactured using blow-molded plastic. It is now common for TV <b>dinner</b> <b>trays</b> to be marketed as [...] "retro" [...] or kitsch items.|$|R
50|$|As {{proof of}} authenticity, all Wrinkles toys have a bone-shaped symbol {{embroidered}} into their ear. As well, {{they all came}} with a fabric bone. The plush Wrinkles spawned some additional merchandise, including metal <b>dinner</b> <b>trays,</b> PVC figures, poseable dolls and even a direct to video movie.|$|R
25|$|Many Australian {{households}} quickly rearranged their dining habits so {{the family}} could watch television together at tea time. The lounge typically became the TV room. Magazines published advice on preparing meals {{to be taken}} in front of the television. Stores began to carry new products such as vinyl furniture, frozen <b>dinners,</b> <b>tray</b> tables, and plastic dishes.|$|R
50|$|When {{in a large}} camp, it {{is common}} for {{soldiers}} to use either normal dining wares, or a multi-compartment mess tray similar to a TV <b>Dinner</b> <b>tray,</b> but much larger.|$|E
50|$|A TV tray table, TV <b>dinner</b> <b>tray,</b> or {{personal}} {{table is a}} type of collapsible furniture that functions as a small and easily portable, folding table. These small tables were originally designed to be a surface from which one could eat a meal while watching television. The phrase tray-table can also refer to a fold-away tray, such as those found in front of airline seats.|$|E
50|$|Abigail reveals {{she left}} a diamond brooch on Rufus's coffin, Bruce, needing the money, and family maid and lover Lettie recover it, though Bruce is perturbed to find it on the floor. He leaves Lettie at the crypt against her wishes, saying they need to return separately—and she is {{beheaded}} by a masked killer—seemingly Rufus returned from the grave. He leaves the head to be discovered by Bruce and others on a <b>dinner</b> <b>tray.</b> Bruce vows to stop Rufus while forcing Vivian to help him.|$|E
40|$|Picture {{a prison}} from a Hollywood film, with long lanes of {{adjacent}} cells full of prisoners. The prisoners are shouting, and smashing their <b>dinner</b> <b>trays</b> against the bars. But then, the Nokia ringtone pierces the corridor. The guard checks his pockets, but his phone isn’t ringing. All prisoners simultaneously reach into their overalls, and one {{pulls out a}} ringing phone. The idea of prisoners being called by their friends on the outside or even fellow prisoners might be shocking. They {{would appear to be}} completely out of control. Apart from the consumer-prisoner sketched above, affix the word consumer to the otherwise disciplined, and consider some events of the recent past. The consumersoldier provided the Abu Ghraib torture shots, for example. The consumer-worker writes a blog that criticizes his company. And the consumer-student uses his own laptop with GPRS, avoiding the university server. In other words, the Foucauldian subjects of surveillance now own and use consumer technology, which makes them unruly. Foucault described how surveillance disciplined people in enclosed spaces – the prison, the barracks, the hospital, th...|$|R
60|$|Jeanne's packing {{was after}} all {{a very small}} matter. She ignored the {{cupboards}} full of gowns, nor did she open one of the drawers of her wardrobe. She simply filled her dressing-case with a few necessaries and hid it under the table. At eight o'clock one of the servants brought her <b>dinner</b> on a <b>tray.</b> Jeanne saw with relief {{that it was one}} of the younger parlour maids, and not the Princess' own maid.|$|R
5000|$|About {{the man who}} deified a binbōgami. At {{the night}} of Jinjitsu (January 7 in the former Japanese calendar), a binbōgami {{appeared}} at the man's bedside and thanked him, [...] "I had a prepared <b>dinner</b> on a <b>tray</b> for the first time," [...] and made the man a millionaire in return. And it is also said that a poor hatamoto (middle-class bushi), who thought binbōgami had brought him security as well as poverty, put sake and rice out to pray to binbōgami {{for a little bit}} of luck. And then, he received a little bit of luck. This binbōgami is now enshrined beside Kitano Shrine, in Bunkyō ward, Tokyo. If you pray at the small shrine to welcome binbōgami temporarily, and send him away 21 days later, it is said, you can avoid binbōgami thereafter.|$|R
50|$|An old Torreya Nut Tree (Torreya nucifera) {{is located}} {{close to the}} Nishinomaru-enokida Gate to the north. Its height is 16 metres and it is eight metres at the base. Over 600 years old, the tree was already there when the castle was constructed. It is the only government-designated natural {{monument}} in Nagoya. The tree regained its viability despite damage from air raids in 1945. Tokugawa Yoshinao, the first feudal lord of Owari, and thus the castle, {{is said to have}} decorated his <b>dinner</b> <b>tray</b> with torreya nuts from this tree before going into battle in Osaka, and later for New Year's celebrations.|$|E
50|$|The largely random {{elements}} of the surroundings that Gallagher declares must be hit include oranges, diet colas, eggs, gumball machines, alarm clocks and fish tanks, but, as opposed to most other live-action games by American Laser Games, people must not be shot. The game was featured on the 1992/1993 series of GamesMaster, as a celebrity challenge in which two actors from The Bill played the game. One of their tasks was to shoot food inside a TV <b>dinner</b> <b>tray,</b> but only the food the fly lands on. This also included canned food {{in which they have}} to avoid the dog food, but shoot the other cans instead.|$|E
5000|$|That night, Manon, in {{a drunken}} craze, {{is in the}} swamps {{attempting}} to shoot several alligators. Joyce is disquieted {{by the sound of}} gunshots, but when she tries to open the door to her room, she discovers it is locked. When the maid Lou Ann (Ruby Goodwin) delivers Joyce’s <b>dinner</b> <b>tray,</b> she warns that the house is deeply troubled and advises her to leave as soon as possible. Later, Lavinia notifies Mark Sinclair (George Macready), a self-proclaimed [...] "Swamp Doctor" [...] who operates a clinic on the plantation, that Paul's wife is there. At the clinic, Mark administers an injection to an agitated patient who is swathed in bandages. Soon after, Lavinia arrives to confer {{about how to deal with}} Joyce.|$|E
2500|$|American University has an Environmental Issues Project Team to {{recommend}} steps {{about how to}} fulfill the university's responsibility {{to protect the environment}} to the administration. The Team also works to increase environmental awareness on campus. Student environmental activism has grown into a major presence on American's campus. The student environmental group, EcoSense, works with regional and national organizations such as the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, The Campus Climate Challenge, Energy Action Network, Step It Up 2007, DC Woodlands, Power Shift, and the DC Youth Environmental Alliance. An environmental science class at American conducted a study from February to April 2009 to measure the amount of food waste avoided by eliminating trays from one of the college's dining halls. The class found that trayless dinners resulted in 47.1% less solid waste than <b>dinners</b> during which <b>trays</b> were used, spurring a student-driven campaign to go trayless across campus. The university's overall grade on the College Sustainability Report Card improved dramatically between 2008 and 2009 from a [...] "D+" [...] to a [...] "B-", demonstrating the university's commitment to environmental responsibility.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Eclipse, Part 1," [...] Claire is told by Angela {{that she}} must go into hiding to avoid Arthur gaining the catalyst, she is taken to Level 5 where she finds Noah Bennet waiting for her, he takes her {{to the house of}} Stephen Canfield. When they arrive there, he starts to teach her how to fight properly, as she struggles to fight him at first. Sylar and Elle are ordered to {{retrieve}} Claire for Pinehearst, but when they arrive they find that their powers are not working. Noah easily defeats the now-depowered Sylar and Elle, but Claire is shot by Elle when she throws herself in front of the gun to save Noah. Claire finds that after she is shot, she is not healing. Angered and worried, Noah takes Claire back to her home where Sandra and Noah try to treat her wound; Noah decides against taking her to a hospital, believing that the wound is not that serious and also because he doesn't want to risk Claire's power being exposed to the public should it return. Claire remarks that not being able to heal has finally allowed her to feel pain once again, and that even though it [...] "sucks," [...] it feels great. Sandra later returns to Claire's room with <b>dinner</b> on a <b>tray,</b> only to find Claire unconscious on the floor with blood pooling under her, showing that she was more severely injured by Elle's gun than Noah originally thought.|$|R
5000|$|History's Lost and Found is a {{television}} show from the History Channel that debuted as a three part series in December 1998. It first aired as a weekly series on August 7, 1999. Each episode is divided into different segments concerning a different [...] "lost" [...] item or artifact from history. Most of the time, the segments do not relate. Each segment runs around 7 minutes and in this time we learn the history, of several famous lost artifacts such as the flags from the Battle of Iwo Jima, and other not so famous artifacts like the first TV <b>Dinner</b> <b>tray.</b> Each segment ends with information on where this item is located. Some segments were reused in other episodes. Episodes of the show were released on VHS in 2001 and the first episode has been released on DVD. 2000 was the big year for the series {{as most of the}} episodes were created and aired during that year, but a few new episodes aired in 2004 and 2005. The final segment of each show is the [...] "Auction Block" [...] hosted by Karen Stone and featuring auction specialist Cameron Whiteman from the eBay auction house Butterfields where viewers can bid on a different historical item that they could own for themselves that changed from week to week. The featured item of the week was up for auction until 11:00 PM ET the following Thursday.|$|E
