30|$|As {{reported}} in previous work, QPVA-based membrane has high water uptake, {{which leads to}} the high <b>fuel</b> <b>permeability</b> and decrease the mechanical strength. This condition can be improved through the blending process with an inorganic filler or other polymers to form a QPVA composite-based membrane [35, 36]. Rajesh Kumar et al. [37] reported that the ethanol permeability of a QPVA-based membrane was high, in the range of (0.95 – 2.08)[*]×[*] 10 − 6  cm 2  s− 1. In this study, QPVA is combined with graphene oxide (GO) as AEMs to enhance the performance of passive alkaline–DEFCs with low ethanol permeability and high ionic conductivity. Currently, GO is the most widely used inorganic material due to its special characteristics, including its potential to improve the thermal and mechanical strength of polymers, good networking ability due to the presence of rich functional. GO is a good candidate as a filler in polymer electrolyte due to the oxygenic functional groups, including hydroxyl, carboxylic, and epoxy groups, present at the edge of GO. This hydrophilic region is useful to transfer the anion across the polymer electrolyte [38 – 41]. Karim et al. [42] reported that the ionic conductivity of GO was nearly 10 − 2 S cm− 1 higher than bulk of graphite oxide (10 − 4 S cm− 1). In addition, the hydrophobic region in the aromatic ring (sp 2 carbon layer) of the GO nanosheet structure is useful to reduce the fuel crossover issue and enhance the mechanical strength due to the strong covalent bonding [40 – 44]. Lin et al. [44] reported that GO sheet was able to decrease the <b>fuel</b> <b>permeability</b> of Nafion® 115 membranes until 10 − 7  cm 2  s− 1. Ye et al. [45] applied the PVA/GO electrolyte membrane in an alkaline direct methanol fuel cell to enhance cell performance, which result in increment about 126 % of ionic conductivity and 55 % reduction in <b>fuel</b> <b>permeability.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{sulfonated}} poly(aryl ether ether ketone ketone) (PEEKK) {{having a}} well-defined rigid homopolymer-like chemical structure was synthesized from a readily prepared PEEKK by post-sulfonation with concentrated sulfuric acid {{at room temperature}} within several hours. The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) cast from the resulting polymer exhibited an excellent combination of thermal resistance, oxidative and dimensional stability, low methanol <b>fuel</b> <b>permeability</b> and high proton conductivity. Furthermore, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were successfully fabricated and good direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) performance was observed. At 2 M MeOH feed, the current density at 0. 5 V reached 165 mA/cm, which outperformed our reported similarly structured analogues and MEAs derived from comparative Nafion membranes.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the highly}} {{competitive}} market of fuel cells, solid alkaline fuel cells using liquid fuel (such as cheap, non-toxic and non-valorized glycerol) and not requiring noble metal as catalyst seem quite promising. One {{of the main}} hurdles for emergence of such a technology {{is the development of}} a hydroxide-conducting membrane characterized by both high conductivity and low <b>fuel</b> <b>permeability.</b> Plasma treatments can enable to positively tune the main fuel cell membrane requirements. In this work, commercial ADP-Morgane® fluorinated polymer membranes and a new brand of cross-linked poly(aryl-ether) polymer membranes, named AMELI- 32 ®, both containing quaternary ammonium functionalities, have been modified by argon plasma treatment or triallylamine-based plasma deposit. Under the concomitant etching/cross-linking/oxidation effects inherent to the plasma modification, transport properties (ionic exchange capacity, water uptake, ionic conductivity and fuel retention) of membranes have been improved. Consequently, using plasma modified ADP-Morgane® membrane as electrolyte in a solid alkaline fuel cell operating with glycerol as fuel has allowed increasing the maximum power density by a factor 3 when compared to the untreated membrane...|$|E
40|$|Flame {{spread over}} porous media due to {{accidental}} fuel spillage {{is a major}} fire safety concern. The behaviour of flame under such conditions greatly depends {{on the availability of}} fuel at combustion zone. A combined experimental and mathematical study was carried out to investigate the rate of fuel penetration through porous beds at different fuel ratios. Propanol at three different fuel ratios of 0. 1, 0. 125 and 0. 15 and sand particles ranging in diameters from 0. 5 to 5 [*]mm were employed as liquid fuel and porous bed, respectively. Results showed that fuel penetration rate was a function of permeability of porous bed and mass of the liquid <b>fuel.</b> The <b>permeability</b> of porous bed and consequently the rate of fuel penetration decreased as either the tortuosity or the specific surface area was increased. Fuel penetration measurement and mathematical results indicated that the rate of fuel penetration is directly proportional to the fuel ratio. The fuel penetration rate was found to be higher for larger fuel ratios compared with that for small ratios. The difference between the fuel penetration rate for two consecutive fuel ratios for a given particle size was 25 %. The predicted results were in good agreement with those acquired experimentally...|$|R
30|$|Perfluorosulfonate membranes, such as Nafion, are {{the most}} used {{electrolyte}} due to their good proton conductivity and chemical stability. However, limitations associated with both limited temperature range of operation and alcohol <b>permeability</b> (<b>fuel</b> crossover) have triggered an extensive research to improve the high temperature properties of Nafion membranes [3, 5]. Previous works were carried out to reduce fuel crossover and to improve Nafion-based membranes performance by incorporating oxide particles, such as SiO 2, TiO 2, and H 2 Ti 3 O 7.H 2 O (titanate nanotubes), obtaining promising results [6, 7, 8, 9]. Such an improved performance {{has been attributed to}} the hygroscopic properties of the oxide phase, which allow the fuel cell operation at higher temperature and, consequently, favor the fuel oxidation kinetics [6, 7]. Among different oxide phases, composites with silica particles in the composition have demonstrated superior performance in PEMFC operating at high temperature. Such a feature has been explained in terms of improved water retention into conductive channels of the Nafion due to the higher water sorption properties of silica. In addition, the morphology of the oxide phase seems to be an important parameter in the hygroscopic properties of the composites. In this context, mesoporous silica-based composite with high proton conductivity, {{as a result of the}} ordered structure of pores, was described as an alternative electrolyte for fuel cell applications [10].|$|R
40|$|Gas {{transport}} {{along the}} axis of irradiated fuel rods is an important process which determines homogeneous pressurization inside the rod. In case of failed rods, gas and/or liquid phase (water) axial transport is relevant for accident conditions (e. g. the effects of depressurization on fuel integrity and radionuclide release), and for spent fuel drying. The effects of increasing burnup on the mode of axial transport of gas are of particular interest. The closure of the pellet-cladding gap, which occurs at burnup around 45 GWd/tHM, removes a fast pathway for axial transport. This implies that gas or other mobile species will have to travel through cracks and other discontinuities in the fuel. This paper {{presents the results of}} axial gas transport measurements in a spent <b>fuel</b> rod. The <b>permeability</b> of nitrogen along {{the axis of}} a PWR ~ 52 GWd/tHM UO 2 rod was investigated by applying a gas pressure difference and measuring the equilibration time across the fuel stack. The tests were performed in hot cell at ambient temperature (approximately 300 K). The pressure difference applied varied between 0. 1 MPa and 1 MPa (1 and 10 bar) and the corresponding equilibration times varied between 930 s and 280 s, respectively. The derived permeability coefficient is of the order of 3 • 10 - 13 m 2. These results confirm that axial transport of fluid occurs readily in spent fuel rod also when the pellet-cladding gap is closed. Further work is ongoing to investigate these properties in the context of spent fuel drying, storage and disposal, and to assess possible implications for in-pile behaviour under off-normal conditions.
