500|$|Most of the European-style vessels {{were built}} in the {{shipyard}} that Nguyễn Ánh had commissioned in Saigon. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> personal interest in the naval program, directly supervising the work and spending several hours a day dockside. One witness noted [...] "One principal tendency of his ambition is to naval science, as a proof of this he has been heard to say he would build ships of the line on the European plan." [...] By 1792, fifteen frigates were under construction, with a design that mixed Chinese and European specifications, equipped with 14 guns. The Vietnamese learned European naval architecture by dismantling an old European vessel into its components, so that Vietnamese shipbuilders could understand the separate facets of European shipbuilding, before reassembling it. They then applied their newfound knowledge to create replicas of the boats. Nguyễn Ánh studied naval carpentry techniques and was said to be adept at it, and learned navigational theory from the French books that Pigneau translated, particularly Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie. The Saigon shipyard was widely praised by European travelers.|$|E
2500|$|But Leavitt's {{interests}} were {{not limited to}} confections for the Gilded Age elite. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in city planning, especially that of his adopted city of New York. On January 3, 1922, for instance, Leavitt was moved to write The New York Times concerning the routing of traffic flow, an issue addressed in a recent Times story. [...] "The construction, operating, financial and economic aspects of any problem belong to the engineer and his field", wrote Leavitt to The Times. [...] "This city is rich in her wealth of men of engineering genius and talent." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was able}} to inspire others with his own love for the culture and people of Java, in an {{academic}} {{as well as other}} respects. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in others who were interested in Indonesian, and particularly Javanese culture. Such as, for instance, the puppeteer from Haarlem, Rien Baartmans [...] who died far too young [...] who performed not only Dutch puppet plays but also Javanese wayang plays and was famous, especially among children, for his wonderful performances of Wayang Kancil stories about the mouse deer. And his good friend Ger van Wengen, who devoted his time as curator at the Leiden ethnological museum to popularizing ethnology, with Ger using data provided by Hans, such as his book De schending van Soebadra (The abduction of Subadra), and Hans learning from Ger.|$|E

50|$|A heavy {{cigarette}} smoker, O'Keefe died of {{lung cancer}} in 1968 at the age of sixty. In the film The Diamond Wizard (1954), he played a U.S. Treasury Agent in London who, ironically, is trying to quit smoking. Throughout the film, different characters prevent him from lighting up. After the rousing finale, however, as a reward for his heroism, he is finally allowed to have <b>a</b> cigarette. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> puff and joyously exhales.|$|R
5000|$|Superman derives {{his power}} from the yellow Sun of Earth. Forced under a red sun akin to that of his homeworld, or exposed to red sun radiation, Superman rapidly loses his powers, {{reverting}} to the stature equal to a normal human. This version of Superman also needs to breathe, as <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath in [...] "Apokalips Now... Part 2" [...] before plunging into the ocean, and has a special suit for when he needs to operate in outer space.|$|R
2500|$|In The Time Ships, Stephen Baxter's {{sequel to}} The Time Machine, the Time Traveller {{encounters}} his younger self via time travel. His younger self reacts with embarrassment to his older self's {{knowledge of his}} real names: [...] "I held up my hand; I had an inspiration. [...] "No. I will use—if you will permit—Moses." [...] <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> pull on his brandy, and gazed at me with genuine anger in his grey eyes. [...] "How {{do you know about}} that?" [...] Moses—my hated first name, for which I had been endlessly tormented at school—and which I had kept a secret since leaving home!" [...] This is a reference to H.G. Wells's story [...] "The Chronic Argonauts", the story which grew into The Time Machine, in which the inventor of the Time Machine is named Dr. Moses Nebogipfel; the surname of Wells's first inventor graces another character in Baxter's book (see above).|$|E

50|$|After graduating {{he moved}} to Bandung, where he studied at an AMS (Algememe Midelbare School, or senior high school). Natsir later {{said that he had}} chosen the school for its Western {{classics}} class. From 1928 until 1932, he became a chairman of JIB Bandung. He then received a teaching permit after studying for two years at a native teacher's training college. Although he had previously studied Islam in West Sumatra, while in Bandung <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> interest in the religion, including subjects such as the interpretation of the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, and dialectics; he later studied under Ahmad Hassan, the leader of Persatuan Islam.|$|R
50|$|Abe Cunningham {{was born}} in Long Beach, California. When he was young, {{his family moved to}} Sacramento. He first started {{drumming}} in his early teens playing the drums for his band Phallucy in the early 90s. During this time, he also drummed for the Deftones on the side, when the band was having problems landing a permanent and dedicated drummer. At the time when he started learning drums, he also learned how to play guitar, but growing up with a stepfather (Neil) who played the drums, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> passion with the drums. Abe's father, Sid, was also a musician and an early influence for Abe before his untimely passing. His influences include Stewart Copeland, Ginger Baker and Mitch Mitchell.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} help him to say that. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> inhalation, pressed his lips tightly together, and nodded at her to confirm his words.|$|E
60|$|He watched Little Brown Betty {{until she}} had filled his mug, and the froth ran over the top. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught and began again.|$|E
60|$|The new-comer {{threw back}} his head, {{and a look}} that was half wonder, half {{enlightenment}} gleamed in the black depths of his imperious eyes. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, Joseph!" [...] {{he cried}} dramatically. [...] "This {{is no time}} to disarm. Keep your sword on your thigh, man; you will need it as you never yet have needed it." [...] <b>He</b> paused, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath, and hurled the news at his brother. [...] "Roland Marleigh is here." [...] And he sat down like a man exhausted.|$|R

5000|$|... "Pig-Pen" [...] {{is known}} for his perpetually filthy {{overalls}} and the cloud of dirt and dust that follows him wherever he goes. When <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath (to sing, for example), the dust rises briefly around him. He sometimes refers to the cloud that surrounds him with pride as the dust of ancient civilizations. He cannot seem to rid himself of the dust for more than the briefest of periods — indeed, in spite of his best efforts, it appears that he cannot stay clean. He is referred to in an early strip as the only person who can get dirty while walking in a snowstorm. Nevertheless, on rare occasions he has very briefly appeared clean, and hence unrecognizable. Once this was in order to impress Violet, of whom he was a bit fond. On another occasion (September 6, 1954), he managed to keep one side of his body clean and presented this clean side to Patty, causing her to believe that he was completely clean.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught of the posset, {{and as he}} set it down {{he heard}} Lionel's step without. Then the door was flung open, and his brother stood on the {{threshold}} a moment at gaze.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{breath and}} clenched 'his hands together. By the time Mr. Chase {{came into the}} room he was able to greet him with a {{stealthy}} wink. Mr. Chase, with a humorous twist of his mouth, winked back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh" [...] said Mr. Chase. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath. [...] "Oh, really!" [...] he said. [...] "I wouldn't 'ave {{thought it}} of you, Gussie. I wouldn't 'ave thought you'd have played it so low down. I'm {{surprised}} at you." ...|$|E

"Speaking {{of these}} {{historical}} romances," [...] said Mwres, with {{an attempt at}} an easy, off-hand manner, [...] "brings me--ah--to the matter I--ah--had in mind when I asked you--when I expressed a wish to see you."

50|$|Tom's head {{is stuck}} in the board, but he is safe. Jerry then {{proceeds}} to twist the board like a helicopter propeller and Tom lifts off. The cat stops the board's rotation and unravels his neck, and then frees himself from the board. Tom sighs in relief until he sees that he is falling toward the sea. He grabs the board again and uses it to actually fly like a glider. He dives after an unsuspecting Jerry, and when Jerry spots him, Tom chases him into a vent pipe. However, Tom is squeezed {{through the hole in}} his board and bounces around through the pipe. Tom crawls through successively shorter widths of pipe in order to reach the mouse, and when the chase exits the plumbing, Tom is compressed into a cylinder with legs barely a centimeter wide, forming himself in some kind of a walking stick. When the cat realizes this, <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath and uncompresses himself, briefly looking like a more monstrous feline in the process.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks to}} me as if the animals used this trail when they wanted a drink," [...] was Luke's comment. [...] "That water looks pretty good to me," [...] and bending down, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> draught. [...] "It's fine," [...] he went on; [...] "try it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Rage had transfigured her. She {{scarcely}} {{heard her}} own words. They poured out senselessly, monotonously, one calling up another, {{as if from}} the lips of a Cassandra.

60|$|The old man {{had taken}} a liking to Bradley {{on account of his}} oratory, and the {{possibilities}} of making him a Democratic leader had really taken possession of him.

6000|$|Denis held {{open the}} little iron gate for his companion.

50|$|As a Roman humanist, <b>he</b> also <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{interest}} in the classical ruins of Rome, and in the urban renewal efforts of Paul III throughout the city. Of particular note in this vein {{are a series of}} short orations that he wrote and possibly delivered at the papal court, urging Paul III to refurbish the aqueduct known as the Aqua Virgo, in order to supply Rome with adequate fresh water, and as a major key to the revitalization of the city itself.|$|R
50|$|Early in 1875 Birks {{suffered}} from a paralytic seizure, and {{this was followed by}} a second stroke in 1877. <b>He</b> still <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in questions of the day, and was able to dictate various works, pamphlets, and letters bearing upon these questions. In April 1880, while residing in the New Forest, he was paralysed for a week, his third attack. He was conveyed home to Cambridge, where he lingered for three years incapable of intellectual effort. He died on 19 July 1883.|$|R
60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} turned {{and gazed at}} each other in stupefaction. Mr. Stokes was the first to recover, and, taking his dazed friend by the arm, led him gently away. At {{the end of the street}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath, and, after a slight pause to collect his {{scattered}} energies, summed up the situation.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{breath and}} then {{stepped out onto}} the gray, rubbled ground. After a minute he lit a {{cigarette}} and stood gazing around him. The landscape was dead. Nothing stirred. He could see for miles, endless ash and slag, ruins of buildings. A few trees without leaves or branches, only the trunks. Above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray, drifting between Terra and the sun.|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} to America in 1885, {{and once more}} occupied the somewhat dilapidated historic mansion at Elmwood. Once more he moved amid his rare and precious books, and heard the birds singing in the elms {{that his father had}} planted, or in the clustered bushes back of the house. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in the struggle for international copyright. He was President of the American Copyright League, and wrote the memorable lines:-- ...|$|E
5000|$|On January 3, 2014, a Del Rio judge set Sells' {{execution}} date for April 3, 2014. Sells' death sentence {{was carried out}} at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville.

50|$|After {{graduating from}} {{economics}} {{department at the}} Moscow State University in 1945, where <b>he</b> also <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in philosophy, Kim Yong-ju joined the Workers' Party of Korea. His rise through the party's echelons was fast: from the 1950s to the 1960s he was chief cadre (1954), vice-director (1957) and finally director (1960) of the WPK Organization and Guidance Department, and he was appointed member of the WPK Central Committee at the Party's 4th Congress in 1961. In 1966 {{he was promoted to}} Organizing Secretary of the WPK Central Committee.|$|R
5000|$|He died at his residence, 'The Willows' (which he {{had owned}} {{since at least}} 1907 and after 1914 joint-owned with his brother Sydney), in Hazelbrook on 28 December 1922 aged 74, with his {{obituary}} noting that he [...] "was a popular figure in Redfern, {{in the affairs of}} which <b>he</b> always <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> and active interest."
