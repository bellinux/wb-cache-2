40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To understand, {{through the}} theory of social representations, the {{influence}} exerted by {{the establishment of a}} residency program in anesthesiology on anesthetic care and professional motivation in a tertiary teaching hospital in the Northeast of Brazil. METHOD: Qualitative methodology. The theoretical framework comprised the phenomenology and the social representation theory. Five multidisciplinary focus groups were formed with 17 health professionals (five surgeons, five anesthesiologists, two nurses, and five nursing technicians), who work in operating rooms and post-anesthesia care units, all with a prior and a posteriori experience to the establishment of residency. RESULTS: From the response content analysis, the following empirical categories emerged: motivation to upgrade, recycling of anesthesiologists and improving anesthetic practice, resident as an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>link</b> in perioperative care, improvements in the quality of perioperative care, and recognition of weaknesses in the perioperative process. It was evident from upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to prolonged intubation that the creation of a residency in anesthesiology brings advancements that are reflected in the motivation of anesthesiologists; the resident worked as an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>link</b> between the multidisciplinary team; there was recognition of weaknesses in the system, which were identified and actions to overcome it were proposed. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a residency program in anesthesiology at a tertiary education hospital in the Northeast of Brazil promoted scientific updates, improved the quality of care and processes of interdisciplinary care, recognized the weaknesses of the service, developed action plans and suggested that this type of initiative may be useful in remote areas of developing countries...|$|E

As exemplified by Orin Aremo, indigenous verbal and artistic resources remain vibrant and are of immense socio-economic and artistic value.

40|$|Summary]. Since a few years, {{a lively}} debate {{has taken place}} on whether European {{regionalisation}} process contributes to a decline or a restructuring of the nation state. In this article, the case of German assistance to Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) will help analysing how national external policies evolve and adapt to a new integrative environment. The eastwards enlargement of the European Union will be the general framework for making the <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>link</b> between foreign policy and European questions. As we argue that the enlargement is a sui generis process, one way to analyse the restructuring state is making sociology of the German federal field of aid. Drawing on the literature on social constructivism, sociological institutionalism and sociology of elites, we adopt two variables (identity norms and institutions), which have to be tested {{in order to understand}} structural and relational power (S. Strange) among actors involved in national/bilateral (Transform program) and European/multilateral projects (Phare/Twinning). As a result, we contribute to the debate on governance, as we observe that German cooperative federalism is particularly put into question, we argue that a multi-bilateral policy towards CEEC is in fact taking shape...|$|E

Recent results based on population studies show that small planets are abound in our galaxy.

We build a strong <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>link</b> between geomicrobiology and observational astronomy, by exploring the color signatures of extremophiles as well as the various extreme niches that those organisms inhabit on Earth. In addition, we provide the first database of surface signatures of terrestrial life for a broad range of pigmented microorganisms, including ones isolated from Earth’s most extreme environments. Our spectral library provides a broader and more realistic guide for the search for surface features of extraterrestrial life.

40|$|A white woman’s {{murder by}} a black man, as {{depicted}} in Doris Lessing’s The Grass IS Singing, incorporates the revengeful act of an abandonment-neurotic black servant against a white female master with tactile delirium {{in the course of}} a paradoxical relationship of love and hate. The final homicide and the consequent act of surrender by Moses, the murderer, convey his paradoxical attitude toward his white master-beloved. This attitude begins with hatred, intensifies with mutual affection, and ends in murder. Focusing on the interracial revenge that takes place in the novel under study, the authors of this paper argue that Moses’ motivation in killing Mary originates from the ambivalence of his state of living under colonization and his learnings in Christianity, struggling with the Double-Effect Reasoning inaugurated by and in defense of black honor or negritude. As such, Moses’ sense of guilt and his subsequent surrender are the consequences of traditional and colonial internalization of sin, already present in him as a native of his revenge or honor-based society, influenced by Lobengula’s rule in which the criminal submits to punishment willingly, as well as missionary teachings. Through an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>link</b> between the Double-Effect Reasoning and the psychoanalytical perspective to the black problem promoted by Frantz Fanon, The Grass Is Singing thus seems to exempt Moses in his crime against the white race, represented by Mary, as well as to justify Moses self-surrender in defense of negritude and black honor...|$|E

I explore how the permeable boundaries between medical and narrative practices are woven together to create political meaning in a corpus of texts from the sixteenth century. By establishing the intricate relationship between medicine, political goals, and narrative; my work creates a historical trajectory between genres and show the way that each appropriates and differentiates itself from one another.
