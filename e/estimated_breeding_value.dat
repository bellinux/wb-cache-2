50|$|Animal {{breeding}} is {{a branch}} of animal science that addresses the evaluation (using best linear unbiased prediction and other methods) of the genetic value (<b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value,</b> EBV) of livestock. Selecting for breeding animals with superior EBV in growth rate, egg, meat, milk, or wool production, or with other desirable traits has revolutionized livestock production throughout the world.

40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between type traits and longevity was {{studied in the}} French Holstein breed using a survival analysis model. In this model, the phenotypic value adjusted for systematic fixed effects, the <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value,</b> or the residual value (defined as {{the difference between the}} adjusted phenotypic value and the <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value)</b> of the cow for each type trait was included as a risk factor. This was done separately for two subpopulations (registered and nonregistered herds) and with or without adjustment for production traits, i. e., considering true or functional longevity. For both types of herds, udder traits (and above all, udder depth) clearly influenced the length of productive life. There seemed to be a more pronounced voluntary culling on type traits in registered herds. The correction for the within herd-year class of production traits, as a way to approximate functional longevity, increased the importance of udder traits and decreased the weight of capacity traits. The same results were obtained when the phenotypic value of the cow for type was replaced by her <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value,</b> whereas residuals had little impact. The {{relationship between}} longevity and type traits was most often nonlinear, in particular for udder traits, but in this study, no trait with a clear intermediate optimum was found. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In the past, {{pedigree}} {{relationships were}} used to control and monitor inbreeding because genomic relationships among selection candidates were not available until recently. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the consequences for genetic variability across the genome when genomic information is used to <b>estimate</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and in managing the inbreeding generated in the course of selection on genome-enhanced <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Methods These consequences were measured by genetic gain, pedigree- and genome-based rates of inbreeding, and local inbreeding across the genome. Breeding schemes were compared by simulating truncation selection or optimum contribution selection with a restriction on pedigree- or genome-based inbreeding, and with selection using <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> based on genome- or pedigree-based BLUP. Trait information was recorded on full-sibs of the candidates. Results When the information used to <b>estimate</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and to constrain rates of inbreeding were either both pedigree-based or both genome-based, rates of genomic inbreeding were close to the desired values and the identical-by-descent profiles were reasonably uniform across the genome. However, with a pedigree-based inbreeding constraint and genome-based <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> genomic rates of inbreeding were much higher than expected. With pedigree-instead of genome-based <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> the impact of the largest QTL on the <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> was much smaller, resulting in a more uniform genome-wide identical-by-descent profile but genomic rates of inbreeding were still higher than expected based on pedigree relationships, because they measure the inbreeding at a neutral locus not linked to any QTL. Neutral loci did not exist here, where there were 100 QTL on each chromosome. With a pedigree-based inbreeding constraint and genome-based <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> genomic rates of inbreeding substantially exceeded the value of its constraint. In contrast, with a genome-based inbreeding constraint and genome-based <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> marker frequencies changed, but this change was limited by the inbreeding constraint at the marker position. Conclusions To control inbreeding, it is necessary to account for it on the same basis as what is used to <b>estimate</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> i. e. pedigree-based inbreeding control with traditional pedigree-based BLUP <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and genome-based inbreeding control with genome-based <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the impact of both the size of genomic {{reference}} populations and {{the inclusion of a}} residual polygenic effect on dairy cattle genetic evaluations enhanced with genomic information. Methods Direct genomic values were estimated for German Holstein cattle with a genomic BLUP model including a residual polygenic effect. A total of 17, 429 genotyped Holstein bulls were evaluated using the phenotypes of 44 traits. The Interbull genomic validation test was implemented to investigate how the inclusion of a residual polygenic effect impacted genomic <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Results As the number of reference bulls increased, both the variance of the estimates of single nucleotide polymorphism effects and the reliability of the direct genomic values of selection candidates increased. Fitting a residual polygenic effect in the model resulted in less biased genome-enhanced <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and decreased the correlation between direct genomic <b>values</b> and <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of sires in the reference population. Conclusions Genetic evaluation of dairy cattle enhanced with genomic information is highly effective in increasing reliability, as well as using large genomic reference populations. We found that fitting a residual polygenic effect reduced the bias in genome-enhanced <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> decreased the correlation between direct genomic <b>values</b> and sire's <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and made genome-enhanced <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> more consistent in mean and variance as is the case for pedigree-based <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{high-quality}} lamb {{products are}} required to maintain consumer confidence and consumption. We conducted studies to compare the meat quality traits of Merinos with those of first- and second-cross lambs. There is great diversity within the Merino genotype, {{particularly with regard to}} wool fibre diameter, which complicates generalisations. However, studies of the quality of meat from Merinos were unanimous in that Merinos produce meat that rates highly in terms of flavour, tenderness and overall acceptability. In one study, the retail display-life of loin meat from Merinos was inferior; high pH has been a consistent problem with Merino meat for a number of years. The prevalence of high-pH meat can be minimised by on-farm concentrate feeding, increasing the plane of nutrition of pasture-fed lambs prior to consignment, using sires with a high <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> for muscling, minimising stress factors between farm and slaughter and using sires with low agitation scores.

The modules of genes revealed by these analyses were enriched for a number of functional terms summarised as muscle sarcomere organisation and development, protein catabolism (proteosome), RNA processing, mitochondrial function and transcriptional regulation. Conclusions This study has revealed strong genetic structure in the gene expression program within ovine longissimus lumborum muscle. The balance between muscle protein synthesis, at the levels of both transcription and translation control, and protein catabolism mediated by regulated proteolysis {{is likely to be the}} primary determinant of the genetic merit for the muscling trait in this sheep population. There is also evidence that high genetic merit for muscling is associated with a fibre type shift toward fast glycolytic fibres.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the impact of carcase <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> on carcase size and lean meat yield of lambs and to determine whether nutrition alters these responses. Selection for high <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for growth increased carcase size by as much as 4 kg in lambs fed a high plane of nutrition. On a low plane of nutrition, this effect was reduced by 60 %, highlighting the importance of nutrition for realizing the potential of this trait. Selection for <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for muscling reduced total carcase fatness by 3 % in lambs fed at a low plane of nutrition and by 10 % in lambs fed at a high plane of nutrition, resulting in an increase in lean meat yield and improved economic returns for sales based on a lean-meat-yield grid. Selecting for <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for low fat depth reduced total carcase fatness by 4 %; this effect was the same whether lambs were maintained on high or low planes of nutrition. Other aspects of meat quality maybe influenced by using sires selected for muscling. Meat tenderness may be reduced due to greater connective tissue content, but it is likely that this can be controlled by concurrent selection for growth. Juiciness and flavour may be reduced due to reduced intramuscular fat content, but this can be attenuated by nutritional practices and, in the longer term, by alleviating the negative selection for fatness.

40|$|Accuracy and bias of <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are {{important}} {{measures of the}} quality of genetic evaluations. A sampling method that accounts for the uncertainty in the estimation of genetic group effects was used to calculate accuracy and bias of estimated effects. The method works by repeatedly simulating phenotypes for multiple traits for a defined data and pedigree structure. These simulated values are analysed using BLUP with genetic groups in the relationship matrix. Accuracies and biases are then calculated as correlations among and differences between true and estimated values across all replicates, respectively. The method was applied to the Irish beef production data set for 15 traits and with 15 genetic groups to account for differences in breed means. Accuracy and bias of estimated genetic groups effects, estimated comparisons between genetic groups effects, <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> within genetic group, and <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> across genetic group were calculated. Small biases were detected for most estimated genetic group effects and most estimated comparisons between genetic group effects. Most of these were not of importance relative to the phenotypic standard deviation of the traits involved. For example, a bias of 0. 78 % of the phenotypic standard deviation was detected for carcass conformation in Aberdeen Angus. However, one trait, calf quality, which has very few performance records in the data set, displayed larger bias ranging from - 10. 31 % to 5. 85 % of the phenotypic standard deviation across the different estimated genetic group effects. Large differences were observed in the accuracies of genetic group effects, ranging from 0. 02 for feed intake in Holstein, which had no data recorded, to > 0. 97 for carcass conformation, a trait with large amounts of data recorded in the different genetic groups. Large differences were also observed in the accuracies of the comparisons among genetic group effects. The accuracies of the <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> within genetic group and <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> across genetic group were sometimes different; for example, carcass conformation in Belgian Blue had an average accuracy within genetic group of 0. 69 compared to an average accuracy across genetic group of 0. 89.

Development of statistical and computational methods to <b>estimate</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> based on markers is a very active area of research. A simulated dataset was analyzed by participants of the QTLMAS XIII workshop, allowing {{a comparison of the}} ability of different methods to <b>estimate</b> genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Methods A best case scenario was analyzed by the organizers where QTL genotypes were known.

The submitted <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were evaluated for correlation with the simulated values (accuracy), rank correlation of the best 10 % of individuals and error in predictions. Bias was tested by regression of simulated on <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Results The accuracy obtained from the best case scenario was 0. 94. Six research groups submitted 19 sets of <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Methods that assumed the same variance for markers showed accuracies, measured as correlations between estimated and simulated values, ranging from 0. 75 to 0. 89 and rank correlations between 0. 58 and 0. 70.

Random, additive genetic and permanent environmental effects were modeled using Legendre polynomials of order 4 and 5, respectively. Residual variance was modeled using five classes. The average lactation curve was modeled using a fourth-order Legendre polynomial. Heritability estimates for measures of persistency ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 25. Genetic correlations between measures of persistency and 305 -day milk yield (Y 305) ranged from - 0. 52 to 0. 03. At high selection intensities for persistency measures and Y 305, few animals were selected in common. As the selection intensity for the two traits decreased, {{a higher percentage of}} animals were selected in common. The average predicted breeding values for Y 305 according to year of birth of the cows had a substantial annual genetic gain. In contrast, no improvement in the average persistency breeding value was observed. We conclude that selection for total milk yield during lactation does not identify bulls or cows that are genetically superior in terms of milk yield persistency. A measure of persistency represented by the sum of deviations of <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> for days 31 to 280 in relation to <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> for day 30 should be preferred in genetic evaluations of this trait in the Gyr breed, since this measure showed a medium heritability and a genetic correlation with 305 -day milk yield close to zero.

40|$|About 30 {{years ago}} there was concern in both the beef and dairy {{industries}} that too much emphasis was being given to accuracy of genetic evaluation. This article will discuss attempts to reduce emphasis on accuracy and, thus increase emphasis on the predictor of genetic value itself which {{is commonly known as}} <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> (EBV). Accuracy is a key component of more useful measures of risk such as standard error of prediction which can be used to create confidence ranges in units of measurement for true breeding value based on the EBV and the standard error of prediction. The concept of standard error of prediction can be extended to comparison of pairs of EBV. The influence of genomic relationships and Bayesian analyses on accuracies and standard errors of prediction will also be briefly introduced...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} the genetic {{evaluation}} of dairy bulls and cows for subjectively scored conformation traits using random contemporary groups is proposed. Variance parameters for the random factors of the model were estimated for 14 traits in Jersey cattle. Three alternatives for reducing the influence of parent averages on <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were compared using the new model. One alternative was to modify {{the construction of the}} inverse of the additive genetic relationship matrix, and the other alternatives involved the application of two artificially high heritability <b>values.</b> Comparisons of <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of bulls and cows from the three alternatives and usual BLUP with the new model were made to determine the effect on rankings of animals. Alternatives with higher heritabilities were similar to usual BLUP, but the modified inverse matrix method caused more rerankings especially for cows. The question is whether procedures for calculating <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> should be modified to reduce the effect of inbreeding in subsequent selections or whether genetic evaluation procedures should be left unaltered and strategies for optimum mating decisions to avoid or minimize inbreeding should be adopted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Partial {{least square}} {{regression}} (PLSR) was {{used to analyze the}} data of the QTLMAS 2010 workshop to identify genomic regions affecting either one of the two traits and to <b>estimate</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> PLSR was appropriate for these data because it enabled to simultaneously fit several traits to the markers. Results A preliminary analysis showed phenotypic and genetic correlations between the two traits. Consequently, the data were analyzed jointly in a PLSR model for each chromosome independently. Regression coefficients for the markers were used to calculate the variance of each marker and inference of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was based on local maxima of a smoothed line traced through these variances. In this way, 25 QTL for the continuous trait and 22 for the discrete trait were found. There was evidence for pleiotropic QTL on chromosome 1. The 2000 most important markers were fitted in a second PLSR model to calculate <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of the individuals. The accuracies of these <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> ranged between 0. 56 and 0. 92. Conclusions Results showed the viability of PLSR for QTL analysis and <b>estimating</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> using markers. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} for assessing trait economic impacts, {{at the level of}} the individual animals considered in selection, for traits where the economic value changes across the range of the trait. Results are compared with those from linear methods for price patterns that are common for traits, such as beef carcase fat depth, weight and marbling score, which affect market acceptability and preference. Some important deviations from linearity were seen in the change in index that occurs with change in <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> (EBV) for these traits. The deviations were most evident at the extremes of the EBV range, which could affect the animals selected. Simple extensions of the method are also suited for use in mate selection and other important areas where non-linearity is encountered...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{estimation}} of gametic effects via marker-assisted BLUP requires the inverse of the conditional gametic relationship matrix G. Both gametes of each animal {{can either be}} identified (distinguished) by markers or by parental origin. By example, it was shown that the conditional gametic relationship matrix is not unique but depends on the mode of gamete identification. The sum of both gametic effects of each animal - and therefore its <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> - remains however unaffected. A previously known algorithm for setting up the inverse of G was generalized in order to eliminate the dependencies between columns and rows of G. In the presence of dependencies the rank of G also depends on the mode of gamete identification. A unique transformation of estimates of QTL genotypic effects into QTL gametic effects was proven to be impossible. The properties of both modes of gamete identification {{in the fields of}} application are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAccording to {{the general}} {{approach}} developed in this paper, dynamic management of genetic variability in selected populations of dairy cattle is carried out for three simultaneous purposes: procreation of young bulls to be further progeny-tested, use of service bulls already selected and approval of recently progeny-tested bulls for use. At each step, {{the objective is to}} minimize the average pairwise relationship coefficient in the future population born from programmed matings and the existing population. As a common constraint, the average <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> of the new population, for a selection goal including many important traits, is set to a desired value. For the procreation of young bulls, breeding costs are additionally constrained. Optimization is fully analytical and directly considers matings. Corresponding algorithms are presented in detail. The efficiency of these procedures was tested on the current Norman population. Comparisons between optimized and real matings, clearly showed that optimization would have saved substantial genetic variability without reducing short-term genetic gains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The use of genomic {{selection}} in breeding programs {{may increase the}} rate of genetic improvement, reduce the generation time, and provide higher accuracy of <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> (EBVs). A number of different methods {{have been developed for}} genomic prediction of <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> but many of them assume that all animals have been genotyped. In practice, not all animals are genotyped, and the methods have to be adapted to this situation. Results In this paper we provide an extension of a linear mixed model method for genomic prediction to the situation with non-genotyped animals. The model specifies that a <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> is the sum of a genomic and a polygenic genetic random effect, where genomic genetic random effects are correlated with a genomic relationship matrix constructed from markers and the polygenic genetic random effects are correlated with the usual relationship matrix. The extension of the model to non-genotyped animals is made by using the pedigree to derive an extension of the genomic relationship matrix to non-genotyped animals. As a result, in the extended model the <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are obtained by blending the information used to compute traditional EBVs and the information used to compute purely genomic EBVs. Parameters in the model are estimated using average information REML and <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs). The method is illustrated using a simulated data set. Conclusions The extension of the method to non-genotyped animals presented in this paper makes it possible to integrate all the genomic, pedigree and phenotype information into a one-step procedure for genomic prediction. Such a one-step procedure results in more accurate <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and has the potential to become the standard tool for genomic prediction of <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> in future practical evaluations in pig and cattle breeding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background Efficient methodologies {{based on}} animal models {{are widely used}} to <b>estimate</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> in farm animals. These methods are not {{applicable}} in honey bees because of their mode of reproduction. Observations are recorded on colonies, which consist of a single queen and thousands of workers that descended from the queen mated to 10 to 20 drones. Drones are haploid and sperms are copies of a drone’s genotype. As a consequence, Mendelian sampling terms of full-sibs are correlated, such that the covariance matrix of Mendelian sampling terms is not diagonal. Results In this paper, we show how the numerator relationship matrix and its inverse can be obtained for honey bee populations. We present algorithms to derive the covariance matrix of Mendelian sampling terms that accounts for correlated terms. The resulting matrix is a block-diagonal matrix, with a small block for each full-sib family, and is easy to invert numerically. The method allows incorporating the within-colony distribution of progeny from drone-producing queens and drones, such that <b>estimates</b> of <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> weigh information from relatives appropriately. Simulation shows that the resulting <b>estimated</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are unbiased predictors of true <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Benefits for response to selection, compared to an existing approximate method, appear to be limited (~ 5 %). Benefits may however be greater when estimating genetic parameters. Conclusions This work shows how the relationship matrix and its inverse can be developed for honey bee populations, and used to <b>estimate</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and variance components...|$|R
