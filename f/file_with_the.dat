5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E

25|$|In Windows utilities, {{the space}} and the period are not allowed as the final {{character}} of a filename. The period is allowed as the first character, but some Windows applications, such as Windows Explorer, forbid creating or renaming such files (despite this convention being used in Unix-like systems to describe hidden files and directories). Workarounds include appending a dot when renaming the file (that is then automatically removed afterwards), using alternative file managers, or saving a <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> desired filename from within an application.|$|E
25|$|A {{common mistake}} of early FTP administrators was to permit a {{directory}} named /incoming that allows full {{read and write}} access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in {{and go to a}} location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> message inside.|$|E

25|$|When not {{properly}} implemented, continuous auditing {{can result in}} hundreds—even thousands—of false positives and wasted effort. Many companies that have experienced success with continuous auditing recommend that you start small. Select which area of the company poses the greatest risk and where its transactions and control systems are most important to the company for your initial foray into continuous auditing. Automate {{a small number of}} key initial tests, such as comparing your accounts payable vendor master <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> employee address file, to uncover potential policy violations or fraud.

25|$|Police {{followed}} a lead in which Muhammad or Malvo {{left a note}} {{at one of the}} shootings to tell the police to investigate a liquor store robbery-murder that had occurred in Montgomery, Alabama. Investigators responding to that crime scene found one of the suspects had dropped a magazine with his fingerprints on it; these were subsequently identified as belonging to a 17-year-old Jamaican illegal immigrant, Lee Boyd Malvo, whose prints were on <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> INS. Malvo was known to associate with Muhammad. They had lived together in Tacoma, Washington, for around one year, where Malvo used the alias John Lee Malvo.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} date of the {{shooting}} match, Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward. A certificate is currently on <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Archives of Ontario, Registration Number 49594, reporting Butler and Oakley being wed on June 20, 1882, in Windsor, Ontario. Many sources say that the marriage took place on August 23, 1876, in Cincinnati, {{yet there is no}} recorded certificate to validate that date. A possible reason for the contradicting dates may be that Butler's divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876. An 1880 U.S. Federal Census record shows Saunders as married. Sources mentioning Butler's first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate; Elizabeth was actually his granddaughter, her father being Edward F. Butler. Throughout Oakley's show-business career, the public was often led to believe that she was five to six years younger than her actual age. Claiming the later marriage date would have better supported her fictional age.|$|E

25|$|On 8 September 2015, it was {{reported}} that Lockheed Martin would protest the award; on the same day it was also disclosed that AM General had decided not to file a protest. Any work that would be performed under the contract stopped during the review period. On 15 December 2015 the Government Accountability Office GAO dismissed Lockheed Martin's protest because the company on 11 December 2015 decided to file a “Notice of Post-Award Bid Protest” with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims; according to a source with knowledge of the procedures, it is uncommon for a company to <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> court close to a GAO protest decision. Immediately after the GAO dismissed the protest, the Army instructed Oshkosh to resume work on the JLTV order. Lockheed Martin filed a preliminary injunction on 17 December, stating that new Army-supplied information related to the contract emerged {{toward the end of the}} GAO's protest process that was not considered before their ruling and no deadline extension was granted. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims denied Lockheed Martin's request to stop work while the lawsuit was pending, allowing Oshkosh to continue work during the process. The company withdrew its protest in the Court of Federal Claims on 17 February 2016.|$|E

500|$|Members of {{the hearing}} panel met with Robb prior to the hearing to review the {{contents}} of Oppenheimer's FBI file. The 1946 Administrative Procedure Act included a legal principle known as [...] "the exclusivity of the record" [...] or the [...] "blank pad rule". This meant that a hearing could only consider information that had been formally presented under the established rules of evidence. However, while the act applied to the courts and to administrative hearings held by agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission, it {{did not apply to}} the AEC.

500|$|An {{unpublished}} manuscript on <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Montana State Historical Society describes life in Basin between 1906 and 1910 {{in great}} detail. Two railroads, the Northern Pacific {{on the north}} side of the Boulder River, and the Great Northern on the south side, served the city; both had depots and warehouses in Basin and carried passengers as well as freight. The Glass brothers' smelter had been set up {{on the north side}} to process concentrated ore delivered by rail from out of town or from the mills on the south side. Infrastructure included a weight scale for ore cars and an overhead tram to carry ore across the river from the reduction mill to the smelter. Although the smelter was a [...] "massive unit" [...] equipped with furnaces, conveyors, and machinery ready for operation, it [...] "never turned a wheel".|$|E

500|$|As {{the private}} equity {{industry}} expanded through 2006 and 2007, {{several of the}} largest private equity firms, most notably The Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, announced plans to realize value from their firms through the sale of shares in the public equity markets. [...] Apollo Management chose a slightly different path, by completing a private placement of shares in its management company in July 2007. [...] By pursuing a private placement rather than a public offering, Apollo {{would be able to}} avoid much of the public scrutiny applied to Blackstone and KKR. [...] In November 2007, Apollo was able to realize additional value from the sale of a 9% ownership interest in its management company to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). [...] Ultimately, in April 2008, Apollo would <b>file</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to permit some holders of its privately traded stock to sell their shares on the New York Stock Exchange and in March 2011, Apollo completed its initial public offering (...)
