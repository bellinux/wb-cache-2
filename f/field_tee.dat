In the fall the park is home to an adult softball league. There are four fields located at the park, Field 1 for senior league baseball, <b>Field</b> 2 for <b>tee</b> ball, and softball, Field 3 for age groups up to 12 playing baseball, and Field 4 which is primarily a softball field.|$|R
30|$|The {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} CVS are endarteritis obliterans of the vasa vasorum with chronic inflammatory infiltration, ischemic necrosis, and fibrosis of the tunica media, {{and this is}} different from atherosclerotic findings [4]. The pathological results of our case were compatible with these findings and determined to be CVS. Since the preoperative RPR and TPHA tests were positive, antibiotics were administered, {{but we did not}} recognize the CVS until the pathological results were reported, as has been previously reported [9, 10]. Cheng [10] has stated, “syphilitic aortitis is dying but not dead,” and Roberts et al. [9] have stated, “cardiovascular syphilis has not disappeared” as well. Additionally, CVS has various characteristic features such as aneurysms and stenotic changes. In our case, computed tomography (CT) was not performed because his hemodynamics were unstable and we did not strongly suspect CVS. If CVS was suspected, CT may be performed before surgery to rule out aortic aneurysms. However, any obvious aortic aneurysms were not detected in the operative <b>field</b> or intraoperative <b>TEE.</b>|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic {{growth rate}} of Helopeltis antonii Sign. (Hemip- tera; Miridae) on cucumberfruit as an alternativefoodThe study on the intinsic rate of natural {{increase}} of Helopeltis antonii Sign. On cucumber ruit as an alternative food was conducted in the pest and disease Laboratory, Research Institute for Spice and Medicinal Crops Bogor rom January o June 1998. Helopeltis antonii is well known as the pest of cashew, cacao and tea The objectives of the experiment wee to study the reproduction rate and fecundity of H antonii. The insects were collected from the <b>field</b> of cashew <b>tees</b> in Bogor. A pair of newly emerged adult was eleased into a plastic jar containing cucumber fruit. The fruit was changed daily until the insects died. A newly emerged nymph was eaed individually in a plastic cup containing a peace of cucumber ruit which was renew every 2 days. Birch exponential equation: N,=No. e" was used for analyzing data. The results showed that intrinsic rate (r) of//, antonii was 0. 106. Net eproduction rate (Rn) was 18. 952 times for each generation. The generation period was 27. 747 days. The value of finite rate of increase was 1. 1 12 times/day. After one month and two months a pair of insect would multiply to 24 and 578 pairs, espectively...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) {{is an excellent}} modality for real-time visualization {{of the heart and}} monitoring of interventions. To improve the usability of 3 -D TEE for intervention monitoring and catheter guidance, automated segmentation is desired. However, 3 -D TEE segmentation is still a challenging task due to the complex anatomy with multiple cavities, the limited <b>TEE</b> <b>field</b> of view, and typical ultrasound artifacts. We propose to segment all cavities within the TEE view with a multi-cavity active shape model (ASM) in conjunction with a tissue/blood classification based on a gamma mixture model (GMM). 3 -D TEE image data of twenty patients were acquired with a Philips X 7 - 2 t matrix TEE probe. Tissue probability maps were estimated by a two-class (blood/tissue) GMM. A statistical shape model containing the left ventricle, right ventricle, left atrium, right atrium, and aorta was derived from computed tomography angiography (CTA) segmentations by principal component analysis. ASMs of the whole heart and individual cavities were generated and consecutively fitted to tissue probability maps. First, an average whole-heart model was aligned with the 3 -D TEE based on three manually indicated anatomical landmarks. Second, pose and shape of the whole-heart ASM were fitted by a weighted update scheme excluding parts outside of the image sector. Third, pose and shape of ASM for individual heart cavities were initialized by the previous whole heart ASM and updated in a regularized manner to fit the tissue probability maps. The ASM segmentations were validated against manual outlines by two observers and CTA derived segmentations...|$|R
