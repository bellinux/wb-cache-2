The march moved from Lahore to Islamabad between 14 and 17 January 2013 and was organised by the Pakistani Sufi scholar Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. On 17 January, the government came for negotiations and struck and agreement which was termed the <b>Islamabad</b> Long March <b>Declaration,</b> that ended the protest.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{have charged}} that the protests were a ploy by the Pakistan Armed Forces to delay {{elections}} and weaken {{the influence of the}} civilian government, citing Qadri's close ties to the military, dual nationality and suspect foreign and Pakistani sources of funding. Lawyers for the Supreme Court of Pakistan claimed that Qadri's demands are unfeasible because they conflict with the Constitution of Pakistan. The Tribune reported on 17 February 2013, that Qadri seemed to have capitulated on most of his demands in the <b>Islamabad</b> Long March <b>Declaration.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Islamabad</b> Long March <b>Declaration</b> {{was signed}} by Prime Minister Raja Parvez Ashraf {{following}} {{the appointment of a}} 10-member committee to negotiate with Qadri. Qadri accepted the agreement after he issued a second ultimatum from his bullet-proof mobile quarters. The government's decision to proceed with the negotiation arose from fear that inclement weather would lead to deaths among those picketing the parliament. The government's negotiation committee was led by former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and included members from all parties in the governing coalition, including PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Fahim and Law Minister Farooq H. Naek.|$|R

Qadri called for a [...] "million-men" [...] march in Islamabad to protest against the government's corruption. On 14 January 2013, a crowd marched down the city's main avenue. Thousands of people pledged to sit-in until their demands were met. When he started the long march from Lahore about 25,000 people were with him. He told the rally in front of parliament: [...] "There is no Parliament; there {{is a group of}} looters, thieves and dacoits bandits ... Our lawmakers are the lawbreakers.". After four days of sit-in, the Government and Qadri signed an agreement called the <b>Islamabad</b> Long March <b>Declaration,</b> which promised electoral reforms and increased political transparency. Although Qadri called for a [...] "million-men" [...] march, the estimated total present for the sit-in in Islamabad was 50,000 according to the government.|$|R
