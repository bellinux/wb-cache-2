5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we {{consider}} non-linear <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> that naturally possess multidimensional alphabets, according to Lemma 5 needed to avoid catastrophic parameters. We will {{conclude that the}} considered <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> avoid catastrophic parameters and are close to meet the UMP condition. We propose and use simple scalar alphabet parametrization easy to meet the UMP condition. Based on the error simulations, {{we will find that}} existence of catastrophic parameters is much more detrimental than not being UMP. In case of <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> (without catastrophic parameters), UMP alphabets are important since according to Remark 11, they form a performance benchmark.|$|R

40|$|Most Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) {{localization}} {{methods can}} generate gradient vibrations at acoustic frequencies and/or magnetic field oscillation, {{which can cause}} a time-varying magnetic field superimposed onto the static one. This effect can produce <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> of the spectral resonances. When localized MRS data are acquired without water suppression, the associated <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> are manifested as a manifold of spurious peaks, called sidebands, which occur symmetrically around the water resonance. These sidebands can be larger than the small metabolite resonances and can present {{a problem for the}} quantitation of the spectra, especially at short echo times. Furthermore, the resonance lineshapes may be distorted if any low <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> are present. A simple solution is presented which consists of selecting the modulus of the acquired Free Induction Decay (FID) signal. Since the <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> affect only the phase of the FID signal, the obtained real spectrum of the modulus is free from the spurious peaks where quantitative results may be directly obtained. Using this method, the distortions caused by the sidebands are removed. This is demonstrated by processing proton MRS spectra acquired without water suppression collected from a phantom containing metabolites at concentrations comparable t...|$|R

25|$|In telecommunications, <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (FM) conveys {{information}} over {{a carrier}} wave by varying its frequency. While {{working in the}} basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong invented wide-band <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied {{the frequency of the}} wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.|$|E

30|$|Non-linear <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> FSK and full-response {{continuous}} phase modulation (CPM) naturally comprise multiple complex dimensions needed to obey UMP condition. We optimize a scalar parameters of FSK (modulation index) and full-response CPM (frequency pulse shape) to yield UMP alphabets. We {{find that a}} lower modulation index (proportional to bandwidth) than that leading to complex-orthogonal alphabet fulfills UMP condition. Numerical simulations conclude that the considered <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> do not have catastrophic parameters and perform close to the utmost UMP alphabets which however require more bandwidth.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{local field}} {{potential}} (LFP) is a population measure, mainly reflecting local synaptic activity. Beta oscillations (12 - 40 Hz) occur in motor cortical LFPs, but their functional relevance remains controversial. Power modulation studies have related beta oscillations to a "resting" motor cortex, postural maintenance, attention, sensorimotor binding and planning. <b>Frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> were largely overlooked. We here describe context-related beta <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> in motor cortical LFPs. Two monkeys performed a reaching task with 2 delays. The first delay demanded attention in time in expectation {{of the visual}} spatial cue, whereas the second delay involved visuomotor integration and movement preparation. The frequency in 2 beta bands (around 20 and 30 Hz) was systematically 2 - 5 Hz lower during cue expectancy than during visuomotor integration and preparation. Furthermore, the frequency was directionally selective during preparation, with about 3 Hz difference between preferred and nonpreferred directions. Direction decoding with frequency gave similar accuracy as with beta power, and decoding accuracy improved significantly when combining power and frequency, suggesting that frequency might provide an additional signal for brain-machine interfaces. In conclusion, multiple beta bands coexist in motor cortex, and <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> within each band are as behaviorally meaningful as power modulations, reflecting the changing behavioral context and the movement direction during preparation...|$|R

40|$|Neurological {{case studies}} and {{qualitative}} measurements suggest that regions within human extrastriate cortex are specialized for different perceptual functions, including color. However, {{there are few}} quantitative measurements of human extrastriate color specializations. We studied the chromatic and temporal responses in several different clusters of human visual field maps using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Contrast response functions were measured for luminance [(L � M) -cone], red–green [(L � M) -cone] and blue– yellow (S-cone) modulations at various temporal frequencies. In primary visual cortex (V 1), temporal responsivities to luminance and red–green modulations are approximately constant up to 10 Hz, but responsivities to blue–yellow modulations decrease significantly. In ventraloccipitalcortex(VO),allcolorselicitstrongresponses,and,foreachcolor,lowtemporalfrequencymodulationsaremoreeffective than high temporal <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations.</b> Hence, VO represents {{the full range of}} color information but does not respond well to rapid modulations.
