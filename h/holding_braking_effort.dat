30|$|Minimum {{pneumatic}} braking: in this region, {{the electric}} <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> {{is limited to}} a maximum value, often related to the motor currents. If a higher <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> is required, then the pneumatic brake is activated to supply the difference.|$|R
5000|$|Braking was tremendously {{improved}} on Standards, as electropneumatic brakes synchronized the <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> {{of every}} {{car in the}} train to provide a faster braking response. This newer type of braking, WABCO schedule AMUE, would be standard in New York's subways through the 1930s, and lasted in limited quantity until as late as 1977 (when the R1-R9s, {{the last of the}} prewar cars, were retired from service). Additionally, a [...] "Variable Load" [...] feature automatically adjusted each car's <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> to compensate for uneven passenger loads in different cars throughout the train. The result was a smooth, uniform <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> that increased passenger comfort.|$|R
5000|$|The ride's layout {{consists}} of two vertical spikes, one twisted and the other straight vertical with a <b>holding</b> <b>brake,</b> connected by a launch and station tract to form a basic [...] "U" [...] layout. The original ride began with riders being launched forward {{by the use of}} linear induction motors. After the initial launch, the train heads up the twisted vertical spike that twists the train 180 degrees. The train then falls and is launched backwards up the vertical spike. It shuttles back and forth three times. On the final full speed launch in reverse the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> {{at the top of the}} vertical rear spike engages, locking the train in place for a very brief moment. The modern day ride is more or less the same, however the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> is no longer operational. Valleyfair's Steel Venom is currently the only Intamin Impulse Coaster in the United States operating with the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> still functional.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} be {{properly}} performed, the driver must have excellent sense of the vehicle's behavior {{and be able to}} keep the <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> within very tight limits. Excessive <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> may result in the vehicle heavily understeering, or - if the brake bias is set to nearly neutral - in the rear wheels locking, effectively causing the vehicle to spin as in a handbrake turn.|$|R
5000|$|Active brake bias, where {{individual}} wheel <b>brake</b> <b>effort</b> is adjusted in {{real time}} to maintain vehicle stability ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Braking</b> <b>effort</b> is {{proportional}} to the product of the magnetic strength of the field windings, multiplied by that of the armature windings.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaders are}} all the animals {{in front of the}} wheelers. As they are also in front of the pole or shafts they cannot provide any <b>braking</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
5000|$|EBA is {{designed}} to detect such [...] "panic stops" [...] and apply maximum <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> within milliseconds. It interprets braking behaviour by assessing the rate that the brake pedal is activated.|$|R
5000|$|An {{electronic}} {{system designed to}} recognise emergency braking operation and automatically enhance <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> improves vehicle and occupant safety, and can reduce stopping distances by up to 70 ft at 125 mph ...|$|R
5000|$|Power off <b>brakes</b> stop or <b>hold</b> a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of <b>holding</b> <b>brakes.</b> The first is spring applied brakes. The second is permanent magnet brakes.|$|R
50|$|A vacuum servo is a {{component}} used on motor vehicles in their braking system, {{to provide assistance}} to the driver by decreasing the <b>braking</b> <b>effort.</b> In the US it is commonly called a brake booster.|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, {{it is first necessary}} to {{determine the}} tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the front suspension linkage and half is being transmitted through the front suspension springs.|$|R
50|$|A pure brake by wire {{system would}} {{eliminate}} the need for hydraulics completely by using motors to actuate calipers, in comparison to the currently existing technology where the system is designed to provide <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> by building hydraulic pressure in the brake lines.|$|R
50|$|The first {{installation}} in the United States was Superman: Ultimate Escape at Six Flags Ohio in Aurora, Ohio. Built in 2000, {{it was the}} first Intamin Impulse roller coaster to feature a vertical twist and a <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> on the rear tower. The largest installation, Wicked Twister built in 2002 at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, did away with the straight section containing the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> and instead had a second twisting tower. V2: Vertical Velocity at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California originally had the twisted front and vertical rear towers when it was built in 2001. However, upon discovery of breaking the 150 ft. height restriction in the Vallejo area, the ride was altered to have a front section slanting at 45 degrees into an inline roll which ended with a straightaway, and the rear tower was lowered to the 150 ft height limit. The <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> was also turned off, and has not been used since. V2: Vertical Velocity reopened in 2002, and is unique among Inverted Impulse roller coasters for being the only one with a true inversion. In 2004, Superman: Ultimate Escape was renamed to Steel Venom after Six Flags sold Six Flags Worlds of Adventure (which Six Flags Ohio had been renamed to after merging with adjacent SeaWorld Ohio in 2001) to Cedar Fair and the park reverted to its original name Geauga Lake. It operated under that name until the end of Geauga Lake's 2006 season and then was moved to Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. In 2008 the ride opened under the name Voodoo but was changed to Possessed the following year. The ride continues to operate at Dorney Park {{and is one of the}} few Inverted Impulse Roller Coasters that has, and still uses, the vertical <b>holding</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{brake shoe}} carries the brake lining, which is riveted or {{glued to the}} shoe. When the brake is applied, the shoe moves and presses the lining against {{the inside of the}} drum. The {{friction}} between lining and drum provides the <b>braking</b> <b>effort.</b> Energy is dissipated as heat.|$|R
5000|$|Mountain bike {{suspension}} {{technology has}} made great advances since first {{appearing in the}} early 1990s. Early full suspension frames were heavy and tended to bounce up and down while a rider pedaled. This movement was called pedal bob, kickback, or monkey motion and took power out of a rider's pedal stroke [...] - [...] especially during climbs up steep hills. Input from hard <b>braking</b> <b>efforts</b> also negatively affected early full suspension designs. When a rider hit the brakes, these early suspensions compressed into their travel and lost some {{of their ability to}} absorb bumps. This happened in situations where the rear suspension was needed most. When <b>braking</b> <b>efforts</b> cause the suspension to compress it is referred to as brake squat, when braking causes the suspension to extend it is called brake jack.|$|R
30|$|Pneumatic braking {{increases}} to supply insufficient electric power: as speed increases, {{the performances of}} the motor drive system are insufficient to manage the corresponding power requirements, limiting the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> to the associated iso-power curve. As a consequence, {{the contribution of the}} pneumatic braking power tends to increase with speed.|$|R
50|$|Murray's Corner is {{the final}} corner before Pit Straight and the lowest point of the circuit. It is a 90-degree left hand turn, and is a good {{overtaking}} spot as drivers <b>hold</b> <b>braking</b> duels for the corner. It was previously called Pit Corner before Bill Murray crashed his Hudson racing car there in 1946.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there was}} no clear {{technical}} solution to the problem, because {{of the necessity of}} achieving a reasonably uniform rate of <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> throughout a train, and because of the necessity to add and remove vehicles from the train at frequent points on the journey. (At these dates, unit trains were a rarity).|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} 3 {{different}} types of brake tester {{used to calculate the}} <b>braking</b> <b>efforts</b> and efficiencies of a motor vehicle. Roller brake testers, which consist of a chassis with a driven roller system; plate brake testers, which consist of 2 parallel measuring plates, and decelerometers which are usually hand held devices.|$|R
50|$|The <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> {{achievable}} was limited, and {{an early}} development was {{the application of a}} steam brake to locomotives, where boiler pressure could be applied to brake blocks on the locomotive wheels. It was also unreliable, as the application of brakes by guards depended upon them hearing and responding quickly to a whistle for brakes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of diesel locomotives, a {{purpose-built}} brake tender was attached to the locomotive to increase <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> when hauling unfitted trains. The brake tender was low, so that the driver could still see the line and signals ahead if the brake tender was propelled (pushed) ahead of the locomotive, which was often the case.|$|R
50|$|This {{had been}} the case until 2004 for the Ocean as well, but the {{introduction}} of the Renaissance cars on the Ocean resulted in both trains operating separately during the summer months (when trains were longer) and combined during the winter; the reason for this policy appears {{to be related to the}} <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> of a combined train.|$|R
50|$|Two issues always {{added to}} brake power, {{the purpose of}} a brake van: wheels, and weight. Hence, many {{companies}} tried both approaches to improve their brake vans. Brake vans often had a significant amount of ballast, in the form of concrete, cast iron or water tanks built into their structure, to increase the available <b>braking</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|R
50|$|The coaster's single seven-car (28-passenger) train {{runs along}} a 200 m (656 ft) U-shaped track, {{incorporating}} two 185 ft vertical spikes. The forward spike incorporates a twisted spiral, and the rearward spike provides a straight freefall. The 20 m (65 ft) train, propelled by linear induction motors (LIMs), is accelerated {{in less than}} four seconds to 70 mph toward the forward tower before dropping back down through the station house and up the rearward tower. A <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> is incorporated on the rear straight tower and is able to suspend the train momentarily (usually on the final ascent during each ride) before dropping it back down to the station house. However, the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> has not been used since September 2008 due to maintenance issues. The train passes, at speed, through the station four times per 2700 ft ride and is smoothly braked by eddy-current braking before being brought into final position at the station by the LIMs. Vertical Velocity is similar to Steel Venom at Valleyfair, and also similar to Possessed at Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|Riders then queue at loading gates. The {{trains are}} {{unchanged}} from before, but {{they no longer}} glow in the dark. Pulling out of the loading station and approaching the control tower while receiving the safety spiel (unchanged from before), the trains make a 180-degree turn and {{come to a stop}} at a <b>holding</b> <b>brake,</b> and wait for the train in front to clear the block on the lift hill. After a few seconds, the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> is released and the trains roll down a drop into the strobe tunnel. The strobe lights flash at a slower rate, but the frequency rate gradually increases as the train progresses down the tunnel. A repetitive warping sound signifies an energy charge as the riders roll towards a blue [...] (which replaced a mirror). At {{the far end of the}} tunnel, a field of stars appears as the blue strobe lights turn off. As the train starts its 180 degree turn to the lift hill, the white flash of a strobe light is seen. This is actually the flash of a new on-ride photo camera.|$|R
50|$|The Kunze-Knorr brake brought {{together}} {{the ideas of}} Prussian senior surveyor, Bruno Kunze (1854-1935), and preparatory work by the founder of Knorr-Bremse, Georg Knorr (1859-1911). It was the first, continuous, compressed-air brake that, even on long goods trains, enabled the brake force not only to be applied gradually, but also released again gradually. By combining a single-stage and a two-stage brake cylinder with a compound brake {{a significant increase in}} <b>brake</b> <b>effort</b> was achieved.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} the electrodynamic brakes {{can charge}} both a battery pack, {{as well as}} high capacity capacitors - meaning that energy absorbed on deceleration can be reused later on. This feature saves emissions and fuel consumption - if the batteries and capacitors are full, a roof-mounted set of resistors provides the remainder or additional rheostatic braking. The maximum electrical <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> is 100 kN. For additional braking a pneumatic braking system is included.|$|R
5000|$|... the {{existence}} of vacuum in the train pipe can cause debris to be sucked in. An accident took place near Ilford in the 1950s, due to inadequate <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> in the train. A rolled newspaper was discovered in the train pipe, effectively isolating the rear part of the train from the driver's control. The blockage should have been detected if a proper brake continuity test had been carried out before the train started its journey.|$|R

50|$|Soaring {{high above}} the County Fair section of the park, this massive {{dual-track}} wooden racing coaster spans almost the entire {{southern edge of the}} park. The out-and-back design features a very recognizable 560-degree helix at the turnaround point and a first drop that dips 20 ft below ground level. An original design feature was a set of <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> that would perch trains {{at the top of the}} lift hill for a brief moment, giving riders a bird's-eye view before releasing them to soar down the 147 ft-tall (45 m) first drop at a 55-degree angle. Use of the <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> was short-lived and the brakes themselves were eventually removed so that the trains just go right down the drop. The ride was also originally designed to run with a total of six trains; however, that number has since been reduced to four (two per track). American Eagle uses three-bench, five-car trains built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The trains were originally designed with single-position lap bars but are now equipped with individual lap bars and seatbelts, making the trains on both American Eagle and Viper similar.|$|R
2500|$|The SD70ACe is the {{successor}} to the older SD70MAC. Built from 2004 to 2014 in the United States, the SD70ACe was originally designed to comply with EPA Tier 2 locomotive emissions regulations.

50|$|In the {{earliest}} days of railways, trains were slowed or stopped by the application of manually applied brakes on the locomotive and in brake vehicles through the train, and later by steam power brakes on locomotives. This was clearly unsatisfactory, but the existing technology did not offer an improvement. A chain braking system was developed, requiring a chain to be coupled throughout the train, but it was impossible to arrange equal <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> along the entire train.|$|R
25|$|The cars, as built, {{featured}} an old {{style of}} WABCO passenger braking equipment previously used on passenger railroads. The braking schedule {{was known as}} AM(P). Originally, it was known as AM, but the 'P' was added later to distinguish the setup from newer AM types like AML. Therefore {{for the purposes of}} this notation, the P has been included in parentheses – as in Braking Schedule AM(P) – to acknowledge this change. On a train equipped with AM(P), there was no electric synchronization of braking throughout a train, so a <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> took a few seconds to apply or release uniformly throughout a train as different cars reacted to the brake request (which was entirely pneumatic) at different times. Additionally, an operator could not partially reduce his <b>braking</b> <b>effort</b> so as to smooth out stops or correct if he had undershot the mark (a feature known as a graduated release of the brakes). The AM(P) setup required the train to fully release the brakes before they could be applied again. This made making precision stops in stations by motormen a real art, but a task that the majority of IRT motormen proved up to.|$|R
5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience {{a moment of}} free-falling {{with at least one}} near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop, a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop. After a few seconds, the train is released into the drop.|$|R
25|$|Disc brakes {{were most}} popular on sports cars {{when they were}} first introduced, since these {{vehicles}} are more demanding about brake performance. Discs have now become the more common form in most passenger vehicles, although many (particularly light weight vehicles) use drum brakes on the rear wheels to keep costs and weight down as well as to simplify the provisions for a parking brake. As the front brakes perform most of the <b>braking</b> <b>effort,</b> this can be a reasonable compromise.|$|R
