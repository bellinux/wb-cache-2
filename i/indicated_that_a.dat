5|$|Alpha's origins {{were from}} a {{tropical}} wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October20. Satellite images <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity. In an area of light wind shear, the convection increased and Doppler weather radar data from Puerto Rico detected a well-defined cyclonic circulation. On October22, the {{area of low pressure}} organized into Tropical Depression 25, southeast of Hispaniola. Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding. Later that same day, the depression had organized enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha; {{this was the first time}} the National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E

5|$|A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system on the following day <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for several days. In {{the early stages of the}} depression, the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong easttowest oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} autumn 2007, long-rage {{forecast}} models <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> La Niña would develop by December of that year. In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia. Following this, a strong Madden–Julian oscillation phase took shape, {{leading to the}} development of Tropical Cyclone Melanie off the coast of Western Australia and an area of low pressure over the Top End by 28December. Situated over land, the system initially embedded within a disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward. By 30December, it separated itself from the trough and travelled towards the west. The following day, the interaction between the two systems allowed the low to significantly deepen, attaining a barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.32inHg). This strengthening was short-lived as wind shear over the low increased, displacing convection from its centre.|$|E

5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, the NTSB {{released}} a report summarizing {{the findings of a}} study of midair collisions. The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years. These figures did not include the casualties from Flight 706.|$|E
5|$|Marked {{structural}} improvements {{took place}} on October17 and the NHC assessed a high probability of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48hours. That evening, corroborating data from ships, satellite imagery, and scatterometer estimates indicated {{the formation of a}} tropical depression by 12:00UTC. With the cyclone located over warm waters of 86°F (30°C) and within a very moist region with low wind shear, intensification was a certainty as the depression approached Mexico. Uncertainties existed as to how fast the system would move. Some forecast models depicting the system as stalling just offshore for several days, though forecasters <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> steady northward movement would lead to dissipation within 48hours.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August 1939, Wick married Ursel Rolfs (1916–1968) in Berlin. The {{marriage}} {{produced two}} children, Walter (born in October 1939) and a girl, Sabine, born after Wick's death, in February 1941. On 23 January 1941, Wick's father received {{a telephone call}} from Karl Bodenschatz at the Führer Headquarters that Helmut Wick had been rescued and taken prisoner of war. Apparently an official Reuters report had <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 25-year-old Luftwaffe Major, credited with 56 aerial victories, had been interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in Canada. Both Hitler and Göring initiated steps to get confirmation of the report. On 5 February 1941, a telegram from Ottawa informed Ursel that Wick was not interned in Canada. Ursel married the military doctor, Stabsarzt (equivalent to captain) Dr. Gerhard Tausch, later in the war.|$|E
5|$|On March8, a {{circulation}} was observed southeast of Diego Garcia and was undergoing tropical cyclogenesis. By the next day, satellite imagery <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm had formed about 635km (395mi) {{south of the}} island, given the name Honorinina. On March9, the Météo France office in Réunion (MFR) began tracking the storm in its database, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 25S. The nascent tropical storm moved generally to the west-southwest, gradually intensifying. On March11, the JTWC upgraded Honorinina to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane with 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph). On the next day, the MFR followed suit by upgrading the storm to tropical cyclone status while it was passing 175km (110mi) north of St. Brandon island.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, a large {{elongated}} extratropical cyclone extended {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean with a pressure of at most 1015 mbar (hPa; 29.98 inHg). The following day, the low-pressure area became more narrow and well-defined, with its central pressure deepening to 1000 mph (hPa; 29.53 inHg). On October 9, the extratropical system was analyzed {{to have become}} a tropical depression. The low moved slowly to the northeast and gradually weakened before dissipating on October 10. On October 14, offshore observations <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression had developed north of The Bahamas. The following day, however, the depression became less defined and degenerated into a trough of low pressure. On October 16, two ships listed in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. However, since these reports occurred in a higher pressure gradient, the system was not included in HURDAT.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 9, reports from the Leeward Islands of low pressures and unsettled weather <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> storm was forming in the vicinity. The disturbance strengthened into a tropical storm on October 12 to the northeast of Puerto Rico. The quickly escalating storm tracked northwestward before turning towards the northeast, away from a high pressure area building in from the west. Early on October 15, the storm attained hurricane intensity and continued to mature until October 16, when it reached its peak at a strength corresponding to Category 4 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day it passed just east of Bermuda. It weakened as it accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical near Newfoundland {{a couple of days}} later.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7.|$|E
