Based on the baseband pool, China Mobile Research Institute proposed C-RAN featuring a centralized base band unit, coordination, and cloud computing [6]. A software-defined RAN architecture is implemented through the virtualization in [7]. For the Soft Cell concept proposed in [8], the transparent sets of BSs are provided for users.|$|E

The cellular topology has for long been regarded as the most promising way to provide the required increase in capacity. However with the emerging densification of cell deployments, the traditional cellular structure limits {{the efficiency of the}} resource, and the coordination between different types of base stations is more complicated and entails heavy cost. Consequently, this study proposes <b>frameless</b> <b>network</b> architecture (FNA) to release the cell boundaries, enabling the topology needed to implement the FNA resource allocation strategy. This strategy is based on resource pooling incorporating a new resource dimension-antenna/antenna array. Within this architecture, an adaptive resource allocation method based on genetic algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution for the multi-dimensional resource allocation problem. Maximum throughput and proportional fair resource allocation criteria are considered. The simulation results show that the proposed architecture and resource allocation method can achieve performance gains for both criteria with a relatively low complexity compared to existing schemes...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} fully explore {{the merits of}} the multi-tier {{heterogeneous}} network (HetNet) and ultra-dense small cell deployments, the evolution of the cellular network architecture is on the way. Based on the <b>frameless</b> <b>network</b> architecture, this paper proposes the control plane (CP) and user plane (UP) adaptation strategy to improve the system energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, we give a three-step system EE optimization with constraints on the CP/UP adaptation. We optimize the system EE via CP and UP construction and adaptation while guaranteeing the user quality of service (QoS). In the first step, the CP construction and adaptation scheme is proposed through the Voronoi Diagram with EE improvements. In the second step, by jointly allocating the AE and subchannel resources, we construct the on-demand user-centric UP. In the last step, based on the UP construction from the second step, we adjust each UP to optimize the EE performance. This is achieved by employing game theory. Furthermore, we verify the existence and uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium for the non-cooperative game model with pricing. Finally, the system-level simulation results show that, with constraints on the QoS of the users, the system EE performances are improved.|$|E
30|$|Based on the <b>frameless</b> <b>network</b> architecture, {{we propose}} a control plane/user plane {{adaptation}} strategy for system energy efficiency improvement. The constraints for the CP/UP separation-based adaptation are presented {{and the system}} EE performance optimization problem is designed as a three-step scheme. Firstly, the CP is constructed with the Voronoi Diagram to achieve better system EE. Secondly, we constructed the user-centric UP for each specific user and considered user-centric serving set construction by jointly allocating resources. The AEs and subchannels are jointly allocated by the GA algorithm with equal power allocations for different QoS services, while the power adjustments are further handled by the third step with game theory solutions for the system EE optimization. The non-cooperative power adjustment game model with pricing is given and the corresponding Nash Equilibrium is solved with the verifications of its existence and uniqueness. Finally, the performance evaluations are conducted with the system-level simulations. According to the simulation results, the CP/UP adaptation-based system EE performances are improved. Moreover, the user-centric UP construction scheme achieves a better user satisfaction level and access succeed user rate. Hence, considering the constraints on signaling and data transmission, the CP/UP adaptation is an innovative method for further improving the system energy efficiency.|$|E
