Approach: The ejaculates from 2 trained poodle dogs were collected. Effect of prostatic fluid from the first and third <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> ejaculates on cryosurvival of dog sperm was examined. SDS-PAGE analyses were performed to verify whether there were any modifications in <b>the</b> protein patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first and third fractions. Results: When second <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> Dog A sperm were combined with the prostatic fluid from the first and third <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ejaculates, sperm motility index was decreased compared to second fractions were collected alone. <b>The</b> post-thaw motility <b>of</b> Dog A sperm was significantly reduced when prostatic fluid from the first and third <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ejaculates was added. <b>The</b> motility <b>of</b> frozen-thawed Dog B sperm {{did not appear to be}} altered when it was diluted with either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prostatic fluids.

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
