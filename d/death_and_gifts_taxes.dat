40|$|Three primary {{categories}} of legislation pertaining to transfer taxes {{have been introduced}} in the 110 th Congress. As noted above, {{the repeal of the}} estate and generation-skipping taxes is not permanent. One category would make the repeal permanent. (See, H. R. 411 and H. R. 2380). Another category would accelerate the repeal of these transfer taxes. (See, H. R. 25, H. R. 1040, H. R. 1586, H. R. 4042, S. 1025, S. 1040, and S. 1081). The third would reinstate these taxes at lower rates and/or in a manner more considerate of family-owned business. (See, H. R. 1928, H. R. 3170, H. R. 3475, H. R. 4172, H. R. 4235, H.

No. 91 - 614 (Dec. 31, 1970) made {{a number}} of {{amendments}} to the federal estate <b>and</b> <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> laws. The estate tax laws were amended to shorten the period of time for filing estate tax returns and for the alternate valuation date and for several related items. In addition, for income tax purposes, the holding period of property that was included in a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s gross estate and that was acquired from the decedent was altered; and fiduciaries were granted additional means of obtaining a discharge of their personal liability for estate taxes or other taxes owed by the decedent at his death. The <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> laws were amended to require that, beginning with the year 1971, <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> returns be filed <b>and</b> the <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> paid on a quarterly basis rather than annually, which had been the procedure prior to the 1970 Act.

However, progressivity can be obtained through the income tax and the estate <b>and</b> <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> is an imperfect backstop to the income tax.

Professor Dodge makes an additional proposal to improve the generation-skipping transfer tax system, an understudied area of the law. Professor Gerzog 2 ̆ 7 s Symposium contribution draws {{particular attention to the}} legal fiction on which the estate <b>and</b> <b>gift</b> <b>tax</b> marital deductions rely. She would restrict the availability of the deduction to only meaningful economic transfers to a spouse, consistent with a desire that tax results reflect the underlying substantive results.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} have been advanced {{to explain the}} size and timing of intergenerational transfers.

Using estate tax data and exploiting variations in state inheritance, <b>gift,</b> <b>and</b> capital gains <b>tax</b> rates, this paper finds taxes to be an important consideration in the choice between <b>gifts</b> <b>and</b> bequests. In particular, each of capital gains <b>and</b> <b>gift</b> <b>taxes</b> are found to be important determinants of the timing of transfers.
