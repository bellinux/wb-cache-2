5|$|The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) {{rated the}} i-MiEV {{four out of}} five stars for crash safety, scoring 28.35 out of 37. This score takes into account a 10.95 out of 16 rating in the frontal offset crash test, and a score of 14.4 out of 16 {{received}} for the side <b>impact</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fracture {{toughness}} {{is measured}} using a notched and pre-cracked rectangular specimen, {{of which the}} dimensions are specified in standards, for example ASTM E23. There are other means of estimating or measuring fracture toughness by the following: The Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> per ASTM A370; The crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) test per BS 7448-1; The J integral test per ASTM E1820; The Pellini drop-weight test per ASTM E208.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
40|$|Efforts to form this Alliance {{began in}} 2008 to {{showcase}} the <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> capabilities within the southern United States. <b>Impact</b> <b>testing</b> customers can utilize SITA partner capabilities to provide supporting data during all program phases-materials/component/ flight hardware design, development, and qualification. This approach would allow programs to reduce risk by providing low cost testing during early development {{to flush out}} possible problems {{before moving on to}} larger scale 1 higher cost testing. Various SITA partners would participate in <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> depending on program phase-materials characterization, component/subsystem characterization, full-scale system testing for qualification. SITA partners would collaborate with the customer to develop an integrated test approach during early program phases.

500|$|The {{design of}} the Pinto fuel system was {{complicated}} by the uncertain regulatory environment during the development period. [...] The first federal standard for automotive fuel system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, initially only considered front impacts. [...] In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto's development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions. [...] The proposed standard {{was based on a}} 20mph moving-barrier rear <b>impact</b> <b>test.</b> Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard. [...] Due to the confusion related to the various proposed standards and an expectation that the NHTSA would not select the more stringent 30mph fixed-barrier standard, Ford elected to voluntarily meet the 20mph moving-barrier standard for all cars by 1973. [...] Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system safety standard and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 {{after the}} breakup of [...] during re-entry, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board {{conducted}} tests at Southwest Research Institute, which used an air gun to shoot foam blocks of similar size, mass and speed to that which struck Columbia at a test structure which mechanically replicated the orbiter wing leading edge. They removed a fiberglass panel from Enterprise wing to perform analysis of the material and attached it to the test structure, then shot a foam block at it. [...] While the panel was not broken {{as a result of}} the test, the impact was enough to permanently deform a seal. Since the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panel on Columbia had only 40% of the strength of the test panel from Enterprise, this result suggested that the RCC leading edge would have been shattered. Additional tests on the fiberglass were canceled in order not to risk damaging the test apparatus, and a panel from Discovery was tested to determine the effects of the foam on a similarly-aged RCC leading edge. On July 7, 2003, a foam <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> created a hole [...] in the protective RCC panel. The tests clearly demonstrated that a foam impact of the type Columbia sustained could seriously breach the protective RCC panels on the wing leading edge.|$|E
