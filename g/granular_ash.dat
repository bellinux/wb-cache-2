Coal fly ash is mainly composed of some oxides including Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 having active siteand unburned carbon as a mesopore material that anables it {{to act as}} a potentialadsorbent. However, the use of powder coal fly ash as an adsorbent is quite complex, especially in the filtration installation, so difficult to be applied in the industry. The aim {{of this study is to}} carry out granulation of the coal fly ash with the addition of carrageenan as a binder to improve the mechanical and chemical stability thereby increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the adsorption process. Coal fly ash wasreacted with sodium hydroxide solution and then granulated with the addition of carrageenan 10, 15 and 20 w/w. <b>Granular</b> coal fly <b>ash</b> was further characterized its specific surface area, functional group and morphology. Furthermore, granular and powder treated coal fly ash were tested their adsorption ability for ion Pb (II). The results show that the addition of carrageenan as a binder can change the characteristics of coal fly ash, decrease specific surface area and adsorption capability.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of the recycled ash on eruption styles, we need to know (1) the temperature of the erupting magma, (2) the fracturing conditions of the magma foam to be scoriae and <b>ash,</b> (3) the <b>granular</b> behavior of <b>ash,</b> and (4) the permeability of the ash layer. In this study, we estimate conditions (1 – 4) by using ejecta from Aso Volcano. First, we reheat the scoria samples and measure their volume change to estimate the possible temperature range of erupted scoriae (1). Second, we demonstrate the conditions for brittle failure and frictional behavior by deformation experiments with scoriae and ash (2 – 3). Third, we measure the permeability of the unheated ash powder and sintered ash plate (4). Finally, on the basis of our experimental results, we estimate the time evolution of the conditions in the conduit that vary the eruption style of Aso Volcano.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{study of}} {{granular}} sub base stabilized at 25 % fly ash showed better results in CBR and strength aspects. As {{the percentage of}} fly ash increases from 0 % to 25 %, the CBR values are decreasing for both the unsoaked and soaked conditions. For tJhe fly ash content beyond 15 % addition to soil is causing about 50 % to 65 % reduction in the CBR values for both the unsoaked and soaked conditions. The percentage of fly ash increases from 0 % to 25 %, the {{angle of internal friction}} of gravel soil is decreasing. This decrease in angle of internal friction is marginal up to about 10 % of fly ash and. From 15 % to 25 % of fly ash, the angle of internal friction observed is almost constant and its value is in the range of 36 0 to 38 0. Up to 25 % of fly ash can effectively be utilized along with the granular subbase in the pavement construction KEY WORDS: CBR, fly <b>ash</b> <b>granular</b> soil mixtures, direct shear, angle of internal friction, Water Content, % FA, Cohesion 1...|$|R
40|$|Co-firing of coal with waste/biomass in PF boilers is {{frequently}} associated with coarse unconverted waste/biomass particles {{reporting to the}} bottom ash. Accordingly, ash postcombustion may still be active during dry bottom ash extraction from utility boilers. This phenomenon has been frequently observed in plants equipped with dry ash belt extraction/conveying systems, such as the MAC (Magaldi Ash Cooler) proprietary technology. In the present work a model is presented that describes the fate of ash particles from a PC boiler co-fired with coal and RDF during their fall-out from the boiler and during the subsequent extraction on the belt-conveyor. The physico-chemical properties and the reactivity of ashes have been characterised experimentally. The model deals with the broad distribution of ash particles falling from the furnace on the belt {{and the establishment of}} a polydisperse granular bed on the conveyor. Modelling of heat transfer and combustion in the <b>granular</b> bed of <b>ash</b> is accomplished considering two distinct length- and time-scales: at the macroscale the deposited solids undergo transient heat transfer within the granular bed and with the environment; at the microscale ash particles of different size and temperature exchange heat among themselves, equalising their temperatures. Model results confirm that extensive carbon conversion can be achieved on the belt and that the MAC system can be effectively implemented to operate as a bottom ash afterburner...|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the net increase on phosphorus removal efficiency in microcosm WSP in which sludge was conditioned with an adsorbent (industrial by-product) having a high phosphorus retention capacity. In {{order to determine the}} best candidate to condition the sludge, four different industrial by-products (<b>granular</b> bentonite; fly <b>ashes</b> from a municipal solid waste incineration plant; and two types of fly ashes from power plants) were tested for their phosphorus adsorption capacity. Experimental results were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich models. All adsorbents showed a high phosphorus adsorption capacity. Maximum phosphorous adsorption capacity estimated from Langmuir equations ranged between 34. 7 and 74. 0 mgP/g adsorbent, being fly ashes from a power plant and granular bentonite the adsorbents with the highest and lowest adsorption capacity, respectively. Microcosms WSP were set up and the sludge conditioned with fly ashes from a municipal solid waste incineration plant. Results showed that phosphorus removal efficiency increased up to 90 % by adding 5 % of adsorbent (in terms of weight of adsorbent to weight of sludge).

40|$|Efficient {{analytical}} methods for the quantification of plant-available Zn contained in mineral fertilizers and industrial by-products are fundamental {{for the control}} and marketing of these inputs. In this sense, there are some doubts {{on the part of}} the scientific community as well as of the fertilizer production sector, whether the extractor requested by the government (Normative Instruction No. 28, called 2 nd extractor), which is citric acid 2 % (2 % CA) (Brasil, 2007 b), is effective in predicting the plant availability of Zn via mineral fertilizers and about the agronomic significance of the required minimal solubility of 60 % compared to the total content (HCl) (Brasil, 2007 a). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the alternative extractors DTPA, EDTA, neutral ammonium citrate (NAC), buffer solution pH 6. 0, 10 % HCl, 10 % sulfuric acid, 1 % acetic acid, water, and hot water to quantify the contents of Zn available for maize and compare them with indices of agronomic efficiency of fertilizers and industrial by-products when applied to dystrophic Clayey Red Latosol and Dystrophic Alic Red Yellow Latosol with medium texture. The rate of Zn applied to the soil was 5 mg kg- 1, using the sources zinc sulfate, commercial <b>granular</b> zinc, <b>ash</b> and galvanic sludge, ash and two brass slags. Most Zn was extracted from the sources by DTPA, 10 % HCl, NAC, 1 % acetic acid, and 10 % sulfuric acid. Recovery by the extractors 2 % CA, EDTA, water, and hot water was low. The agronomic efficiency index was found to be high when using galvanic sludge (238 %) and commercial granular zinc (142 %) and lower with brass slag I and II (67 and 27 %, respectively). The sources galvanizing ash and brass ash showed solubility lower than 60 % in 2 % CA, despite agronomic efficiency indices of 78 and 125 %, respectively. The low agronomic efficiency index of industrial by-products such as brass slag I and galvanizing ash can be compensated by higher doses, provided there is no restriction, as well as for all other sources, in terms of contaminant levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury as required by law (Normative Instruction No 27 / 2006). The implementation of 2 nd extractor 2 % CA and the requirement of minimum solubility for industrial by-products could restrict the use of alternative sources as potential Zn sources for plants...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleSlow sand filers are {{commonly}} used in water purification processes. However, {{with the emergence of}} new contaminants and concern over removing precursors to disinfection by-products, as well as traditional contaminants, there has recently been a focus on technology improvements to result in more effective and targeted filtration systems. The use of new media has attracted attention in terms of contaminant removal, but there have been limited investigations on the key issue of clogging. The filters constructed for this study contained stratified layers comprising combinations of Bayer residue, zeolite, fly <b>ash,</b> <b>granular</b> activated carbon, or sand, dosed with a variety of contaminants (total organic carbon (TOC), aluminium (Al), ammonium (NH 4 +-N), nitrate (NO 3 [...] N) and turbidity). Their performance and clogging mechanisms were compared to sand filters, which were also operated under two different loading regimes (continuous and intermittently loaded). The study showed that the novel filter configurations achieved up to 97 % Al removal, 71 % TOC removal, and 88 % NH 4 +-N removal in the best-performing configuration, although they were not as effective as sand in terms of permeability. Deconstruction of the filters revealed that the main clogging mechanism was organic matter build-up at the uppermost layer of the filters. The clogging layer formed more quickly {{on the surface of the}} novel media when compared to the sand filters, but extended further into the sand filters, the extent dependent on the loading regime. The study shows the potential for an alternative filtration configuration, harnessing the adsorption potential of industrial waste products and natural media.

40|$|Dredged marine soils (DMS) are the sediments {{and debris}} removed during the {{dredging}} process. In Malaysia, DMS are considered as wastes and are currently not being recycled. Solidification of DMS {{needs to be}} undertaken before the materials can be reused. Soil solidification {{involves the use of}} solidification agents or binders in soft soils to improve the geotechnical properties. This study focused on the development of strength of three solidified fme-grained DMS admixed with cement and bottom ash (BA). The factors that could influence the strength development are curing period effects, water-binder ratio, percentage of binders and percentage of granular admixture were examine. The DMS were collected fkom dredge sites in Melaka and Kelantan, while the binder used were ordinary Portland cement (C) and the <b>granular</b> admixture bottom <b>ash</b> (BA) retrieved fiom a local coal power plant. The standard unconfined compression, bender element and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) test were conducted to determine the improvement of strength, stifihess and leaching behaviour of solidified DMS. The water-binder ratio used in this study was 1, 3 and 5. The results show the strength and stifl 5 ess increased with prolonged curing. As for water-binder ratio, the strength and stiftkess increased when the water-binder ratio decreased. The results show that, high plasticity clay (CH) samples with water-binder (wh) ratio = 1 has the highest strength that is up to 4. 7 MPa. The optimal dosage of BA or granular admixture for effective solidification of the DMS was found to be 25 %. With higher BA dosages strength and stiaess of the solidified DMS would increase till it peaked at the optimal dosage. After exceeding the optimal BA dosage, the strength was observed to decrease rather dramatically. All of the elements tested using the SPLP method does not exceed the allowable limit for drinking water. In conclusion, solidification of DMS with cement-bottom ash improved the original properties of the DMS, with the added 'green' value of partial substitution of cement with an industrial waste product...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. The South African sugar {{industry}} generates excessive amounts of {{sugar cane bagasse}} (~ 25 wt% of feed) as a byproduct during the extraction of sugar juice from cane. Although bagasse is extensively consumed in various processes, a substantial amount remains unexploited. The industry's core business is the production of refined sugar which involves among others, a step of decolourising raw sugar liquor. Activated carbons are well known adsorbents and their excellent decolourisation capabilities have been established since 1800 in the {{sugar industry}}. The possibility of making suitable in-house activated carbons from sugar cane bagasse to aid the decolourisation process of raw sugar liquor is {{of interest to the}} growing South African sugar industry. The purposes of this research study were to develop an understanding on the manufacture of activated carbons from sugar cane bagasse, produce suitable activated carbons on a laboratory scale, characterize them and subsequently determine their sugar decolourisation capabilities under simulated conditions. The application of the two-step physical method of processing was found to be the most effective and feasible route to produce activated carbons from sugar cane bagasse for the purposes of decolorizing unrefined sugar. A semi-batch process was developed whereby compressed sugar cane bagasse was pyrolysed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to the final pyrolysis temperature for a desired hold time resulting in bagasse chars with a rudimentary pore structure. These bagasse chars were subsequently subjected to partial and controlled gasification with a steam/nitrogen mixture at higher temperatures to produce the final activated carbon product. Both pyrolysis and activation were carried out in a pyrolysis furnace that was modified to represent a fixed bed reactor system. The process was designed such that it included a steam supply and a gas cleaning system. Feasible processing conditions were established by varymg the temperature, hold time and partial pressure of steam in the pyrolysis furnace. The bagasse chars and final activated carbons were characterized with respect to surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, methylene blue number, iodine number and molasses number. The optimum pyrolysis conditions were found to be at heating rate of 10 °C/min to the final pyrolysis temperature of 680 °C for a hold time of 1 hour, which gave rise to microporous carbons. Increasing the steam partial pressure and activation temperature during activation of bagasse chars resulted in the gasification reaction proceeding at a much faster rate leading to well developed mesoporous activated carbons having high adsorption capacity for large colour bodies present in molasses and sugar liquor. This was achieved by activating bagasse chars at a temperature of 900 °C for 2 hours with a steam / nitrogen mixture of 1 : 0. 6 which resulted in 50 % bum-off being reached. Excellent powder and granular activated carbons were produced from sugar cane bagasse fibres by the established process with the latter being mixed with refined sugar prior to pyrolysis and activating for half an hour extra. A typical final activated carbon produced in this research possessed a BET surface area of 995 m 2 /g, pore volume of 0. 82 crrr'zg, iodine number of 994 mg/g, molasses number of 700 and methylene blue number of 256 mg/g. High ash content in the bagasse raw material tends to decrease the surface area and pore volume for adsorption of the final activated carbon. Both <b>granular</b> and low <b>ash</b> bagasse activated carbons possess high adsorption capacity to remove large colour bodies from molasses and brown liquor solutions and compare well with commercial Norit N 2 carbon. Approximately 80 % colour removal was achieved using 0. 5 g carboni 100 g brown liquor. The bagasse activated carbons were stable in acidic and basic brown liquor solution and maintained their high decolourisation potential. The ability of bagasse activated to replace commercial activated carbons has been proven in this study. The option of producing both granular and powder activated carbons provide flexibility of the sugar industry to choose between batch and continuous adsorption systems during sugar decolourisation. This research has established that the fact that excellent sugar decolourising activated carbons can be produced from South African sugar cane bagasse fibres. However, more research needs to be carried out in order for the sugar industry to take this project to the commercial stage and it is suggested that a pilot study and an economic study be carried out...|$|R
