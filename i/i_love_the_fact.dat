He once commented: [...] "My father {{taught me how to}} play 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right'.

[...] Smith covered Dylan's [...] "When I Paint My Masterpiece" [...] several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk legend Nick Drake, due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of AllMusic called references to [...] "the definitive folk loner" [...] Drake [...] "inevitable", and Smith's lyrics have been compared to those in Drake's minimalist and haunting final album.|$|E

Paul Mavis of DVD Talk {{was positive}} towards the episode {{specifically on the}} live action scenes, writing [...] "Patchy and Potty are always funny, so it's great to see them slinging hamburgers in honor of their idol, SpongeBob. I particularly liked the gorilla at the end, whipping burgers at Patchy ('You got me right in the buns!')." [...] Mavis also praised the episode calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] because [...] " [...] Krabs and Plankton are strong enough characters, with their own mythology, that they can sustain their very own episode with only a cameo from SpongeBob." [...] He also said the episode is [...] "hilarious (<b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it's a barely disguised version of Rashomon), with an especially funny look at Krabs, Plankton, and even SpongeBob, as babies." ...|$|E

She states of this: [...] "Shakespeare keeps coming my way. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I get to play people who are much more articulate than I'll ever be". Ayola has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and Viola. She explains: [...] "The role of Viola didn't sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense." [...] She has also appeared in modern performances, assuming the title role of Dido, Queen of Carthage at the Globe Theatre in London in 2003, which she described as [...] "a dream of a part". She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure, as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it.|$|E

He holds some sort of high priority status within the Alliance, and on numerous occasions has demonstrated a depth of knowledge in a number of fields one would not expect a clergyman to be familiar with, including space travel, firearms, hand-to-hand combat, and criminal activity. Glass enjoyed this aspect of the role as well: [...] "Though rather mysterious, it was absolutely clear that he had had a very full life before he went off to the monastery and took on that responsibility. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he could save your soul but he could also kick your ass.

During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers, Brown actually injured herself on the rusty bedsprings used as the prop for the show. Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as [...] "Meana" [...] due to her seemingly [...] "mean" [...] personality, and speculated that Nina may have become this way because without William Bell, [...] "she wasn’t at the party with all of the boys, the science boys" [...] and thus developed an [...] "outsider" [...] perspective.

500|$|Contrary to the lukewarm {{response}} to the pilot, [...] "Diversity Day" [...] earned positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode positive reviews, stating that: [...] "Think of the toss-off racism of the original, plopped into a PC-gone-wrong showcase that might be entitled The Accidental Bigot. As when the African-American diversity trainer introduces himself as Mr. Brown, and Scott assures him, 'I will not call you that.'" [...] Ricky Gervais, who was {{the lead in the}} British series, stated that, in comparison to the British version, [...] "It is as good. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that, apart from the first one, the scripts are all original.

[...] Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael shows the office his diversity video the third greatest Moment from The Office. The article particularly praised Michael's line: [...] "Abraham Lincoln once said, 'If you are a racist, I will attack you with the North.|$|E

Bell couldn't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash-up more, and West felt the [...] "choreography on {{the whole thing was}} stellar", and graded it an [...] "A+". Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, when it was all about an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography seemed a little awkward and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added that for her [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−". However, Slezak wrote that it [...] "proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance".|$|E

Admission for the shows was set at £1, and clauses in the contract with each venue stipulated that Clapton's name {{was not to be}} used as a crowd-puller. Shapiro writes that the band had [...] "made great strides" [...] since the Lyceum concert; their set list included [...] "Tell the Truth", covers of Billy Myles' [...] "Have You Ever Loved a Woman" [...] and Jimi Hendrix's [...] "Little Wing", and songs such as [...] "Bottle of Red Wine" [...] and [...] "Don't Know Why", both from the Eric Clapton album.

I went on and Googled “How to break out of prison,” “How to break into a car,” and found these fascinating things, and I just used them. I figured that’s what he would do. I also knew I would fail spectacularly, at least at first. But then I would continue. And I’d get the shit beat out of me, and I would trust the wrong people, and I would do the wrong things. I’d start to feel really good about myself, that I’d figured the whole thing out, and then something would go wrong. I would just keep going until I either was caught or we got out or something happened. That’s what he does. So, I just tried to make him an everyman. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that this guy was also an English teacher, so he was a romantic. He was talking about Don Quixote.

He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the time we got to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three.

500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open <b>the</b> Window. <b>I</b> just <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you {{what the hell is going}} on in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|R

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{typography}} language always comes first. This might seem like a fairly obvious statement to make but to find this harmony between content and form is incredible hard. It was the first problem I came across when I started making books and it stemmed from being both author and designer. There {{is a need to}} achieve legibility but also have a strong visual aesthetic. I don’t think they are exclusive but at times they can be at odds. An example of exploring this balance came about in a project called a ‘dictionary story’. Initially the project started as a short narrative in which certain words from the dictionary became living characters that met each other – “Springs next victim was Lawless who was rejoicing in being knocked away from such a boring neighbour as Lawful. Lawless landed straight on top of Lawn which suddenly became very unruly. After some time Lawn was no longer and in its place sat Jungle, happily spreading its creepers across the page. ” From exploring the meaning in writing it was then applied it to its design. As I came to set the type I realised, by creating two columns, you could have the story running in one whilst the definitions of the words ran in the other. The final element to ‘a dictionary story’ was the typographic illustrations. Here I used the definitions to illustrate {{what was happening in the}} narrative. This project hopefully goes some way to explaining some of my thoughts around language and design. With a dictionary story I was exploring the idea of ‘reading environments’ and what happens when you become ‘lost’ inside a book. I wanted to see what happen if words could take on their own meaning without the help of the reader. I became interested in books because they are the objects that house our knowledge - they are the place where previous generations stored what they knew. <b>I</b> also <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that a dictionary has the ability to say everything that can be ever said, it contains all the stories imaginable but just not in the right order...|$|R

Stockhausen composed Orvonton with de la Paz Zaens' voice in mind, and the composer assigned to him its extraordinarily long text (56 lines) because of the clarity of his German diction (Tariman 2011). The text provides [...] "an analysis of the material and structure of the piece itself, and is also meant humorously" [...] (Nonnenmann 2010): [...] "Orvonton: I am a baritone, … / Layer nineteen has twenty-three tones as sound loop. / In the basic tempo 3.75 each note lasts 2 seconds, / and therefore the loop lasts 23 x 2 = 46 seconds", and so on (Nonnenmann 2010). Later on, this text includes an artistic credo: Each sound is a universe. / But one cannot tell if it is beautiful by the numbers: / that depends on who is counting. / Four hundred and forty Hertz is neither beautiful nor ugly. / Beauty lives. / … / Art music is not honky-tonk low music-hall entertainment, / its number games need moments every now and then for the soul, / that touch, astonish: / time stands still".|$|R
