A space has low effective dimension if the smallest ball {{in it that}} contains a function of variance 1, has no functions with large values of certain ANOVA mean squares. For a Hilbert space defined by <b>product</b> <b>weights</b> we get explicit formulas describing effective dimension in terms of those weights. In particular, for a space with <b>product</b> <b>weights</b> {{it is possible to}} compute truncation and superposition dimensions directly from the weight sequence.

Since then, these sets have largely been ignored since {{a number of other}} constructions have been discovered which achieve a better convergence rate. However, it has recently been discovered that the $p$-sets perform well in terms of the dependence on the dimension. We prove bounds on the weighted star discrepancy of the $p$-sets which hold for any choice of <b>weights.</b> For <b>product</b> <b>weights</b> we give conditions under which the discrepancy bounds are independent of the dimension $s$. This implies strong polynomial tractability for the weighted star discrepancy. We also show that a very weak condition on the <b>product</b> <b>weights</b> suffices to achieve polynomial tractability...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop equations to predict retail product and fat trim (weights and percentages) for Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle. Live ultrasound measurements of the longissimus muscle area, backfat thickness at the 12 th rib and rump fat depth and shrunk body weight were obtained from 218 Nellore steers to predict weights and percentages of carcass retail product, pistola retail product and fat trimmings. After slaughter, carcasses were deboned and weighed and percentages of retail cuts were obtained directly. Measurements taken directly in the carcasses explained 97 % and 36 % of variation in carcass retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> and percentage, and 94 % and 36 % of variation in pistola retail weight and percentage, respectively. Live measurements explained 93 % of carcass retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> and 39 % of carcass retail product percentage. Lower accuracies were observed for pistola retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> (R 2 = 0. 87) and percentage (R 2 = 0. 33). Accuracies for fat trimmings weight and percentage were 79 % and 55 %, respectively. Ultrasound rump fat thickness showed greater correlations with retail product and fat trimmings (weights and percentages) when compared with ultrasound backfat thickness. The weight and percentage of retail products and of trimmable fat can be estimated in Nellore steers from live animal measurements, with similar accuracy to equations developed based on carcass measurements obtained at slaughter. 201...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dairy {{products}} {{are important in}} a healthy diet due to their high nutritional value; they are, however, associated with relatively large greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) per <b>kg</b> <b>product.</b> When discussing the need to reduce the GHGE caused by the food system, {{it is crucial to}} consider the nutritional value of alternative food choices. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} elucidate the role of dairy products in overall nutrition and to clarify the effects of dietary choices on GHGE, and to combine nutritional value and GHGE data. Methods: We created eight dietary scenarios with different quantity of dairy products using data from the Danish National Dietary Survey (1995 – 2006). Nutrient composition and GHGE data for 71 highly consumed foods were used to estimate GHGE and nutritional status for each dietary scenario. An index was used to estimate nutrient density in relation to nutritional recommendation and climate impact for solid food items; high index values were those with the highest nutrient density scores in relation to the GHGE. Results: The high-dairy scenario resulted in 27 % higher protein, 13 % higher vitamin D; 55 % higher calcium; 48 % higher riboflavin; and 18 % higher selenium than the non-dairy scenario. There was a significant correlation between changes in calcium and changes in vitamin D, selenium, and riboflavin content (P= 0. 0001) throughout all of the diets. The estimated GHGE for the dietary scenario with average-dairy consumption was 4, 631 g CO 2 e/day. Conclusions: When optimizing a diet with regard to sustainability, it is crucial to account for the nutritional value and not solely focus on impact per <b>kg</b> <b>product.</b> Excluding dairy products from the diet does not necessarily mitigate climate change but in contrast may have nutritional consequences...|$|R

The general theme of atom-efficient, catalytic processes is illustrated with industrially relevant examples.
