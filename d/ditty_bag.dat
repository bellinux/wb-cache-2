50|$|During both World Wars, {{and into}} the late 60’s, the Navy League {{operated}} numerous hostels and Sailor’s Homes, on both coasts. The Navy League <b>Ditty</b> <b>Bag,</b> (a small gift bag full of clothing, food and sundries) was a welcome comfort to sailors throughout this time.|$|E
5000|$|The thief knot {{resembles the}} reef knot (square knot) {{except that the}} free, or bitter ends are on {{opposite}} sides. It is said that sailors would secure their belongings in a <b>ditty</b> <b>bag</b> using the thief knot, often with the ends hidden. If another sailor went through the bag, the odds were high the thief would tie the bag back using the more common reef knot, revealing the tampering, hence the name. It is difficult to tie by mistake, unlike the granny knot.|$|E
60|$|Life on the Japanese warship {{proved to}} be very much like life in the American navy. There were hours set apart for various drills and exercises. Each day they had to go through the {{movements}} of handling the gun, fighting with cutlasses, putting out a fire, and manning the small boats. They also had to keep their <b>ditty</b> <b>bags</b> and grass hammocks in good order, also their eating utensils, and each had to do his share of cleaning up. Twice a week the ship's surgeon examined each man, to see that he was perfectly healthy.|$|R
50|$|A toiletry bag (also {{called a}} toiletry kit, <b>ditty</b> <b>bag,</b> dopp kit, {{bathroom}} kit, sponge bag, toilet bag, toilet kit, body hygiene kit, travel kit, wash bag, or wet pack), is a portable container—usually a pouch with a zippered closure—which holds body hygiene and toiletry supplies such as toothbrush and toothpaste, dental floss, cotton swabs, deodorant, nail clippers, tweezers, soap, shaving supplies, hair brush, tampons, contact lenses and supplies, condoms, and similar items while travelling {{and in other}} circumstances where permanent shelves and cupboards are unavailable or impractical for use.|$|E
5000|$|Minton, too, saw flawed logic. Unlike Frankfurter, he {{believed}} that boxing generally did not constitute interstate commerce, noting that the broadcasters and sponsors had not been named as defendants by the government, and that the Court was turning Federal Baseballs conclusion on its head. When boxers travel from State to State, carrying their shorts and fancy dressing robes in a <b>ditty</b> <b>bag</b> in order {{to participate in a}} boxing bout, which is wholly intrastate, it is now held by this Court that the boxing bout becomes interstate commerce. What this Court held in the Federal Baseball case to be incident to the exhibition now becomes more important than the exhibition. This is as fine an example of the tail wagging the dog as can be conjured up.|$|E
5000|$|Chief Justice Earl Warren admitted, {{writing for}} the {{majority}} two years later when denying boxing the exemption, that [...] "this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business. Yet, {{if it were not}} for Federal Baseball and Toolson, we think that it would be too clear for dispute." [...] Dissenters Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton, who were in the Toolson majority, were harshly critical. [...] "It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions ...and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a trade or commerce.", the former wrote. [...] "I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of stare decisis into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or tittle from it." [...] Minton, in his dissent, added: When boxers travel from State to State, carrying their shorts and fancy dressing robes in a <b>ditty</b> <b>bag</b> in order to participate in a boxing bout, which is wholly intrastate, it is now held by this Court that the boxing bout becomes interstate commerce. What this Court held in the Federal Baseball case to be incident to the exhibition now becomes more important than the exhibition. This is as fine an example of the tail wagging the dog as can be conjured up.|$|E
