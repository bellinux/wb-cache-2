40|$|There is an {{ever-increasing}} demand for new imaging methods {{that can provide}} additional information about the coronary wall to better characterize and stratify high-risk plaques, and to guide interventional and pharmacologic management of patients with coronary artery disease. While {{there are a number}} of <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities</b> that facilitate the assessment of coronary artery pathology, this review paper focuses on intravascular optical <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities</b> that provide information on the microstructural, compositional, biochemical, biomechanical, and molecular features of coronary lesions and stents. The optical <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities</b> discussed include angioscopy, optical coherence tomography, polarization sensitive-optical coherence tomography, laser speckle imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, time-resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging. Given the wealth of information that these techniques can provide, optical <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities</b> are poised to play an increasingly significant role in the evaluation of the coronary artery in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of various types}} of cancer is rising in the developed world. Detection, staging the disease and evaluating the response to therapy largely depends on conventional <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities</b> such as simple X-rays (chest X-ray, mammography), computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (US). With these <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities,</b> excellent anatomical information can be obtained. However, for many indications, anatomical information is not enough and functional information would provide better answers to the clinical questions of physicians. Examples of functional imaging techniques in oncology are bone scintigraphy, sentinel lymph node scintigraphy, single photon emission tomography (SPELT) and positron emission tomography (PET). These <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities</b> offer only limited anatomical information, whereas they can visualize different metabolic pathways in vivo non-invasively. Recent developments in imaging in oncology are the combination of both anatomical and functional <b>imaging</b> <b>modalities,</b> resulting in PET/CT, PET/MR and SPELT/CT scanners. ...|$|R

25|$|A study's {{choice of}} <b>imaging</b> <b>modality</b> {{depends on the}} desired spatial and {{temporal}} resolution. fMRI and PET offer relatively high spatial resolution, with voxel dimensions {{on the order of}} a few millimeters, but their relatively low sampling rate hinders the observation of rapid and transient interactions between distant regions of the brain.

25|$|Tactile imaging is {{a medical}} <b>imaging</b> <b>modality</b> that {{translates}} the sense of touch into a digital image. The tactile image {{is a function of}} P(x,y,z), where P is the pressure on soft tissue surface under applied deformation and x,y,z are coordinates where pressure P was measured. Tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation, since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination, slightly deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern. Figure on the right presents an experiment on a composite tissue phantom examined by a tactile imaging probe illustrating the ability of tactile imaging to visualize in 3D the structure of the object.|$|E
25|$|The transesophageal {{echocardiogram}} (TEE) is {{a relatively}} good test in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity up to 98% and a specificity up to 97%. It has become the preferred <b>imaging</b> <b>modality</b> for suspected aortic dissection. It {{is a relatively}} noninvasive test, requiring the individual to swallow the echocardiography probe. It is especially good {{in the evaluation of}} AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection, and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during transesophageal echocardiography for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the aortic arch), and the descending abdominal aorta that lies below the stomach. A TEE may be technically difficult to perform in individuals with esophageal strictures or varices.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian {{method for}} deducing the {{structure}} of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the <b>imaging</b> <b>modality</b> in use.|$|E

2500|$|Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) or diffuse optical {{tomography}} (DOT) is {{a medical}} <b>imaging</b> <b>modality</b> which uses near infrared light to generate images of the body.

In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason, it is called a physiological <b>imaging</b> <b>modality.</b> Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.|$|E
