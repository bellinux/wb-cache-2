50|$|Introduced in 1964, the 1A2 system {{represents}} {{a stage of}} <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> development at Bell Laboratories that started in the late 1930s with the 1A <b>Key</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>System,</b> and was an improvement over the 1A1 system introduced in 1953.|$|R
50|$|President Ohashi {{visited the}} United States in 1959 {{to see the}} trends in the American {{telephone}} industry. He found out <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> were already in actual use and {{was convinced that the}} <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> was the next new thing in the telephone market in Japan. Iwatsu had been working on the development of a <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> and the first practical system (with five trunks and ten stations) was delivered to NTT Public Corporation that year.|$|R
50|$|An {{international}} bid {{was conducted}} by the Kuwaiti government in 1967 {{as part of its}} plan to expand telephone services. Iwatsu won the 50,000,000-yen bid, beating strong competitors from England, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Germany, etc. Iwatsu exported <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> to Kuwait. It was Iwatsu's first mass-export of <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{business}} <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> {{differs from}} an installation of several telephones with multiple central office (CO) lines {{in that the}} CO lines used are directly controllable in <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> from multiple <b>telephone</b> stations, and that such a system often provides additional features related to call handling. Business <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> are often broadly classified into <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems,</b> and private branch exchanges, but many hybrid systems exist.|$|R
50|$|The 1A2 <b>Key</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> is a {{business}} <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> developed and distributed by the Western Electric Company for the Bell System.|$|R

5000|$|The 1A2 <b>Key</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> {{and later}} ComKey series (4-16, 7-18, 14-34) had the {{following}} problems which the Merlin System sought to solve: ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> was {{originally}} distinguished {{from a private}} branch exchange (PBX) in {{that it did not}} require an operator or attendant at the switchboard to establish connections between the central office trunks and stations, or between stations. Technologically, private branch exchanges share lineage with central office <b>telephone</b> <b>systems,</b> and in larger or more complex systems, may rival a central office system in capacity and features. With a <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system,</b> a station user could control the connections directly using line buttons, which indicated the status of lines with built-in lamps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} unified {{communications}} {{is tied to}} the evolution of the supporting technology. Originally, business <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> were a private branch exchange (PBX) or <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> provided and managed by the local phone company. These systems used the phone company's analog or digital circuits to deliver phone calls from a central office (CO) to the customer. The system [...] - PBX or <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> - [...] accepted the call and routed the call to the appropriate extension or line appearance on the phones at the customer's office.|$|R
50|$|New {{installations}} of <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become}} less common, as hybrid systems and private branch exchanges of comparable size have similar cost and greater functionality.|$|R
50|$|The wiring plans {{evolved into}} modular {{hardware}} building blocks {{with a variety}} of functionality and services in the 1A <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> developed in the Bell System in the 1930s.|$|R

50|$|<b>Key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> also {{supported}} manual buzzers, intercom lines (with or without selective ringing), music on hold, and other features. The features were provided on a line-by-line basis by {{the selection of}} particular <b>Key</b> <b>Telephone</b> Units (KTUs) plugged into a pre-wired backplane in the central control unit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> are {{primarily}} defined by arrangements with individual line selection buttons for each available telephone line. The earliest systems {{were known as}} wiring plans and simply consisted of <b>telephone</b> sets, <b>keys,</b> lamps, and wiring.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} {{one or both}} ends of the circuit {{terminate}} in a <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system,</b> a well-designed system will have no hold feature on the ringdown circuit unless supervision provides a Calling Party Control (CPC) signal.|$|R
50|$|Included are <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> {{and most}} private branch exchanges. Excluded from CPE are {{overvoltage}} protection equipment and pay telephones. Other types of {{materials that are}} necessary for the delivery of the telecommunication service, but are not defined as equipment, such as manuals and cable packages, and cable adapters are instead referred to as CPE-peripherals.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> {{for office}} use provide access to {{multiple}} outside lines plus an intercom, where the latter appeared {{as if it were}} one of the individually-selectable lines. The Western Electric Model 207 and Model 6A intercoms were designed for integration into such key system multiline installations, providing one or two simultaneous intercom calls respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, Nortel {{developed}} the Meridian Norstar system. This system directly competed with the AT&T Merlin, ROLM Redwood, Executone/Isotec Hybrid systems, Toshiba DK Strata, and NEC hybrid systems. [...] Unlike the earlier Vantage system, the Norstar {{went on to}} be one of the leading <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> in the world. It is visible worldwide with installations at major retail chains, educational environments, medical institutions, government facilities, and many places where <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> are required.|$|R
50|$|This list covers only {{single line}} {{telephone}} plugs {{commonly used in}} homes and other small installations; there are 44 different variations of plugs, including an Israeli version of BS6312 with different internal wiring of the pins, plus hard wiring to a junction box with no adapter. Special telephone sets {{use a variety of}} special plugs, for example micro ribbon for <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
25|$|For {{corporate}} or enterprise use, {{a private}} telephone exchange {{is often referred}} to as a private branch exchange (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched telephone network. A PBX is installed in enterprise facilities, typically collocated with large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the local private <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> and any private leased line circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a PBX or <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> in the office of a receptionist.|$|R
50|$|The Norstar system {{went further}} than the other systems in {{similarity}} to a PBX system such as the Meridian SL-1/Meridian 1 system developed in the late 1980s as well. This allowed blurring the distinction of <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> versus PBX <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> Many features such as Direct Inward Dial, Caller ID, Automatic Call Distribution, and Call Accounting were designed off the larger Meridian 1 PBX, DMS-100 and Meridian SL-100 {{as opposed to being}} developed as an independent system.|$|R
50|$|Iwatsu {{continued}} {{to expand its}} production and export. Kyushu Iwatsu and Fukushima Iwatsu were established for manufacturing <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> and associated components. Iwatsu Seimitsu was established for manufacturing and selling switches for measurement instruments. Iwatsu became partners with Rex Rotary of Denmark and exported ELEFAX to 77 countries. Iwatsu tied up with a Taiwanese company to export telephone manufacturing technologies and start production in Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|Ringdown {{features}} are often {{part of a}} <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> In the wire spring relay key service units of the Bell System 1A2, a model 216 automatic ringdown was used to operate the circuit. In the 400-series units, {{a number of different}} KTUs operate (supervise) a ringdown, including the model 415. In other situations, the ringdown is powered and operated by equipment inside the telephone exchange.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of LSI ICs, also called {{integrated}} circuits in the 1980s, <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> design went from electro-mechanical parts to electronic or fully digital parts. The first key system developed by Northern Telecom in the early 1980s was the Vantage TDD system. Unlike {{the success of the}} SL1 system, the Vantage system did not catch with the business environment and the Meridian Norstar was developed as its replacement.|$|R
50|$|RJ21 is a {{registered}} jack standard using a modular connector with contacts of up to 50 conductors. It is used to implement a 25-line (or less) telephone connection such as that used in the 1A2 <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> The miniature ribbon connector of this interface {{is also known as}} a 50-pin telco connector, CHAMP(AMP), or Amphenol connector, the latter being a genericized trademark, as Amphenol was a prominent manufacturer of these at one time.|$|R
50|$|A PBX {{differs from}} a <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> (KTS) in that users {{of a key}} system {{manually}} select their own outgoing lines on special telephone sets that control buttons for this purpose, while PBXs select the outgoing line automatically, or formerly, by an operator. The telephone sets connected to a PBX do not normally have special keys for central-office line control, {{but it is not}} uncommon for key systems to be connected to a PBX to extend its services.|$|R
5000|$|In telephony, a call may {{be placed}} on hold, {{in which case the}} {{connection}} is not terminated but no verbal communication is possible until the call is removed from hold by the same or another extension on the <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> Music on hold or on hold messaging may be played for the caller while the call is on hold, especially if the call has been placed to a customer service center. Alternatives to placing a caller on hold include virtual hold or virtual queuing solutions that allow scheduled or queue-based callbacks to be made to the caller.|$|R
50|$|The 1A2 <b>Key</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> was a {{modular system}} that {{provided}} flexible solutions {{for a variety}} of telephone service requirements. It provided multiple users with control over multiple telephone lines without the requirement for an operator, system attendant, or receptionist. Each user could select a specific telephone line to place calls on, or to answer calls, and manage those calls by placing them on hold or transferring them to other stations. The system provided options for station-to-station signaling and intercom, and music-on-hold. The control functions were operated directly on each telephone instrument with a set of push buttons (keys) that had lamps installed internally to provide visual indication of line status.|$|R
50|$|The major {{drawback}} to this service was {{the reliance on}} the phone company or vendor partner to manage (in most cases) the PBX or <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> This resulted in a residual, recurring cost to customers. Over time, the PBX became more privatized, and internal staff members were hired to manage these systems. This was typically done by companies that could afford to bring this skill in-house and thereby reduce the requirement to notify the phone company or their local PBX vendor each time a change was required in the system. This increasing privatization triggered {{the development of more}} powerful software that increased the usability and manageability of the system.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, AT&T {{closed the}} Western Electric Indianapolis Works plant, and Trimline and other {{residential}} telephone production was moved overseas. Production of the residential {{models of the}} 2500/2554 telephones were shifted overseas as well, both marketed under the [...] "Traditional 100" [...] brand. The 500/554 rotary phones ended production as {{they were no longer}} needed. A new Design Line telephone was introduced and produced overseas as well, and many variations of single line telephone sets were manufactured over the years. AT&T Technologies kept the Shreveport Works open, and Princess & 2500/2554 business model production continued in the U.S.. Also multiline <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems,</b> such as the Merlin and the Spirit systems were manufactured there. Formerly Shreveport manufactured payphones.|$|R
50|$|NT6X19 {{line card}} allows {{the use of}} older style, neon message-waiting lamps, this feature also {{requires}} an addition card per drawer that supplies the voltage. Type NT6X21 cards serve P-sets (Meridian Business Sets), a special analogue telephone with a proprietary Nortel data link operating at 8 kHz to provide advanced call handling services. For example, a telephone number may appear on multiple P-sets even though each such telephone has only one pair of wires, thus providing a simpler replacement for <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems.</b> NTBX27 cards serve Basic Rate ISDN lines. LCMs are served by a Line Group Controller (LGC) and communicate over DS-30 connections to NT6X48AA interface cards on the LGC. The number of LCMs per LGC depends on traffic: 3-4 LCM per LGC but as few as two where traffic is heavy.|$|R
5000|$|In {{residential}} telephony, {{an extension}} telephone {{is an additional}} telephone wired to the same telephone line as another. In middle 20th century telephone jargon, the first telephone on a line was a [...] "Main Station" [...] and subsequent ones [...] "Extensions". Such extension phones allow making or receiving calls in different rooms, for example in a home, but any incoming call would ring all extensions and any one extension being in use would cause the line to be busy for all users. Some telephones intended for use as extensions have built in intercom features; a <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> for a small business may offer two to five lines, lamps indicating lines already in use, the ability to place calls on 'hold' and an intercom {{on each of the}} multiple extensions.|$|R
5000|$|Centrex obviates {{the need}} for {{separate}} exchange lines delivered to a site for use with a 1A2 Key System or similar, or PBX. Instead, telephone extensions, called Centrex lines, are delivered directly from the local exchange to the user. Some customers, however, still like to use a <b>key</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> for a small office within the large corporate Centrex, in an arrangement called [...] "key behind Centrex". Unlike with a conventional PBX, {{it is a simple}} matter to have extensions at different locations while allowing them to function as if they were within the same building. Newer IP PBX systems also allow phones at any location with a WAN or Internet connection to act as a local extension. Facilities such as Direct Inward Dialing (DID), where individual extensions are offered a direct and unique telephone number for incoming calls, are standard features in a Centrex environment. Stations may also be part of a hunt group, allowing for automatic distribution of incoming calls to two or more extensions.|$|R
