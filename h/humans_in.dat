[...] Greece, a destination country for human trafficking, and other Eastern European countries, including Ukraine and Bulgaria, are countries of origin, and increasingly countries of destination, for victims of trafficking. The United States of America, Great Britain, and Australia are mostly destination countries for trafficking victims, while South Africa and Thailand are both sources and destinations for trafficked human beings.

5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in <b>humans.</b> <b>In</b> the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria.
