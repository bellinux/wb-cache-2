40|$|Although {{recognized}} as an important feature of atherosclerotic coronary disease, {{little is known about}} the frequency and prognostic importance of <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> during primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. As part of a randomized trial of thrombolysis vs primary angioplasty, 178 patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with primary angioplasty. In these patients the occurrence of <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> after angioplasty <b>was</b> <b>assessed.</b> <b>Embolization</b> <b>was</b> defined as a distal filling defect with an abrupt 'cutoff' in one of the peripheral coronary artery branches of the infarct-related vessel, distal to the site of angioplasty. We analysed myocardial blush grade, ST-T segment elevation resolution, enzymatic infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with and without <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> Clinical information <b>was</b> collected for a mean of 5 years. <b>Distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>was</b> present in 27 patients (15. 2 %).

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis {{to summarize the}} association of pre-PCI plaque composition and post-PCI <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> in acute coronary syndrome patients. METHODS: Studies were identified in PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Current Controlled Trials Register, reviews, and reference lists of relevant articles. A meta-analysis using both fixed and random effects models with assessment of study heterogeneity and publication bias was performed. RESULTS: Of the 388 articles screened, 10 studies {{with a total of}} 872 subjects (199 with <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> and 673 with normal flow) met the eligibility of our study. Compared with normal flow groups, significant higher absolute volume of NC [weighted mean differences (WMD) : 5. 79 mm 3, 95 % CI: 3. 02 to 8. 55 mm 3; p< 0. 001] and DC (WMD: 2. 55 mm 3, 95 % CI: 0. 22 to 4. 88 mm 3; p =  0. 03) were found in acute coronary syndrome patients with <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> Further subgroup analysis demonstrated that the {{predictive value}} of tissue characteristics in determining <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>was</b> correlated to clinical scenario of the patients, definition of <b>distal</b> <b>embolization,</b> and whether the percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy was applied.

BackgroundDistal embolization during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) carries a poor prognosis in patients with STEMI. However, it is unclear which plaque characteristics cause <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> after stent deployment. MethodsA total of 71 patients with STEMI were included prospectively. All patients underwent primary PCI within 12 h of symptom onset. After crossing the lesion with a guidewire and performing thrombectomy with an aspiration catheter, VH-IVUS of the infarct-related vessel was performed. Stent deployment was then undertaken without embolic protection. ST-segment re-elevation (STR) {{was used to evaluate}} <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> Correlations among plaque characteristics, morphology, and <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>were</b> analyzed. ResultsThe STR after stent deployment was observed in 11 patients (STR group, 15. 5 %). Necrotic core volume was significantly higher in the STR group than in the non-STR group (32. 9 ± 14. 1 mm 3 vs. 20. 4 ± 19. 1 mm 3, p < 0. 05). Total plaque volume was similar in both groups. On receiver-operating characteristic analysis, necrotic core volume clearly predicted STR after stent deployment as compared with fibrous, fibro-lipid, dense calcium, and total plaque volumes. The necrotic core volume that was best predictive for STR was 33. 4 mm 3, with a sensitivity of 81. 7 % and a specificity of 63. 6 %.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} manual thrombus aspiration in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Background: Myocardial necrosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes {{may be a sign}} of microvascular obstruction, owing to spontaneous or PCI-induced embolization of atherothrombotic material. Manual thrombus aspiration results in improved myocardial reperfusion in patients undergoing PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Currently, no published data on thrombus aspiration in patients with NSTEMI are available. Methods: As part of a prospective cohort study, 70 patients undergoing PCI for NSTEMI were treated with thrombus aspiration (Export Aspiration Catheter, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Histopathological analysis was performed on aspirated material. Results: Thrombus aspiration was effective in 58 patients (83 %) and resulted in a marked reduction of TIMI-thrombus score 4 / 5 (40 % pre-versus 7 % postthrombus aspiration) and increase of the rate of TIMI-flow 3 (36 % pre-versus 66 % postthrombus aspiration).

Atherosclerotic plaque rupture with atheromatous debris <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>is</b> the pathogenetic mechanism responsible for cerebrovascular events due to atherosclerotic carotid disease. Plaque composition rather than lesion burden {{seems to be the}} determinant factor producing rupture and subsequent thrombosis. Histologic features of vulnerability are : a large lipid core, a thin fibrous cap, and an inflammatory infiltrate rich of monocytes and macrophages. In the clinical practice, it is difficult to predict the risk of experiencing a major cerebrovascular events especially in asymptomatic patients. New invasive techniques such as intravascular ultrasound with termography, optical coherence tomography, fotons spectroscopy and elastography have been developed to detect atherosclerotic lesion tissue composition. However, such techniques are difficult to apply on a large scale basis in primary prevention. On the contrary, new serologic biomarkers such as Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein-A, Lp-PLA 2, Interleukin- 6, Interleukin- 12, metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-(a), and plaque oxidative products have been recently proposed for screening general and high risk population.

Background <b>Distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>is</b> common during percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and can induce impaired myocardial perfusion. Several aspiration thrombectomy devices have been introduced to prevent <b>distal</b> <b>embolization,</b> however, with conflicting clinical results. Currently, it is unclear to what extent this variance in outcome can be explained by device-related factors, such as internal lumen size. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study in which patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention were treated with a large-internal-lumen catheter (Diver, Invatec, Roncadelle, Italy). Outcomes were compared with a matched population of the Thrombus Aspiration during Percutaneous coronary intervention in Acute myocardial infarction Study (TAPAS) trial, in which patients were treated with a medium-sized catheter (Export, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). A histopathological analysis was performed of retrieved material. Results A total of 160 patients, treated with the Diver (n = 80) or Export (n = 80) aspiration catheter, were enrolled. Effective thrombus aspiration was seen in 70. 3 % of the patients treated with the Diver catheter versus 81. 8 % with the Export catheter (p = 0. 10) No significant difference was found in myocardial blush grade or electrocardiographic outcome between the 2 devices. Size distribution of retrieved thrombotic particles was similar per device. Erythrocyte-rich thrombi were found in 34. 8 % of the cases and were predominately seen in patients with low initial Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade (p = 0. 008).

METHODS: Mechanical thrombectomy was simulated in a vascular phantom with collateral circulation. Hard fragment-prone clots (HFC) and soft elastic clots (SECs) were used to generate middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions that were retrieved by the Solitaire FR devices through (1) an 8 Fr balloon guide catheter (BGC), (2) a 5 Fr distal access catheter at the proximal aspect of the clot in the MCA (Solumbra), or (3) a 6 Fr guide catheter with the tip at the cervical internal carotid artery (guide catheter, GC). Results from mechanical thrombectomy were compared with those from direct aspiration using the Penumbra 5 MAX catheter. The primary endpoint was the size distribution of emboli to the distribution of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. RESULTS: Solumbra was the most efficient method for reducing HFC fragments (p 1000 microm) was significantly increased using GC. A non-statistically significant benefit of direct aspiration was observed in several subgroups of emboli with size 50 - 1000 microm.

BACKGROUND: Covered stents are intended to trap friable debris and reduce <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> during vein graft PCI, but have consistently failed to improve clinical outcomes in randomized trials. The reasons for this lack of benefit are unclear. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing SVG PCI, and eligible for a FilterWire distal protection device, were randomized to Symbiot or to a conventional bare-metal stent. Postprocedure, the FilterWire was removed, fixed in formalin, and photographed under high magnification. The primary end-point was embolic debris area, measured by semi-automated edge-detection analysis of digital images. Secondary end points were no-reflow, "Filter no-reflow", and <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> RESULTS: There <b>was</b> {{no significant difference between the}} Symbiot and conventional stent groups in embolic debris area (10. 5 +/- 7. 2 versus 6. 6 +/- 7. 8 mm 2; p = 0. 18).

Applying aspiration via the balloon guide catheter {{in place of the}} conventional guide catheter resulted in a significant increase of flow reversal (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Prior to thrombectomy, deployment of the stent-trievers produced immediate flow restoration through the soft and hard clot occlusions, 69. 2 +/- 27. 3 and 45. 5 +/- 22. 8 mL/min, respectively, that was preserved after the balloon inflation because of collateral flow via the posterior communication artery. After deployment but before thrombectomy, no flow was restored when using the Merci Retriever. After thrombectomy, complete flow restoration was achieved in a majority of cases. The Merci Retriever required more thrombectomy attempts to achieve hard clot removal compared with the stent-trievers when the conventional guide catheter was used (1. 5 versus 1. 1). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>was</b> significantly reduced {{with the use of the}} balloon guide catheter...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeThe ORBIT I trial, a first-in-man study, was {{conducted}} to evaluate the safety and performance of the orbital atherectomy system (OAS) in treating de novo calcified coronary lesions. Methods/MaterialsFifty patients were enrolled between May and July 2008 based on several criteria, and were treated with the OAS followed by stent placement. The safety and performance of the OAS were evaluated by procedural success, device success, and overall major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rates, including cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI) and need for target lesion revascularization (TLR). Our institution enrolled and treated 33 of the 50 patients and continued follow-up for 5 years. ResultsAverage age was 54 years and 91 % were males. Mean lesion length was 15. 9 mm. Device success was 100 %, and average number of orbital atherectomy devices (OAD) used per patient was 1. 3. Stents were placed directly after OAS in 31 / 32 patients (96. 9 %). All stents (average stent per lesion 1. 1) were successfully deployed with 0. 3 % residual stenosis. The overall cumulative MACE rate was 6. 1 % in-hospital, 9. 1 % at 30 days, 12. 1 % at 6 months, 15. 2 % at 2 years, 18. 2 % at 3 years and 21. 2 % at 5 years (4 total cardiac deaths). None of the patients had Q-wave MIs. Angiographic complications were observed in 5 patients. No flow/slow flow due to <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>was</b> observed. ConclusionsThe ORBIT I trial suggests that OAS treatment continues to offer a safe and effective method to change compliance of calcified coronary lesions to facilitate optimal stent placement in these difficult-to-treat patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Atherothrombotic {{embolization}} during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) induces microvascular obstruction {{and reduces}} myocardial tissue reperfusion. A variety of thrombectomy devices {{have been evaluated}} {{as an adjunct to}} primary PCI in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to reduce <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> Results have <b>been</b> inconsistent and difficult to predict. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the safety and efficacy of an innovative thrombectomy device, the Rinspiration System, which simultaneously "rinses" the vessel with turbulent flow and aspirates thrombus. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 109 patients at six academic institutions in three countries referred for primary or rescue PCI for STEMI presenting within 12 hr of symptom onset.

40|$|ObjectiveWe have {{observed}} that some patients with isolated popliteal artery occlusions (PAOs) harbor varying degrees of organized clot, {{as suggested by the}} rapidity with which these occlusions are traversed with the Glidewire. We hypothesized that debulking such PAOs by using rheolytic thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and selective stenting (PTA/S) is safe and enables single-session treatment with minimal risk of embolization. MethodsBetween February 2004 and January 2007, 16 male patients (mean age, 68. 9 ± 11. 1 years; range, 54 - 84 years) presenting with disabling claudication (n = 1), rest pain (n = 5), and tissue loss (n = 10; mean duration, 11 ± 8 weeks; range, 4 - 26 weeks) were prospectively followed up after rheolytic thrombectomy and angioplasty and selective stenting of their PAO. ResultsThe mean occlusion length was 11. 6 ± 4. 5 cm. After rheolytic thrombectomy, the occlusions were converted to long stenoses (mean length of 7. 6 ± 3. 6 cm). Self-expanding stents were used in 10 of 16 (mean length of 8. 3 ± 4. 4 cm). Additional recanalizations of occlusions of the iliac artery and proximal superficial femoral artery were performed before popliteal artery recanalizations in two patients. Ankle-brachial indexes increased from 0. 27 ± 0. 22 to 0. 94 ± 0. 13. No case of <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>was</b> observed. Adjuvant thrombolysis was used in only one case to improve runoff. Inline flow to the foot was achieved in 15 of 16 cases. Three occlusions occurred at 3, 6, and 20 months after surgery (mean follow-up, 15. 7 ± 10. 0 months), and two patients underwent successful thrombolysis. The third patient refused further intervention and remains a claudicant. One-year primary and secondary patency rates were 84 % and 92 %, respectively. Two limb losses occurred at 7 and 9 months as a result of recurrent foot infection in patients with diabetes, both with patent popliteal arteries (1 -year limb salvage rate, 83 %). ConclusionsWe advocate debulking isolated subacute PAOs with rheolytic thrombectomy when they are easily crossed, because this enables recanalization of these lesions in a single setting, thus obviating the additional need for thrombolysis in most cases, with seemingly minimal risk of <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> This simple approach is effective and widely available...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Of 47 {{consecutive}} patients {{referred for}} coronary angioplasty, {{the procedure was}} at-tempted in 13 patients despite occlusion of the involved vessel. This included four patients with total coronary occlusion and nine with functional coronary occlusion (faint, late antegrade opacification {{in the absence of}} a discernible luminal continuity). All procedures were performed with an angioplasty system in which the leading guide wire could be moved independently of the dilatation catheter. Primary success was obtained in 54 % (7 / 13) of patients with coronary occlusion compared with 85 % (29 / 34) in the remaining patients with conventional stenoses between 75 % and 95 % (91 + 5 %, mean + SD; p <. 02). In patients with coronary occlusion, the mean residual stenosis after angioplasty (41 %), the abrupt reclosure rate (8 %), and the incidence of angiographically evident dissection (29 %) were similar to those seen in the 34 patients who underwent angioplasty of conventional stenoses, although restenosis tended to be more common (43 % vs 23 %) in patients with coronary occlusion. No evidence of coronary perforation or <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>was</b> found in either group, and no patient undergoing angioplasty of an occluded vessel required emergency surgery, despite one case of abrupt reclosure. All patients with coronary occlusion had prominent collateral flow to the occluded vessel, which could no longer be visualized after successful angioplasty. These collaterals were associated with a higher distal pressure (35 + 10 mm Hg) in patients with coronary occlusion than that seen in patients with less severe stenoses and no visible collaterals (distal occluded pressure 20 + 7 mm Hg; p <. 001). Although the primary success rate is lower than that associated with conventional stenotic lesions, coronary angioplasty can be performed safely and successfully in the majority of patients with coronary occlusion...|$|R
40|$|Current {{treatment}} for coronary stent thrombosis (ST) often lacks satisfactory results and clinical outcome is poor. We investigated {{the impact of}} manual thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on myocardial reperfusion and clinical outcome in patients with angiographically proved ST. We interrogated our PCI registry for patients with a first stent placement from January 2002 through May 2010 who had undergone an emergency repeated PCI procedure and systematically reviewed coronary angiograms and hospital records for evidence of ST. We identified 113 patients with ST. Thrombus aspiration was used in 51 patients and 62 patients received conventional PCI. Histopathologic analysis of thrombus aspirates was performed in 6 patients. Use of thrombus aspiration predicted postprocedure Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow (odds ratio 3. 16, 95 % confidence interval 1. 22 to 8. 17, p = 0. 018) and myocardial blush grade 2 / 3 (odds ratio 3. 20, 95 % confidence interval 1. 20 to 8. 55, p = 0. 020) after multivariable adjustment with bootstrap model selection. <b>Distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>was</b> lower in the thrombus aspiration group compared to the conventional PCI group (14 % vs 37 %, p = 0. 017). In most patients, aspirated thrombus was large and contained platelet and erythrocyte components at histopathologic analysis. Mortality in the thrombus aspiration group and conventional PCI group was 9. 8 % versus 16 % at 30 days (p = 0. 351) and 12 % versus 21 % at 1 year (p = 0. 220), respectively. In conclusion, use of manual thrombus aspiration in patients with ST was associated with greater epicardial and microvascular myocardial reperfusion. In addition, mortality was lower in patients treated with thrombus aspiration, although not statistically significant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to compare clinical and angiographic outcomes between patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to stent thrombosis (ST) and de novo coronary thrombosis. BackgroundThere are limited data for procedural and mid-term outcomes of patients with ST presenting with STEMI. MethodsFrom January 2004 to March 2007, 115 definite ST patients were observed: 92 (80 %) of them presented as STEMI and were compared with a consecutive group of 98 patients with de novo STEMI. All patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Primary end points were successful angiographic reperfusion and <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), evaluated at 6 -month follow-up, were defined as death, nonfatal myocardial reinfarction, target vessel revascularization, and cerebrovascular accident. ResultsSuccessful reperfusion rate was lower in patients with ST (p < 0. 0001), whereas <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> rate <b>was</b> higher (p = 0. 01) in comparison with patients with de novo STEMI. Stent thrombosis {{proved to be an}} independent predictor of unsuccessful reperfusion at propensity-adjusted binary logistic regression (odds ratio 6. 8, p = 0. 004). In-hospital MACCE rate was higher in patients with ST (p = 0. 003), whereas no differences were observed at 6 -month follow-up among hospital survivors between the 2 groups (p = 0. 7). ConclusionsStent thrombosis identifies a subgroup of patients with STEMI with poor angiographic and early clinical outcomes, suggesting that the management of these patients should be improved...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Isolated {{bilateral}} {{profunda femoris artery}} aneurysm (PFAA) is a {{very rare}} entity. Most of the cases are unilateral and occur with synchronous aneurysms elsewhere. Symptoms range from none to limb ischemia or hemorrhage because of rupture. METHODS: We present a rare case of PFAA. In contrast to the general rule, the patient had a bilateral PFAA which was isolated to the deep femoral artery. The aneurysm was discovered after signs of acute limb ischemia caused by <b>distal</b> <b>embolization.</b> The patient <b>was</b> treated surgically with open aneurysmectomy and ligation of {{a branch of the}} deep femoral artery. CONCLUSION: PFAA are asymptomatic most of the time. Surgical repair is always recommended to prevent such life-threatening complications. Different treatment modalities are offered, including endovascular options. The presence of a PFAA should prompt screening for concomitant aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundFemoral {{arterial}} sheath thrombosis and <b>distal</b> <b>embolization</b> <b>are</b> well-recognized {{complications of}} cardiac catheterization but the occlusion is extremely rare. Heparinized saline flushes are used during diagnostic coronary angiography to prevent thrombus formation within the sheath lumen. However, {{the use of}} prophylactic intravenous heparin following the femoral arterial sheath insertion is controversial. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effectiveness of 2000 units of intravenous heparin bolus in comparison to a saline placebo on the thrombus formation within the arterial sheath during the diagnostic coronary angiography. MethodsEligible patients were randomized to receive either a study drug or placebo at the time of femoral sheath insertion. The sheath was aspirated and flushed for any presence of thrombus after each catheter exchange and at the end of the procedure. Five milliliters of blood were extracted and visualized on clean gauze followed by a saline flush. The primary end-point was the effectiveness of the study drug on reducing the incidence of sheath-thrombus formation. ResultsThree hundred and twenty patients were randomized into two arms. Three hundred and four patients were analyzed: 147 patients in heparin arm and 157 patients in placebo arm after exclusion of 13 patients in heparin arm and three in placebo arm because of incomplete reports. The baseline characteristics were similar and sheath-thrombi formation was observed in 20 % of the total cohort. Of the heparin arm, 12 % (19 patients) developed sheath-thrombus formation, whereas 26 % (42 patients) in the placebo arm, p-value= 0. 002. An adjusted logistic regression model showed that the only predictor for the sheath-thrombus formation was the study drug (i. e. heparin). The odds ratio of developing a thrombus in the control arm was 2. 5 (95 % CI: 1. 4 – 4. 5, p= 0. 003). There were no bleeding events observed. ConclusionThe risk of thrombus formation is significant and intravenous heparin significantly reduced thrombus formation during diagnostic coronary angiography, with no excess bleeding events...|$|R
