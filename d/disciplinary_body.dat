5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>body</b> and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E
5|$|The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & Lybrand {{to include}} an {{alternate}} reform proposal in their report, and after pressure from the Law Society, {{and several of the}} larger regional societies, the alternate proposal was used. This was far weaker than the original proposal, and kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required {{that the majority of the}} people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors). The events surrounding this scandal have been directly linked to the reforms pushed through in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which created an independent <b>disciplinary</b> <b>body</b> for solicitors.|$|E

The Comintern's <b>disciplinary</b> <b>body,</b> the International Control Commission (ICC), asked him to explain his unauthorized action. When he refused to do so, the ICC expelled him from the Communist movement on 23 February 1934. A phase of Padmore's political journey was at an end.|$|E

Midwives are trained to assist during labour and birth, either through direct-entry or nurse-midwifery education programs. Jurisdictions where midwifery is a regulated profession will typically have a registering and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>body</b> for quality control, such as the American Midwifery Certification Board in the United States, the College of Midwives of British Columbia (CMBC) in Canada or the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|However, sectarian {{chanting}} by supporters {{has continued}} to incur criticism and sanctions upon the club as well as convictions against individuals identified. In 1999, the vice-chairman of The Rangers Football Club Ltd, Donald Findlay, resigned after being filmed singing sectarian songs during a supporters club event. UEFA's Control and <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Body</b> has punished Rangers for incidents during European ties, most notably Villarreal in 2006, Osasuna in 2007, and PSV Eindhoven in 2011. In 2013, allegations were made {{that members of the}} armed forces were involved in sectarian singing at Ibrox at a weekend set up by the club to celebrate the British armed forces. In February 2015, following sectarian singing from Rangers fans at a match at Raith Rovers, the SPFL came in for criticism for their failure or inability to deal with the issue. The police and courts are taking action, however, as Rangers fans are being charged, convicted and jailed for sectarian behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Big-spending Paris Saint-Germain {{had to face}} Greek outfit Olympiakos Volou in the UEFA Europa League play-offs {{over two}} legs for {{a place in the}} group stages. Olympiakos Volou, however, were {{excluded}} from the Europa League for their involvement in a match-fixing scandal, with UEFA handing the Greek club a three-season ban from continental competition. Differdange from Luxembourg replaced Olympiakos Volou. The UEFA Appeals Body seconded the decision of the Control and <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Body</b> to exclude Olympiakos Volou from the Europa League competition. Javier Pastore provided two assists in his debut to help Paris Saint-Germain take a commanding lead into the second leg of their UEFA Europa League play-off tie against Differdange. Paris Saint-Germain never looked in danger of squandering their first-leg lead as they claimed a convincing win over Differdange to take the tie 6-0 on aggregate and advance to the group stages. However, it did take Antoine Kombouaré's star-studded side more than an hour to break down the Luxembourgish outfit, but Nenê's spectacular strike from distance was worth the wait. Paris Saint-Germain were top seeds for the draw in Monaco and were placed in a testing Group F alongside Athletic Bilbao, Slovan Bratislava and Red Bull Salzburg.|$|E

500|$|The Glanville Davies {{affair was}} a {{scandal in the}} English legal {{profession}} which resulted in greater reform of the regulatory processes for solicitors {{and was one of}} the justifications for the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Glanville Davies was a well-respected solicitor and a member of the Council of the Law Society of England and Wales who massively overcharged his client, Leslie Persons, sending him a bill for £197,000 that was reduced on taxation to £67,000. Davies was not punished by the Law Society's internal regulatory committees, which allowed him to resign from the council on the grounds of ill-health with his reputation intact. Following litigation and public criticism, the Law Society commissioned an internal report that found [...] "administrative failures, wrong decisions, mistakes, errors of judgement, failures in communication and insensitivity". A private member's bill reformed the way in which the Law Society investigated disciplinary complaints, although not to the extent initially proposed, and paved the way for the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 that created an independent <b>disciplinary</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

40|$|While most {{prosecutors}} {{adhere to}} the maxim that their primary task is to obtain just results, {{there are some who}} violate their ethical responsibilities in order to rack up convictions. This article describes the distressing, decades-long absence of discipline imposed on prosecutors whose knowing misconduct has resulted in terrible injustices being visited upon defendants throughout the country. Many honorable lawyers have failed to speak out about errant prosecutors, thus enabling their ethical breaches. The silent accessories include practicing lawyers and judges of trial and reviewing courts who, having observed prosecutorial misconduct, failed to take corrective action. Fault also lies with members of attorney <b>disciplinary</b> <b>bodies</b> who have not investigated widely publicized prosecutorial misconduct. This article summarizes the rules requiring all members of the bar to report unethical conduct. We focus particularly on lawyers who serve in prosecutors’ offices, defense lawyers, and trial and reviewing court judges and their lawyer clerks, each of whom has a personal, non-delegable responsibility to report their knowledge of ethical breaches to disciplinary authorities. In addition, the article identifies reforms to the justice system designed to reduce prosecutorial abuses: (1) substituting for the Brady rule a verifiable open-file pretrial discovery requirement on prosecutors; (2) instead of invoking harmless error, requiring reversal of convictions if serious prosecutorial misconduct is proven; (3) identifying errant prosecutors by name in trial and appellate opinions; (4) providing prosecutors with qualified instead of complete immunity from civil damages for misconduct; and (5) authorizing the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General to handle investigations of alleged misconduct by federal prosecutors. The article also proposes that attorney <b>disciplinary</b> <b>bodies</b> adopt changes designed to more effectively discover and sanction misbehaving prosecutors. Lawyer organizations and bar associations are urged to speak out when prosecutors deviate from appropriate conduct, and law schools are encouraged to include instruction on ethical rules peculiar to the criminal practice...|$|R
50|$|The {{work of the}} Court {{is divided}} into four areas: civil, criminal, {{administrative}} and disciplinary, and criminal injuries. The District Court can hear most civil and criminal matters except for offences related to murder and treason. It also has jurisdiction over criminal injuries compensation claims. In the administrative and disciplinary division, the Court hears appeals from various government agencies, tribunals and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>bodies.</b> The Court is usually constituted of a single judge sitting alone or with a jury (in criminal trials only). In certain cases a judge may sit with two assessors who, with the judge, determine factual questions while the judge determines questions of law. For ceremonial occasions such as the swearing in of a new judge, the Court sits as a Full Court constituted of all available judges.|$|R

40|$|Part I of this Article {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} the Brady rule over the past forty-three years. Part I sketches the origins of the rule and its doctrinal developments. Part II closely examines Brady 2 ̆ 7 s impact on constitutional criminal procedure.

The Article concludes that Brady, more than any other rule of constitutional criminal procedure, has been the most fertile and widespread source of misconduct by prosecutors and, more than any other rule of constitutional criminal procedure, has exposed the deficiencies in the truth-serving function of the criminal trial...|$|R
40|$|Aims A common {{understanding}} of 'rehabilitation' is {{the restoration of}} physical or mental functioning. However, sometimes the concept is applied by professional <b>disciplinary</b> <b>bodies</b> to restore poorly performing health practitioners to their former level of professional functioning. This article aims to research what 'rehabilitation' means, {{in the context of}} New Zealand law. Methods A range of cases were considered to assess what rehabilitation consists of, and when disciplinary boards choose to use it. Where discrepancies between decisions gave rise to questions, further analysis was carried out. Findings It can be seen that the New Zealand's disciplinary decisions do not appear consistent, particularly differing by profession. Nevertheless, a clearer approach is beginning to emerge, one which should become more so in the future. Conclusions Analysis of New Zealand's disciplinary decisions may contribute to the rich international research on professional regulation. Griffith Health FacultyFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|Some {{doctors do}} enter into sexual {{relationships}} with patients. These relationships can be {{damaging to the}} patient involved. One response available to both individual doctors and to <b>disciplinary</b> <b>bodies</b> is to prohibit sexual contact between doctors and patients ("zero tolerance"). This paper considers five ways of arguing for a zero tolerance policy. The first rests on an empirical claim that such contact is almost always harmful to the patient involved. The second {{is based on a}} "principles" approach while the third originates in "virtues" ethics. The fourth argues that zero tolerance is an "a priori" truth. These four attempt to establish that the behaviour is always wrong and ought, therefore, to be prohibited. The fifth argument is counterfactual. It claims a policy that allowed sexual contact would have unacceptable consequences. Given the responsibility of regulatory bodies to protect the public, zero tolerance is a natural policy to develop...|$|R
25|$|Investigations by the party's <b>disciplinary</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{not part}} of the state {{judicial}} system. When an official is detained for an investigation, known as Shuanggui, they are essentially placed under house arrest and are isolated from the outside world. The subject often must endure days of grueling interrogation. Data from the first half of 2014 showed that the conviction rate of those who were investigated in that time period to be around 99%. The CCDI and its local counterparts usually gather evidence covertly well in advance of detaining the subject. Generally, when an official is announced to be under investigation, the CCDI has already collected an overwhelming amount of hard evidence. China scholar Willy Lam also wrote that the CCDI has seen a massive expansion of its powers since Xi's ascension, and that it was increasingly involved in the governance of the state. Lam also contended that the CCDI seemed to be deriving most of its power from Xi Jinping personally.|$|R
40|$|My {{aim is to}} {{demonstrate}} that professionals perceive {{they have a right}} to refuse to provide their services and are currently acting accordingly. This thesis explores whether a professional right to refuse services exists; if so, the limits of this right; and whether a professional 'right' to refuse services ought to exist and in what circumstances. This requires analysis of whether refusals to provide professional services might be considered unethical conduct according to existing codes of ethics and moral theories, unprofessional conduct within the norms of professional regulatory and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>bodies,</b> or illegal conduct according to Canadian law, in particular, human rights law. The issues are examined primarily with reference to physicians who treat patients and some comparisons are made with physician clinical researchers and lawyers. The shift from a duty-based system of professional service to a rights-based system of professional privileges has led to conflicting goals of professional self-regulation, and some possible resolutions to this conflict are explored...|$|R
