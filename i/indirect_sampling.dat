50|$|Noninvasive {{genotyping}} is {{a modern}} technique for obtaining DNA for genotyping that {{is characterized by the}} <b>indirect</b> <b>sampling</b> of specimen, not requiring harm to, handling of, or even the presence of the organism of interest. Beginning in the early 1990s, with the advent of PCR, researchers have been able to obtain high-quality DNA samples from small quantities of hair, feathers, scales, or excrement. These noninvasive samples are an improvement over older allozyme and DNA sampling techniques that often required larger samples of tissue or the destruction of the studied organism. Noninvasive genotyping is widely utilized in conservation efforts, where capture and sampling may be difficult or disruptive to behavior. Additionally, in medicine, this technique is being applied in humans for the diagnosis of genetic disease and early detection of tumors. In this context, invasivity takes on a separate definition where noninvasive sampling also includes simple blood samples.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Establishment of {{reference}} values by direct strategy for selection {{of reference}} individuals is time-consuming and expensive for laboratories. The {{aim of this}} study was to establish reference intervals for thyrotrophin(TSH), free thyroxine (FT 4), free triiodothyronine (FT 3) in a middle-aged and elderly population (age range; 40 - 80 years) on an immunoassay analyzer using both direct and indirect strategies, and to compare the results of direct and indirect strategies. Materials and methods: As for direct sampling strategy, healthy reference individuals were randomly selected (129 male, 131 female; age range: 40 - 80) by questionnaire. As for <b>indirect</b> <b>sampling</b> strategy, the results of TSH, FT 3, FT 4 measurements of all individuals (male, n= 3060 - 3920; female, n= 4090 - 4520; age range 40 - 80 years), were selected from laboratory information system. Reference intervals were calculated by nonparametric methodsResults: The following 95 % reference intervals were determined: For direct sampling group: TSH 0. 32 - 4. 38 μIU/mL; FT 4 0. 75 - 1. 32 ng/dL; FT 3 1. 98 - 3. 65 pg/mL. For <b>indirect</b> <b>sampling</b> group: TSH 0. 29 - 4. 36 μIU/mL; FT 4 0. 71 - 1. 37 ng/dL; FT 3 1. 69 - 3. 32 pg/mL. <b>Indirect</b> <b>sampling</b> group showed a good concordance in the reference intervals for TSH and FT 4 with direct sampling group.

40|$|Objectives : The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{artificial}} accelerated aging (AAA) on color change of direct and indirect fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) restorations. Materials and Methods: Direct (Z 250) and indirect (Gradia) composite resins were reinforced with glass (GF) and polyethylene fibers (PF) based on the manufacturers’ instructions. Forty samples were fabricated and divided into eight groups (n= 5). Four groups served as experimental groups and the remaining four served as controls. Color change (∆E) and color parameters (∆L*, ∆a*, ∆b*) were read at baseline and after AAA based on the CIELAB system. Three-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Significant differences were found in ΔE, ΔL*, Δa* and Δb* among the groups after AAA (P< 0. 05). Most of the studied samples demonstrated an increase in lightness and a red-yellow shift after AAA. Conclusions: The obtained ∆E values were unacceptable after AAA (∆E≥ 3. 3).

40|$|Abstract Aims: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the inactivation efficacy of dielectric barrier discharge atmospheric cold plasma (DBD-ACP) generated inside a sealed package for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Methods and Results: A plasma discharge was generated between two circular aluminium electrodes at 40 kV. E. coli suspensions (10 ^ 7 CFU/ml) in either maximum recovery diluent (MRD) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were treated in a 96 -well microtitre plate inside a sealed package. The effects of treatment time, post-treatment storage time, either direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>samples</b> exposure to the plasma discharge and suspension media were studied. Regardless of the media tested, 20 s of direct and 45 s of indirect plasma treatment resulted in complete bacterial inactivation (7 log CFU/ml). At the lower plasma treatment times (10 – 30 s) investigated, the effects of suspension media and mode of exposure on the inactivation efficacy were evident. The inactivation efficacy was also influenced by the post-treatment storage time. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that the novel DBD-ACP can inactivate high concentrations of E. coli suspended in liquids within sealed packages in seconds. Significance and impact of the Study: A key advantage of this in-package nonthermal novel disinfection approach is the elimination of post-processing contamination...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate if patterns of snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) densities in interior Alaska are influenced by post-fire successional stage. Stages of succession were classified using the proxy Time Since Last Fire (TSLF). I estimated snowshoe hare densities during the summers of 2003 and 2004 in 5 young (10 - 20 yrs) and 5 old (44 - 46 yrs) burns, each with an adjacent unburned control, using <b>indirect</b> distance <b>sampling</b> methods. Because <b>indirect</b> distance <b>sampling</b> has not previously been applied for snowshoe hares, I compared these results with a traditional mark-recapture analysis. Hare density estimates from both methods were not statistically different. I observed that hare densities were not higher in older stands relative to unburned habitat and that hare densities were highly variable in young stands. Therefore, my research suggests that TSLF was not suitable as a stand-alone indicator of quality of habitat for snowshoe hares. Other processes and factors such as fire severity can influence successional pathways and post-fire species composition, creating both temporal and spatial variability in the development of successional stages. I recommend that other covariates, such as fire severity, be researched to address the influence of vegetation succession on hare densities...|$|R

Relationship, vitality, and {{conscientiousness}} {{are three}} fundamental virtues {{that have been}} recently identified as important individual differences to health, well being, and positive development. This cross-sectional study attempted to explore {{the relationship between the}} three constructs and post-traumatic growth (PTG) in three directions, including <b>indirect</b> trauma <b>samples</b> without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), direct trauma samples without PTSD, and direct trauma samples with PTSD. Methods. A total of 340 community participants from Sichuan Province, Mainland China involved in the study, most of which experienced Wenchuan and Lushan Earthquake. Participants were required to complete the self-reported questionnaire packages at one time point for obtaining their scores on virtues (Chinese Virtues Questionnaire), PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Specific), and PTG (Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Chinese). Results. Significant and positive correlations between the three virtues and PTG were identified (r =. 39 –. 56; p <. 01). Further regression analysis by stepwise method reveled that: in the <b>indirect</b> trauma <b>samples,</b> vitality explained 32 % variance of PTG. In reference to the direct trauma sample without PTSD, both relationship and conscientiousness explained 32 % variance of PTG, whereas in the direct trauma sample with PTSD, only conscientiousness accounted for 31 % the variance in PTG.

40|$|Quantifying density {{fluctuations}} in volumes of {{all shapes and}} sizes using <b>indirect</b> umbrella <b>sampling</b> Received: date / Accepted: date Abstract Water {{density fluctuations}} are an important statistical mechanical observable that is related to many-body correlations, as well as hydrophobic hydration and interactions. Local water density fluctuations at a solid-water surface have also been proposed as a measure of its hydropho-bicity. These fluctuations can be quantified by calculating the probability, Pv(N), of observing N waters in a probe volume of interest v. When v is large, calculating Pv(N) using molecular dy-namics simulations is challenging, as the probability of observing very few waters is exponentially small, and the standard procedure for overcoming this problem (umbrella sampling in N) leads to undesirable impulsive forces. Patel et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B, 114, 1632 (2010) ] have recently developed an <b>indirect</b> umbrella <b>sampling</b> (INDUS) method, that samples a coarse-grained particle number to obtain Pv(N) in cuboidal volumes. Here, we present and demonstrate an extension of that approach to other basic shapes, like spheres and cylinders, as well as to collections of such volumes. We further describe the implementation of INDUS in the NPT ensemble and calculate Pv(N) distributions over a broad range of pressures. Our method may be of particular interest in characterizing the hydrophobicity of interfaces of proteins, nanotubes and related systems...|$|R

The novel techniques reported here for sampling, storage and multi-locus microsatellite analysis of larval Schistosoma mansoni, allowing genotyping of up to 7 microsatellite loci from a single larva, circumvent these problems. The utility of these assays and the potential problems of laboratory passage, were evaluated using 7 S. mansoni population isolates collected from school-children in the Hoima district of Uganda, by comparing the associated field-collected miracidia with adult worms and miracidia obtained from a single generation in laboratory mice. Analyses of laboratory-passaged material erroneously indicated the presence of geographical structuring in the population, emphasizing the dangers of <b>indirect</b> <b>sampling</b> for population genetic studies. Bottlenecking and/or other sampling effects were demonstrated by reduced variability of adult worms compared to their parent field-collected larval samples.

40|$|Although the {{discrete}} Fourier transform {{played an}} enabling {{role in the}} development of modern NMR spectroscopy, it suffers from a well-known difficulty providing high-resolution spectra from short data records. In multidimensional NMR experiments, so-called indirect time dimensions are sampled parametrically, with each instance of evolution times along the <b>indirect</b> dimensions <b>sampled</b> via separate one-dimensional experiments. The time required to conduct multidimensional experiments is directly proportional to the number of <b>indirect</b> evolution times <b>sampled.</b> Despite remarkable advances in resolution with increasing magnetic field strength, multiple dimensions remain essential for resolving individual resonances in NMR spectra of biological macromolecues. Conventional Fourier-based methods of spectrum analysis limit the resolution that can be practically achieved in the indirect dimensions. Nonuniform or sparse data collection strategies, together with suitable non-Fourier methods of spectrum analysis, enable high-resolution multidimensional spectra to be obtained. Although some of these approaches were first employed in NMR more than two decades ago, it is only relatively recently that they have been widely adopted. Here we describe the current practice of sparse sampling methods and prospects for further development of the approach to improve resolution and sensitivity and shorten experiment time in multidimensional NMR. While sparse sampling is particularly promising for multidimensional NMR, the basic principles could apply to other forms of multidimensional spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{widespread}} degradation of freshwater habitats, assessing the distributions {{of species that}} may be negatively or positively impacted should be of general interest. However, determining distributions of freshwater organisms that are small and patchily distributed and attached or sedentary is particularly problematic, as it is time consuming, inaccurate, and nearly impossible when the focal species is rare. Here we illustrate the use of <b>indirect</b> <b>sampling</b> approaches to survey {{the distribution of the}} rare freshwater bryozoan Lophopus crystallinus, a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan [Anonymous, 1999. UK Biodiversity Group Tranche 2 Action Plans. Invertebrates, Vol. 4. Environment Agency, Peterborough, pp. 437 - 439. 1. By utilising two complementary methods for sampling bryozoan propagules (statoblasts), namely the collection of debris samples and sediment cores, we achieved an efficient and integrative sampling of habitats across spatial and temporal scales. Analysis of 154 debris samples, encompassing 62 rivers and lakes, identified at least 16 new populations while analysis of 26 sediment cores provided evidence of current or very recent (in the last 10 - 20 years) occurrence in a further six localities. These results represent a more than 10 -fold increase in the current recorded distribution of the species in the UK. Logistic regression analysis provided evidence that L. crystallinus is generally found in lowland sites and is tolerant of eutrophication. Our study exemplifies how integrative and <b>indirect</b> <b>sampling</b> approaches can greatly aid in assessing the conservation status of rare aquatic species and reveals, in this case, that the focal species is less rare than previously appreciated.

40|$|In {{structural}} equation models, researchers often examine {{two types of}} causal effects: direct and indirect effects. Direct effects involve variables that "directly" influence other variables, whereas indirect effects are transmitted via intervening variables. While researchers have paid considerable attention to the distribution of sample direct effects, the distribution of <b>sample</b> <b>indirect</b> effects has only recently been considered. Using the (delta) method (Rao, 1973), Sobel (1982) derived the asymptotic distribution for estimators of indirect effects in recursive systems. Sobel (1986) then derived the asymptotic distribution for estimators of total indirect effects in the Joreskog covariance structure model (Joreskog, 1977). This study examined {{the applicability of the}} large sample theory described by Sobel (1986) in small samples. Monte Carlo methods were used to evaluate the behavior of estimated total <b>indirect</b> effects in <b>sample</b> sizes of 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800. Two models were used in the analysis. Model 1 was a nonrecursive model with latent variables, feedback, and functional constraints among the effects (Duncan, Haller, & Portes, 1968; Sobel, 1986). Model 2 was a recursive model with observable variables (Duncan, Featherman, & Duncan, 1972). In addition, variations in these models were studied by randomly increasing and decreasing model parameters. The principal findings of the study suggest certain guidelines for researchers who use Sobel's procedures to evaluate total indirect effects in {{structural equation}} models. In order for the behavior of the estimates to approximate the asymptotic properties, sample sizes of 400 or more are indicated for nonrecursive systems similar to Model 1, and for recursive systems such as Model 2, sample sizes of 200 or more are suggested. At these sample sizes, researchers can expect <b>sample</b> <b>indirect</b> effects to be accurate point estimators, and confidence intervals for the effects to behave as theory predicts. A caveat to the above guidelines is that, when the total indirect effects are "small" in magnitude, relative to the scale of the model, convergence to the asymptotic properties appears to be very slow. Under these conditions, sampling distributions for the "smaller" valued estimates were positively skewed. This caused estimates to be significantly different from true values, and confidence intervals to behave contrary to theoretical expectations...|$|R
