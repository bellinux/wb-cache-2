To identify occupational risk factors for cancer, a multi-site case-control {{study was conducted in}} Montreal; renal cell carcinoma was one of the sites. A total of 142 cases of renal cell cancer and 2, 433 controls were interviewed in this study. Complete occupation histories were obtained, and a team of industrial hygienists and chemists estimated each subject's exposure to a list of industrial substances. Statistical analyses were carried out to estimate the association between renal cell cancer and each non-occupational and occupational variable. Among non-occupational variables collected and analysed, increased risks were observed for highest level of body mass index (BMI) and a previous history of hypertension. Negative associations were found for tea and coffee consumption. Increased risks were found in the following industries: printing related service, laundries, military, wholesale and retail trade industries. Increased risks were found in the following occupations: managers, plumbers, welders, printers, nursery workers, and aircraft mechanics.

Of the worldwide total remaining petroleum reserves of approximately [...] (about {{one half of the}} original virgin reserves) and a worldwide usage rate of [...] per year, only about 50 years worth of petroleum is predicted to remain at the current depletion rate. Petroleum is imperative for the following industries: fuel (home heating, <b>jet</b> fuel, <b>gasoline,</b> diesel, etc.) transportation, agriculture, pharmaceutical, plastics/resins, man-made fibers, synthetic rubber, and explosives. If the modern world remains reliant on petroleum as a source of energy, the price of crude oil could increase markedly, destabilizing economies worldwide. Consequently, renewable fuel drivers include: high oil prices, imbalance of trade, instability in oil exporting regions of the world, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the potential for windfall profits for American farmers and industries, avoidance of economic depression, avoidance of scarcity of products due to a volatile ‘peak oil’ scenario expected to begin as early as 2021, (though peak oil is not a new idea) and a slowing of global warming that may usher in unprecedented climate change.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasingly}} stricter regulations for deep reduction of fuel sulfur content, {{development of new}} deep desulfurization processes for liquid transport fuels {{has become one of}} the major challenges to the refining industry and to the production of hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cell applications. The sulfur compounds in the current transport fuels corresponding to the S level of 350 - 500 ppm account for only about 0. 12 - 0. 25 wt % of the fuel. The conventional hydrotreating approaches will need to increase catalyst bed volume at high-temperature and high-pressure conditions for treating 100 % of the whole fuel in order to convert the fuel mass of less than 0. 25 wt %. In the present study, we are exploring a novel adsorption process for desulfurization at low temperatures, which can effectively reduce the sulfur content in <b>gasoline,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel and diesel fuel at low investment and operating cost to meet the needs for ultra-clean transportation fuels and for fuel cell applications. Some adsorbents were prepared in this study for selective adsorption of sulfur compounds in the fuels. The adsorption experiments were conducted by using a model fuel and real fuels. The results show that the adsorbent (A- 1) with a transition metal compound has a significant selectivity for sulfur compounds with a saturated adsorption capacity of {approx} 0. 12 mol of sulfur compounds per mol of the metal compound. Most sulfur compounds existing in the current commercial <b>gasoline,</b> <b>jet</b> fuel and diesel fuel can be removed by the adsorption using adsorbent A- 1.
