40|$|We {{develop a}} Keynesian cross {{analysis}} with a dynamic optimization setting that explains long-run stagnation caused by aggregate demand deficiency. We show that {{an increase in}} government purchases boosts GDP through a multiplier process, but the implication {{is quite different from}} the conventional Keynesian one. It works not through an increase in disposable income but through moderation of deflation. Thus, countries that have lapsed into long-run stagnation should expand government spending that directly creates employment in order to reduce the <b>deflationary</b> <b>gap...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{analyze the}} effects of a child allowance, an improvement in the efficiency of child rearing and a labor income tax on the fertility rate and per capita consumption. The effects on per capita consumption are opposite in the absence, and the presence, of unemployment. For example, a child allowance urges people to have more children and allocate more labor to child rearing, decreasing labor supply for the purpose of commodity production. Therefore, under full employment, it decreases per capita consumption. In the presence of unemployment, however, it reduces the <b>deflationary</b> <b>gap</b> and hence stimulates per capita consumption. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an equation of income {{derived from the}} Keynesian IS curve and the consumption Euler equation that explains the business cycle. Drawing on multi-period data from Japan, the model confirms {{the conventional wisdom that}} the appropriate policy response to an inflationary gap is to increase the interest rate when economic growth accelerates and decrease it when growth decelerates. However, the model indicates that to stabilize a <b>deflationary</b> <b>gap,</b> policymakers should decrease the interest rate when growth accelerates and increase it when growth decelerates. This prescription defies generations of conventional wisdom but fits the historical data remarkably well. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of interest rates}} and inflation on GDP growth {{has been the subject}} of long debates and many research studies: from purely theoretical analysis of the channels through which this is accomplished, to empirical studies on a broad panel of countries. Because of these shared arguments about the impact of interest rates and inflation on GDP growth, as an area of investigation in this paper we took FYROM, Bulgaria and Romania. The first country is not part of the EU but the last two are, but all of them non-Eurozone members. The analysis aims to investigate the {{influence of}} these variables on GDP, on one hand in the country which is still on its way to enter the EU and on the other hand for the two countries that are expected to enter the common monetary area. The paper examines existing theory to create an analytical framework for the impact of interest rate and inflation on GDP, then to quantitatively evaluate the importance of these variables for the economic growth in the three countries. A cointegration analysis with three variables (interest rate, inflation and GDP growth) and a Granger causality analysis are implemented to examine the relations between these variables. Unit root tests will be applied in so as to examine the relationships among the respective data series. Our target period is from 2000 until present time, offering both a relatively positive first period until the arrival of the debt crisis by the end of the 2000 s, leading to strict austerity and <b>deflationary</b> <b>gaps</b> in most countries. Our basic aim is to investigate the links between monetary and fiscal measures, especially for developing countries that strive for economic growth without having a strong home currency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} non-traditional monetary policy measures implemented by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) based on the quantity theory of money. The reduced form equation regression results explain that quantity easing policy measures have very limited effects on the economy, especially on inflation under the zero lower bound on interest rates. Therefore, {{it is worth noting}} that stimulating the demand-side economy and hence money demand through credit creation is much important rather than the expansion of money stock under the zero percent interest rates policy. In other words, the new phase of monetary easing policy measures by the BOJ will not be effective to overcome the <b>deflationary</b> <b>gap,</b> although around one percent inflation will be observed in the second and third fiscal year, which is expected to be affected by rise in import price through yen depreciation, according to the scenario simulation in this study...|$|E
