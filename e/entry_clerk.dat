50|$|The role of data <b>entry</b> <b>clerks</b> {{working with}} {{physical}} hand-written documents {{is on the}} decline in the developed world, because employees within a company frequently enter their own data, as it is collected now, instead of having a different employee do this task. An example of this is an operator working in a call center or a cashier in a shop. Cost is another reason for the decline. Data entry is labor-intensive for large batches and, therefore, expensive, so large companies will sometimes outsource the work to third world countries where {{there is no shortage of}} cheaper unskilled labor.|$|R

40|$|Data {{quality is}} {{critical}} for many information-intensive applications. One of the best opportunities to improve data quality is during entry. USHER provides a theoretical, data-driven foundation for improving data quality during entry. Based on prior data, USHER learns a probabilistic model of the dependencies between form questions and values. Using this information, USHER maximizes information gain. By asking the most unpredictable questions first, USHER is better able to predict answers for the remaining questions. In this paper, we use USHER’s predictive ability to design a number of intelligent user interface adaptations that improve data entry accuracy and efficiency. Based on an underlying cognitive model of data entry, we apply these modifications before, during and after committing an answer. We evaluated these mechanisms with professional data <b>entry</b> <b>clerks</b> working with real patient data from six clinics in rural Uganda. The results show that our adaptations {{has the potential to}} reduce error (by up to 78 %), with limited effect on entry time (varying between- 14 % and + 6 %). We believe this approach has wide applicability for improving the quality and availability of data, which is increasingly important for decision-making and resource allocation.

30|$|In 2011, Bosmans {{and colleagues}} {{surveyed}} clinical specialists and GPs (COVER) and radiologists (ROVER) regarding {{their views of}} and preferences for radiology reports. Eighty-seven per cent of referrers considered the radiology report an indispensable tool; 63 % did not think they were better able to interpret an imaging study in their own specialty than a radiologist. Almost all agreed they need to provide adequate clinical information and state clearly the question they want answered. For complex examinations, 84.5 % of referring clinicians and 55.3 % of radiologists preferred itemised reports; 56 % of clinicians and 72.9 % of radiologists rejected {{the idea that a}} radiology report should consist of prose. Half of referring clinicians thought the radiologist might not have looked at a particular feature if it was not explicitly mentioned in the report; slightly over half of radiologists agreed that clinicians would assume this. The authors concluded that there is no universal consensus on what constitutes a good report and that the literature on this topic is primarily based on the insights and lifetime experience of specific authors rather than formal assessment of the views and needs of referrers or radiologists. Commenting that “one size does not fit all”, they recommend tailoring the report to the profile of the referring physician. Finally, they encapsulate the dilemma by noting: “Medicine certainly needs talented and competent radiologists. But do we want them to be data <b>entry</b> <b>clerks</b> rather than journalists, poets or essayists?” [32].|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the differences in}} entry errors associated with entry of prospective cohort data using a single versus a dual data entry system. Design: Cross-over trial Measurements: The database for the Canadian Intercollegiate Sport Injury Registry (CISIR) has, to date, used a dual data entry system. To test the differences in entry error, one season of injury and exposure (participation) data were entered for one sport from two participating institutions. A total of 5 data <b>entry</b> <b>clerks</b> were involved. Discrepancies between the final entries from both systems were flagged and checked against the original paper record. The number of instances where the dual entry system was correct but the single entry system was incorrect, and vice versa, were determined. Results: A total of 17, 988 database fields were evaluated (15, 509 text and 2, 479 fixed response fields). There was {{a statistically significant difference}} in error where the dual entry system was correct but the single entry system was incorrect for 2 out of the 4 data entry modules. The percent accuracy using the single entry system was lower (99. 35 %) than that using the dual entry system (99. 83 %). Conclusions: Although the single entry system was statistically different from the dual entry system, the percent accuracy remained high and the errors did not cluster in one specific field. Given the doubling of entry costs with a dual entry system, it is recommended that a single entry system be used for the CISIR...|$|R

40|$|In this study, 144 {{professional}} {{accounting data}} <b>entry</b> <b>clerks</b> {{took part in}} a fully randomized field experiment using a 4 (mode of participation) × 2 (task meaningfulness) design. Participants were full-time, mandatory users of payroll applications. The nature of the experiment engaged these users in hands-on activity (Hartwick and Barki [Hartwick, J., H. Barki. 1994. Explaining the role of user participation in information system use. Management Sci. 40 440 [...] 465. ]) regarding the development of a payroll input screen. User mode of participation was manipulated by varying the extent of decision input used to execute hands-on activity in accordance with procedural justice theory. Perceptions of decision control, procedural justice, and outcome satisfaction, as well as objective levels of task performance escalated with corresponding increases in decision input. Task meaningfulness was manipulated by creating either high or low expectations of using the payroll input screen in the near future. As the development task became more meaningful, procedural justice, decision control, task commitment, and task performance responses also increased. An underlying theoretical model of treatment effects was tested using path analysis which supported the control-oriented theory of procedural justice. The strong attitudinal and behavioral results observed in this experiment enhance understanding of the user participation and involvement model proposed by Hartwick and Barki (Hartwick, J., H. Barki. 1994. Explaining the role of user participation in information system use.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Gathering {{information}} {{accurately and}} quickly {{is essential for}} enabling organizations working in low-resource settings to have timely and sustainable impact. Due to insufficient infrastructure, many organizations currently use paper to collect data in the field, only to have data <b>entry</b> <b>clerks</b> digitize the data later. This often introduces latency and potential sources of error. However, the growing development of cellular infrastructure combined with the rapid decline {{in the cost of}} smart phones presents an opportunity to shift the primary collection medium from paper to mobile devices. This dissertation presents our contribution to data collection in developing regions, Open Data Kit (ODK), an extensible, open-source suite of tools designed to facilitate tasks at every level of data collection campaigns. ODK currently provides three tools to this end: Collect, Aggregate, and Build. Collect is a mobile client providing simple interfaces for collecting data. Aggregate is an easy to deploy data storage system hosted in the "cloud" or on local servers. Build is a web-based drag-and-drop form designer created to simplify the process of creating complex digital forms. By providing the ability to both capture and present richer data (e. g. images, video, and location), ODK tools have provided organizations new ways to collect and analyze information. We present the system architecture and through example real-world deployments, highlight specific design decisions that have enabled new directions in data collection and workforce management. Finally, we discuss lessons learned in building the system and present promising future directions in the space...|$|R
40|$|The work sample {{method of}} datacollection {{involves}} the system-atic collection and review ofproducts created during the nor-mal course of work. Work samples {{can be written}} documents, such as reports, memos, letters, or journal articles; or tan-gible products, such as a bowl created by a potter, a poster created by a graphic designer, or an educational videotape developed by an instructional designer. Work samples may also include routine recordings of work, such as daily audio-tapes of a customer service representa-tive’s conversations with clients or computer records of a data <b>entry</b> <b>clerk’s</b> output for the day. Work samples are similar to performance tests and observations because all three methods of data collection focus on work products or the directly observable results of work. In performance tests, which are commonly administered in selection, training, or certification situa-tions, people are given tasks to perform that closely simulate tasks performed on the job (Binder, 2004). In observations, data are collected by systematically observing employees as they perform their jobs and documenting their behav-iors (Marrelli, 2005). Work samples are different from perfor-mance tests in that work samples are actual specimens of routine on-the-job work, while performance tests are spe-cially administered for a specific purpose outside the usual job context. Work sam-ples are different from observations in that observations are specifically sched-uled for a set period and are typically of relatively short duration. In contrast, work samples are collected from routine work performed over an extended period. While performance tests and observations both require {{the presence of the}} worker, work samples examine the tangible results of work performance, but the worker is not present during the review of the work...|$|R
40|$|Low-resource {{organizations}} worldwide work {{to improve}} health, education, infrastructure, and economic opportunity in disadvantaged communities. These organizations must collect data {{in order to}} inform service delivery and performance monitoring. In such settings, data collection can be laborious and expensive due to challenges in the physical and digital infrastructure, in capacity and retention of technical staff, and in poor performance incentives. Governments, donors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) large and small are demanding more accountability and transparency, resulting in increased data collection workloads. Despite continued emphasis and investment, countless data collection efforts continue to experience delayed and low-quality results. Existing tools and capabilities for data collection have not kept pace with increased reporting requirements. This dissertation addresses data collection in low-resource settings by algorithmically shepherding human attention at three different scales: (1) by redirecting workers' attention {{at the moment of}} entry, (2) by reformulating the data collection instrument in its design and use, and (3) by reorganizing the flow and composition of data entry tasks within and between organizations. These three different granularities of intervention map to the three major parts of this dissertation. First, the Usher system learns probabilistic models from previous form responses, supplementing the lack of expertise and quality control. The models are a principled foundation for data in forms, and are applied at every step of the data collection process: form design, form filling, and answer verification. Simulated experiments demonstrate that Usher can improve data quality and reduce quality-control effort considerably. Next, a number of dynamic user-interface mechanisms improve accuracy and efficiency during the act of data entry, powered by Usher. Based on a cognitive model, these interface adaptations can be applied as interventions before, during, and after input. An evaluation with professional data <b>entry</b> <b>clerks</b> in rural Uganda reduced error by up to 78 %. Finally, the Shreddr system transforms paper form images into structured data on-demand. Shreddr reformulates data entry work-flows with pipeline and batching optimizations at the organizational level. It combines emergent techniques from computer vision, database systems, and machine learning, with newly-available infrastructure - on-line workers and mobile connectivity - into a hosted data entry web-service. It is a framework for data digitization that can deliver Usher and other optimizations at scale. Shreddr's impact on digitization efficiency and quality is illustrated in a one-million-value case study in Mali. The main contributions of this dissertation are (1) a probabilistic foundation for data collection, which effectively guides form design, form filling, and value verification; (2) dynamic data entry interface adaptations, which significantly improve data entry accuracy and efficiency; and (3) the design and large-scale evaluation of a hosted-service architecture for data entry...|$|R
