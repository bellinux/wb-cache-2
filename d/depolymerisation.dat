25|$|Secretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, {{are moved}} across the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the <b>depolymerisation</b> of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.|$|E

50|$|Either {{chemical}} or enzymatic <b>depolymerisation</b> techniques {{or a combination}} of the two underlie the vast majority of analyses carried out on the structure and function of heparin and heparan sulfate (HS).|$|E
5000|$|Depolymerization (or <b>depolymerisation)</b> is {{the process}} of {{converting}} a polymer into a monomer or a mixture of monomers. [...] All polymers depolymerize at high temperatures, a process driven by an increase in entropy.|$|E
5000|$|The three lamins {{present in}} the nuclear lamina, lamin A, B & C, are {{phosphorylated}} by MPF at serine amino residues. This leads to <b>depolymerisation</b> of the nuclear lamina & breakdown of nuclear envelope into small vesicles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Depolymerisation</b> {{reactions}} are mainly analytical techniques {{but it is}} envisaged to use them as means to produce molecules for the chemical industry derived from waste products, such as bark from the wood industry or pomaces from the wine industry.|$|E
50|$|As {{might be}} expected, {{products}} prepared by distinctly different processes are dissimilar in physical, chemical, and biological properties. Hence a slight {{change in the}} <b>depolymerisation</b> process could result in substantial variation of the structure or composition of a given LMWH.|$|E
50|$|Phloroglucinolysis is an {{analytical}} technique to study condensed tannins {{by means of}} <b>depolymerisation.</b> The reaction makes use of phloroglucinol as nucleophile. Phlobaphenes formation (tannins condensation and precipitation) can be minimized in using strong nucleophiles, such as phloroglucinol, during pine tannins extraction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Depolymerisation</b> is an {{indirect}} {{method of analysis}} allowing to gain informations such as average degree of polymerisation, percentage of galloylation, etc. The depolymerised sample can be injected on a mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source, only able to form ions with smaller molecules.|$|E
50|$|Epimerization is a {{chemical}} process where an epimer {{is made to}} transform into its chiral counterpart. It can happen in condensed tannins <b>depolymerisation</b> reactions. Epimerisation can be spontaneous (generally a slow process), or catalyzed by enzymes, e.g. the epimerization between the sugars N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmannosamine, which is catalyzed by renin-binding protein.|$|E
50|$|Thiolysis is a {{reaction}} with a thiol (R-SH) that cleaves one compound into two. This reaction {{is similar to}} hydrolysis, which involves water instead of a thiol. This reaction is seen in &beta;-oxidation of fatty acids. The <b>depolymerisation</b> of condensed tannins {{with the use of}} benzyl mercaptan as nucleophile is also called thiolysis.|$|E
5000|$|Condensed tannins can be characterised by {{a number}} of modern {{techniques}} including <b>depolymerisation,</b> asymmetric flow field flow fractionation, small-angle X-ray scattering and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Their interactions with proteins can be studied by isothermal titration calorimetry [...] and this provides information on the affinity constant, enthalpy and stoichiometry in the tannin-protein complex.|$|E
50|$|The {{condensed}} tannins can nevertheless undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage in {{the presence}} of (an excess of) a nucleophile like phloroglucinol (reaction called phloroglucinolysis), benzyl mercaptan (reaction called thiolysis), thioglycolic acid (reaction called thioglycolysis) or cysteamine. These techniques are generally called <b>depolymerisation</b> and give informations such as average degree of polymerisation or percentage of galloylation. These are SN1 reactions, a type of substitution reaction in organic chemistry, involving a carbocation intermediate under strongly acidic conditions in polar protic solvents like methanol. The reaction leads to the formation of free and derived monomers that can be further analyzed. The free monomers correspond to the terminal units of the condensed tannins chains. If thiolysis is done directly on plant material (rather than on purified tannins), it is, however, important to subtract naturally occurring free flavanol monomers from the concentration of terminal units that are released during <b>depolymerisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a {{pioneering}} study by Bernstein and Bamburg, {{it was observed}} that the actin-binding protein actin <b>depolymerisation</b> factor (ADF)/cofilin, a factor that promotes actin filament <b>depolymerisation,</b> competed with tropomyosin for binding to the actin filament. The expression of Tropomyosin 5NM1 in neuronal cells eliminated ADF/cofilin from the growth cone region, leading to more stable actin filaments. However, the increased expression of Tropomyosin Br3 was observed to recruit ADF/cofilin to actin filaments bound to the Tropomyosin Br3 isoform within the lamellipodium, which led to the disassembly of actin filaments. This phenomenon, whereby a specific tropomyosin isoform directs specific interactions between actin-binding proteins, and the actin filament has been observed in a variety of model systems with a range of different binding proteins (reviewed in Gunning et al., 2008). These interactions, under the influence of tropomyosin isoforms, allow actin filaments to be involved in a diverse range of cellular functions.|$|E
50|$|Abp1/Drebrins, {{which are}} {{relatively}} large proteins composed of an N-terminal ADF-H domain {{followed by a}} variable region and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Abp1/Drebrins interact only with actin filaments and do not promote filament <b>depolymerisation</b> or fragmentation. Although these proteins are biochemically distinct and play different roles in actin dynamics, they all appear to use the ADF-H domain for their interactions with actin.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of Stathmin is {{to regulate the}} cytoskeleton of the cell. The cytoskeleton {{is made up of}} long hollow cylinders named microtubules. These microtubules are made up of alpha and beta tubulin heterodimers. The changes in cytoskeleton are known as microtubule dynamics; the addition of the tubulin subunits lead to polymerisation and their loss, <b>depolymerisation.</b> Stathmin regulates these by promoting depolymerization of microtubules or preventing polymerization of tubulin heterodimers.|$|E
50|$|These {{techniques}} are generally called <b>depolymerisation</b> and give {{information such as}} average degree of polymerisation or percentage of galloylation. These are SN1 reactions, a type of substitution reaction in organic chemistry, involving a carbocation intermediate under strongly acidic conditions in polar protic solvents like methanol. The reaction leads {{to the formation of}} free and derived monomers that can be further analyzed or used to enhance procyanidin absorption and bioavailability. The free monomers correspond to the terminal units of the condensed tannins chains.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal <b>depolymerisation</b> {{is similar}} to other {{processes}} which use superheated water as a major step to produce fuels, such as direct Hydrothermal Liquefaction.These are distinct from processes using dry materials to depolymerize, such as pyrolysis. The term Thermochemical Conversion (TCC) has also been used for conversion of biomass to oils, using superheated water, although it is more usually applied to fuel production via pyrolysis.Other commercial scale processes include the [...] "SlurryCarb" [...] process operated by EnerTech, which uses similar technology to decarboxylate wet solid biowaste, which can then be physically dewatered and used as a solid fuel called E-Fuel. The plant was designed to Rialto to process 683 tons of waste per day. However, it failed to perform to design standards and was closed down. The Rialto facility defaulted on its bond payments {{and is in the}} process of being liquidated. [...] The Hydro Thermal Upgrading (HTU) process uses superheated water to produce oil from domestic waste.A demonstration plant is due to start up in The Netherlands said to be capable of processing 64 tons of biomass (dry basis) per day into oil.

50|$|TCP-seq {{is based}} on these {{capabilities}} of the high-throughput RNA sequencing and further uses the nucleic acid protection phenomenon. The protection is manifested as resistance to <b>depolymerisation</b> or modification of stretches of nucleic acids (particularly, RNA) that are tightly bound to or engulfed with other biomolecules, which thus leave their “footprints” over the nucleic acid strand. These “footprint” fragments therefore represent location on nucleic acid chain where the interaction occurs. By sequencing and mapping the fragments back to the source sequence, {{it is possible to}} precisely identify the locations and counts of these intermolecular contacts.|$|E
50|$|Heparin is a {{naturally}} occurring polysaccharide that inhibits coagulation, {{the process that}} leads to thrombosis. Natural heparin consists of molecular chains of varying lengths, or molecular weights. Chains of varying molecular weights, from 5000 to over 40,000 Daltons, make up polydisperse pharmaceutical-grade heparin. LMWHs, in contrast, consist of only short chains of polysaccharide. LMWHs are defined as heparin salts having an average molecular weight of less than 8000 Da and for which at least 60% of all chains have a molecular weight less than 8000 Da. These are obtained by various methods of fractionation or <b>depolymerisation</b> of polymeric heparin.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{for every}} LMWH, a {{strictly}} defined <b>depolymerisation</b> procedure {{is needed to}} guarantee the sameness of the final LMWH product and the predictability of clinical outcomes. LMWHs, as biological origin products, rely on stringent manufacturing procedures to guarantee the absence of biological or chemical contamination. It is therefore critical to adopt stringent manufacturing practices, through rigorous quality assurance steps, to ensure the highest quality of the produced LMWHs and to guarantee patient safety. These quality assurance steps, to be effective, need to be implemented from the raw material (crude heparin) collection to the final LMWH product.|$|E
5000|$|In late prometaphase, {{kinetochore}} microtubules {{begin to}} search for and attach to chromosomal kinetochores. A kinetochore is a proteinaceous microtubule-binding structure that forms on the chromosomal centromere during late prophase. A number of polar microtubules find and interact with corresponding polar microtubules from the opposite centrosome to form the mitotic spindle. Although the kinetochore structure and function are not fully understood, {{it is known that}} it contains some form of molecular motor. When a microtubule connects with the kinetochore, the motor activates, using energy from ATP to [...] "crawl" [...] up the tube toward the originating centrosome. This motor activity, coupled with polymerisation and <b>depolymerisation</b> of microtubules, provides the pulling force necessary to later separate the chromosome's two chromatids.|$|E

50|$|The {{drive to}} industrialise {{biorefinery}} technologies within the NEPIC Cluster is mostly {{aimed at reducing}} carbon emissions or at making manufacturing more sustainable by counterbalancing the emissions by the reabsorption of carbon dioxide through the growth of an equivalent amount of biomass. Alternatively they are implementing technologies that enable the use of societal waste as a new basic raw material. The Chemical Engineering technologies that are being implemented include advanced gasification and Air Products are implementing their plasma gasification technology on Teesside, the company has announced that a second such unit is also {{to be built in}} this location. Others are developing projects utilising pyrolysis to recover useful materials from carbon wastes and also new processes to manufacture biosynthetic natural gas (SNG)and fuels from air being developed by Air Fuels Synthesis. <b>Depolymerisation</b> processes are also under investigation.|$|E
50|$|Cytoskeletal {{drugs are}} small {{molecules}} that interact with actin or tubulin. These drugs can {{act on the}} cytoskeletal components within a cell in three main ways. Some cytoskeletal drugs stabilize {{a component of the}} cytoskeleton, such as taxol which stabilizes microtubules or Phalloidin which stabilizes actin filaments. Others such as Cytochalasin D bind to actin monomers and prevent them from polymerizing into filaments. Drugs such as demecolcine act by enhancing the <b>depolymerisation</b> of already formed filaments. Some of these drugs have multiple effects on the cytoskeleton, for example Latrunculin both prevents actin polymerization as well as enhancing its rate of depolymerization. Typically the microtubule targeting drugs {{can be found in the}} clinic where they are used therapeutically in the treatment of some forms of cancer. As a result of the lack of specificity for specific type of actin (i.e. cannot distinguish between cardiac, smooth muscle, muscle and cytoskeletal forms of actin) the use of these drugs in animals results in unacceptable off target effects. Despite this the actin targeting compounds are still useful tools that can be used on a cellular level to help further our understanding of how this complex part of the cells internal machinery operates. For example, Phalloidin which has been conjugated with a fluorescent probe can be used for visualizing the filamentous actin in fixed samples.|$|E
50|$|T. spinosa pods are an {{excellent}} source of environmentally friendly tannins (tara tannins) most commonly used in the manufacture of automotive and furniture leathers. This growing industry is developing around their production in Peru. Some producers have their own plantations to guarantee constant quality. Tara tannin derivatives are being proposed as antifouling against marine organisms that can grow on ship hulls. Those tannins are of the hydrolysable type. Gallic acid is the main constituent of tara tannins (53%) and can be easily isolated by alkaline hydrolysis of the plant extract. Quinic acid is also a constituent of the tara tannins. Its tannines are colourless or light making them suitable a pre-mordant in the dyeing of cotton and other cellulose fibres.Tara gum is a white or beige, nearly odorless powder that is produced by separating and grinding the endosperm of T. spinosa seeds. Tara gum consists of a linear main chain of (1-4)-β-D-mannopyranose units attached by (1-6) linkages with α-D-galactopyranose units. The major component of the gum is a galactomannan polymer similar to the main components of guar and locust bean gums that are used widely in the food industry. The ratio of mannose to galactose in tara gum is 3:1. Tara gum has been deemed safe for human consumption as a food additive.Tara gum is used as a thickening agent and stabilizer in a number of food applications. A solution of tara gum is less viscous than a guar gum solution of the same concentration, but more viscous than a solution of locust bean gum. Generally, tara gum presents a viscosity around 5,500 cps (1% aqueous solution). Furthermore, tara gum shows an intermediate acid stability between locust bean gum and guar gum. It resists the <b>depolymerisation</b> effect of organic acids down to a pH of 3.5. This gum is also stable to high-temperature treatment, up to 145 °C in a continuous process plant. Blends of tara with modified and unmodified starches can be produced which have enhanced stabilization and emulsification properties, and these are used in the preparation of convenience foods, such as ice cream.|$|E
