40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{differences}} in perceptions of officials and personnel of educational agencies according to the following criteria: geographic region; corporation size; and frequency of participation. This study was designed to assess perceptions regarding: needs assessment; evaluation; dissemination; innovation; cooperation; decision-making; released time; diffusion; interpersonal relationships; status of education; community relationships; post-graduate education; reading of officials; and class size. The respondents included: board presidents; superintendents; central office administrators; principals; and teachers. Data processing consisted of determining percentages of respondents selecting potential choices on a thirty-nine item questionnaire. Items were analyzed according to region, agency size, and frequency of participation. Prior assessments resulted in conflicting findings. The literature, before August, 1973, failed to confirm or refute the value of sampled programs. Data indicate the respondents have not made use of assessment instruments to define appropriateness of content included in curricula. Data indicate the problems inherent in evaluation are not viewed as a deterrent to effective evaluation. Data indicate that innovative educational practices have not received extensive coverage by newspapers. Data indicate that among respondents an inverse relationship exists between an individuals position in the educational hierarchy and direct communication about innovation. Data also indicate that professional personnel made more positive statements concerning innovation in 1973 and 1967. Data reveal the amount of independent study and number of instructional areas allowing independent study has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data indicate that cooperative efforts by staff to improve the quality of education offered to students has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data show that more decisions concerning innovation were made by professional personnel, below the rank of superintendent, in 1973 than 1967. Data reveal that cognitive and affective objectives are formulated one year or less in advance of utilization. Data indicate that most school governing bodies have not increased the number of days of released time provided for the improvement of instruction. Data show the availability of materials and equipment has become an important factor in improvement of instruction. Data indicate that assistance offered to students by teachers for the development of effective study and work habits has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data indicate that assistance provided for the improvement of instruction has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data show the diffusion of information about participation was unsuccessful in most school districts. Data reveal that the quality of college preparatory and vocational curricula has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data indicate the number of educational options available to students has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data indicate the acceptance of innovation has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967, but acceptance is reduced by increased levels of responsibility. Data reveal the conviction among teachers that pupils interfering with learning opportunities of other students should be excluded from school, has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data show the treatment of students as responsible individuals by professional staff has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data indicate the amount of time spent dealing with contemporary issues has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data show that an education received in an authoritarian school system is the best preparation for citizenship in a democratic society has decreased since 1967. Data indicate the amount of observable evidence, of cooperation between administrators and school patrons for the improvement of education offered students, has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967. Data show the amount of observable evidence, of cooperation between teachers and school patrons, has <b>increased</b> <b>since</b> 1967.

5|$|A massive {{influx of}} Palestinian {{refugees}} swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population {{had grown to}} about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to <b>increase</b> <b>since</b> that time to 515,556 in 2012, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City {{has one of the}} highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km² (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km² – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km² – 55,000/sq mi).

5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined {{significantly from}} a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was in part due to the slowdown of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population <b>increase</b> <b>since</b> 2010, the first increase in five decades.|$|E

Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the Flats and the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments has been on the <b>increase</b> <b>since</b> 2000. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements <b>increase.</b> <b>Since</b> there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the wrens {{increased}} northward and westward in several regions {{over the past few}} centuries. In Massachusetts, the wrens had expanded westward and northeastward from its former southeastern location in approximately 35 years, in New York the population increased three-fold in roughly 25 years, while in midwest states such as Ohio and Michigan have seen numbers of the birds <b>increase</b> <b>since</b> the mid-1800s and early 1900s, respectively. Expansion around Ontario occurred since early reports in 1890 and 1905. Explanations given include infrequent winter storms in the 20th century, expanded forest habitats, and the wrens taking advantage of urban areas containing feeders, especially in winter.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 {{there were}} {{estimated}} to be 2.37 million households in Scotland. Of these approximately 1.5 million (62.5 per cent) were owner-occupied homes, 319,000 (12.7 per cent) homes rented from local authorities, 305,000 (11.5 per cent) privately rented homes, and 277,000 (11.5 per cent) homes rented from housing associations. The total number had increased by around 173,000 (7.9 per cent) over the previous ten years, with {{the rate of increase}} having slowed substantially {{since the start of the}} economic downturn in 2007. The rate of growth in households was affected by falls in new housing supply (which includes new builds, refurbishments and conversions). This fell in each year from 2008–09 to 2010–11, from around 27,600 units in 2007–08 to 17,100 units in 2010–11. The number of households increased after 2010 in every local authority except Clackmannanshire, Inverclyde and West Dunbartonshire. The area with the greatest <b>increase</b> <b>since</b> 2001 in percentage terms was Aberdeenshire with an additional 13,800 households (15.2 per cent). Edinburgh City saw the largest absolute increase of 17,000 households (8.3 per cent). Overall 2.8 per cent of dwellings are vacant and 1.5 per cent are second homes, with the largest proportions in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|India {{is home to}} the world's largest {{population}} of wild tigers but only 11% of the original Indian tiger habitat remains, and it has become fragmented. From 1973, India's Project Tiger, started by Indira Gandhi, established over 25 tiger reserves in reclaimed land, where human development was forbidden. The project was credited with tripling the number of wild Bengal tigers from some 1,200 in 1973 to over 3,500 in the 1990s, but a 2007 census showed that numbers had dropped back to about 1,400 tigers because of poaching. Following the report, the Indian government pledged $153 million to the initiative, set up measures to combat poaching, promised funds to relocate up to 200,000 villagers in order to reduce human-tiger interactions, and set up eight new tiger reserves. India also reintroduced tigers to the Sariska Tiger Reserve and by 2009 it was claimed that poaching had been effectively countered at Ranthambore National Park. A 2014 census estimated a {{population of}} 2,226, a 30% <b>increase</b> <b>since</b> 2011.|$|E
5|$|Former President Hastings Banda {{established}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy that}} continued into early 2011. It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries. The transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States. Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for International Development in Malawi. Malawi maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes {{over the use of}} the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid. In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to <b>increase</b> <b>since</b> then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies. In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika. Mutharika expelled the ambassador from Malawi, and in July 2011, the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika's lack of response to criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement. On 26 July 2011, the United States followed suit, freezing a US$350 million grant, citing concerns regarding the government's suppression and intimidation of demonstrators and civic groups, as well as restriction of the press and police violence.|$|E
