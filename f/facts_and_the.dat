5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, {{what began as a}} strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> law.... These women {{should never have been}} charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E
5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

25|$|The scandal got in {{the even}} {{international}} focus before 1972, as the Beobachter newspaper's journalists investigated, after the newspaper got hints by affected Yenish people, and as the first media, Hans Caprez published on 15 April 1972 in the article Kinder der Landstrasse the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> background involving in all about 590 children of the Yenish people minority in Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|The American Council on Science and Health {{said that}} denialism {{of the facts}} of climate science and of climate change, means to {{misrepresent}} verifiable data and information as political opinion. In that vein, anti-intellectualism puts scientists in the public view and so forces them to align with either a liberal or a conservative political stance. One third of Americans believe that climate scientists know about climate change, while fewer than one third believe that scientists know how to end global climate change. Moreover, 53 per cent of Republican politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives and 74 percent of Republican senators deny the scientific <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of climate change.|$|E
25|$|Pretext for Mass Murder by {{historian}} John Roosa is a {{work that}} traces a historical path through the 1965 incidents, painting a scenario of explanations for what preceded, caused and followed the political coup. It focuses on several aspects of the coup such as the incoherence of <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> incompetence of coup organizers to provide four main interpretations of the coup:(1) the movement as an attempted coup d’etat by the PKI, (2) the movement as a mutiny of junior officers, (3) the movement as an alliance of army officers and the PKI, and (4) the movement as a frame-up of the PKI. It also looks at material previously left unexplored in traditional discussions of the incident to give a reconstruction of the chaos that surrounds {{this period of time}} in Indonesian history.|$|E

500|$|After some negotiations, he {{obtained}} possession of this precious fragment.

[...] He conveyed it to Tsar Alexander II, who appreciated its importance and had it published as nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the ancient handwriting. In 1869 the Tsar sent the monastery 7,000 rubles and the monastery of Mount Tabor 2,000 rubles by way of compensation. The document in Russian formalising this was published in 2007 in Russia and has since been translated.|$|E

500|$|Heffron also {{clashed with}} the Federal Government's {{imposition}} of National Emergency Services procedures, most notably over the imposition of brownouts {{for the city of}} Sydney. In the Legislative Assembly in November 1942, Heffron denounced the advisers of the Federal Government who continued to maintain the brown-out as an essential defence measure: [...] "The only conclusion I can come to, is that the brown-out was born of a form of panic when Japan entered the war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will not look at the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evidence of the fighting men, but persist in sticking to their first conclusion. The position, therefore, is ludicrous." [...] Heffron later affirmed that the brown-out was completely unnecessary as a black-out, with short notice given, was a more effective and safer defensive measure.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was {{assisted}} in their investigation by psychiatrists from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide [...] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30p.m., and the toxicology report later {{revealed that the}} cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning. She had 8mg% (milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution) chloral hydrate and 4.5mg% of pentobarbital (Nembutal) in her blood, and a further 13mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. Empty bottles containing these medicines were found next to her bed. The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out, because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit. Her doctors stated that she had been prone to [...] "severe fears and frequent depressions" [...] with [...] "abrupt and unpredictable" [...] mood changes, and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of any indication of foul play, the coroner classified her death as a [...] "probable suicide".|$|E
500|$|Woon was {{the first}} Attorney-General in {{more than ten years}} to {{personally}} appear in court. On 28 July 2008, he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence. The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant's psychiatric condition, and affirmed the nine-year jail term imposed by the High Court. Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung, chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns Tangs department store, for the illegal purchase of a human organ– a kidney– in the first case of its kind in Singapore. The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling, Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in an article published in The Straits Times on 5 September 2008. Woon replied, pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> law, and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law. Subsequently, in response to further comments by Dr. Lee, he wrote an extended article entitled [...] "Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic" [...] that appeared in The Straits Times on 18 September 2008.|$|E
