5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central Committee meeting to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> to address the meeting. For the first time, {{the proceedings of the}} Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E

5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 sparked a {{revolution}} in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to make concessions. In April 1905 a decree guaranteed complete freedom of religion, and <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> religious studies to be conducted in native languages. The most important decree, the October Manifesto, was announced on October 30 (October 17 O.S.), 1905. It guaranteed many political rights, {{including the right to}} form political parties and organize convocations. This decree formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October Manifesto also announced the intent to hold elections to the Russian Parliament (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: they claimed that the Lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election.|$|E
5|$|Although the German–Hungarian {{relations}} remained tense, {{no major}} confrontations {{occurred when the}} German crusaders marched through Hungary in June 1147. Two months later, Louis VII of France and his crusaders arrived, along with Boris Kalamanos who attempted {{to take advantage of}} the crusade to return to Hungary. Louis VII refused to extradite Boris to Géza, but prevented the pretender from coming into contacts with his supporters in Hungary and took him to Constantinople. Géza joined the coalition that Louis VII and Roger II of Sicily formed against Conrad III of Germany and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The ancestors of the Transylvanian Saxons came to Hungary during Géza's reign. Western European knights and Muslim warriors from the Pontic steppes also settled in Hungary in this period. Géza <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> his Muslim soldiers to take concubines.|$|E
5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E

5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{exceptions}} were made; Israel and Egypt {{could buy}} advanced designs under the Camp David Agreements, Israel was <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> to buy McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, {{a key component}} in U.S. air-defense technology. Iran was already receiving the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, and this demonstrated the problem with advanced exports in February 1979 when reports emerged that Iran had sold an AIM-54 Phoenix missile to the Soviets. South Korea's F-16 order was initially blocked under this policy, but later allowed {{in the context of}} strengthening relations. Despite exceptions, the export policy was implemented, covering many potential and current customers. As the F-5G was a relatively modest upgrade to the F-5E, the F-5G appeared to be in a strong position for sales given the limitations placed on rival designs, however Carter personally blocked the sales of the F-5G to Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors {{and a day}} or so with each player and member of the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> their dogs to eat out of the Cup.|$|E

5|$|The {{first signs}} of a {{rehabilitation}} were seen during Leonid Brezhnev's rule, when information about him was again allowed {{to be included in}} Soviet encyclopaedias. His connection, support and work in the Anti-Party Group was mentioned in encyclopaedias published in 1973 and 1974, but eventually disappeared altogether by the mid-to-late-1970s. Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko further rehabilitated Molotov; in 1984 Molotov was <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> to seek membership in the Communist Party. A collection of interviews with Molotov from 1985 was published in 1994 by Felix Chuev as Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics. In June 1986, Molotov was hospitalized in Kuntsevo hospital in Moscow and he died, during the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev, on 8 November 1986. During his long life Molotov suffered seven myocardial infarctions, but lived to 96 years and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{heard that}} at Michigan {{women were not}} <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> to use the front entrance, and decided that she would prefer to study at Berkeley. Yuan took her to see Raymond T.

Wu then abandoned her plans to study at Michigan and enrolled at Berkeley. Her Berkeley classmates included Robert R. Wilson and George Volkoff; her friends included Ursula Schaefer, a history student who chose to remain in the United States rather than return to Nazi Germany, and Margaret Lewis, an American post-doctoral student. Wu applied for a scholarship at the end of her first year, but there was prejudice against Asian students, and Wu and Yuan were instead offered a readership with a lower stipend. Yuan then applied for, and secured, a scholarship at Caltech.|$|E

5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E
