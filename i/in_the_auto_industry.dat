5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry</b> were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|The freeway bears several {{names in}} {{addition}} to the I-75 designation. The southern segment was called the Detroit–Toledo Expressway during planning in the 1950s and 1960s. Through Detroit, I-75 is the Fisher Freeway or the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway, named for pioneers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry.</b> Sections {{on either side of the}} Mackinac Bridge are the G. Mennen Williams Freeway or the Prentiss M. Brown Freeway, named for politicians who helped get the bridge built. Officially, the entire length is the American Legion Memorial Highway, after the organization of the same name. Various sections carry components of the four Great Lakes Circle Tours in the state.|$|E

25|$|Detroit {{continued}} to expand through the 1950s, {{at one point}} doubling its population in a decade. After World War II, housing was developed in suburban areas outside city cores; newly constructed U.S. Interstate Highways allowed commuters to navigate the region more easily.

25|$|The first {{investments}} in road infrastructure {{have given up}} in the 1920s, the government of Washington Luis, being pursued in the governments of Getúlio Vargas and Eurico Gaspar Dutra. President Juscelino Kubitschek (1956–61), who designed and built the capital Brasília, was another supporter of highways. Kubitschek {{was responsible for the}} installation of major car manufacturers in the country (Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors arrived in Brazil during his rule) and one of the points used to attract them was, of course, support for the construction of highways. With the implementation of Fiat in 1976 ending an automobile market closed loop, {{from the end of the}} 1990s the country has received large foreign direct {{investments in}}stalling in its territory other major car manufacturers and utilities, such as Iveco, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota among others. Brazil is the seventh most important country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Detroit {{was founded}} on July 24, 1701 by the French {{explorer}} and adventurer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and a party of settlers. During the 19th century, it became an important industrial hub {{at the center of}} the Great Lakes region. With expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century, the city and its suburbs experienced rapid growth, and by the 1940s, the city had become the fourth-largest in the country. However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry,</b> and rapid suburbanization, Detroit lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 60 per cent. In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances.|$|E

25|$|Industrial mergers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, {{especially}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> automobile sector, increased oligopoly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American <b>auto</b> <b>industry.</b> Detroit manufacturers such as Packard and Hudson {{merged into}} other companies and eventually disappeared. At its peak population of 1,849,568, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950 Census, {{the city was}} <b>the</b> 5th-largest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, after New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Chery {{has been}} <b>the</b> top Chinese <b>auto</b> {{exporter}} since 2003, {{and many of}} its exports may be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of knock-down kits destined for overseas assembly. The fact that, prior to 2012, it lacked a joint venture with an established western automaker may explain its export focus; a 2009 report by the US Congressional Research Service asserted that such joint ventures, commonplace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>auto</b> <b>industry,</b> restrained overseas sales.|$|R
25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) had {{attempted}} to organize auto workers since the early 1920s with little success. After {{the passage of the}} National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933, the AFL again spearheaded a major drive in automobile manufacturing, this time organizing workers into federal labor unions. By March, more than 32,000 workers (representing about 17 percent of the total automotive manufacturing workforce) had been organized. On March 4, 1934, auto workers at Buick, Fisher Body, and Hudson voted to strike unless the employers recognized their unions, rehired all workers fired for union activity, and raised wages 20 percent. The AFL had accepted severe restrictions on union organizing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry</b> code (accepted by the government in early fall 1933), did not do much organizing under the code, utilized craft rather than industrial organizers whose main role appeared to be to suppress worker militancy rather than organize unions, and acquiesced when Hugh S. Johnson reinterpreted Section 7(a) in February 1934 to require proportional rather than exclusive representation. Worried that the auto worker unions might actually strike, the AFL negotiated with the government {{to find a way to}} avoid a strike.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} impact of the strike began to be felt immediately. [...] Layoffs in a number of steel-dependent industries occurred just two days after the strike began. National defense mobilization authorities began denying manufacturers of consumer goods steel four days after the strike started, and banned the export of steel on June 10. By June 17, defense plants producing the M47 Patton tank, the M41 Walker Bulldog tank, trucks, bazooka rockets and mortar shells had all shut down or were running half- or quarter-shifts. By June 21, consumer inventories of steel were almost gone, forcing manufacturing shut-downs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry.</b> As the Independence Day holiday neared, most inventories of steel were gone even from defense stockpiles.|$|E
2500|$|Taken together, {{these two}} {{elements}} allowed DeLorean to successfully defend himself at trial with the procedural defense of police entrapment. DeLorean's lawyers successfully {{argued that the}} FBI and DEA had unfairly targeted and illegally entrapped DeLorean when they allowed Hoffman (an active FBI informant who only knew DeLorean casually) to randomly elicit DeLorean into a criminal conspiracy simply because {{he was known to}} be financially vulnerable. Another factor was DeLorean's lack of criminal history, whereas Hoffman was a career criminal who stood to directly benefit if he was able to convince DeLorean to incriminate himself on tape. The DeLorean defense team did not call any witnesses. DeLorean was found not guilty on August 16, 1984, but by then DMC had already collapsed into bankruptcy and DeLorean's reputation as a businessman was irrevocably tarnished. When asked after his acquittal if he planned to resume his career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry,</b> DeLorean bitterly quipped [...] "Would you buy a used car from me?" ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} recent horror films <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US <b>in</b> {{relationship to}} <b>the</b> economic collapse of 2008 and the Great Recession. Using Rubber (2010) and Iron Invader (2011), it explores how the “killer commodity ” resonates with working-class anxieties of dispossession and disposability, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industries</b> of <b>the</b> {{places where the}} films are set and produced: the US and France. The films tap into a rich tradition of presenting capitalist relations through occultist narratives, relying on “monsters ” and mayhem to dramatize some of the conditions and confusion surrounding recent economic crises. The “absurd ” use of animated objects—a psychotic pneumatic tire in Rubber and a Golem made of discarded automobile parts in Iron Invader—invites a wider discussion of capitalism and social theory, including Marx‟s exposition of “dead labor ” and commodity fetishism. On the one hand, the object can only come to life and terrorize the American town if the social history of its production is missing from the plot of each film. On the other hand, the discarded but “demonic ” commodity is a frightening projection of objectified labor, one that doubles as an increasingly expendable but volatile worker found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent redundancies and protests at tire and automotive factories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and France...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to increasing militancy and revolutionary consciousness in the Black working class movement, {{the conditions of}} the trade union movement in Detroit, and particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry,</b> {{played a significant role in}} the creation of the LRBW. During the intense labor shortages as a result of WWII, Black workers were hired in significant numbers, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry.</b> While there was a union <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry,</b> the United Auto Workers (UAW), most Black workers felt alienated from the union’s majority white leadership and perceived the union in the same vein as the government and the bosses for its failure and outright refusal to meaningfully take up the growing concerns of Black workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
