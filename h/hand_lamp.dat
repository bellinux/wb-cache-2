50|$|The {{freight train}} passed the {{entrance}} signal as normal, then {{pulled into the}} station, expecting the dispatcher's instructions. Although not strictly necessary according to the rules, the dispatcher declared that he showed a red <b>hand</b> <b>lamp</b> to the approaching freight train to make absolutely sure it would stop (according to the rules, the 'stop' board was enough to halt the train). It is unclear what happened next, but the train failed to stop as it was meant to, and departed toward Wuppertal. The driver later claimed that the train dispatcher had signalled him with a green light using his <b>hand</b> <b>lamp,</b> the signal to pass the 'stop' board. The train trailed the points already set for the passenger train, as the points' seal, which ruptures in such an event, was later found to be missing. About 800 m north of the station, on a curve, both trains collided. The motor coach of the two-car special train was compacted to one third of its length and pushed backwards 100 m by the freight train locomotive, which was five times as heavy and 20 cm higher than the railbus.|$|E

In absence of any other signal, all trains were obliged to stop at the board to await instructions; the dispatcher, however, could show a green <b>hand</b> <b>lamp</b> to an approaching train, which allowed its crew to ignore the stop board.

50|$|A coal train {{preceding}} the Flying Scotsman {{on the main}} East Coast up (south-bound) line was normally scheduled to be shunted into a siding at Abbots Ripton to allow the much faster Flying Scotsman to pass. Because of a very bad snowstorm, both the coal train and the Flying Scotsman were running late and the signalman at Holme, the next station north of Abbots Ripton, judged that the coal train needed to go into sidings at Holme {{if it was not}} to delay the Flying Scotsman. He therefore set his signal levers to danger so as to stop the coal train, but it continued on the main line until it reached Abbots Ripton, where as expected the signalman waved it on to his box with a <b>hand</b> <b>lamp,</b> and directed it to shunt. The goods train had nearly completed shunting into the Abbots Ripton siding when the Scotch express ran into it at speed. The wreckage obstructed the down (northbound) line and a second collision occurred some minutes later when a northbound express to Leeds crashed into the wreckage. Thirteen passengers died in the collisions, and 53 passengers and 6 traincrew members were injured.|$|E
50|$|The Rother Valley Railway {{opened a}} small {{platform}} at Junction Road in 1900 as an informal private stopping {{place for the}} benefit of the tenant of the adjoining fields who enjoyed shooting rights over the land. The station was situated on the eastern side of a level crossing adjacent to Udiam Farm on the turnpike road from Hawkhurst to Hastings called Junction Road (now part of the B2244 road). The crossing was originally gated but cattle grids were later provided. The existence of the platform was discovered by the Board of Trade in January 1903 during an inspection of the line by Major Pringle who had stopped at the site to examine the new cattle grids. After the inspection, Colonel Stephens, the proprietor of the Rother Valley Railway, wrote to the Board of Trade to obtain permission to open the halt to the public. The station would be unstaffed and trains would only call as required. The Board of Trade indicated its willingness to authorise the halt so long as the railway provided suitable lights for trains calling in the hours of darkness. Despite Stephens' reply that guards would be instructed to aid passengers with a <b>hand</b> <b>lamp,</b> the Board of Trade still insisted on lights.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of synathropic rodents {{may be difficult}} since they are animals with nocturnal activity. Methods of their detection and monitoring rely mostly on indirect signs of their activity such {{as the presence of}} faeces, urine, consumed foods and damaged materials. Our experimental hypothesis was that the production of fluorescent faeces - following consumption of fluorescent bait - may be used for rodent monitoring. For this purpose we studied the production of fluorescent faeces, temporal dynamics and detectability in wild black rat (Rattus rattus). Wild black rats were individually housed in experimental cages with the wire-mesh grid floor and faeces were collected in short-time intervals. The peak of fluorescent activity in faeces was detected 10 - 20 hours after bait ingestion. We found that there is only relatively short delay between bait consumption and defecation and fluorescent faeces are easily detectable at distance using an ultraviolet <b>hand</b> <b>lamp.</b> Thus, this method can contribute to effective monitoring of rodent pests...|$|E

These results were in good agreement with their greenish-white powders and it is characteristic of phosphorescent metal complexes from the weak Cu(I) -Cu(I) metallophilic interaction. Upon direct or stepwise exposure to ethanol vapor with series of concentrations (12. 5, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 Î¼L in 22 mg of chemosensor), the emission of chemosensor complex A was not shifted even after 1 d. Interestingly, chemosensor complex B showed gradually changes in both emission band with shifting from 602 to 552 nm and color with changing from orange to green under Ultra-violet (UV) <b>hand</b> <b>lamp</b> (254 nm) at the dark room due to the attachment of benzyl ring to the pyrazole ligand.

40|$|Vapochromism using optical chemosensors of d 10 group metal {{complexes}} have a {{great potential}} for sensing different kinds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by vapor-triggered color and luminescence changes. Since organic aromatic vapors are mainly hazardous and carcinogenic to human health and environment, it is interesting challenge to develop the low-cost vapochromic chemosensors with high sensing capability. On the other hands, inorganic complexes and materials {{have been found to}} change their color and luminescence properties by modifying molecular structures. However, there is no study on, the relationship of molecular structures for chemosensors of VOCs such as aromatic vapors. Therefore, we report systematic study on by using supramolecular assembly of a weak metal-metal interaction, optical response of trinuclear copper(I) pyrazolate complexes ([Cu 3 Pz 3]) for vapochromic chemosensors of benzene, toluene and hexafluorobenzene. The [Cu 3 Pz 3] complexes have been successfully synthesized from 3, 5 -dimethyl (complex A), 3, 5 -trifluoromethyl (complex B), 3, 5 -diphenyl (complex C) and 4 -(3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl) - 3, 5 -dimethyl (complex D) pyrazole ligands as a solid powder.

The sensing capability of all [Cu 3 Pz 3] complexes with different molecular side-chains showed different phenomena depending on the types of aromatic solvents. In contrast to no response of complex A upon exposure to VOCs, complexes B and C showed gradually quenching of the intensity due to cleavage of Cu(I) -Cu(I) interaction.

40|$|Neuroendocrine (NE) {{prostate}} cancer (PCa) {{is a highly}} aggressive subtype of {{prostate cancer}} associated with resistance to androgen ablation therapy. In this study, we used LNCaP prostate cancer cells cultured in a serum-free medium for 6 days as a NE model of prostate cancer. Serum deprivation increased the expression of NE markers such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Î²III tubulin (Î²III tub) and decreased {{the expression of the}} androgen receptor protein in LNCaP cells. Using cDNA microarrays, we compared gene expression profiles of NE cells and non-differentiated LNCaP cells. We identified up-regulation of 155 genes, among them LAMP 2, a lysosomal membrane protein involved in lysosomal stability and autophagy. We then confirmed up-regulation of LAMP 2 in NE cells by qRT-PCR, Western blot and confocal microscopy assays, showing that mRNA up-regulation correlated with increased levels of LAMP 2 protein. Subsequently, we determined autophagy activity in NE cells by assessing the protein levels of SQSTM/p 62 and LC 3 by Western blot and LC 3 and Atg 5 mRNAs content by qRT-PCR. The decreased levels of SQSTM/p 62 was accompanied by an enhanced expression of LC 3 and ATG 5, suggesting activation of autophagy in NE cells. Blockage of autophagy with 1 Î¼M AKT inhibitor IV, or by silencing Beclin 1 and Atg 5, prevented NE cell differentiation, as revealed by decreased levels of the NE markers. In addition, AKT inhibitor IV as well as Beclin 1 and Atg 5 kwockdown attenuated LAMP 2 expression in NE cells. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>LAMP</b> 2 knockdown by siRNA led to a marked blockage of autophagy, prevention of NE differentiation and decrease of cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that LAMP 2 overexpression assists NE differentiation of LNCaP cells induced by serum deprivation and facilitates autophagy activity in order to attain the NE phenotype and cell survival. LAMP 2 could thus be a potential biomarker and potential target for NE prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Yuki Goto, Takayuki Katoh & Hiroaki Suga ### Abstract Genetic code {{reprogramming}} is {{a method}} for the reassignment of arbitrary codons from proteinogenic amino acids to non-proteinogenic ones, and thus specific sequences of non-standard peptides can be ribosomally expressed according to their mRNA templates. We have developed a protocol that facilitates the genetic code reprogramming using flexizymes integrated with a custom-made in-vitro translation apparatus, {{referred to as the}} flexible in-vitro translation (FIT) system. Flexizymes are flexible tRNA acylation ribozymes that enable the preparation of a diverse array of non-proteinogenic acyl-tRNAs. These acyl-tRNAs read vacant codons created in the FIT system, yielding the desired non-standard peptides with diverse exotic structures, such as N-methyl amino acids, D-amino acids and physiologically stable macrocyclic scaffolds. We here describe a protocol for the preparation of DNA templates for flexizymes, tRNAs, microhelix RNA, and mRNAs that are used for genetic code reprogramming with flexizymes. ### Reagents 1.
