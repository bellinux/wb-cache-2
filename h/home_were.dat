5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer felt safe in his old neighborhood. In the 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at <b>home</b> <b>were</b> Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E
5|$|SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2004) has {{provided}} the Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989, but also been criticized for its football sightlines and atmosphere. Even crowds of about 30,000 can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed environment does, at least, remove the elements and is an advantage to passers and comfortable for fans. Two critical opportunities {{to find a new}} <b>home</b> <b>were</b> missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year.|$|E

5|$|As regiments {{organized}} and reorganized, Union soldiers continued to gather at Indianapolis, sometimes {{as many as}} 12,000 at a time. Indianapolis regiments formed in 1862 included the 70th Indiana, {{under the command of}} Benjamin Harrison, and the 79th Indiana, under the command of Frederick Knefler. Popular gathering spots for the soldiers included Monument Circle and University Park. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' <b>Home</b> <b>were</b> established in Indianapolis in 1862 and in 1863, respectively, to house and feed Indiana's soldiers and their families as they passed through Indianapolis. City residents continued to aid Union soldiers by providing food, clothing, equipment, and supplies. Soldiers' aid societies and the Indiana Sanitary Commission, established in 1862 with its headquarters in Indianapolis, raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. The women of Indianapolis also organized groups, usually local Ladies' Aid Societies, to provide soldiers with blankets and clothing, and helped raise funds for additional troop supplies.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis, {{the state}} capital of Indiana, was a major base {{of support for the}} Union. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major {{supporter}} of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place to organize and train troops for the Union army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground to organize and train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' <b>Home</b> <b>were</b> established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union soldiers and their families as they passed through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided nursing care, and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866.|$|E
2500|$|The last Sears Modern <b>Homes</b> catalog <b>was</b> {{issued in}} 1940.

Many of these <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> based on models from the 1940 and earlier Sears catalogs but not all were, leading to debate over whether these homes qualify as [...] "Sears Catalog Homes".

5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at <b>home</b> <b>were</b> pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E

One Direction became the first group to bow atop the Billboard 200 with their first two albums since American girl group Danity Kane entered with Welcome to the Dollhouse in 2008 and their self-titled debut in 2006, the second act in 2012 to achieve two number-one albums within a 12-month period alongside Justin Bieber, and the first boy band in US chart history to land two number-one albums in a calendar year. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 5 December 2012, denoting shipments of one million copies. It became their second album in 2012 to top the one million mark in US sales in the week of 16 December 2012, making them the first act to achieve the feat in a calendar year since 2009, and the first group or duo to achieve the feat since Rascal Flatts in 2007.

One significant advantage of the catalog <b>homes</b> <b>was</b> the ease with which they could be added onto.

5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy propane tank was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area.
