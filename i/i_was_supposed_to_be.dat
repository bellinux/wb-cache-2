500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, he mused on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I was terribly unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't quite sure what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing. I wish there had been someone around who could have told me." ...|$|E
500|$|Houllier was {{disappointed}} with Liverpool's start and noticed his players {{struggled with the}} humidity. He nevertheless saw set-pieces {{as an opportunity to}} score goals from and felt the equaliser turned the final in his team's favour: [...] "Suddenly the confidence switches to the other camp. They're affected, they become a bit unsettled, and you keep going." [...] Houllier revealed he gave a frank assessment of the task facing his players before the match; although in his words Arsenal were [...] "...probably a bit better than us, probably more mature, more experienced, more ability in some areas," [...] dealing with setbacks would make the difference on the day. He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he answered his critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the worst header and the worst player with my left foot in the league, and how could an England player play when they haven't got a left foot.... It does go to show that I have improved and I am improving." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I {{was trying to get}} that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the songs}} for The Beatles were written during a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. The retreat {{involved}} long periods of meditation, conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours – a chance, in John Lennon's words, to [...] "get away from everything". Both Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting [...] "clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms" [...] to review their new work. [...] "Regardless of what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing," [...] Lennon later recalled, [...] "I did write {{some of my best}} songs there." [...] Author Ian MacDonald said Sgt Pepper was [...] "shaped by LSD", but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison's development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became [...] "privately prolific", given his customary junior status in the group.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm not going to say that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E

Snowden had a seat reserved to continue to Cuba but did not board that onward flight, saying in a January 2014 interview that he intended to transit through Russia but was stopped en route. He asserted [...] "a planeload of reporters documented the seat <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in" [...] when he was ticketed for Havana, but the U.S. cancelled his passport. He said the U.S. wanted him to stay in Moscow so [...] "they could say, 'He's a Russian spy.'" [...] Greenwald's account differed on the point of Snowden being already ticketed. According to Greenwald, Snowden's passport was valid when he departed Hong Kong but was revoked during the hours he was in transit to Moscow, preventing him from obtaining a ticket to leave Russia. Greenwald said Snowden was thus forced to stay in Moscow and seek asylum.|$|E
