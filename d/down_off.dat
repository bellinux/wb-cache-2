5|$|Another catch went <b>down</b> <b>off</b> Miller {{late in the}} {{day when}} Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E

5|$|As several squads {{left the}} hill on a patrol, North Koreans {{attacked}} the main company position behind it. The platoon dropped <b>down</b> <b>off</b> the ridge into a gully on the left. Some {{of the men}} in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured most near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned back this attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E

Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible.

5|$|Koch {{returned}} to the East Indies operation, and on 30 January 1942, when in command of Corio, he was shot <b>down</b> <b>off</b> Timor by seven Japanese Zeros whilst carrying out a relief flight to Surabaya, Dutch East Indies. Of the eighteen people on board, five survived. Koch was wounded by gunfire in the left leg and left arm, and broke his right leg in the subsequent crash landing. Despite the injuries, he swam about five miles to the shore where he was looked after by local people, until the Dutch Navy found the survivors some days later, and rescued them with a Dornier flying boat. Some three weeks later, he was in Darwin hospital {{on the day of}} the first Japanese raid on Darwin. By good fortune, the QEA flying boat Camilla survived the raid, and Koch was flown to Sydney for treatment.|$|E
5|$|Sinop was {{refitted}} in Nikolaev with torpedo bulges {{to serve}} as 'mine-bumpers' in 1916 {{to allow her to}} lead other ships into the mined waters of the Bosphorus, but the operation was later cancelled. She was captured by the Germans in April 1918 in Sevastopol and was handed over to the Allies in November 1918. The British sabotaged her engines on 25 April 1919 as they abandoned the Whites to prevent any use by the advancing Bolsheviks. Sinop therefore remained at Sevastopol {{for the duration of the}} Russian Civil War, being captured by both sides as they occupied the city in turn, but was then abandoned by Wrangel's fleet when it evacuated the Crimea in 1920. Although Russian archives say that Sinop was gradually scrapped from 1922, an underwater expedition under the leadership of Robert Ballard found a wreck that has been tentatively identified as Sinop upside <b>down</b> <b>off</b> not far from Sevastopol.|$|E
5|$|Acting on a {{tip from}} Strax, the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes. He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon's office that {{contains}} psychic snow. The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence, the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon {{since he was a}} boy. He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer's pond. The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara is putting the children to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra, Jenny and Strax. Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess' ice body. The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead. They are pursued by the ice governess, whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals. Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key, but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara <b>down</b> <b>off</b> the cloud.|$|E

5|$|At 23:00 on August 29, the North Koreans {{attacked}} C Company again. Men on {{the left}} flank of the company position quickly abandoned their positions and soon the entire company was retreating, leaving the North Koreans in possession of the mountain again. Captain Lawrence M. Corcoran, the company commander, was left with only the 17 men in his command post, which included several wounded. All of those who stayed were later given Bronze Star Medals. After daylight on August 30, UN air strikes again came in on Battle Mountain, and US artillery, mortar, and tank fire from the valley concentrated on the North Korean-held peak. A wounded US soldier came <b>down</b> <b>off</b> the mountain where he had hidden for several hours while cut off from escape. He reported that {{the main body of}} the North Koreans had withdrawn to the wooded ridges west of the peak for better cover from the airstrikes, leaving only a small covering force on the mountain itself. At 11:00, B Company, which had to this point been the reserve unit, with the 3rd Battalion in support, attacked toward the heights and retook the top by 13:00. The poor defensive positions were repaired but logistical difficulties continued for the US troops at the top.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet bore <b>down</b> <b>off</b> the Giglio Island {{in a line}} astern {{with the}} galleons and the galleys at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and galleys, and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the lightness of the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line to catch it between two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag galleon Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan galleys, the galleon Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian galleys, other large Spanish galleons.|$|E
5|$|Because Miami {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. After Miami's kickoff and a touchback, Tech began the first possession {{of the second half}} at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a quick first <b>down</b> <b>off</b> a rush each by Lawrence, Dovel, and Casey. Lawrence picked up another with two rushes that resulted in 13 yards and drove the Hokies to their 44-yard line. There, Casey completed his longest pass of the game — a 42-yard throw to tight end Rob Purdham — that gave Tech a first down at the Miami 14-yard line. Tech continued to drive, picking up short yardage with multiple rushes. The Hokies suffered a near-disaster when Lawrence fumbled the ball, but Tech retained possession when the ball rolled out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays after the fumble, Lawrence vaulted over the goal line for Tech's first and only touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech cut Miami's lead to 1410 with 8:52 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|In 1679 a {{group of}} Covenanters killed Archbishop Sharp. The {{incident}} led to a rising that grew to 5,000 men. They were defeated by forces under James, Duke of Monmouth, the King's illegitimate son, at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. Two ministers were executed and 250 followers shipped to Barbados, 200 drowning when their ship went <b>down</b> <b>off</b> Orkney. The rebellion {{eventually led to the}} fall of Lauderdale, who was replaced by the King's brother, the openly Catholic James, known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany. The dissenters, led by Donald Cargill and Richard Cameron called themselves the Society People, but would be become known after their leader as the Cameronians. Reduced in number, hiding out in the moors, they became increasingly radical. On 22 June 1680, the Sanquhar Declaration was posted in Sanquhar, renouncing Charles II as king. Cameron was killed the next month. Cargill excommunicated the King, Duke of Albany and other royalists at the Torwood Conventicle and his followers now separated themselves from all other Presbyterian ministers. Cargill was captured and executed in May 1681.|$|E

25|$|A major {{contributor}} to the environmental degradation and barrier to the regeneration of forests was the grazing of domestic animals. Animals grazed and destroyed land areas unsuitable for cultivation. The consumption of hillside plants and young trees caused erosion, stripping hillsides of soils and eventually exposing bare rock.
