5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), <b>thumb</b> <b>screws,</b> iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a right-hand thread; a common mnemonic device for remembering this {{when working with}} screws or bolts is [...] "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." [...] Another rule is this: curl the fingers of your right hand around the <b>screw</b> with your <b>thumb</b> pointing is the direction you want the screw to go. If the screw is right-handed (most screws are) and you turn the screw {{in the direction of}} your fingers the screw will move in the direction of your <b>thumb.</b> <b>Screws</b> with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.|$|R

50|$|The tribrach is {{attached}} to the tripod and placed over the monument. Looking through the optical plummet pick up two of the tripod legs and position the cross hairs over the monument. Tread all three legs into the grass, bitumen, concrete. Look through the optical plummet and using the thumbscrews put the cross hairs back over the monument. Adjust the level of the tribrach by slackening the tripod screws and sliding the legs. Re-center the cross hairs using the <b>thumb</b> <b>screws,</b> then fine-tune the level using the tripod legs. Once the tribrach is nearly centered over the monument, level the tribrach the last little bit using the thumbscrews. Slacken the tribrach from the tripod head and slide it the last 4-5mm so that it is centered over the monument and level. If the target over which the instrument is to be placed is roughly at the same elevation as the tripod feet, the preceding technique is applicable. However, if there is a considerable difference between the elevation of the target and the elevation of the tripod feet, such as when the target is in a deep hole or raised on a shelf or wall, it will not work, as the target will appear to move laterally by a large distance in the optical plummet as the tripod legs are raised or lowered.|$|R
40|$|In microtomy, faults of {{the cutting}} edge are an obvious and avoidable source of artifact. The purpose of this {{communication}} is to describe a simple apparatus for viewing and marking {{the cutting edge}} of the glass knives which are used in seetioning for electron microscopy (1, 2). The apparatus consists of a monocular microscope with base, arm, body tube, coarse and fine adjustments, an annular incident light objective lens, and a mechanical stage that has been modified to hold a glass knife. The apparatus is illustrated in Text-fig. 1. The advantage of the annular incident light illumination is that rough surfaces reflect light into the objective and appear bright; an effect opposite to that obtained when strictly vertical illumination is used. A facet without faults appears as a narrow, white line in a dark field, while a faulty or dirty edge is a speckled, widened, or fissured white line. Three different knives are shown in Figs. 1 to 3. We have found a 50 × objective lens combined with a 15 × eyepiece satisfactory for discriminating between cutting edges. The glass knife is mounted vertically between a rigid pillar and <b>thumb</b> <b>screw</b> allowing adjustment of the angle of viewing. This vertical mounting together with the length of the objective lens make it necessary to increase the usual working distance between the objective lens and the mechanical stage. To that end a block was placed in the arm of the microscope above the mechanical stage. * This investigation was supported by Researc...|$|R

40|$|As MRI guided {{interventions}} {{are becoming more}} widely practiced, {{the goal of this}} thesis was to design an instrument guidance device for MRI-guided percutaneous interventions in closed bore systems, namely cryoablation procedures where multiple probes need to be placed to treat a tumor. Multiple meetings with researchers and clinicians the Brigham and Women's Hospital were conducted to understand the challenges currently faced by interventionists, to set functional requirements for the design of a system to overcome them, and to help select a clinically viable strategy. The strategy selected involved making a device that had two degrees of angular freedom about a remote center of motion located at the probe entry point on the skin. This device is designed to be incorporated with a custom built MR coil. Structural and finite element analysis was conducted for a number of different mechanism concepts to examine their stiffness and the effect of structural displacements on the end-point probe placement accuracy. The selected concept was a curved arm piece that travels around the pivot point on a circular base, and an additional needle holder that travels along the curved arm. The sliding parts were designed with five points of constraint so that only sliding motion was possible. <b>Thumb</b> <b>screws</b> were used for preload and locking so that the probe guide could be locked along a specific trajectory. The device was prototyped via stereolithography as a proof of concept. It was found that sanding was required to fit the parts together because of overbuild in the stereolithography process. The parts functioned as designed and demonstrated that a probe could be angled about a remote pivot point. However, wear of the plastic parts eventually caused increased play between the plastic parts. Further testing and optimization of the device is planned. by Xuefeng Chen. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|A {{simplified}} method for {{the determination of}} diffusion coefficients, {{and the use of}} the latter in the calculation of molecular radii and weights, have been described by Northrop and Anson (1). The use of the method has been extended to the study of crystalline pepsin and crystalline trypsin, in an attempt to separate by fractional diffusion (2) molecules responsible for the proteolytic activity from those containing protein nitrogen. The fact that no fractionation could be ascertained by this method, since the diffusion of proteolytic activity and of protein nitrogen ran parallel, was interpreted as evidence that the former is an integral property of the protein molecule. The determination of the diffusion coefficient of crystalline trypsin is here reported in detail. Assembly of the Apparatua. l [...] The apparatus was assembled somewhat differently from the description given by Northrop and Anson (1) and is illustrated in Fig. 1. The outer vessel measured 6 X 20 era. The siphon tube was 2 to 3 mrn~ inside diameter, so that the fixed error due to the fact that free diffusion does not take place into the liquid in the tube was negligible. The outer vessel was held by a large condenser clamp which in turn was mounted on a ring-stand with tripod base, two of whose feet were fitted with <b>thumb</b> <b>screws</b> to facilitate leveling of the apparatus. The outer vessel was partially submerged, as shown, in a large water-bath set up in a room in which the temperature was maintained at 5 ° 4 - 1 °C. During the day when the room was used extensively and the temperature tended to rise, it was necessary to control the temperature of the bath by the addition of ice. Care must be taken that the apparatus is mounted where it will not be subjected to vibrations or sudden jars. To this end, the bath was not stirred mechanically. Also, to avoid disturbances during the withdrawal of samples, a rubber tube of small diameter and about 2 feet long was permanently attached to the siphon tube during an experiment, and the samples were withdrawn b...|$|R
