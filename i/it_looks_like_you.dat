Wayne Lukas Oxbow's racing career began on August 3, 2012, at Saratoga Race Course in an $80,000 maiden race at [...] under jockey Junior Alvarado. Listed at odds of 22-1, he was slow {{out of the gate}} and in sixth early on. He took an awkward step going into the turn, and as a result, his jockey pulled him up and he was taken off the track in a horse ambulance. In October, Oxbow was given another chance in a $50,000 maiden race at [...] at Keeneland Race Course. At 11-1 under jockey Jon Court, he broke sharply and led the field at the quarter-mile post. At the top of the homestretch he was caught by Winning Cause, and ultimately finished fourth with a speed figure of 73. On October 31, he ran in another $50,000 maiden race at seven furlongs at Lukas' home track, Churchill Downs. At 17-1 under jockey Terry Thompson, Oxbow came out of the gate ninth, but as in his previous race, had the lead by the quarter-mile post.

40|$|The Spiritual Health And Life-Orientation Measure (SHALOM) is a 20 -item {{instrument}} that assesses {{the quality of}} relationships of the respondent with self, others, the environment and/or a Transcendent Other. In the Transcendental domain, {{four of the five}} items had the words ‘God, ‘Divine’ and ‘Creator’ replaced by the word ‘Transcendent’ to make the survey more generic by removing any implied reference to any god or religion. Invitations to complete a web survey were sent to people who had published papers in spirituality, or belonged to associations for spirituality or religious studies, as well as the Australian Atheist Forum. 409 respondents from 14 geographic regions, completed the survey. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the modified, generic form of SHALOM showed acceptable model fit, comprising four clearly delineated domains of spiritual well-being. The paper analyses the results derived from using the modified, generic version and, in comparison with results of applications of the original survey instrument, concludes with discussion of the comparative utility of each of the versions of SHALOM. Further studies with more people are warranted, but, from evidence presented here, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can’t beat relating with God for spiritual well-being...|$|E
40|$|The great {{microbiologist}} Hans Zinsser {{observed in}} 1934 that, “Infectious disease {{is one of}} the few genuine adventures left in the world. ” 1 During the past quarter century, this statement has taken on new meaning with the advent of AIDS, Hantavirus infections, West Nile encephalitis, and most recently, avian influenza. In all of these, at least initially, a virus is transmitted from animals to humans. When I went to medical school in the 1960 s, where we incidentally used Zinsser’s textbook of microbiology, we were taught that viruses were species-specific and couldn’t jump from an animal to humans. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can forget that rule. On page 273 in this issue of the Journal, infectious disease specialist Steve Gordon discusses avian influenza, puts it into perspective with more mundane human influenza A, with which we are all unfortunately familiar, and proposes a preventive strategy involving mandatory immunization of health care workers (that’s us, folks). The goal here is to prevent our becoming a reservoir of infection and thus posing an unacceptable risk to our patients. However much we might not like that approach...|$|E

5000|$|Pastore {{served as}} the {{chairman}} of United States Senate Subcommittee on Communications. He is probably best remembered for taking part in a 1969 hearing involving a $20 million grant for the funding of PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was proposed by former President Lyndon Johnson. President Richard Nixon had wanted to cut the proposed funding to $10 million due {{to the demands of the}} Vietnam War, and Fred Rogers, host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, appeared before the committee to argue for the full $20 million. In about six minutes of testimony, Rogers spoke of the need for social and emotional education that public television provided. Pastore was not previously familiar with Rogers' work, and was sometimes described as gruff and impatient. However, he told Rogers that the testimony had given him goose bumps, and after Rogers recited the lyrics to [...] "What Do You Do with the Mad that You Feel?", one of the songs from his show, Pastore finally declared: [...] "I think it's wonderful.

5000|$|... "First of all, the Iceman and the PS10 {{have about}} as much in common as a Chevy and a Rolls Royce. The PS10 came about in the '70s, {{when we were on}} our first trip to Japan. Ibanez was {{interested}} in me doing a signature guitar with them. They wanted to me to design something new, and we did go through their catalog, I saw a picture of a guitar that was not terribly popular. I liked the asymmetrical shape to it; it reminded me of a Firebird or a Rickenbacker bass turned upside down. It had one pickup on <b>it</b> that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> took three bobbins from a humbucker and put them together somehow. It also had that wacky knob that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> were to change your television channels with it! I said, [...] "You've got something here, but you don't {{know what to do with}} it." [...] My feeling about Ibanez in the '70s, like many companies in Japan, was that they were excellent at copying but they didn't know why they were copying. We sat down, and by using that basic shape, I came up with a guitar: construction, frets, inlays, wiring, the type of tail block that has a sustain block built into it, the half-brass/half-bone nut, and so on. In other words, we took a shape and made a new guitar. Although there is still a guitar called an Iceman and some people use the name interchangeably with the PS10, they really have nothing in common except a silhouette".|$|R

5000|$|The video {{depicts the}} nine members of Slipknot playing {{in groups of}} three as well as footage of each {{individual}} member submerged underwater. Percussionist and co-director Crahan explained that {{when he tries to}} write treatments for their music videos he always thinks, [...] "What has Slipknot not done? What can we embark upon that will be fun and knowledge-enhancing instead of the same old song and dance?", saying that the members themselves are the treatment for this video. This further shows that they always try to give their fans as much of themselves as they can even although they are tired of live performances, revealing that in order to change things up they shot the members performing in groups of three. The concept of the band members appearing individually underwater was modeled after a video installation entitled [...] "Ascension" [...] by video artist Bill Viola. Crahan explained that the smell of sulfur is [...] "something people either love or hate, and if you hate it, then it can be suffocating", so they incorporated water as a visual representation of this. He also went on to reveal that the members felt more uncomfortable when shooting in an eleven-foot glass tank, explaining, [...] "you had to go up this really weird ladder and the water was dirty and it was a five-foot by five-foot tank and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> when <b>you</b> stepped into it you were gonna hit your head on the frame that holds the glass and it would just rip your nose off", but {{he went on to say}} that it was his favorite video so far [...] "because it involved that fear".
