In all six models, the presence of the warm pool generates zonal asymmetries in the simulated mean states {{in the form of a}} ''Gill-type'' response, made more complex by feedbacks between moisture, convective heating and circulation. Noticeable differences appear from one model to another. Only half the models simulate mean low-level <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerlies</b> over the warm pool area. The presence of the warm pool can also favor the development of large-scale variability consistent with observed Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) characteristics, but this happens only in half the models.

Comparing spectral characteristics of the simulated Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves (CCEWs) in the aquaplanet experiments and the corresponding coupled atmosphere-ocean (i. e., CMIP) and atmosphere-only (i. e., AMIP) simulations, we also show that there is more consistency for a given model across its configurations, than for a given configuration across the six models.

40|$|This article {{describes}} and validates a new conceptual model for understanding Sahel rainfall variability. This conceptual model {{provides a framework}} that can readily incorporate and synthesize the roles played by the oceans, the African landmass and local meteorological factors. The most important local factors are {{the location of the}} African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and the associated shears. The position of the AEJ helps to distinguish between a wet mode and a dry mode in the Sahel, while other factors determine which of two spatial patterns prevail during years of the dry regime. We test the paradigm by contrasting selected circulation parameters for the years 1958 - 1967 (representing the wet mode) and 1968 - 1997 (representing the dry mode). In doing so, we have identified several changes in the general atmospheric circulation that have accompanied the shift to drier conditions. The AEJ is further southward and more intense, the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is further south, the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) is weaker, the <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerlies</b> are shallower and weaker, the southwesterly monsoon flow is weaker, and the relative humidity is lower (but not consistently so). The {{results of this study suggest}} that the key factor controlling the occurrence of the wet Sahel mode versus the dry mode is the presence of deep, well-developed <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerlies.</b> These displace the AEJ northward into Sahelian latitudes and increase the shear instabilities. The westerlies appear to be at least partially responsible for the well-known association between a weaker AEJ and wetter conditions in the Sahel, because the thermal wind induced by the Sahara/Atlantic temperature gradient is imposed upon a westerly basic state. Since one of the strongest contrasts between the wet Sahel and dry Sahel modes is the strength of the TEJ, the TEJ probably also plays a pivotal role in rainfall variability. In the dry mode, the <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerlies</b> are poorly developed and the core of the AEJ lies well to the south of the Sahel. The dry mode consists of two basic spatial patterns, depending on whether the Guinea Coast Region is anomalously wet or dry (the well-known dipole and no-dipole patterns, respectively). Which occurs is determined by other factors acting to reduce the intensity of the rainbelt. One of the relevant factors appears to be sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Gulf of Guinea...|$|R

In that respect, we applied an EOF analysis to the onshore flow of moisture along the west coast of southern Africa using NCEP-DOE AMIP II Re-analyses. It reveals two dominant modes of variability that are linked to (a) the latitudinal movement of the South Atlantic anticyclone (b) the intensity of the flow that penetrates from the tropical Atlantic.

However, these transient modes are produced in a complex basic state which includes both horizontal and vertical shear and horizontal stretching deformation.

Analysis of in situ measurements and a model-assimilated dataset reveals a strong influence of subsurface thermocline variability on sea surface temperature (SST) in this upwelling zone. El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is found to be the dominant forcing for the SIO thermocline variability, with SST variability off Sumatra, Indonesia, also making a significant contribution. When either an El Niño or Sumatra cooling event takes place, anomalous easterlies appear in the equatorial Indian Ocean, forcing a westward-propagating downwelling Rossby wave in the SIO. In phase with this dynamic Rossby wave, there is a pronounced copropagation of SST. Moreover, a positive precipitation anomaly is found over, or just to the south of, the Rossby wave–induced positive SST anomaly, resulting in a cyclonic circulation in the surface wind field that appears to feedback onto the SST anomaly. Finally, this downwelling Rossby wave also increases tropical cyclone activity in the SIO through its SST effect. This coupled Rossby wave thus offers potential predictability for SST and tropical cyclones in the western SIO. These results suggest that models that allow for the existence of upwelling and Rossby wave dynamics will have better seasonal forecasts than ones that use a slab ocean mixed layer. The lagged-correlation analysis shows that SST anomalies off Java, Indonesia, tend to precede those off Sumatra by a season, a time lead that may further increase the Indian Ocean predictability. 1...|$|R

Also, while the zonal wind anomalies over the equatorial central Pacific are westerly, those over the equatorial far western Pacific are easterly. The nearly out-of-phase behavior between the eastern and western tropical Pacific is also observed during the cold phase of ENSO, but with anomalies of opposite sign.

The first and second interannuaI modes contain many atmospheric features related to extremes in the Southem Oscillation. These include I) variations in the pattem of tropical convection, and 2) changes in the intensity of upper-tropospheric zonal flow in the equatorial band and in the subtropics. The first intraseasonal mode has its greatest loadings in the Tropics and is most active during the southem summer season. For positive (negative) amplitudes ofthis mode, anomalous upper-tropospheric westerly (easterly) flow dominates the Tropics throughout the region, and positive (negative) OLR anomalies are observed over northeastem South America and over the eastem equatorial Pacifico These features {{are associated with the}} 30 - 60 day (Madden-Julian) oscillation. An extended combined EOF analysis was performed to study the evolution of intraseasonal oscillations in the South American sector. The first rotated combined extended EOF mode describes a sequence of pattems in which anomalous <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerlies</b> and positive OLR anomalies over tropical Brazil gradually weaken and then reverse. The largest loadings throughout the evolution of the pattems contained in the first mode remain in the Tropics and subtropics. These results provide information on the combined relationship between atmospheric circulation and convection over the South American sector and on the evolution of pattems associated with 30 - 60 day (intraseasonal) oscillations. By projecting the combined fields of anomalous OLR and 250 -mb zonal and meridional wind onto the individual pattems contained in the first rotated combined extended EOF mode, one obtains indices that should enhance real-time monitoring efforts and may lead to improved monthly forecasts for the South American sector.

40|$|Hurricane and {{tropical}} storm statistics verify the modulation of eastern Pacific tropical systems by the Madden– Julian oscillation (MJO) as hypothesized by Maloney and Hartmann. Over {{twice as many}} named tropical systems (hurricanes {{and tropical}} storms) accompany <b>equatorial</b> 850 -mb <b>westerly</b> anomalies than accompany equatorial easterly anomalies, and the systems that do exist are stronger. Hurricanes are over four times more numerous during westerly phases of the MJO than during easterly phases. The current study constructs a composite life cycle of the MJO during May–November 1979 – 95 using an index based on the 850 -mb equatorial zonal wind. Equatorial Kelvin waves propagating eastward from convective regions of the western Pacific Ocean alter dynamical conditions over the eastern Pacific Ocean. <b>Westerly</b> (easterly) <b>equatorial</b> 850 -mb wind anomalies are accompanied by enhanced (suppressed) convection over the eastern Pacific hurricane region. Convection locally amplifies the wind anomalies over the eastern Pacific. Cyclonic horizontal shear of the low-level zonal wind and low vertical wind shear support tropical cyclogenesis. Periods of <b>equatorial</b> 850 -mb <b>westerly</b> wind anomalies associated with the MJO are accompanied by cyclonic low-level relative vorticity anomalies and near-zero vertical wind shear over the eastern Pacific hurricane region. Easterly periods are accompanied by anticyclonic vorticity anomalies and less-favorable vertical wind shear. The vorticity anomalies are associated with variations in the meridional shear of the zonal wind. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{contrasting}} behaviour of westward-moving mixed Rossby-gravity (WMRG) and {{the first}} Rossby (R 1) waves in El Niño (EN) and La Niña (LN) seasons is documented {{with a focus on}} the Northern Hemisphere winter. The eastward-moving variance in the upper troposphere is dominated by WMRG and R 1 structures that appear to be Doppler-shifted by the flow and are referred to as WMRG-E and R 1 -E. In the East Pacific and Atlantic the years with stronger <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerly</b> winds have the stronger WMRG and WMRG- E. In the East Pacific, R 1 is also a maximum in LN. However, R 1 -E exhibits an eastward-shift between LN and EN. The changes with ENSO phase provide a test-bed for the understanding of these waves. In the East Pacific and Atlantic, the stronger WMRG-E and WMRG with stronger westerlies are in accord with the dispersion relation with simple Doppler-shifting by the zonal flow. The possible existence of free waves can also explain stronger R 1 in EN in the Eastern Hemisphere. 1 -D free wave propagation theory based on wave activity conservation is also important for R 1. However, this theory is unable to explain the amplitude maxima for other waves observed in the strong <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerly</b> regions in the Western Hemisphere, and certainly not their ENSO-related variation. The forcing of equatorial waves by higher latitude wave activity and its variation with ENSO phase is therefore examined. Propagation of extratropical eastward-moving Rossby wave activity through the westerly ducts into the equatorial region where it triggers WMRG-E is favoured in the stronger westerlies, in LN in the East Pacific and EN in the Atlantic. It is also found that WMRG is forced by Southern Hemisphere westward-moving wavetrains arching into the equatorial region where they are reflected. The most significant mechanism for both R 1 and R 1 -E appear to be lateral forcing by subtropical wavetrains...|$|E
40|$|The intraseasonal Madden-Julian {{oscillation}} (MJO) {{involves a}} slow eastward-propagating signal {{in the tropical}} atmosphere which significantly influences climate yet is not well understood despite significant theoretical and observational progress. We study the atmosphere's response to nonlinear "Wind Induced Surface Heat Exchange" (WISHE) forcing in the tropics using a simple shallow water atmospheric model. The model produces an interestingly rich interannual behavior including a slow, eastward propagating <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerly</b> multiscale signal, not consistent with any free linear waves, and with MJO-like characteristics. It is shown that the slow signal {{is due to a}} Kelvin wave forced by WISHE due to the meridional wind induced by a Yanai wave group. The forced Kelvin wave has a velocity similar to the group velocity of the Yanai waves, allowing the two to interact nonlinearly via the WISHE term while slowly propagating eastward. These results may have implications for observed tropical WISHE-related atmospheric intraseasonal phenomena...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStratospheric {{aerosols}} {{from large}} tropical explosive volcanic eruptions backscatter shortwave radiation {{and reduce the}} global mean surface temperature. Observations suggest that they also favour an El Niño within 2 years following the eruption. Modelling studies have, however, so far reached no consensus on either the sign or physical mechanism of El Niño response to volcanism. Here we show that an El Niño tends to peak during the year following large eruptions in simulations of the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5). Targeted climate model simulations further emphasize that Pinatubo-like eruptions tend to shorten La Niñas, lengthen El Niños and induce anomalous warming when occurring during neutral states. Volcanically induced cooling in tropical Africa weakens the West African monsoon, and the resulting atmospheric Kelvin wave drives <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerly</b> wind anomalies over the western Pacific. This wind anomaly is further amplified by air–sea interactions in the Pacific, favouring an El Niño-like response...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{relative}} roles {{played by}} the remote El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing and the local air-sea interactions in the tropical Atlantic are investigated using an intermediate coupled model (ICM) of the tropical Atlantic. The oceanic component of the ICM consists of a six-baroclinic mode ocean model and a simple mixed layer model that has been validated from observations. The atmospheric component is a global atmospheric general circulation model developed at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In a forced context, the ICM realistically simulates both the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) variability in the equatorial band, and the relaxation of the Atlantic northeast trade winds and the intensification of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>westerlies</b> in boreal spring that usually follows an El Niño event. The results of coupled experiments with or without Pacific ENSO forcing and with or without explicit air-sea interactions in the equatorial Atlantic indicate that the background energy in the equatorial Atlantic is provided by ENSO. However, the time scale of the variability and the magnitude of some peculiar events cannot be explained solely by ENSO remote forcing. It is demonstrated that the peak of SSTA variability in the 1 - 3 -yr band as observed in the equatorial Atlantic {{is due to the}} local air-sea interactions and is not a linear response to ENSO. Seasonal phase locking in boreal summer is also the result of the local coupling. The analysis of the intrinsic sustainable modes indicates that the Atlantic El Niño is qualitatively a noise-driven stable system. Such a system can produce coherent interdecadal variability that is not forced by the Pacific or extraequatorial variability. It is shown that when a simple slab mixed layer model is embedded into the system to simulate the northern tropical Atlantic (NTA) SST variability, the warming over NTA following El Niño events have characteristics (location and peak phase) that depend on air-sea interaction in the equatorial Atlantic. In the model, the interaction between the equatorial mode and NTA can produce a dipolelike structure of the SSTA variability that evolves at a decadal time scale. The results herein illustrate the complexity of the tropical Atlantic ocean-atmosphere system, whose predictability jointly depends on ENSO and the connections between the Atlantic modes of variability...|$|R
40|$|The 1997 – 98 El Niño {{was both}} unusually strong and {{terminated}} unusually. Warm eastern equatorial Pacific (EEqP) sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) exceeded 4 °C {{at the event}} peak and lasted well into boreal spring of 1998, even though subsurface temperatures began cooling in December 1997. The oceanic processes that controlled this unusual termination are explored here and can be characterized by three features: (i) eastward propagating equatorial Pacific thermocline (Z tc) shoaling beginning in the central Pacific in November 1997; (ii) persistent warm EEqP SSTA between December 1997 and May 1998, despite strong EEqP Z tc shoaling (and subsurface cooling); and (iii) an abrupt cooling of EEqP SSTA in early May 1998 that exceeded 4 °C within two weeks. It is shown here that these changes can {{be understood in terms}} of the oceanic response to changes to the meridional structure of the near-equatorial zonal wind field. <b>Equatorial</b> near-date-line <b>westerly</b> wind anomalies greatly decreased in late 1997, associated with a southward shift of convective and wind anomalies. In the EEqP, equatorial easterlies disappeared (reappeared) in late January (early May) 1998, driving the springtime extension (abrupt termination) of this El Niño event. The authors suggest that the wind changes arise from fundamentally meridional processes and are tied to the annual cycle of insolation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe upper equatorial Pacific Ocean response to anomalous westerly wind forcing during the 1991 - 92 El Nino was examined using observed oceanographic and atmospheric data from equatorial moorings and the Navy's operational atmospheric analyses. A strong 30 - 60 day signal {{was observed in}} the zonal winds and is mainly a result of westerly wind events. The local response to anomalous westerly winds differed between the western and eastern equatorial Pacific. In the western Pacific, westerly wind events tended to produce rapid decreases in sea surface temperatures (SST) (up to 1 degree C). There decreases were followed several days later by SST increases due to horizontal warm water advection and downwelling. In the central and eastern <b>equatorial</b> Pacific, <b>westerly</b> wind events were expressed mainly as weakenings of the easterlies. These weakenings caused decreases in equatorial upwelling and SST increases Westerly wind events in the western Pacific were also associated with large thermocline temperature fluctuations (on the order of 10 degrees C) in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. These fluctuations propagated eastward at phase speeds consistent with first baroclinic equatorial Kelvic wave dynamics (i. s., 2. 0 - 3. 5 ms- 1). The ocean temperature fluctuations indicate wide wavelengths (about 15 X 10 (3) km), with periods of 30 - 60 days. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
