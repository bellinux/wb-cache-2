5|$|Both {{of these}} discoveries—the space {{weathering}} effects {{and the low}} density—led to a new understanding {{about the relationship between}} S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, {{the most common type of}} meteorite found on the Earth's surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> that of OC meteorites. The Galileo flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record.

Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process.

A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design.

5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E

Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
