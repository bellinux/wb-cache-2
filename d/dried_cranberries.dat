Mechanical and chemical pretreatments were considered, by cutting the fruits in half, by making pin holes in each cranberry, and by dipping the fruits in an alkaline solution. A second pretreatment seemed necessary when <b>drying</b> <b>cranberries</b> in order to reduce their tartness. Cranberries were osmotically dehydrated, by immersing them in osmotic solutions of sucrose or high fructose corn syrup. Once the pretreatment conditions were selected, four drying methods were tested on the pretreated cranberries.

40|$|Historically, {{cranberry}} juice has been consumed to prevent urinary tract infections. These {{and other health}} benefits, including reduced risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease, {{are believed to be}} due to the presence of polyphenolics, specifically flavonoids. Cranberry pomace is the by-product of cranberry processing which consists of seeds and skins. This research focuses primarily on the effects of processing on the flavonoid composition of cranberries and cranberry pomace. First, the concentration of flavonoids during juice processing was evaluated. It was determined that anthocyanins were degraded readily compared to other flavonoids, and a significant amount of flavonoids were retained in the pomace. Additionally, hydrolysis of flavonol glycosides to aglycones occurred due to heat treatment. Next, <b>dried</b> <b>cranberry</b> pomace from industry was characterized based on its proximate and polyphenolic content. The pomace consisted primarily of insoluble dietary fiber and had high concentration of anthocyanins (111. 5 mg/ 100 g DW), flavonols (358. 4 mg/ 100 g DW), and procyanidins of DP 1 - 6 (167. 3 mg/ 100 g DW). Next, extrusion processing was used to alter the flavonoid composition of cranberry pomace. Extrusion processing increased the amounts of DP 1 and DP 2 procyanidins and decreased the amounts of procyanidins with DP 3 ̆e 4. Total flavonols and antioxidant capacity also increased after extrusion. Alkaline hydrolysis was also used to extract procyanidins from cranberry pomace and alter their composition. When compared to conventional extraction, alkaline hydrolysis increased procyanidin oligomer extraction with the greatest increase being DP 1 (14. 9 x) and A-type DP 2 (8. 4 x) procyanidins. Treatment of the residue remaining after conventional extraction using alkaline hydrolysis resulted in further procyanidin extraction, indicating that procyanidins are not fully extracted by conventional methods. This was confirmed by staining samples of cranberry pomace and residues remaining after conventional extraction and alkaline hydrolysis with dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde to visualize procyanidins. Alkaline hydrolysis was also used on other fruit processing by-products, and it was revealed that these by-products also contained bound procyanidins. This research indicates that cranberry pomace is a rich source of polyphenolics, which could be extracted for nutraceutical purposes. Additionally, the composition of procyanidins in the pomace could be altered by extrusion or alkaline hydrolysis to increase their bioavailability and health-promoting properties...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of various biological fertilizers on the growth and development of plants of the large-fruited cranberry and the degree of mycorrhizal association in their roots under controlled conditions. Plants of the ‘Pilgrim’, ‘Stevens’ and ‘Ben Lear’ cranberry cultivars were planted in rhizoboxes filled with soils collected from the areas of Krojczyn and Motoga. The following experimental treatments with fertilizers were applied: control plants, plants fertilized with NPK, a bacterial-mycorrhizal consortium, Vinassa, lignite + Vinassa, Florovit Natura and the fertilizer Crop-UP. The study has shown that there was a tendency to stimulate the vegetative growth and development of cranberry plants through the use of bio-fertilizers and beneficial fungi obtained from the rhizosphere of these plants. There was a tendency for the fresh and <b>dry</b> weight of <b>cranberry</b> shoots to increase, especially in ‘Ben Lear’, under the influence of the bio-fertilizer Florovit Natura when compared with the control plants fertilized with NPK.

40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} and oxidation degradation result in unacceptable safety {{and quality of}} many foods. Phenolic compounds in essential oils extracted from plant sources may exhibit both radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities. Interest in the use natural phenolic compounds as part of food product formulation has therefore seen {{a significant increase in}} order to preserve both food quality and ensure food safety. Despite the high interest in their use, little is known about whether a direct relationship between antimicrobial activity and antioxidant activity of phenolic components exists, i. e. do these components have common characteristic physicochemical properties that allow them to exhibit the two functionalities. Moreover, if there are specific physicochemical properties required for optimal activity in terms of antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, these could be modulated through the design of a suitable delivery system. The objectives of this research were therefore twofold: (1) to determine the relationship between physicochemical properties of phytophenols on lipid oxidation and antimicrobial activity and (2) to develop a delivery polyphenols in complex food system approach to optimize their dual functionalities. To this purpose, model simple phenolic compounds (eugenol and carvacrol) and model complex polyphenolic compounds (polyphenols from cranberries) were characterized in terms of their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Results showed both eugenol and carvacrol had remarkably ability to maintain their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities after exposing to oxidative stresses. When complex polyphenolics in cranberries were investigated, CSE powder, a spray <b>dried</b> formulation from <b>cranberry</b> skins, had a higher total phenolic content than 90 MX powder, a spray <b>dried</b> formulation from <b>cranberry</b> juice. Also CSE powder simultaneous showed surprisingly high antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Even more active extracts from CSE powder could be extracted from the powders using solvent extraction. Methanol CSE crude extract had the highest antioxidant and antimicrobial activities compared to water and acetone crude extracts and the CSE powder raw materials compared {{on the basis of the}} same concentration of total phenolics. These results were attributed to the affinity of the polyphenolics to the specific solvent resulting in extracts with different polyphenol profiles. ^ The methanol cranberry crude extract (which was the most active extract) was used to formulate an oil-in-water emulsion-based delivery system. Results showed that interfacial composition had a significant effect on stability of emulsions containing the added polyphenols, affecting both antioxidant and also antimicrobial activities. Generally, nonionic surfactants, such as Tween 20, were more capable of formulating stable oil-in-water emulsions that were both oxidatively stable and had antimicrobial activities with cranberry polyphenols. In contrast, emulsions formulated with cationic surfactants were not suitable to produce stable emulsions due to the formation of electrostatically driven complexes with higher interfacial tensions and reduced surface charges. Results of this study thus have offer a new promising method to improve food quality by incorporating simple and complex phenolics in foods that inhibit both lipid oxidation and prevent growth of microorganism. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCranberries {{belong to}} a group of {{evergreen}} dwarf shrubs or trailing vines in the genus Vaccinium subgenus Oxycoccus. Traditionally they grow in acidic bogs throughout the cooler parts of the world; when cultivated are grown on low trailing vines in great sandy bogs. The research focuses on the study of vitamin C changes in Latvia grown wild (Vaccinium oxycoccus L.) and cultivated (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) cranberries during convective and microwave vacuum <b>drying.</b> Latvian wild <b>cranberries</b> and cultivated cranberry varieties ‘Early Black’, ‘Ben Lear’, ‘Stevens’, ‘Bergman’ and ‘Pilgrim’ from Kurzeme region harvested in 2010 were used for experiments. Mechanical and thermal pre-treatment of fresh berries was applied for better water evaporation in drying process. During experiments the berries were dried: in a convective air dryer by controlled hot air stream circulation velocity of 1. 2 m s- 1 at temperature + 50 ± 2 °C. The berries were placed on the perforated sieve (diameter 0. 185 m, diameter of holes – 0. 002 m); the moisture content of dried berries was 9. 0 ± 0. 1 %. Following quality parameters were analysed during experiments: moisture content (oven-drying method) and vitamin C content (LVS EN 14130 : 2003). Experimentally it was ascertained that drying time of berries by various drying methods mainly depends on the pre-treatment manner. During the drying process moisture content of cranberries decreased from on average 86. 94 % to 9. 00 %, about ∼ 10. 00 times. Vitamin C is the least stable of all vitamins and it can be easily degraded during processing and storage. The most harmful factors to vitamin C content are the presence of oxygen, prolonged heating in the air ambiance and exposure to light. The initial content of vitamin C in wild and cultivated fresh cranberries was differing, which mainly depends on varieties’ individuality. Current research proved that vitamin C content loss in cranberries processed by microwave vacuum drying method comparing with drying in convective cabinet type dryer was smaller...|$|R
