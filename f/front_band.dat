50|$|Phil and Brock, {{although}} {{rumored to}} initially be in Mike's band, Evacuate, {{have gone on}} to create a different band, A Bande Apart, a female <b>fronted</b> <b>band.</b> The band recorded a demo and then split up.|$|R
50|$|The ST300 had a three-element torque converter, a {{front and}} rear multiple-disc clutch pack, and a {{compound}} planetary gearset with a <b>front</b> <b>band</b> and a clutch pack for reverse and manual low gear. The unit was cooled with a small auxiliary oil cooler located beneath the engine radiator. It had a die cast aluminum case, and weighed 152 lb.|$|E
50|$|Bryant {{was born}} in Memphis, Tennessee, the middle of ten children. He began singing in church at age 5. He soon joined his father’s family vocal group and would {{eventually}} form a gospel quartet for a high school radio show, finding success singing secular pop songs on Dick “Cane” Cole’s popular WLOK show. The quartet, performing as The Four Kings, would part with Cole to become the <b>front</b> <b>band</b> for Willie Mitchell, with Bryant as the leading man.|$|E
50|$|The Fordomatic {{two-speed}} transmission {{was introduced}} in 1959. A simplified version of the Cruise-O-Matic, it combined a torque connector and a compound planetary gear set. A front unit (multiple-disc) clutch provided high gear, a <b>front</b> <b>band</b> on the clutch drum provided low gear, and a band on the rear unit internal gear drum provided reverse. This transmission was offered on Ford, Fairlane, Mercury, Edsel, Falcon, Comet and Meteor cars with differences in the torque converter, valve bodies and clutch plates to accommodate differing engine torques.|$|E

5000|$|The Luxury Of Hysteria is {{the fourth}} solo album by the <b>front</b> <b>band</b> for Australian rock band You Am I, Tim Rogers, and his first to be {{credited}} solely to his name, although his backing band, The Temperance Union, did play on most tracks. The album was released on the 29 September, 2007. The only single from the album, [...] "When Yer Sad", was released to radio and TV. Rogers actually created his own record label, Ruby Q, specifically to release this album, so he could remain free from any creative control issues.|$|E
50|$|The FMX {{transmission}} is controlled through two clutches called the forward and rear clutches, and two band brakes, called the forward and rear bands. The clutches and bands are operated by hydraulic pressure. In this case, forward means {{closest to the}} engine. When applied, a clutch connects a rotational component to the engine, causing the component to turn, and a band holds the component, preventing it from turning. The forward clutch controls power to the primary sun gear. The rear clutch controls power to the secondary sun gear. Confusingly, the band that holds the rear clutch is called the <b>front</b> <b>band.</b> The rear band holds the planet carrier.|$|E
5000|$|Many Hydramatics did not {{execute the}} 2-3 shift very well, as the shift {{involved}} the simultaneous operation of two bands and two clutches. Accurate coordination of these components {{was difficult to}} achieve, even in new transmissions. As the transmission's seals and other elastomers aged, the hydraulic control characteristics changed and the 2-3 shift would either cause a momentary flare (sudden increase in engine speed) or tie-up (a short period where the transmission is in two gears simultaneously), the latter often contributing to failure of the <b>front</b> <b>band.</b> Much of the difficulty in staging a [...] "clean" [...] 2-3 or 3-2 shift in any cast iron Hydramatic was the changing elasticity of the governing springs in the valve bodies. Even ambient temperature would affect this variable, so that a Hydramatic that would shift perfectly on a summers day would usually exhibit 2-3 [...] "flare" [...] when cold. Another long-standing driver complaint would be [...] "flare" [...] when {{trying to get a}} [...] "3-2" [...] downshift when going around a corner, which usually resulted in a neck snapping jolt upon band application.|$|E

50|$|The Pedersen T1E3 rifle {{was made}} in two versions: an {{infantry}} rifle with a 24-inch barrel, full-length stock with an M1903-type <b>front</b> <b>band,</b> 44 inches long (twenty made); and a cavalry carbine with a 21-inch barrel and half-stocked liked the Krag-Jørgensen cavalry carbine (five made). An unknown but larger number of infantry rifles were made by Vickers-Armstrong in Britain. The infantry rifle had a planned weight of 8 pounds, 2 ounces; weights of the rifles tested by the Infantry Board averaged out at 9 pounds, 2 ounces. The walnut stock had a semi pistol grip of rather shallow contour and a pronounced drop at the butt with a long cheek rest formed {{on top of the}} butt. A ventilated metal handguard covered the barrel only between the receiver and the lower band. Under the handguard was a thicken section of the barrel machined with 12 spiraling grooves, the whole design evidently intended to provide both heat sink and radiant air cooling effect. (The metal handguard was a point of criticism during Army tests due to it becoming too hot to the touch after moderate firing; the lack of uniform wood covering of the barrel was judged the cause of accuracy problems due to uneven expansion of the hot barrel). The built-in ten-round magazine included a steel lower body that protruded below the bottom of the stock approximately one inch ahead of a conventional milled steel trigger guard; this magazine body had smooth and distinctive contours that reflected both the shapes of the feed mechanism parts and the designer’s evident concern for the soldier’s ease of use and safety. The front sight was an unprotected M1903 blade; the rear sight, mounted at the extreme rear of the receiver, was a protected peep sight of original design adjustable for windage and elevation. The receiver was entirely open on top between the barrel ring and the rear sight mount. The stubby, flat operating handle for the toggle joint breech mechanism protruded to the right from the forward part of the crank (the rearmost part of the breech mechanism).|$|E
40|$|Directional {{solidification}} {{experiments have}} been carried out in the Pb-Bi peritectic alloys to study the (alpha) ( [...] - 3 ̆e) (beta) phase transition, primary spacing and band structure formation. The (alpha) to (beta) phase transition has been shown to occur at low growth rates as well as at high growth rates. The critical growth velocity at which the (alpha) phase and (beta) phase will grow at the same growing front has been determined experimentally and it is found to follow a relationship of the form: V(,cr) (alpha) G(2 ̆ 7 m) C(2 ̆ 7 n), at a fixed solid fraction. The experimental results on the relationship between G/V(,cr) vs. C were found to agree with the theoretical model which predicted the planar single (beta) phase stability;The characteristics of primary spacing for Pb-Bi peritectic alloys were found to be the same as those in eutectic systems. An empirical relationship (lamda) (alpha) G(2 ̆ 7 -a) V(2 ̆ 7 -b) has been found at higher growth velocities to hold true. As V is decreased, the spacing tends to become constant and even to begin decreasing. For constant G and V, the effect of composition on primary spacing in peritectic region was found to be quite small. The effect of convection was found to affect the primary spacing relationship at low velocities;In Pb-Bi peritectic alloys, the band structures have been observed within the entire peritectic composition regime when the growth conditions were such that the (alpha) phase first formed as a planar growth <b>front.</b> <b>Band</b> structures were also observed when the conditions were slightly greater than the critical conditions for the planar (alpha) phase formation. These band structures were shown to be transition structures when the (alpha) -phase tends to transform to the (beta) phase at low growth rate conditions. The distance over which the band structures form has been found to decrease as the peritectic alloy composition increased...|$|E
