25|$|Despite the {{instability}} and without having received a Jupiter-powered Badger, the Air Board were sufficiently encouraged by this engine's promise {{to order a}} fourth, fully armed Badger with this powerplant. After some testing, the rudder was modified with a <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> and larger ailerons were fitted. This aircraft was the sole Badger II and was loaned by the Air Board to Bristol {{for the development of}} the Jupiter and its cowling during 1920-1.|$|E
25|$|The Beagle was a single-bay biplane with {{staggered}} {{and slightly}} swept wings. The fabric-covered wings, {{which did not}} fold as the aircraft was not intended for carrier service, had spruce spars and ribs with metal bracing. Four ailerons were fitted. The fuselage followed standard Blackburn practice with a steel tube centre section and wooden construction aft, though the final section was again of tube steel; covering was fabric throughout. Fin area was small and the rudder large, with a <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> initially merging into the fin but later reduced, leaving a prominent step {{similar to that of}} the Blackburn Nautilus. The braced tailplane had significantly greater elevator than stabiliser area, the former also having prominent horn balances.|$|E
25|$|The Gull was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{constructed of}} wood with fabric covering. The wings reduced outwards in both thickness and chord, with dihedral outboard of the centre section. They were constructed according to Basil Henderson's patent, and folded rearwards {{at the rear}} spar for storage. There were split flaps inboard. The fin and rudder were initially {{very similar to those}} of the Hendy 302, with a <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> and a notable nick on the leading edge where that balance met the fin, but this was soon replaced by the final symmetric, elliptical and unbalanced arrangement. The horizontal surfaces were also rounded, and tail plane incidence was adjustable in flight for trim; the elevators were mounted on a common shaft.|$|E
50|$|The IS-23 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft. It {{had a high}} {{cantilever wing}} with constant chord inboard and slight taper beyond with almost square tips. The wing was equipped with various high lift devices to achieve the required STOL capability. The tail surfaces were constant chord and straight tipped, though the fin and rudder were slightly swept. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage. The rudder was <b>horn</b> <b>balanced,</b> fitted with a trim tab and cut away at the bottom to allow movement of the single piece elevator, also <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R
50|$|V-tail {{surfaces}} {{were carried}} {{at the end}} of the tail-boom at an angle of 114Â° to each other with push rods operating the large <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> ruddervators for yaw control as well as pitch.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Amiot 130, {{built around}} four longerons, {{was long and}} slender, with a rounded upper surface. Its vertical tail was oval. The horizontal tail was straight-tapered but the elevators had prominent <b>horn</b> <b>balances.</b>|$|R
25|$|This initial batch {{offered little}} {{improvement}} over the BE.2, and was rejected for service in France. Aircraft following this initial batch were completed to a revised design, with a new fin and rudder, its leading edge straight and lacking the earlier comma shaped <b>horn</b> <b>balance,</b> and powered by the Renault-related but more powerful 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a engine. Both crew were placed in a single, extended cockpit with the pilot forward, allowing the observer a more effective field of fire, although in the event few F.K.3s were flown with armament. Trials at Upavon in May 1916 proved that the F.K.3 had a better performance in some respects than the B.E.2c, although it had a smaller useful load. Armstrong Whitworth were given a contract to build 150 aircraft with another 350 being built by Hewlett & Blondeau Limited at Luton. Some of the early batch had twin high exhaust pipes that exited above the upper wing in B.E.2 style, but these were later replaced with rams' horns forward stubs.|$|E
25|$|The slim {{power unit}} {{encouraged}} {{the design of}} slender, well-streamlined fuselages, and {{the nose of the}} Nautilus was longer and more pointed than even that of the Ripon III, which used a larger area W-12 Napier Lion engine. The wooden propeller was two-bladed with a diameter of 11ft (3.35m). Like most of Blackburn's aircraft of the time, the fuselage was built up around four steel longerons; it was duralumin-covered from the nose to just aft of the rear observer/gunner's cockpit, the rest fabric-covered. The pilot's cockpit was immediately in front of the observer's, under an upper trailing edge cutout. A braced, rather rectangular tailplane was carried {{at the top of the}} fuselage. There was fixed fin surface both above and below the fuselage and the rudder with its <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> had an upper fin and extended down to the lower part. Both the tailplane incidence and (more unusually) the alignment of the upper part of the fin could be adjusted in flight via trimming wheels. The robust undercarriage was a broad, split-axle type with mainwheels fitted with disc brakes. As a seaplane, it could be fitted either with a two-float arrangement or with a single central float, the latter intended to give a better field of view to the observer.|$|E
2500|$|All Menestrel {{variants}} are wooden {{framed and}} fabric covered. [...] The wing {{is built around}} a single spar and has constant chord to mid span, with semi-elliptical outer panels. [...] There are no flaps fitted on the single seat variants, though they are an option on the MenestrelII. [...] The fin and rudder are curved, the rudder having a <b>horn</b> <b>balance.</b> [...] The tailplane is mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the J.I was developed as the AEG J.II, which had aerodynamically balanced ailerons with overhanging <b>horn</b> <b>balances,</b> extended rear fuselage with a larger fin to improve directional stability and a re-located aileron link strut.|$|R
50|$|FFV Aerotech BA-14 Starling: Side-by-side {{version with}} 48 kW (65 hp) Rotax 532 engine. Wing span {{increased}} by 1.0 m. (3 ft 3 in) with more rounded tips. Flaps added. Tailplane span also increased and tips rounded, with <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> elevators.|$|R
50|$|The IAR.22 was a wooden, low-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed conventional undercarriage, seating two in tandem, open cockpits. The wings {{were built}} around two spruce box spars, with plywood webs; plywood covered the whole wing {{except for the}} fabric trailing edges. In plan, the wings were straight-tapered, {{with most of the}} taper on the trailing edge, but with rounded tips. The wing trailing edge carried ailerons but no flaps. The tailplane was also straight-tapered, though with the taper more equally distributed between leading and trailing edges. The elevators were split, with a cut-out for rudder movement, and were <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b> The fin was also straight-edged but the broad rudder, also <b>horn</b> <b>balanced,</b> had a curved trailing edge.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tail unit}} of the Wee Bee was fairly conventional. [...] Fin and {{tailplane}} were both integral with the fuselage and narrow in chord, carrying wider control surfaces. [...] Both horizontal and vertical surfaces were rather rectangular, but the rudder had a noticeable <b>horn</b> <b>balance.</b> [...] The main undercarriage was very simple, with two wheels mounted on a bent chrome-nickel alloy tube which passed through the fuselage bottom. [...] This placed the wheels well clear of the fuselage horizontally - the track was 3ft 9 in (1.14 m) - but left the Wee Bee sitting close to the ground. [...] Landing loads were absorbed by elastic axle bending.|$|E
2500|$|The Gorcock was a single-bay biplane {{with strong}} stagger and unequal span wings, having a strong {{resemblance}} to the Gamecock. The inline engine allowed a smoother, longer and more pointed nose and increased the length by about 6ft 5 in (1.95 m); the span was slightly less than the Gamecock's. [...] The first Gorcock had a Lion IV engine, geared and producing 450hp (335kW) and the second an ungeared Lion VIII of 525hp (390kW). [...] The radiator was mounted on the fuselage underside, between the undercarriage legs. [...] Both engines drove fixed-pitch wooden two-blade, 9ft (2.74 m) diameter propellers. [...] Initially both these machines had Grebe style rudders, squared off with no balance; these were later replaced with Gamecock rudders, vertically extended to include a <b>horn</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Fleetwing was a single-bay biplane which, {{like the}} Fox II, {{had a lower}} wing of much {{narrower}} chord than the upper plane. Initially, N-type interplane struts of quite wide chord were used, though later slimmed. Upper and lower ailerons were at first linked by wire, but later with a rigid strut. The wings folded for carrier storage. The fuselage, apart from cockpit details, and the undercarriage and empennage of the Fleetwing, Firefly, and Fox II were very similar and the Fleetwing's fin and rudder evolved with the Firefly's from a slightly square topped, unbalanced arrangement to a more round topped rudder with <b>horn</b> <b>balance.</b> The Fleetwing's tailplane retained a single lower strut. There were two cockpits, one for the pilot under an upper wing cut out and a gunner's position behind. Armament was traditional: a single forward-firing synchronised [...]303in (7.7mm) Vickers machine gun and a [...]303in (7.7mm) Lewis Gun on a Fairey high-speed mounting in the rear cockpit. There was a bomb rack under the port wing.|$|E
50|$|The Parrot's wire-braced {{empennage}} is conventional. The vertical {{surfaces are}} large, angular and slightly swept. Its horizontal surfaces are rectangular in plan, {{with a small}} tailplane carrying a much larger, one-piece elevator hinged well behind the rudder trailing edge. Both rudder and elevator are <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{wings of}} the G3 Mirage have a {{constant}} chord centre section with straight tapered outer panels. The inboard sections carry electrically operated flaps. There is a single lift strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage. Behind the cabin the fuselage is slender and carries a low set, straight tapered tailplane with <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> elevators. The fin and rudder are straight edged and sharply tapered, the latter <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> and ending {{at the top of}} the fuselage. There is a small underfin. [...] The GX version introduced a long, integrated dorsal fin. The G3 Mirage has a tricycle undercarriage with cantilever legs mounted to the fuselage and with faired wheels. [...] The Remos is somewhat unusual among modern certificated/LSA aircraft in that it can be flown with the doors removed.|$|R
50|$|Like all Junkers duralumin-structured designs, {{from the}} 1918 J 7 to the 1932 Ju 46, (some 35 models), it used an {{aluminium}} alloy (duralumin) structure entirely covered with Junkers' characteristic corrugated and stressed duralumin skin. Internally, the wing was built up on nine circular cross-section duralumin spars with transverse bracing. All control surfaces were <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Pipit prototype, N232, first flew {{sometime}} {{in the summer of}} 1928. [...] In October it flew to the A at RAF Martlesham Heath for official trials. [...] During that month, the Pipit was put into a terminal-velocity dive during which tail flutter set in and became so violent that the tailplane spar fractured. [...] The aircraft was a complete writeoff, but the pilot survived, despite a broken neck, to fly again. [...] The loss was a severe blow to Parnall's, who had staked a lot on the hope of getting a production order for the promising Pipit. [...] A second prototype was built, as the first but with distinguishing modifications. It was allocated the serial N233 but, confusingly, was painted with the same serial as the first prototype. [...] The tailplane was now braced on each underside with a pair of struts, the fin and rudder had a less smoothly-rounded shape largely because of the addition of a large <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> and there were now ailerons on all wings, linked between upper and lower planes by an external rod. [...] This aircraft began testing at the Parnall factory field at Yate early in 1929, but on 24 February the Pipit encountered flutter strong enough to break the fin and rudder from the fuselage. [...] The aircraft was lost, but the pilot escaped by parachute.|$|E
50|$|The G3 Mirage first flew on 20 September 1997 {{with the}} lower powered Rotax. The first {{production}} aircraft also used this engine but had some small horizontal control surface modifications plus {{the addition of a}} <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> to the rudder.|$|E
5000|$|All Menestrel {{variants}} are wooden {{framed and}} fabric covered. The wing {{is built around}} a single spar and has constant chord to mid span, with semi-elliptical outer panels. There are no flaps fitted on the single seat variants, though they are an option on the Menestrel II. [...] The fin and rudder are curved, the rudder having a <b>horn</b> <b>balance.</b> The tailplane is mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage.|$|E
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} of <b>horn</b> <b>balances</b> on a 45 degree sweptback, semispan, horizontal tail surface {{was made to}} determine the effects of horn size and inboard-edge fairing at a Mach number of 0. 30 and {{to determine the effects}} of compressibility up to a Mach number of 0. 89. Presented are lift, drag, pitching-moment, and hinge-moment data and lift and hinge-moment parameters...|$|R
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was a pine framed, plywood covered hexagonal box, {{with the}} straight edged fin an integral part. The rudder was rounded and <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b> [...] Though the rudder was wood framed and covered, the tailplane, mounted {{just above the}} fuselage and externally braced from below, had a tube steel structure and was fabric covered. The elevators were balanced by an elastic rope to the control column.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the AB 1 was flat-sided, with a narrowed but flat topped decking. There was a gunner's {{position in}} the extreme nose fitted with a 7.7mm machine gun on a TO 4 mounting. The fuselage tapered rearwards with the cantilever tailplane, which carried separate elevators, mounted on top. The fin carried a <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> rudder which extended {{down to the bottom}} of the fuselage, moving between the elevators.|$|R

50|$|The PV.7 was {{powered by}} a Bristol Pegasus IIIM3 engine within a Townend ring, which {{produced}} 722 hp (538 kW) and drove a two-bladed wooden propeller. It flew {{for the first time}} on 30 October 1933, with Harald Penrose, Westland's regular test pilot at the controls. Early flights showed the need to glaze the cockpit and lighten the ailerons, and later tests at higher speed revealed that the wing twisted under aileron loads. This latter problem required significant re-working of the wing structure, specifically the replacement of the inter-spar rods with torsionally stiffer tubes. Flight testing also showed that the rudder was aerodynamically over-balanced, causing oscillations cured by removal of the <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> entirely.|$|E
2500|$|The A1's {{construction}} was delayed by funding problems: though design work began in 1968, {{the first flight}} was not made until 1976. By mid-1977 some 40 hours had been flown under {{the power of a}} 156kW (210hp) Rolls-Royce Continental IO-360-D. [...] This was then replaced with a 209kW (280hp) Lycoming IO-540-D (Special) driving a three blade propeller which markedly improved the performance. Revised ailerons were fitted, the rudder <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> and heightened.|$|R
50|$|The {{rest of the}} Wanderlust was plywood skinned, with a cockpit {{which could}} be open or {{enclosed}} in a bubble hood. The fuselage tapered aft, with the tailplane mounted on top and the small fin behind it. The elevators, with individual trim tabs, moved {{either side of the}} fin and the rudder was hinged behind their trailing edges. Both elevators and rudder were <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b> The Wanderlust landed on a pneumatically-mounted central skid.|$|R
50|$|The wing has {{constant}} chord, turned-down {{tips and}} 2Â° of washout. It is braced by pairs of V-struts {{attached to the}} lower fuselage longerons forward of the cabin. Four-position Fowler flaps are fitted. The tailplane and elevators are rectangular in plan, with a cutout in the latter to allow rudder movement. Fin and rudder are likewise rectangular apart from the leading edge, which has a curved fillet. Both rudder and elevators are <b>horn</b> <b>balanced.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 15 June 1936, K4049 {{conducted}} its {{maiden flight}} from Brooklands. Vickers chief test pilot Joseph Summers flew K4049 {{on its first}} flight, accompanied by Wallis and Trevor Westbrook. The aircraft soon came to be largely regarded as being an advanced design for its era and proved to have considerable merit during its flight trials. In April 1937, K4049 was destroyed by an accident during a service test flight. The cause was {{the failure of the}} elevator's <b>horn</b> <b>balance</b> due to excessive slipstream exposure, leading to the aircraft inverting and rapidly descending into terrain. It was completely destroyed in the crash, which also had resulted in the death of the navigator. The horn balances would later be deleted, and thus not feature on production aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The rudder was {{hinged to}} a {{triangular}} fin which also mounted, low down, a triangular tailplane braced by diverging pairs of struts {{on each side}} to the lower fuselage. Originally both elevators and the rudder were <b>horn</b> <b>balanced</b> but before 1933 these integrated balances had external assistance to ease the control loads of this large and heavy aircraft: the elevators were fitted with upper surface spades and the rudder {{had a pair of}} servo surfaces close to it.(image, right) ...|$|R
