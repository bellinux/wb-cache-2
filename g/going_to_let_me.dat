2500|$|... 2006 – Civil {{lawsuit filed}} by patient but {{dismissed}} as out of time. The complaint was that Gosnell {{had been unable to}} complete an abortion, but then apparently failed or refused to call paramedics or other clinical emergency personnel, after the patient had needed help. [...] The patient reported, [...] "I really felt like he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{caught up}} with her, he laid his hand upon her arm to stay her. [...] "If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Venice, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go <b>to</b> Venice with you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Marjorie, and thought. [...] "It {{would be}} jolly," [...] she said. [...] "All the same, you know--and {{just to show}} you--I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you buy <b>me</b> that fur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I say, Rosy," [...] said Fred, as she {{was passing}} out of the room, [...] "if you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the piano, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> come and play some airs with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{have one}} more breakfast in the old place, then," [...] said Burleigh. [...] "Half-past eight, half-past----" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHINN Yes, sir. Mr. Cohen {{has been}} very nice about it. He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> pay it off by instalments.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is magnificent," [...] {{cried the}} Rocket, [...] "they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> off in broad day-light, {{so that every}} one can see me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dykes was {{not invited}} to the 2008 NFL Combine however, and said of it, [...] "I was shocked...I believe they made a mistake. But I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it get <b>me</b> down. I still have my pro day." ...|$|R
5000|$|Raimi {{has said}} {{of working with}} Murawski on Drag Me to Hell, [...] "He’d come (down to the set) {{to see how things}} were <b>going</b> and <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know if he’d just cut {{something}} that wasn’t working the way he’d wanted it to, or to suggest a pick-up shot I should get for a piece he felt we needed in a sequence I hadn’t realized I needed. He’s very detail-oriented... So we’re very close collaborators." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{off your}} coat and sit down, Will, and don't look so angry at me. I know that you're not greedy, well enough. Tell {{me what you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see if I can help you." ...|$|R
60|$|Fancy Mary Gladstone {{forgiving}} me {{even that}} second naughtiness![37] She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{come to see}} her this week, and to play to me, {{which is a great}} comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Button-Bright!" [...] {{cried the}} little girl presently. [...] "I'm so glad you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> fly with you way to town and back tomorrow. Won't it be fine, Cap'n Bill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, Smith,' he said definitely, 'if being your {{confidential}} {{secretary and}} adviser is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> in for {{any more of}} that sort of thing, you can jolly well accept my resignation.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Bailey {{had been}} sentenced to hang, because the method of {{execution}} in Delaware had been changed to lethal injection, he {{had the option of}} choosing that method. Bailey refused to accept lethal injection, telling a visitor [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them put <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] Collins {{reassured}} her. [...] "You {{will lose}} merely {{most of your}} jacket. The worst that can happen will be the exposure of the trick and the laugh on you. But the apparatus isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> break. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> explain again. The horses do not pull against you. They pull against each other. The audience thinks that they are pulling against you.--Now try once more. Take hold the double-trees, {{and at the same}} moment slip down the hooks and connect.--Now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Morris Hyde {{was very}} disappointing," [...] she confessed. [...] "I {{was looking forward}} to being tremendously entertained, but instead of telling me all about these unknown tribes in Central America, his only anxiety seemed to be to know if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him kiss <b>me</b> in the taxi afterwards. Explorers, I am afraid, are far too promiscuous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I'm {{going to}} enjoy every moment of it; and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> help, you know--look over papers and all that. I'm the heiress, you must remember," [...] she said wickedly.|$|E
6000|$|When {{he spoke}} again {{his voice was}} less friendly, and he prodded Denton by way of address. [...] "Look see!" [...] he said: [...] "are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> show you 'ow to scrap?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{really think}} I am," [...] replied Mrs. Vervain, playfully. [...] "Considering {{that you were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> leave Venice without even trying to say good-by to me, I think I'm very good indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could have}} sobbed into the bacon and eggs. That there wasn't any sympathy to be {{got out of}} Jeeves was what put the lid on it. For a moment I almost {{weakened}} {{and told him to}} destroy the hat and tie if he didn't like them, but I pulled myself together again. I was dashed if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Jeeves treat <b>me</b> like a bally one-man chain-gang! ...|$|R
2500|$|Terry Lubbock {{responded by}} {{distancing}} {{himself from the}} controversy saying, [...] "This is a diversion from the campaign which I don't want to take any part in. My aim is as it has always been, to get justice for my son Stuart {{and that is the}} only thing in my life now. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> anything distract <b>me</b> from that. This latest episode is not doing the campaign a lot of good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Claude, [...] "I {{was just}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> {{tell you it}} will {{surprise}} you." [...] She had finished breakfast now and she sat {{back in her chair}} again: she waited in silence to hear. He had pushed the things before him a little way and had his elbows on the table. This time, she was convinced, she knew what was coming, and once more, for the crash, as with Mrs. Wix lately in her room, she held her breath and drew together her eyelids. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say she must give him up. He looked hard at her again; then he made his effort. [...] "Should you see your way <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little girl," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are very}} good to me, and I think you understand. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> feel that I have found a friend on my first evening in London?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now that it's all over, I {{may as well}} {{admit that}} there was a time during the rather funny affair of Rockmetteller Todd when I thought that Jeeves was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> down. The man had the {{appearance}} of being baffled.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go on?' said Mrs. Woodward--'her {{intended}} sposo'--Charley gave a kick {{with his}} foot and satisfied himself with that--'is determined to {{have nothing to say}} to her in the matrimonial line till she has revealed to him this secret which he thinks concerns his own honour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did, did she? And {{you made}} her {{give you that}} promise which is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bind her, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell you that. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> also tell you in the meanwhile, my fine gentleman from America, that your d----d {{interference}} will do no good to your former sweetheart, who is already as good as my wife--and will be my wife to-morrow. Klara Goldstein is my friend, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell you that, and [...] . . ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're {{very nice}} sometimes, but you're very foolish more times. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you give <b>me</b> horses, or {{take you out}} of your way to-night. I'll go home by myself. Only I want you to promise me something. You won't think any more about that extra threepence, will you? Remember, you've been paid; and I won't allow you to be spiteful and do bad work for a little thing like that. You can be so big that you mustn't be tiny.' ...|$|R
5000|$|At 16, Carr {{returned}} to Arkansas, {{where he played}} bass for his biological father, Robert Nighthawk, an established blues musician, and also worked as a chauffeur. He married Doris in 1946, and they began sharecropping in Helena, Arkansas. He {{was involved in a}} dispute over a borrowed mule team with the plantation owner, who attempted to beat him. Carr later stated, [...] "I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him whoop <b>me,</b> that was plumb out of the question. From that day on, white people called me crazy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; Ben, {{the driver}} {{on the wagon}} where I ride, {{told him not to}} do that again; but he hain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have any supper, 'cause I was so slow about my work--though I wasn't slow; I only talked to Mr. Stubbs when there wasn't anybody round his cage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pigott," [...] {{she called}} out, feeling the {{absolute}} necessity of a confidant in her joy, and forgetting that that worthy soul {{had nothing but}} the most general knowledge of George's advances, [...] "he has given me up; just think, he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> alone. I declare that I feel quite fond of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|We breakfasted as silently on {{his part}} as we had supped, but when we had finished, and I was {{wondering}} what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do with myself, and on the whole what the deuce I had come for, he said, in the longest speech I had yet had from him, [...] "Wouldn't {{you like to come}} up and see what I've been doing?" ...|$|E
5000|$|..... from {{a purely}} {{business}} standpoint, Mrs. Manley felt that Branch Rickey was obligated to compensate her for my contract. That position probably delayed my {{entry into the}} major leagues ... Mrs. Manley told Rickey {{that he had taken}} Don Newcombe for no money but she wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him take <b>me</b> without some compensation. Furthermore, if he tried to do it, she would sue and fight him in court ... Rickey contacted her to say he was no longer interested released me ... the Giants picked up my contract ..." ...|$|R
5000|$|Murawski {{has largely}} {{worked as a}} film editor, {{primarily}} for director/producer Sam Raimi, on films including Army of Darkness, The Gift, Drag Me to Hell and the Spider-Man series of films. He also co-edited the Academy Award winning film, The Hurt Locker with editor Chris Innis. Raimi has said of working with Murawski:"He’d come (down to the set) {{to see how things}} were <b>going</b> and <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know if he’d just cut something that wasn’t working the way he’d wanted it to, or to suggest a pick-up shot I should get for a piece he felt we needed in a sequence I hadn’t realized I needed. He’s very detail-oriented... So we’re very close collaborators." [...] Raimi finds editing with Murawski to be [...] "relaxing", adding:"I love it... I can watch the film come together, so it’s a time of discovery for me as Bob and I fit all the pieces together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Baas," [...] said Hans, {{who could}} {{understand}} English well enough although he seldom spoke it, [...] "why are you always bothering me with such praatjes?"--(that is, chatter). [...] "Whatever you do I will do, and I don't {{care what you}} do, except for your own sake, Baas. If I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> die; it doesn't at all matter how, since I must go soon and make report to your reverend father, the Predikant. And now, Baas, I have been awake all night, for I heard those camels coming a long while before the two spook men appeared, and as I have never heard camels before, {{could not make out}} what they were, for they don't walk like giraffes. So I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep, Baas, there in the sun. When you have settled things, you can wake me up and give me your orders," [...] and he suited the action to the word, for when I glanced at him again he was, or appeared to be, slumbering, just like a dog at its master's feet.|$|R
