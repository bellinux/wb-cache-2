Though Chinese laws condemn harsh <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures,</b> Chinese authorities and family planning staff {{have been accused of}} carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.|$|E

Within the European Union, <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> vary: infringement may be treated as counterfeit, misleading advertising, passing off or even as a question of public health.

PRC authorities, their supporters, and other proponents claim that existing policies and <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> are sufficient to guard against human rights abuses. However, other countries and their authorities (such as the United States Department of State, Canada, among others), international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as Human Rights in China and Amnesty International, and citizens, lawyers, and dissidents inside the country, state that the authorities in mainland China regularly sanction or organize such abuses.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} I explore {{microdata}} from Argentine household surveys {{for the period}} 2005 – 2011 to analyze (i) how changes in the enforcement of labor market regulations affect different indicators of compliance with the labor law among {{men and women and}} (ii) how changes in enforcement generates adjustments of some labor outcomes (different than the compliance level) for men and women separately. I take advantage of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina which allows me to construct an <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> (number of inspected firms per hundred formal firms) with variation at the province, productive sector, and time level. The econometric strategy links indicators of compliance with labor regulations and other labor market outcomes such as hourly wages, percentiles of the wage distribution, indicators of the provision of non-mandated benefits, and the structure of occupation by employment categories (wage employment versus self-employment), with the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> and with a rich set of individual socioeconomic and labor characteristics, and economic, institutional, and development characteristics of Argentine provinces.|$|R
25|$|In March 2008, Vitter reintroduced {{the latter}} two {{proposals}} and cosponsored ten of eleven other bills in a Republican package of tough immigration <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> including jail time for illegal border crossing; deportation for any immigrant (legal or illegal) for a single driving while intoxicated; declaration of English as the official language (thereby terminating language assistance at voting booths and federal agencies)' additional construction of a border fence; permission for local and state police to enforce immigration laws and penalties for states who issue drivers licenses to illegals. None of these proposals passed, partially because the Democratic-controlled Senate preferred a comprehensive approach which would include a guest-worker program and a path to citizenship for the current population more akin to the package defeated by Vitter in 2007.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{dimension to}} misrepresentations is the statutory regulation of business, and <b>enforcement</b> <b>measures</b> by the Office of Fair Trading against unfair trade practices. Typically consumers {{do not understand}} legal complexities and {{have little incentive to}} litigate over small claims. Statute may also strengthen enforcement of consumer protection by providing criminal or regulatory sanctions. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 ss 1-4 say that not only false, but also misleading statements about products are prohibited. An early example is found in Robertson v Dicicco where it was held that describing a vehicle as a ‘beautiful car’ was implicitly saying it was fit for purpose. Though the exterior was attractive, it was still a misrepresentation when the car did not work. Similarly the Consumer Protection Act 1987 ss 20-21 create an offence for giving misleading information about the prices of goods and services, such as banking or insurance. On top of this the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, give a broad principle based jurisdiction to courts and the OFT to clamp down on misleading practices or omissions by businesses.|$|E
25|$|At the time, any {{introduction}} of prerequisite legislation which would alter Japanese family court law would {{take at least}} a year in committee discussion and draft legislation could have been introduced in 2011 at the earliest or possibly later which would delay signature of the treaty to later than 2011 to allow for legislative change.which via babelfish translates to: When it assumes that enactment of new special law because national administrative organization method amendment and the courthouse where the central authorities are installed make return order is necessary Ministry of Justice inquires laws conference (the advisory organ of legal phase), “1 years (the same economical staff) with become necessary” in deliberation.

30|$|The main {{challenge}} to the estimation of the relationships of interest is that the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> is probably endogenous. To deal with this problem, I implement an instrumental variable strategy. The proposed instrument {{is a measure of}} the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms. Labor inspectors travel by car from the inspection agencies to the firms to be inspected. A combination of the extension of the road network and the traffic in each province provides a measure of the arrival cost to the firms.|$|R
30|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} in the analysis of labor market regulations is of clear importance for both developed and developing countries. I focus the empirical work on Argentina for three reasons. First, the availability of data allows me to construct a <b>measure</b> of <b>enforcement</b> with variation across provinces, sectors, and overtime for the period 2005 – 2011, when there is also microdata at the individual level on a wide set of mandated benefits for wage employees, some non-mandated benefits and hourly wages. With this data, I can test for men and women how the compliance with labor regulations reacts when the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> changes, and how other labor outcomes respond, probably due to firms’ need of adjustment. Second, the fact that the labor rules being enforced are common to all Argentine provinces generates an ideal framework to evaluate the effects of changes in the <b>enforcement</b> <b>measure</b> on labor outcomes using the province variation of the data. Third, equality of opportunities between men and women has been placed {{at the top of the}} policy agenda in recent years. The elimination of any type of violence against women, including the discrimination at the workplace, has been part of Argentine Congress meetings which is discussing laws in that direction.|$|R
