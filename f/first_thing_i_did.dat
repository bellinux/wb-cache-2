Bennett remembers the puppet {{that was based}} on his likeness: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to ask if I could keep him when filming was finished, but apparently he was to be turned into another character after the film had been finished." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E
500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I got to Island was suggest we put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E

2500|$|While at {{the head}} of AMC, Chapin spearheaded the {{acquisition}} of Jeep from the Kaiser Motors Division of Kaiser Industries in 1970. According to Chapin: [...] "Perhaps the easiest decision I ever made was the purchase of Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. I tried to buy it when George Romney (later Michigan governor) and Roy Abernethy were running AMC. Romney and Edgar Kaiser couldn't get along. I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm. Where Jeep was, there were roads and gasoline. Abernethy didn't go for the idea and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I became chairman and got a little money was to buy Jeep. We got it for a song, about $75 million..." [...] American Motors' engineers and designers quickly overhauled Jeep and expanded its lineup, creating a valuable asset that attracted Renault, Chrysler, and ultimately DaimlerBenz AG.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of several remixes of her songs by Steve [...] "Silk" [...] Hurley, Minogue became {{interested}} in dance music. She commented that the remixes were [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that was really cool and my love of dance music and clubbing started from there." [...] Minogue's interest in dance music and clubbing influenced her third album, Girl, released in September 1997, which featured collaborations with musicians such as Brian Higgins of Xenomania. The album presented a more sophisticated and adult style of dance music, but despite generally positive reviews, {{failed to make the}} British top 50. The lead single [...] "All I Wanna Do", which the Daily Mirror described as a [...] "bass-bumping, shuddering return", was a success peaking at number four on the UK singles chart. In her native Australia, the single also proved to be a success peaking at number eleven and was certified gold. The album's second single [...] "Everything I Wanted" [...] made the top 20 in the UK and the top 50 in Australia, while the third single [...] "Disremembrance" [...] narrowly missed the top 20 in the UK, peaking at number 21. All three singles released from Girl reached number one on the UK dance chart.|$|E

5000|$|As a writer, Zailckas {{says her}} writing is {{informed}} by memoirists Mary Karr, Nick Flynn, Tobias Wolff, as well as novelists T.C. Boyle, Jeffrey Eugenides, A.M. Homes, Richard Ford, Haruki Murakami. She's also admitted she is heavily influenced by music and song lyrics. Zailckas has been quoted as saying, [...] "If you're a writer, there's a lot of inspiration {{to be found in}} lyrics. That's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> before <b>I</b> get to work in the morning: {{have a cup of coffee}} and put on a record." ...|$|R

60|$|Five minutes {{afterwards}} my bonds were cut, I was hoisted on a man's back, carried {{up to the}} forecastle, {{and laid}} in a bunk on some sea-blankets; where the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to lose my senses.|$|R
5000|$|Bitcoin was {{initially}} led by Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto stepped back in 2010 {{and handed the}} network alert key to Gavin Andresen. Andresen stated he subsequently sought to decentralize control stating: [...] "As soon as Satoshi stepped back and threw the project onto my shoulders, one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was try to decentralize that. So, if I {{get hit by a}} bus, it would be clear that the project would go on." [...] This left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin. The reference implementation of the bitcoin protocol called Bitcoin Core obtained competing versions that propose to solve various governance and blocksize debates; , the alternatives were called Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited.|$|R

60|$|Upon these apprehensions, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{was to go}} quite out of my knowledge, and go {{by another}} name.

5000|$|In December 2015, in {{a speech}} {{accepting}} {{the endorsement of the}} New England Police Benevolent Association, Trump said that [...] "One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> elected President in terms of executive order if I win will be to sign a strong, strong statement that will go out to the country, out to the world, that ... anybody killing a police officer—death penalty. It's going to happen, O.K.?" [...] However, under the current U.S. legal system, these prosecutions usually take place in state court under state law, and the president has no authority over such cases. Furthermore, 19 states have abolished the death penalty, and mandatory death sentences are unconstitutional, as held by the Supreme Court in Woodson v. North Carolina (1976).|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{turned from}} his contemplation with a visible effort. [...] "I {{feel obliged to}} you for taking it so; it mightn't--one never knows--have amused you.

6000|$|... "Hey! are {{you ever}} going to get up?" [...] some one yelled into my drowsy brain. I roused and opened my eyes.
