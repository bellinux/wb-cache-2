25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{mountain}} is extremely characteristic. Only from northwest <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like a 'tind' a high pointy summit in Norwegian. From the east, from Galdhøpiggen, it shows its steep wall with Nåle balancing on the left flank, {{as seen in the}} table. This wall {{is one of the more}} inaccessible in Jotunheimen and is climbed rarely. The southwest face is less forbidding, and it is possible to find a way up through the partly snow-covered talus slopes. The mountain, as its neighbors, consists of the hard gabbro rock, which withstands erosion better than most other rocks. The orientation of the layers of gabbro in Skarstind is uncommon. Normally they rise from northwest towards southeast, which is why many summits are easiest to reach from the north side. At Skarstind the layers rise from southwest towards northeast. This is easily seen on the photo in the table.|$|E

60|$|Although, however, {{there is}} no vestige among the old masters of any effort to {{represent}} the attributes of the higher mountains seen in comparative proximity, we are not altogether left without evidence of their having thought of them as sources {{of light in the}} extreme distance, as for example, in that of the reputed Claude in our National Gallery, called the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca. I have not the slightest doubt of its being a most execrable copy; for {{there is no}}t one touch nor line of even decent painting in the whole picture; but as connoisseurs have considered it a Claude, as it has been put in our Gallery for a Claude, and as people admire it every day for a Claude, I may at least presume it has those qualities of Claude in it which are wont to excite the public admiration, though it possesses none of those which sometimes give him claim to it; and I have so reasoned, and shall continue to reason upon it, especially with respect to facts of form, which cannot have been much altered by the copyist. In the distance of that picture (as well as in that of the Sinon before Priam, which I have little doubt is at least partially original, and whose central group of trees is a very noble piece of painting) is something white, which I believe must be intended for a snowy mountain, because I do not see that it can well be intended for anything else. Now no mountain of elevation sufficient to be so sheeted with perpetual snow, can by any possibility sink so low on the horizon as this something of Claude's, unless it be at a distance of from fifty to seventy miles. At such distances, though the outline is invariably sharp and edgy to an excess, yet all the circumstances of aerial perspective, faintness of shadow, and isolation of light, which I have described as characteristic of the Alps fifteen miles off, take place, of course, in a threefold degree; the mountains rise from the horizon like transparent films, only distinguishable from mist by their excessively keen edges, and their brilliant flashes of sudden light; they are as unsubstantial as the air itself, and impress their enormous size by means of this aerialness, in a far greater degree at these vast distances, than even when towering above the spectator's head. Now, I ask of the candid observer, if there be the smallest vestige of an effort to attain--if there be the most miserable, the most contemptible shadow of attainment of such an effect by Claude? Does that white thing on the horizon look seventy miles off? Is it faint, or fading, or to be looked for by the eye before it can be found out? <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> high? <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> large? <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> impressive? You cannot but feel {{that there is not a}} vestige of any kind or species of truth in that horizon; and that, however artistical it may be, as giving brilliancy to the distance, (though, as far as I have any feeling in the matter, it only gives coldness,) it is, in the very branch of art on which Claude's reputation chiefly rests, aerial perspective, hurling defiance to nature in her very teeth.|$|E

60|$|In {{most places}} the rich, dry soil is {{occupied}} by a coarse grass, three or four feet high, growing in large tussocks, and all the year round of a deep green; a few slender herbs and trefoils, with long, twining stems, maintain a frail existence among the tussocks; but the strong grass crowds out most plants, and scarcely a flower relieves its uniform everlasting verdure. There are patches, sometimes large areas, where it does not grow, and these are carpeted by small creeping herbs of a livelier green, and are gay in spring with flowers, chiefly of the composite and papilionaceous kinds; and verbenas, scarlet, purple, rose, and white. On moist or marshy grounds there are also several lilies, yellow, white, and red, two or three flags, and various other small flowers; but altogether the flora of the pampas is the poorest in species of any fertile district on the globe. On moist clayey ground flourishes the stately pampa grass, Gynerium argenteum, the spears of which often attain a height of eight or nine feet. I have ridden through many leagues of this grass with the feathery spikes high as my head, and often higher. It {{would be impossible for}} me to give anything like an adequate idea of the exquisite loveliness, at certain times and seasons, of this queen of grasses, the chief glory of the solitary pampa. Everyone is familiar with it in cultivation; but the garden-plant has a sadly decaying, draggled look at all times, and to my mind, is often positively ugly with its dense withering mass of coarse leaves, drooping on the ground, and bundle of spikes, always of the same dead white or dirty cream-colour. Now colour--the various ethereal tints that give a blush to its cloud-like purity--is one of the chief beauties of this grass on its native soil; and travellers who have galloped across the pampas at a season of the year when the spikes are dead, and white as paper or parchment, have certainly missed its greatest charm. The plant is social, and in some places where scarcely any other kind exists it covers large areas with a sea of fleecy-white plumes; in late summer, and in autumn, the tints are seen, varying from the most delicate rose, tender and illusive as the blush on the white under-plumage of some gulls, to purple and violaceous. At no time <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> so perfect as in the evening, before and after sunset, when the softened light imparts a mistiness to the crowding plumes, and the traveller cannot help fancying that the tints, which then seem richest, are caught from the level rays of the sun, or reflected from the coloured vapours of the afterglow.|$|E
6000|$|Then in {{the yellow}} light and in the {{intervals}} of mopping the deck they crunched hard bread, arranging to [...] "worry through somehow." [...] Men chummed as to beds. Turns were settled for wearing boots and having the use of oilskin coats. They called one another [...] "old man" [...] and [...] "sonny" [...] in cheery voices. Friendly slaps resounded. Jokes were shouted. One or two stretched on the wet deck, slept with heads pillowed on their bent arms, and several, sitting on the hatch, smoked. Their weary faces appeared through a thin blue haze, pacified and with sparkling eyes. The boatswain put his head through the door. [...] "Relieve the wheel, one of you"--he shouted inside--"it's six. Blamme if that old Singleton hasn't been there more'n thirty hours. You are a fine lot." [...] He slammed the door again. [...] "Mate's watch on deck," [...] said some one. [...] "Hey, Donkin, it's your relief!" [...] shouted three or four together. He had crawled into an empty bunk and on wet planks lay still. [...] "Donkin, your wheel." [...] He made no sound. [...] "Donkin's dead," [...] guffawed some one, [...] "Sell 'is bloomin' clothes," [...] shouted another. [...] "Donkin, if ye don't go to the bloomin' wheel they will sell your clothes--d'ye hear?" [...] jeered a third. He groaned from his dark hole. He complained about pains in all his bones, he whimpered pitifully. [...] "He won't go," [...] exclaimed a contemptuous voice, [...] "your turn, Davis." [...] The young seaman rose painfully, squaring his shoulders. Donkin stuck his head out, and it appeared {{in the yellow}} light, fragile and ghastly. [...] "I will giv' yer a pound of tobaccer," [...] he whined in a conciliating voice, [...] "so soon as I draw it from aft. I will--s'elp me..." [...] Davis swung his arm backhanded and the head vanished. [...] "I'll go," [...] he said, [...] "but you will pay for it." [...] He walked unsteady but resolute to the door. [...] "So I will," [...] yelped Donkin, popping out behind him. [...] "So I will--s'elp me... a pound... three bob they chawrge." [...] Davis flung the door open. [...] "You will pay my price... in fine weather," [...] he shouted over his shoulder. One of the men unbuttoned his wet coat rapidly, threw it at his head. [...] "Here, Taffy--take that, you thief!" [...] "Thank you!" [...] he cried from the darkness above the swish of rolling water. He could be heard splashing; a sea came on board with a thump. [...] "He's got his bath already," [...] remarked a grim shellback. [...] "Aye, aye!" [...] grunted others. Then, after a long silence, Wamibo made strange noises. [...] "Hallo, what's up with you?" [...] said some one grumpily. [...] "He says {{he would have gone}} for Davy," [...] explained Archie, who was the Finn's interpreter generally. [...] "I believe him!" [...] cried voices.... "Never mind, Dutchy... You'll do, muddle-head.... Your turn will come soon enough... You don't know when ye're well off." [...] They ceased, and all together turned their faces to the door. Singleton stepped in, advanced two paces, and stood swaying slightly. The sea hissed, flowed roaring past the bows, and the forecastle trembled, full of deep murmurs; the lamp flared, swinging like a pendulum. He looked with a dreamy and puzzled stare, as though he could not distinguish the still men from their restless shadows. There were awestruck exclamations:--"Hallo, hallo"... "How <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> outside now, Singleton?" [...] Those who sat on the hatch lifted their eyes in silence, and the next oldest seaman in the ship (those two understood one another, though they hardly exchanged three words in a day) gazed up at his friend attentively for a moment, then taking a short clay pipe out of his mouth, offered it without a word. Singleton put out his arm towards it, missed, staggered, and suddenly fell forward, crashing down, stiff and headlong like an uprooted tree. There was a swift rush. Men pushed, crying:--"He's done!"... "Turn him over!"... "Stand clear there!" [...] Under a crowd of startled faces bending over him he lay on his back, staring upwards in a continuous and intolerable manner. In the breathless silence of a general consternation, he said in a grating murmur:--"I am all right," [...] and clutched with his hands. They helped him up. He mumbled despondently:--"I am getting old... old."--"Not you," [...] cried Belfast, with ready tact. Supported on all sides, he hung his head.--"Are you better?" [...] they asked. He glared at them from under his eyebrows with large black eyes, spreading over his chest the bushy whiteness of a beard long and thick.--"Old! old!" [...] he repeated sternly. Helped along, he reached his bunk. There was in it a slimy soft heap of something that smelt, as does at dead low water a muddy foreshore. It was his soaked straw bed. With a convulsive effort he pitched himself on it, and {{in the darkness of the}} narrow place could be heard growling angrily, like an irritated and savage animal uneasy in its den:--"Bit of breeze... small thing... can't stand up... old!" [...] He slept at last, high-booted, sou'wester on head, and his oilskin clothes rustled, when with a deep sighing groan he turned over. Men conversed about him in quiet, concerned whispers. [...] "This will break'im up"... "Strong as a horse"... "Aye. But he ain't what he used to be." [...] In sad murmurs they gave him up. Yet at midnight he turned out to duty as if nothing had been the matter, and answered to his name with a mournful [...] "Here!" [...] He brooded alone more than ever, in an impenetrable silence and with a saddened face. For many years he had heard himself called [...] "Old Singleton," [...] and had serenely accepted the qualification, taking it as a tribute of respect due to a man who through half a century had measured his strength against the favours and the rages of the sea. He had never given a thought to his mortal self. He lived unscathed, as though he had been indestructible, surrendering to all the temptations, weathering many gales. He had panted in sunshine, shivered in the cold; suffered hunger, thirst, debauch; passed through many trials--known all the furies. Old! It seemed to him he was broken at last. And like a man bound treacherously while he sleeps, he woke up fettered by the long chain of disregarded years. He had to take up at once the burden of all his existence, and found it almost too heavy for his strength. Old! He moved his arms, shook his head, felt his limbs. Getting old... and then? He looked upon the immortal sea with the awakened and groping perception of its heartless might; he saw it unchanged, black and foaming under the eternal scrutiny of the stars; he heard its impatient voice calling for him out of a pitiless vastness full of unrest, of turmoil, and of terror. He looked afar upon it, and he saw an immensity tormented and blind, moaning and furious, that claimed all the days of his tenacious life, and, when life was over, would claim the worn-out body of its slave....|$|E
