40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure, {{based on}} the study of the Autocovariance Function, is described to study isothermal <b>GC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> of multicomponent mixtures. Isothermal GC analysis is the method of choice in space missions since it is, to date, the only method compatible with flight constraints. Isothermal <b>GC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> look inhomogeneous and disordered with peak density decreasing at higher retention times: a time axis transformation is required to make retention a homogeneous process so that CH 2 addition in terms of a homologous series yields constant retention increment. The order introduced into the chromatogram by retention time linearization can be simply singled out by the experimental autocorrelation function (EACF) plot: if constant interdistances are repeated in different regions of the chromatogram, well-shaped peaks are evident in the EACF plot. By comparison with a standard mixture, it is possible to identify peaks diagnostic of specific molecular structures: the study of the EACF plot provides information on sample chemical composition. The procedure was applied to standard mixtures containing compounds representative of the planetary atmospheres [...] hydrocarbons, nitriles ans oxigenated compounds with between 3 and 12 carbon atoms [...] analyzed in flight simulating conditions. The coupling of the selectivity of the SIM detection with the interpretation power of the EACF procedure proves to be a powerful tool for interpreting data recovered from space missions: the chemical composition of unknown mixtures can be dentified by handling the raw SIM chromatogram...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} chemometric {{procedure}} for {{the identification of}} the reference standard chromatographic peak in cases where the GC-FTIR analysis of commercial standards results in the appearance of more than one peak in the <b>GC</b> <b>chromatogram.</b> The procedure has been designed for phenethylamines, which represent the class with the largest number of individual molecules on the illicit drug market, and which are abused for their stimulant and/or hallucinogenic effects. The similarity between their vapor-phase FTIR spectra was modeled using principal component analysis (PCA), and class identity was assigned on the basis of soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). Additional peaks could be assigned to impurities in the standards, but most often they were artifacts formed during the GC-FTIR analysis of thermolabile or chemically unstable compounds.

The detrimental impact of VOCs on air quality and human health pushed state authorities to take measures to reduce their emissions and occurrence in circulating goods.

A variety of leather and textile matrices were spiked with known amounts of the VOC mix.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{purposeful}} induction of malolactic fermentation (MLF) in wines such as Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is {{an established}} commercial wine making practice in Oregon. This induction {{is not always}} successful, especially with white wines, such as Chardonnay. A study was initiated to examine the compatibility of yeasts commonly used in Oregon winemaking with various strains of malolactic bacteria. In preliminary and pilot plant scale experiments, the yeast strain found to be most conducive to malolactic fermentation by lactic acid bacteria was Montrachet (Red Star). The malolactic bacterial strains that were best able to complete malolactic fermentation in various wines, fermented by different yeast strains, were the two Oregon commercial strains, ER 1 A and Ey 2 d, and the Pinot Noir juice isolate, DAPN 85 A. Sensory analysis of aroma by difference from control test was done on Chardonnay wine fermented by 4 different yeast strains and 3 different malolactic bacterial strains. In all cases, there was an overall significant difference in malolactic fermented wine aroma when compared to control wines. Organic acid analyses by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analyses of volatile compounds by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were done on selected Chardonnay wines. Propionic acid was found to diminish in malolactic fermented wines while acetic acid content increased. Isobutanol and isobutyraldehyde increased significantly in MLF wines, compared to the controls. Chemical analyses of MLF and control wines suggested two possible chemical reactions resulting from the MLF. The first was the reduction of isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol, and the second was the hydrolysis of isobutyl acetate to isobutyraldehyde and acetate. On all <b>GC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> of wines, where MLF had occurred, there was an unidentified peak close to the retention time of isoamyl acetate. This peak was not evident in wines where MLF had not occurred. Eight compounds were tentatively identified by GC-MS in malolactic fermented wines which were {{not found in the}} control wines. These were 4 -methyl- 3 -pentanoic acid, methyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, 1, 12 -tridecadiene, hexadecanoic acid, and a compound which was tentatively identified as farnesol, or 1, 2 -benzenedicarboxylic acid. The latter four compounds had identity fits of less than 900 from the mass spectral analysis.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) {{was used to examine}} the distribution of char and volatiles during pyrolysis up to 900 °C. Utilising multi-heating rate thermogravimetric data, the Friedman iso-conversional kinetic method was used to determine pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Light and medium volatile decomposition products were investigated using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py–GC–MS) up to 520 °C.

From results presented in this study, perennial grasses such as switch grass, have the most attractive properties for fast pyrolysis processing.

40|$|The Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process {{produces}} {{a variety of}} compounds over a wide carbon number range and the synthetic crude oil produced by this process is rich in highly valuable olefins and oxygenates, which crude oil only contains at trace levels. The characterization of these products is very challenging even when using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC–TOF-MS). The separation between cyclic paraffins and olefins is especially difficult since they elute in similar positions on the GC × <b>GC</b> <b>chromatogram</b> and since they have identical molecular masses with indistinguishable fragmentation patterns. Previously, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation procedure was used prior to GC × GC–TOF-MS analysis to distinguish between alkenes and alkanes, both cyclic and non-cyclic, however, there was co-elution of the solvents used in the HPLC fractionation procedure, and the volatile components in the gasoline sample and the dilution introduced by the off-line fractionation procedure made {{it very difficult to}} investigate components present at very low concentrations.

40|$|Increasing {{consumer}} {{awareness of}} food safety issues requires the development of highly sophisticated techniques for the authentication of food commodities. The food products targeted for falsification are either products of high commercial value or those produced in large quantities. For this reason, the present investigation is directed toward the characterization of coffee samples according to geographical origin attributes. In addition, the current examination {{is focused on the}} identification of particular marker compounds that compose the volatile and semivolatile aroma fraction of flavoured and dessert coffees. The conducted research involved the development of a rapid headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) – gas chromatography – time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) method for the verification of geographical origin traceability of coffee samples. As opposed to the utilization of traditional univariate optimization methods, the current study employs the application of multivariate experimental designs to the optimization of extraction-influencing parameters. Hence, the two-level full factorial first-order design aided in the identification of two influential variables: extraction time and sample temperature. The optimum set of conditions for the two variables was 12 min and 55 oC, respectively, as directed by utilization of the Doehlert matrix and response surface methodology. The high-throughput automated SPME procedure was completed under optimized conditions by implementing a single divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) metal fiber with excellent properties of durability, which ensured the complete analysis of coffee samples in sequence. The coffee sample originating from an authentic Brazilian coffee producing region and characterized by rich volatile and semivolatile chromatographic profiles was selected as a reference starting point for data evaluation. The combination of the retention index (RI) system using C 8 -C 40 alkanes and the mass spectral library search was utilized for the confirmation of analyte identity in this reference sample.

Traditional one-dimensional (1 D) gas chromatographic (GC) techniques achieved impressive results in the past, but have reached limitations in many cases. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) either coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC × GC–FID) or time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC × GC–TOFMS) is a powerful tool to overcome the challenges of 1 D GC, such as the resolution of unresolved complex mixture (UCM). We studied a number of Tertiary, terrigenous oils, and source rocks from the Arctic and Southeast Asia, with special focus on angiosperm biomarkers, such as oleanoids and lupanoids. Different chromatographic separation and detection techniques such as traditional 1 D GC–MS, metastable reaction monitoring (GC–MRM-MS), GC × GC–FID, and GC × GC–TOFMS are compared and applied to evaluate the differences and advantages in their performance for biomarker identification. The measured 22 S/(22 S + 22 R) homohopane ratios for all applied techniques were determined and compare exceptionally well (generally between 2 % and 10 %). Furthermore, we resolved a variety of angiosperm-derived compounds that co-eluted using 1 D GC techniques, demonstrating the superior separation power of GC × GC for these biomarkers, which indicate terrigenous source input and Cretaceous or younger ages. Samples of varying thermal maturity and biodegradation contain higher plant biomarkers from various stages of diagenesis and catagenesis, which can be directly assessed in a GC × <b>GC</b> <b>chromatogram.</b> The analysis of whole crude oils and rock extracts without loss in resolution enables the separation of unstable compounds that are prone to rearrangement (e. g. unsaturated triterpenoids such as taraxer- 14 -ene) when exposed to fractionation techniques like molecular sieving. GC × GC–TOFMS is particularly valuable for the successful separation of co-eluting components having identical molecular masses and similar fragmentation patterns.

VBOC analytical methodologies are briefly reviewed, and optimal conditions are discussed for sampling with both adsorption/thermal desorption (ATD) cartridges and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers. Air samples containing VBOC emissions from leaves of two tree species (Cedrus atlantica and Calycolpus moritzianus) were obtained by both ATD and SPME. The optimized gas chromatographic conditions utilized a 45 m, 0. 25 mm I. D. low-polarity primary column (DB-VRX, 1. 4 μm film) and a 1. 5 m, 0. 25 mm I. D. polar secondary column (Stabilwax TM, 0. 25 μm film). Excellent separation was achieved in a 36 min temperature programmed GC × <b>GC</b> <b>chromatogram.</b> Thousands of VBOC peaks {{were present in the}} sample chromatograms; hundreds of tentative identifications by NIST mass spectral matching are provided. Very few of the tentatively identified compounds are currently available as authentic standards. Minimum detection limit values for a 5 l ATD sample were 3. 5 pptv (10 ng m − 3) for isoprene, methyl vinyl ketone, and methacrolein, and ~ 1. 5 pptv (~ 10 ng m − 3) for monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Kovats-type chromatographic retention index values on the primary column and relative retention time values on the secondary column are provided for 21 standard compounds and for 417 tentatively identified VBOCs. 19 of the 21 authentic standard compounds were found in one of the Cedrus atlantica SPME samples. In addition, easily quantifiable levels of at least 13 sesquiterpenes were found in an ATD sample obtained from a branch enclosure of Calycolpus moritzianus. Overall, the results obtained via GC × GC-TOFMS highlight an extreme, and largely uncharacterized diversity of VBOCs, consistent with the hypothesis that sesquiterpenes and other compounds beyond the current list of typically determined VBOC analytes may well be important contributors to global atmospheric levels of organic particulate matter...|$|E

Of the 40 identified compounds in preputial gland secretions, 31 were esters, 2 sesquiterpens, and 7 alcohols. We failed to find any compound unique to a specific sex, individual, or strain. However, many low molecular weight compounds between the sexes, most compounds among individuals, and several compounds among the 3 strains varied significantly in relative ratios. These quantitative differences in preputial gland volatiles (analog coding) are likely to convey information about sex, individual, and the genetic background of mouse strain.

The current thesis established new procedures of detailed characterization of AcGX. The xylan OLIgosaccharide Mass Profiling (OLIMP) method encompassed endoxylanase hydrolysis and mass spectrometry detection. The endoxylanase cleaves the xylan backbone into acetylated xylooligosaccharides (AcXOS). As the action is hindered by the side groups, endoxylanase can be a selective tool to liberate AcXOS from plant tissues for fingerprinting the acetylation pattern in AcGX. Additionally, mass fragmentation analyses were performed to elucidate the spatial distribution of acetyl residues. The accuracy of MeGlcpA quantitation using the GlcpA standard was examined by comparing it to the in-house purified MeGlcpA in acid methanolysis and gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Several of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of AcGX were previously identified using Arabidopsis thaliana as the model plant. Herein, the structures of AcGX in Arabidopsis wild-type and biosynthetic mutant plants that are defective in reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence or backbone synthesis, irx 7, irx 9, irx 10 and irx 14; and (Me) GlcpA addition, gux 1 gux 2 were analyzed using methods established for structural characterization of AcGX. Mono-acetylations (2 -O or 3 -O position) were reduced in irx 7, irx 9 and irx 14, whereas 2 -O acetylation was elevated in the (Me) GlcpA deficient mutant, gux 1 gux 2, indicating that the addition of (Me) GlcpA residues is taking place before acetylation of xylans. Structural elucidation on the major AcXOS liberated from wild-type plant suggests that the acetyl residues are added in every other Xylp residue in AcGX. Interestingly, a novel pentose substitution on the GlcpA side group in AcGX was identified. In acid methanolysis, the GlcpA standard was partially lactonized, thus yielding six derivatives in <b>GC</b> <b>chromatogram.</b> When all six GlcpA derivatives were used in the calibration curve, the MeGlcpA content was underestimated by nearly 30 %. The MeGlcpA content can be closely estimated by choosing the appropriate GlcpA derivatives in the calibration curve. The method was used to investigate the impact of Schizophyllum commune glycoside hydrolase family 115 α-glucuronidase (AGU) transgene expressed in Arabidopsis. The (Me) GlcpA content in the ScAGU 115 expressing plants was surprisingly unchanged despite the active recombinant enzyme present within the cell walls. In this work, the acetylation pattern in the AcGX of Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant plants was studied in detail. The methods developed herein revealed that the acetylation of AcGX was reduced in Arabidopsis lines that encode a defective biosynthetic gene related to backbone or reducing end sequence synthesis, suggesting pleiotropic effect of a single gene mutation in xylan biosynthesis. The MeGlcA substituents in AcGX can be effectively reduced by disruption of the glucoronyltrasnferases; however, the substitution in the AcGX of gux 1 gux 2 was compensated by acetylation. On the other hand, constitutive transgenic expression of ScAGU 115 α-glucuronidase did not remove the (Me) GlcpA substituents in planta. The reason may be ascribed to the shielding by neighbouring acetyl substituents, or limited accessibility of the recombinant enzyme to cell wall substrates. Therefore, a viable approach for the effective tailoring of AcGX substituents in planta could be co-expression with an acetyl xylan esterase to obtain synergism between these side-group removing enzymes. Plant biomass represents a plentiful source of carbon on Earth that can be exploited as a renewable raw material for producing fuels, chemicals and materials. However, harnessing the greatest benefits from the structurally complex plant cell walls remains a major challenge. Secondary cell walls, the major component of plant biomass, are mainly formed by complex polysaccharides and polyphenols. These biomolecules are interacting to strengthen wall support, and also contributes to recalcitrance against extraction or decomposition by enzymatic hydrolysis. Cell wall modification via in planta engineering can be utilized to design the constituents of plant cell walls, to thereby improve the extractability of sugars and polymers, or tailor the cell wall properties. This goal is approachable either by manipulating biosynthetic genes or by expressing microbial polysaccharides-modifying enzymes in plants. O-acetylglucuronoxylans (AcGX) are the second most abundant polysaccharides found in the secondary cell wall of dicotyledon species. The model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana has been utilized for the studies of AcGX biosynthesis and modifications. Detailed studies on the compositions and structures of AcGX are needed to detect the outcomes resulted from cell wall modification. Therefore, the current thesis established new procedures of detailed characterization of AcGX. Using the established methods, AcGX in Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant plants were examined. The results showed that the mutation of single gene involved in AcGX biosynthesis could cause multiple effects to the AcGX structures. Additionally, expressing single side group removing enzyme was ineffective to modify the substituents in AcGX. The findings contribute to the understanding of AcGX biosynthesis and modification that will help to improve the strategies devised for plant improvements...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} {{centered}} on the Rancho Villa community in Rogers, Arkansas where several residents have had hydrocarbon contamination in their domestic water wells. The goal of this project {{was to understand the}} hydrogeology in the study area, characterize the contaminant chemically, and determine the source of the contaminant. The hydrogeology of the area was determined from previous theses. Seventeen samples were taken from the wells in the Rancho Villa community; each sample was analyzed for geochemical parameters and by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) for organic compounds analysis. Four of the 17 samples had a visible non-aqueous layer of hydrocarbon on top of the water. Qualitative analyses of the <b>GC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> for the hydrocarbon samples indicate the presence of abundant gasoline and diesel range n-alkanes. Synthetic fuel additives also were detected in the samples. These findings suggest the contamination is from a fuel spill and is not naturally occurring. The carbonate aquifer in the study area is karstified, with anisotropic flow. The contaminant has persisted in the area {{for the past six years}} and is localized in the Rancho Villa community. No reported spill sites are near the community, and no possible physical sources have been identified. The study area is located on the up thrown block of a normal fault; stress fractures associated with the normal fault are likely conduits for the contaminant, and allow focused migration of the hydrocarbon. The water samples with visible hydrocarbon had some emulsification, indicative of microbial degradation. The source of the contaminant was not determined; however this study is a foundation for further investigation in the area...|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} of ephedrine-type alkaloids and their enantiomers in raw herbs and commercial herbal products was investigated by carrying out enantioselective separation in the first-dimension column (containing P-cyclodextrin as the chiral selector) {{of a comprehensive}} two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) system, whereas a polar polyethylene glycol capillary column was used for separation in the second dimension. Naturally occurring ephedrine-type alkaloids and their synthetic analogues (enantiomeric counterparts) were adequately resolved from each other, {{as well as from}} potential interference species in the sample matrix using GC x GC, whereas single column GC analysis was unable to separate all the alkaloids of interest. Detection limits in the order of 0. 1 - 1. 3 mu g/mL and linearity of calibration with R- 2 >= 0. 999 over approximately the range of 0. 5 - 100 mu g/mL for the quantitative determination of various ephedrine-type alkaloids were obtained. The commercial herbal products tested contained mostly (-) -ephedrine, (+) -pseudoephedrine, (-) -N-methylephedrine and (-) -norephedrine, with concentrations in the range of 40 - 2100, 0 - 1300, 15 - 300 and 0 - 30 mu g/g of the product, respectively, and repeatability of analysis was generally in the range of 1 - 5 %. The present GC x GC method is effective and useful for the determination of the dosage levels of the principle ephedrine-type alkaloids in commercial health supplements and complex raw herb formulations, as well the differentiation of ephedrine-containing products that were derived from natural plant or synthetic sources, e. g., simply by visualizing {{the presence or absence of}} the enantiomeric pairs of () ephedrine and () -N-methylephedrine in the <b>GC</b> x <b>GC</b> <b>chromatograms...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{pyrethroid}} is {{an organic}} compound {{similar to the}} natural pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids constitute the majority of commercial insecticides. The major agricultural pyrethroids at present are esters of 3 -phenoxybenzyl alcohol or α-cyano- 3 -phenoxybenzyl alcohol used as a single isomer (deltamethrin) or as a mixture of four isomers (permethrin) or eight isomers (cypermethrin). Permethrin and cypermethrin are two insecticides commonly used in agricultural production in Kentucky and worldwide. They are very similar in chemical structure, but cypermethrin contains a cyanide (CN) group. It {{was found that the}} CN group affects the physical and chemical properties of the two compounds. We investigated differences in the persistence, vapor pressure and solubility in water that might affect their behavior under field conditions. A CN group at α- carbon of the 3 -phenoxybenzyl-alcohol moiety enhanced the insecticidal activity roughly 3 - 6 fold compared to non-cyano pyrethroids. The solubility of permethrin in water is 5. 5 ˟ 10 - 3 mg/L at 20 ⁰C versus cypermethrin that is 4. 0 × 10 mg/L at 20 ⁰C. Permethrin was extracted from plants using hexane and cleaned-up using a 1. 2 m × 2 mm i. d. open glass chromatographic column packed with Florisil. The <b>GC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> revealed the presence of the two sterioisomers (cis- and trans-permethrin) at retention times of 26. 0 and 26. 6 minutes, that corresponds to half-lives (T 1 / 2) of 4. 45 and 3. 41 d, respectively. The electron impact mass spectrum of permethrin extracted from plant leaves and fruits indicated the molecular weight of 390 and molecular ions of m/z 183, 163, 127, 91, and 51, along with other characteristic fragment ions.

40|$|Vanillin (4 -hydroxy- 3 methoxybenzaldehyde) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{employed}} aromatic and flavoring additives in food and cosmetic industry. The industrial interest in vanillin could also apply to its biodegradation products. The microbial transformation of vanillin can open the possibility of new products with new areas of application for products related to vanillin. For example, vanillyl alcohol, vanillic acid and ferulic acid are currently used in the pharmaceutical or food industry. Some species reported to biodegrade vanillin into the related products vanillyl alcohol and vanillic acid, are: Brettanomyces anomalus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, certain microorganisms possess the ability to accumulate lipids when cultivated on different carbon sources, opening the possibility of microbial lipid production as another industrial application. The present investigation focuses on the optimization of extraction methods for vanillin biodegradation products, as well as identifying the isolates of a collection of microorganisms originating from the Faroe Islands that are amenable to being cultivated on a lignin-based media. Finally, the potential for microbial lipid accumulation was also studied. Two analytical methods, Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas Chromatography (GC) were employed for characterizing the biodegradation products obtained after 24 hours and 72 hours of culture in growth medium supplemented with 1 mM of vanillin. The results showed that after 24 hours of incubation, the model microorganism, strain FMYD 002, had consumed some of the vanillin and transformed it into biodegradation products. TLC retention factors and <b>GC</b> <b>chromatograms</b> revealed that the main biodegradation product after 24 hours - when compared to a standard – is likely to be to vanillyl alcohol. Furthermore, vanillin and its biodegradation products were relatively temperature-stable based on a temperature test of supernatant from a 24 -hour culture, however, when the 72 -hour culture had been subjected to the highest temperature (60 °C) some spontaneous decomposition occurred. The biodegradation pattern of the 72 -hour culture evidenced by TLC revealed two additional biodegradation products, one of which migrates in a similar fashion to vanillic acid. After 72 hours of incubation, the biodegradation product presumed to be vanillyl alcohol was no longer observed. Acidification tests showed that the best route for extraction of the product believed to be vanillyl alcohol is to adjust the extracted sample to a pH of 9. The cultivation test of the isolates in media prepared from different lignin-based residual products showed that 26 out of 60 initial strains grew regardless of the concentration of lignosulfonates and vanillin. Moreover, 17 strains grew in nitrogen-limited medium. Eight of the strains accumulated lipids. A preliminary categorization of isolates based on their colony morphology and capacity of growth on different substrates showed that to some extent, their morphology can predict the ability to grow on lignin- and vanillin-based media. This could help future scientists to easily screen for and select isolates with interesting activity for the ligno-cellulose industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} {{atmospheric}} emission discharges by food industries is classically achieved in two phases. The first one consists of sampling the target atmosphere followed by concentrating the {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC) contained in a defined volume of this atmosphere on an adsorbing agent. These compounds are then thermally desorbed (TD) or desorbed with a solvent. In the second phase, the gas phase <b>chromatogram</b> (<b>GC)</b> will be coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) or flame ionization detector (FID) for compounds analysis. Quantitative analysis are usually achieved with solvent desorption followed by GC-FID. However, this mode imposes the dilution of the sample by a solvent and consequently may cause high detection thresholds as well as important matrix effect and possible interferences due to chemical reactions between analytes and the solvent. Besides, a preliminary qualitative analysis (GC-MS identification) is necessary. Combining TD-GC-MS allows very low detection thresholds to be reached, and the matrix effect and the interferences caused by products of the reactions between analytes and the solvent to be eliminated. The use of this combination in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode allows targeting analytes via their characteristic ions, increasing their sensitivity and repeatability insuring more accuracy for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis. This technique was experimented for seeking VOC in the atmosphere around food industries. Peer reviewe...|$|R
