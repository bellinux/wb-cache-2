Club gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} reveal was [...] "an effective narrative, and one which creates a [...] "satisfying" [...] resolution for the viewer {{as well as the}} character. Veronica Mars <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job of subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it’s still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] Which is my roundabout way of saying that while I wasn’t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, I was impressed by how well it worked up to that point. It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A+", its fourth such rating for the series, after [...] "An Echolls Family Christmas", [...] "Clash of the Tritons", and [...] "M.A.D.".|$|E
500|$|Margarita with a Straw premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, and {{was also}} {{screened}} at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, 19th Busan International Film Festival, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The film garnered positive reviews, and Koechlin widespread attention and universal acclaim for her portrayal of a disabled person. While Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter made a detailed note of her [...] "bravura performance in both physical and emotional terms", NDTV film critic Saibal Chatterjee straightforwardly deemed her [...] "absolutely brilliant". Firstposts Deepanjana Pal ascribed her screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, and wrote [...] " [...] <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job of miming the physicality but what is truly remarkable {{is the lack of}} artifice in her expressions". John Beifuss compared her performance to Eddie Redmayne's act as Stephen Hawking in the biographical drama, The Theory of Everything, in his review for The Commercial Appeal. He gave Koechlin the highest praise writing that her performance would have attracted Academy Award notice in a major film studio production. The view was echoed by Variety critic Guy Lodge, who was particularly impressed by her range. Koechlin won several accolades for the film, including the Best Actress Award at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Jury Award at the 63rd National Film Awards. Additionally, she had garnered nominations for Best Actress at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Asian Film Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Rampal's first {{release of}} 2005 was Satish Kaushik's Vaada, {{in which he}} played a lead role {{opposite}} Ameesha Patel and Zayed Khan. The film was a flop. Patcy N of Rediff praised Rampal, writing: [...] "Arjun Rampal <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job; his is a subdued performance, and the model-turned-actor looks great in most scenes." [...] Rampal's next release was Vikram Bhatt's multi-starrer action film Elaan. The film managed to do well and became an average-grosser at the box office. Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performance in Elaan. Subhash K. Jha of IANS praised Rampal and wrote: [...] "Arjun is pretty much on his own. Once again playing a man with responsibilities he brings a controlled conviction to both his scenes with his screen daughter and his engrossing death scene." [...] Merril Diniz of Rediff wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal is almost believable as the rugged ex-cop. He has a deep baritone and svelte body language." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Delacorte Press {{published}} Hickam's second book, Rocket Boys, {{the story}} of his life as the son of a coal miner in Coalwood, West Virginia. Rocket Boys has since been translated into numerous languages and released as an audiobook and electronic book. Among its many honors, it was selected by The New York Times as one of its [...] "Great Books of 1998" [...] and was an alternate [...] "Book-of-the-Month" [...] selection for both the Literary Guild and the Book of the Month Club. Rocket Boys was also nominated by the National Book Critics Circle as Best Biography of 1998. In February 1999, Universal Studios released its critically acclaimed film October Sky, based on Rocket Boys (The title [...] "October Sky" [...] is an anagram of [...] "Rocket Boys"). In an interview, Hickam has said of the movie that it was [...] "fine for what it is, a low-budget feel-good movie, but sadly missed the best parts of my memoir. Still, the world needs feel-good movies and it <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job of encouraging young people to go after their dreams."

60|$|The {{glory of}} Spa has departed!

The industrious inhabitants even now spare no pains to render the abode pleasant, but the capricious taste of the age lures the traveller to other springs, where still pleasanter haunts invite their presence. Germany abounds with watering-places, which are usually rendered agreeable by a judicious disposition of walks, and by other similar temptations. In nothing are the money-grasping and shiftless habits of America rendered more apparent, than in the inferiority of her places of public resort.

The crops, too, look bright and well; and it is a curious circumstance, that here there appears to be no fixed time for harvest. It is no unusual thing to see three adjoining patches of cultivated land—the one having barley in full ear, the second having the crop only a few inches above the ground, and the third undergoing the operation of the plough.|$|E
