50|$|Antonius wrote {{a life of}} {{his master}} Simeon, whom he knew closely.

Sanctor. i. p. 264. Theologian Gerardus Vossius, who knew only the Latin translation, was doubtful whether he should consider Antonius as a Latin or a Greek historian.|$|R

The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression.

5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the 1736 English cricket season was the rise to {{prominence}} of the famous Club, playing games against both Croydon and London. It is known that two games were played before July that season. One was Croydon v Chertsey at Duppas Hill in Croydon; the other is Chertsey v Croydon at the Laleham Burway ground in Chertsey. Knowledge of the games is via an announcement in Read’s Weekly Journal dated Saturday, 3 July, about a deciding game on Richmond Green to be played on Monday, 5 July. In {{each of the two}} matches, the home team won [...] "by a great number of runs". The match at Laleham Burway is the first important one that we <b>know</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> played at this venue.|$|R

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the campaign, about 600 men from the regiment– including a batch of reinforcements that arrived in early October– carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December.

The exact number of casualties suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed in this time.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a eunuch.

Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|In either 1483 or 1484, Josquin is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in {{the service}} of the Sforza family in Milan.

He was in Milan again in 1489, after a possible period of travel; but he left that year.|$|E
40|$|Chard, {{commonly}} referred to as Swiss chard, belongs to the same family as beets and spinach. Although its name suggests that it originated in Switzerland, chard is actually native to the Mediterranean region and <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> first <b>been</b> grown in Sicily. The name, Swiss chard, originated because a Swiss scientist determined its scientific name...|$|R
50|$|Accordingly at 2 a. m. on the 19th, {{accompanied}} by a detail of twenty men of my command and Lieutenant Daley, with Jose Chico as guide, I left camp, and at dawn surrounded the camp of the Indians, which was situated about ten miles from Keysville, upon the right bank of Kern River. I had the bucks collected together, and informed Jose Chico and the citizens who had arrived that they might choose out those whom they <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> friendly. This was soon done. The boys and old men I sent back to their camps, and the others, {{to the number of}} thirty-five, for whom no one could vouch, were either shot or sabered. Their only chance for life being their fleetness, but none escaped, though many of them fought well with knives, sticks, stones, and clubs.|$|R
40|$|Economists {{commonly}} {{specialize in}} some limited {{parts of the}} general field. This is a necessity, due {{to the complexity of}} the different issues, the amount of literature available on each of them and the possibility of recourse to different analytical or statistical tools. However, specialization has its drawbacks. Quite often, specialists in the fields of, for instance, labour economics or industrial organization, utilize tools such as the aggregate production function or Marshallian U-shaped cost curves for the firm and the industry; tools which any specialist in abstract theory <b>knows</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proved faulty. Again, quite often econometric exercises rely on implicit, forgotten assumptions which if duly recognized would deprive the results of any meaning with regard to the interpretation of real world events. The risks of field specialization are commonly countered by the existence of generalist journals, such as the present one...|$|R
