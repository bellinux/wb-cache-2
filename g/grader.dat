5|$|Saori, nicknamed , is a {{girl who}} is a fifth <b>grader</b> in Shuichi's class at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son.

Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of Shuichi's femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for Shuichi. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior.|$|E

Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the <b>grader</b> rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The <b>grader</b> uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both.
