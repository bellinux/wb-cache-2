5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and <b>gas</b> <b>composition.</b> Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E

It's heavy, which are reąuired to operate at least two people. Cumbersome and time-consuming is to place it into the soil by impact method, and often there is fail to reach the planned measurement depth.

This article presents a thermochemical process model based on the H- 2 /C ratio and relative oxygen content (ROC). Therefore, all oxygen-, hydrogen-, and carbon-containing components inside a gasifier are considered, and the model enables the prediction of feedstock behavior {{as well as an}} optimization of the feedstock gasification. Furthermore, producer <b>gas</b> <b>compositions</b> are determinable in a unique way as well as the achievable producer <b>gas</b> <b>compositions</b> deriving from several feedstocks combined with several gasifying agents (O- 2 and H 2 O). The calculated results show that the area of achievable producer <b>gas</b> <b>compositions</b> (AAPGC) derived from hard coal clearly exceeds the AAPGC derived from biomass. Whereas the AAPGC derived from lignite only exceeds the AAPGC derived from biomass for low H- 2 /C ratios. The LHV of the producer gases decreases with increasing the H- 2 /C ratio and ROC values. However, the resulting gas flow for the steam gasification is clearly higher compared to that of the oxygen gasification...|$|R

It hosts a deep water (> 1000 m) gas hydrate and associated seafloor seepage system. Near-seafloor headspace <b>gas</b> <b>compositions</b> and its methane carbon isotopic signature {{along the ridge}} indicate a predominance of thermogenic gas sources feeding the system. Prediction of {{the base of the}} gas hydrate stability zone for theoretical pressure and temperature conditions and measured <b>gas</b> <b>compositions</b> results in an unusual underestimation of the observed bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) depth. The BSR is up to 60 m deeper than predicted for pure methane and measured <b>gas</b> <b>compositions</b> with > 99 % methane. Models for measured <b>gas</b> <b>compositions</b> with > 4 % higher-order hydrocarbons result in a better BSR approximation. However, the BSR remains > 20 m deeper than predicted in a region without active seepage. A BSR deeper than predicted is primarily explained by unaccounted spatial variations in the geothermal gradient and by larger amounts of thermogenic gas {{at the base of the}} gas hydrate stability zone. Hydrates containing higher-order hydrocarbons form at greater depths and higher temperatures and contribute with larger amounts of carbons than pure methane hydrates. In thermogenic provinces, this may imply a significant upward revision (up to 50 % in the case of Vestnesa Ridge) of the amount of carbon in gas hydrates...|$|R

25|$|The oxide {{particles}} then agglomerate to form {{large particle}} chains, which subsequently deposit {{on the walls}} of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as thermophoresis). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the <b>gas</b> <b>composition,</b> resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.|$|E
