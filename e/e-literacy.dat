30|$|Stork and Schmidt (2009) {{noted that}} the absence of {{necessary}} skills could marginalize those who can access and afford to use ICT services. To this end, Deen-Swarray 2016 affirmed that users must develop certain skills, such as the ability to understand, use, modify, and create content and services, to fully benefit from using ICTs. From a broader view, <b>e-literacy</b> skills can help individuals develop e-skills, such as the ability to modify content, required to experience the full benefits and make optimal use of ICTs (Deen-Swarray 2016).

Deen-Swarray (2016) stated that the process of taking advantage of ICT involves being aware of the opportunities presented through devices and knowing how to use the tools which in this study is conceptualized as <b>e-literacy.</b> Deen-Swarray (2016) noted that the definitions of literacy must take on varying dimensions to encompass what it actually means to be literate in today’s information age. To this end, MediaSmarts (2017) noted that to be functional in recent digital world and information society, users must possess ICT literacy which is conceptualized as <b>e-literacy.</b> Husseini and Safa (2009) show that in the information society, ICT literacy is important and predicts the use of ICT such as in SMEs as conceptualized in this study.|$|E
30|$|Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2017) {{has noted}} that {{digitalization}} offers new opportunities for SMEs {{to participate in the}} global economy, but SMEs in developing countries such as Nigeria are lagging behind in the digital transition and the disruptive effects of this need to be considered and addressed. A major factor that hinders the adoption of ICT and causes the disruptive effects for SMEs’ growth and development is literacy in the use of ICT. To fully function in the digital world and information society—which in this study could be synonymous to increase SMEs’ development—users (which are SMEs’ owners) must possess certain level of ICT literacy (MediaSmarts 2017). In this study, ICT literacy is conceptualized as <b>e-literacy.</b> In the changing information society, the concept of literacy has changed from the traditional platform and view such as in the traditional reading and writing to the electronic platform known as ICT literacy (or rather <b>e-literacy</b> as conceptualized in this study). ICT literacy or <b>e-literacy</b> refers to some sets of literacy in the use of ICT that a user should possess in order for such user to efficiently adopt it for developmental purpose. Husseini and Safa (2009) show that in the information society, <b>e-literacy</b> skill is important and predicts the use of ICT such as for SMEs’ growth and development. <b>E-literacy</b> is beyond the technological know-how of ICT, and it includes a wide variety of ethical, social, and reflective practices that are embedded in work, learning, leisure, daily life, and SMEs’ activities.|$|E

40|$|As web-based {{technologies}} have changed {{teaching and learning}} {{and the support of}} learning, {{what it means to be}} literate has also changed. Reading and writing are now only part of what people have to learn in order to communicate in a technology driven society. A new concept of literacy has emerged that is variously described as <b>e-literacy,</b> digital literacy, silicone literacies, technological literacies, and multi-literacies. This paper offers a synthesis of the literature relating to literacy, <b>e-literacy</b> and e-learning. It discusses current definitions of literacy and <b>e-literacy</b> and applies them to the context of e-learning. This analysis was undertaken as part of a Learning and Teaching Fellowship project within Learning Services at Edge Hill University. The purpose was to identify a range of practical support solutions to enable learners become more e-literate.

30|$|The study {{investigates the}} moderating effect of <b>e-literacy</b> and {{business}} information strategy {{on the relationship}} between ICT adoption and performance of women-owned SMEs in Southwestern Nigeria. The theories of information technology trilogy by (J Strateg Inf Syst 10 : 77 - 99, 2001) coupled with the ICT literacy of (MediaSmarts, Digital Literacy Funadamentals, Canada’s Centre for Digital and Media Literacy MediaSmarts, 2017) which in this study is conceptualized as <b>e-literacy</b> were adapted, and five hypotheses were formulated towards proposing an e-literacy-adoption model for enhanced SMEs’ performance. The study adopted the correlational survey research design and consists of women-owned SMEs in Southwestern, Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling was employed in the study, and a sample size of 240 women-owned SMEs was drawn. However, 236 were retrieved, giving a 94.4 % response rate. The questionnaire was used to obtain information, and the correlation analysis was used to analyze the data obtained. The result of the study revealed that <b>e-literacy</b> and business information strategy are significant to the adoption of ICT for effective performance among women-owned SMEs in Nigeria. The study recommends that governments and various NGOs committed to enhancing the growth and development of women-owned SMEs in Nigeria should provide necessary grants and sponsorship towards providing necessary ICT workshops and trainings that could enhance women-owned SMEs’ <b>e-literacy</b> and skills and also the adoption of ICT towards a better performance.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{studies on}} ICT {{literacy}} {{which in this}} study is referred to as <b>e-literacy</b> on SMEs’ performance are few. However, few studies have tried to express and explain their relationship. Digital Innovation for Growth Academy (2014) and Baker and Lomax (2014) have noted that digital literacy which {{in this study is}} conceptualized as <b>e-literacy</b> enhances business performance. For SMEs, digital technologies possess the potential to provide significant business opportunities to business growth (Digital Innovation for Growth Academy 2014). However, Parida (2010) and Digital Agenda for Europe: A Europe, 2020, European Commission (2010) cited in Baker and Lomax (2014) have noted that this significant effect on growth and productivity of SME which is to be brought about by digital technologies has been limited {{due to the lack of}} literacy or skills in using them. This has made <b>e-literacy</b> germane in the studies of SMEs especially in recent ICT era if they should enjoy the benefits that ICT brings to development. This present study focuses on providing an e-literacy-adoption model for an enhanced performance of women-owned SMEs in Southwestern Nigeria.|$|E
30|$|The {{result in}} Table  6 shows that <b>e-literacy</b> has a partial {{significant}} impact on the relationship between ICT adoption and performance of women-owned SMEs in Southwestern, Nigeria (p[*]<[*] 0.05); thus, hypothesis 5 was rejected. This implies that <b>e-literacy</b> has a {{significant impact on}} the relationship between ICT adoption and performance of women-owned SMEs in Southwestern, Nigeria. In addition, digital literacy has the highest mean (69.5776) which makes it to likely be the highest literacy. Information and visual literacy have the lowest means (24.149 respectively), which makes them to probably be the least literacy that contribute to the relationship between ICT adoption and performance of women-owned SMEs.|$|E
40|$|<b>E-{{literacy}}</b> {{is the new}} literacy, {{the literacy}} of the digital age. However, many of the faults of the old information order - particularly its social dislocations - remain visible in today's new information world. Logically, the {{theory and practice of}} <b>e-literacy</b> will also show this pattern. Writers from South America see information functioning as a capital asset, one which is made to circulate and grow in a way that ignores the requirements of those who need it most. Information literacy and IT literacy are simply ways of maximising the information consumption of those who are already information-rich. In a world information order of over-production and data superabundance, it is vital to up-skill the saturated consumers of information assets in order to stimulate demand for the information output of the developed world. Ironically those who are most in need of information empowerment to overcome their economic disadvantage are rarely if ever the focus of the <b>e-literacy</b> industry - if information is regarded simply in terms of its economic value, then <b>e-literacy</b> initiatives for the poor are pointless, since {{they do not have the}} economic wherewithal to consume it. Inclusive information policies should involve more than facilitating access and removing economic barriers to networks and computing infrastructures (vital though this is). It is possible to aspire to a vision of information and IT literacy for the socially excluded which bridges the gap between infrastructure-based information initiatives and their target market of the excluded and dispossessed. This paper will examine attempts from South America and Sub-Saharan Africa to fulfil this aspiration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an integrated security system for electronic-government services. Many governments are transforming manual government services to electronic government services. This transformation is {{in most cases}} done without involving users of the services. This makes users of these services have little trust in the e-government. Security is in most cases not addressed from {{the early stages of}} e-government development. Some governments depend on security solutions from private vendors and these governments do not have full control of security. E-government services have different levels of classification and so they require different types of authentication and authorization methods. Most e-government systems today use one form of authentication in all types of services without considering the different sensitivity levels. All countries have different levels of <b>e-literacy</b> and users with low levels of <b>e-literacy</b> do not understand some of today‘s e-government security systems. This security system provides multiple authentication methods. Some e-government services require simple authentication while other highly classified transactions demand strong authentication. This security system provides multiple authorization schemes, information integrity schemes and digital signature schemes. These schemes can be configured to accommodate different <b>e-literacy</b> levels. The system integrates a registration system, a certification system, an authorization system, and a smart card system. It bases on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standard, which is an XML-based framework for exchanging security information. The system can be integrated in existing e-government systems and can be built-in in new e-government systems. Information of different levels of classification can be stored in same websites and can be accessed through multiple authentication and authorization methods. This system enables the society to perform secure e-government transactions and accommodates different <b>e-literacy</b> levels. QC 2011060...|$|E
30|$|The e-literacy-adoption {{model for}} SMEs’ {{performance}} opined that although ICT adoption can influence SMEs’ performance, however, the elasticity of this effect {{could be affected}} by <b>e-literacy</b> level of the SMEs’ owners.

30|$|Thus, one can {{hypothesize that}} {{considering}} {{the relationship between}} ICT adoption and performance, <b>e-literacy</b> {{could serve as a}} mediating variable between them, and business strategy of SMEs can be affected by ICT adoption and could also have impact on performance of SMEs. With regard this, Pires and Aisbett (2003) affirmed that if a firm adopts ICT-based innovations without a clear understanding (which in this study could be conceptualized as <b>e-literacy)</b> of the scope and implications of that adoption, then not enough attention may be paid to realigning business strategy which in this study is conceptualized as business information strategy. Sandada et al. (2014) noted that business strategy, which is reconceptualized to business information strategy in this study due to the metamorphosis of its usage in the information society, affects SMEs’ performance. In addition, <b>e-literacy</b> can be used to enhance business information strategy and can further enhance the effect of business strategy on SMEs’ performance (Pires and Aisbett 2003; Govender and Pretorius 2015). Furthermore, Mahmood and Hanafi (2012) affirmed that demographic, social change, and innovative ability, which in this study {{could be used as a}} subset of ICT literacy could affect SMEs’ performance in Nigeria.

Several plans and reports such as the Academic plan, draft IT and Information Literacy policy, graduate attributes and recommendations from the Student Life Commission and Curriculum Commission highlighted the need for collaboration between stakeholders to put plans into action. Progress in implementing recommendations and developing initiatives had been slow until the opening of the Kate Edger Information Commons at the end of April 2003. The Kate Edger Information Commons very quickly became the heart of the City Campus and a catalyst for change and collaboration. The Information Commons, the University of Auckland’s leading edge student-centred learning facility, provides a collaborative interdisciplinary environment where over 500 full-productivity workstations, electronic classrooms, and an additional 500 + flexible study and social spaces have been combined with proactive, integrated learning support and <b>e-Literacy</b> skills development. It provides the infrastructure for the functional integration of the information and the technology services, information literacy, learning support and language skills development offered by the University Library, IT Directorate, Student Learning Centre and English Language Self-Access Centre, consequently creating an enhanced learning environment that reflects the transformations in higher education. The development of IT and information literacy (<b>e-Literacy</b> skills) is a key focus for the Information Commons and opportunities for skills development are integrated into all aspects of service delivery.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} the {{thinking}} behind {{the development of a}} tool to measure online discussion group interaction. The output parameters (results factors) relating to both quantity and quality of interaction are explained. Quantity metrics are relatively simple to establish and relate to measuring the number and length of initiated and response postings by both learners and tutors. Measuring quality of interaction clearly moves the researcher into a more qualitative domain. Earlier research at the Open University in the UK (Salmon, 2000) established a 5 -step model of online interaction. Using definitions related to the different stages, this model is applied to evaluate interaction quality. The evaluation establishes a level in a continuum from basic access, through socialization and information exchange, to knowledge construction and finally to autonomous development. A comparative case analysis is provided to illustrate the application of the tool. On the basis of this initial study, input parameters (enabling factors) are tentatively postulated. These include aspects related to: [1] learning design and assessment, [2] tutor management and skill, [3] learner <b>e-literacy</b> skills and [4] peer-related learning.
