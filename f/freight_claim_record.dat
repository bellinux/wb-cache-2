5000|$|The {{intention}} of a <b>freight</b> <b>claim</b> {{is for the}} carrier to make the shipper or consignee “whole” - that is to say, their position {{is as good as}} it would have been if the carrier had carried out their tasks according to the Bill of Lading.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the concordance between <b>claims</b> <b>records</b> in the National Health Insurance Research Database and patient self-reports on clinical diagnoses, medication use, and health system utilization. Methods: In this study, we used the data of 15, 574 participants collected from the 2005 Taiwan National Health Interview Survey. We assessed positive agreement, negative agreement, and Cohen’s kappa statistics to examine the concordance between <b>claims</b> <b>records</b> and patient self-reports. Results: Kappa values were 0. 43, 0. 64, and 0. 61 for clinical diagnoses, medication use, and health system utilization, respectively. Using a strict algorithm to identify the clinical diagnoses <b>recorded</b> in <b>claims</b> <b>records</b> could improve the negative agreement; however, the effect on positive agreement and kappa was diverse across various conditions. Conclusion:We found that the overall concordance between <b>claims</b> <b>records</b> in the National Health Insurance Research Database and patient self-reports in th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Episode {{creation}} {{describes the}} task of classifying medical events and related clinical data to a high-level concept, such as a disease, illness or care. Traditional approaches to the problem have been limited to feature-poor <b>claims</b> <b>records</b> utilizing simplistic strategies such as rules, filters and code transformations. However, these approaches have suffered a number of shortcomings including: inconsistencies in defining episodes; lack of sufficient information to infer episodes; and differences in methods for diagnosing and resolving episodes. With {{the advent of the}} electronic medical record, which contains multiple sources of patient-related information, data is now accessible to construct more accurate and refined episodes. A probabilistic model is described that utilizes features extracted from different medical repositories (e. g., <b>claims</b> <b>records,</b> structured medical reports) to guide a context-sensitive combinatorial approach for associating medical data contained in a patient’s record with their underlying episodes.
