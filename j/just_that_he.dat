500|$|While {{making the}} album, Yellowcard had also {{developed}} a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character is featured in the songs [...] "Rough Landing, Holly" [...] and [...] "Holly Wood Died". The band explained the meaning of the title track, which they said is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged after the release of Ocean Avenue. Key also commented that when he was preoccupied with making the album, there were distractions while in the process; he simply referred to the distractions as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> also says that the main reason behind that was how it affected the band during that particular time.|$|E

500|$|O'Malley was {{characterized}} a [...] "hapless naif". On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting to see is what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E
500|$|Ralph Abernathy {{stated in}} his 1989 {{autobiography}} And the Walls Came Tumbling Down that King had a [...] "weakness for women", although they [...] "all understood and {{believed in the}} biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a particularly difficult time with that temptation." [...] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term [...] "womanizing", {{that he did not}} specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his original wording, Abernathy had claimed he saw King coming out of his room with a lady when he awoke the next morning and later claimed that [...] "he may have been in there discussing and debating and trying to get her {{to go along with the}} movement, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wounding" [...] and [...] "causing grievous bodily harm" [...] {{are defined}} {{in the same way}} as they are in the crime of maliciously {{wounding}} or inflicting grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm includes serious psychological trauma and serious infection; however, these are less controversial here because of the inclusion of intent. Intent narrows the crime considerably, and the term [...] "inflict" [...] is not used. In form (3), intent can be simply decided in the case of a direct attack, or [...] "virtual certainty", with knowledge of the virtual certainty [...] the Woollin principle. In form (1), where an injury does not amount to grievous bodily harm, intent to cause grievous bodily harm (in the advancement of a different cause) must be shown. Practically, the [...] "virtual certainty" [...] clause cannot come into force, since grievous bodily harm was not actually caused, by definition. In forms (2) and (4), the concept of [...] "malice" [...] has a role to play that it does not in (1) and (3). The defendant must foresee the risk of wounding or grievous bodily harm, where the core intent is to resist arrest. The defendant cannot be reckless to the resisting of arrest, it must be an intention. Concerning the requirement to resist a lawful arrest, the defendant only lacks the required mens rea if he believes in facts which, if true, would make the arrest unlawful; not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believes the facts as they are make the arrest illegal [...] a mistake of fact suffices, a mistake of law does not.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, the American {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein compared Stravinsky to Jacopo Peri and C.P.E. Bach, conceding that, [...] "there is {{no denying}} the greatness of Stravinsky. It is <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not great enough". Blitzstein's Marxist position was that Stravinsky's wish to [...] "divorce music from other streams of life", which is [...] "symptomatic of an escape from reality", resulted in a [...] "loss of stamina", naming specifically Apollo, the Capriccio, and Le Baiser de la fée.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1850s Maykov had {{acquired}} {{the reputation of}} a typical proponent of the [...] "pure poetry" [...] doctrine, although his position was special. Yet, according to Pryima, [...] "Maykov was devoid of snobbishness and never saw himself occupying some loftier position even when mentioning 'crowds'. His need in communicating with people is always obvious ("Summer Rain", [...] "Haymaking", [...] "Nights of Mowing", The Naples Album). It's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> failed to realize his potential as a 'people's poet' [...] to the full." [...] "Maykov couldn't be seen as equal to giants like Pushkin, Lermontov, Koltsov, or Nekrasov," [...] but still [...] "occupies a highly important place {{in the history of}} Russian poetry" [...] which he greatly enriched, the critic insisted.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{has said}} in {{reference}} to ants [...] "Karl Marx was right, socialism works, it is <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the wrong species". He meant that while ants and other eusocial species appear to live in communist-like societies, they only {{do so because they}} are forced to do so from their basic biology, as they lack reproductive independence: worker ants, being sterile, need their ant-queen in order to survive as a colony and a species, and individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen and are thus forced to live in centralised societies. Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence so they can give birth to offspring without the need of a [...] "queen", and in fact humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness only when they look after themselves and their offspring, while finding innovative ways to use the societies they live in for their own benefit.|$|E

2500|$|Some modern {{scholars}} argue that, {{contrary to}} what his contemporary detractors said, Leskov had not held [...] "reactionary" [...] or even [...] "conservative" [...] sensibilities and his outlook was basically that of a democratic enlightener, who placed great hopes upon the 1861 social reform and became deeply disillusioned soon afterwards. The post-serfdom anachronisms that permeated Russian life in every aspect, became one of his basic themes. Unlike Dostoyevsky, who saw the greatest danger {{in the development of}} capitalism in Russia, Leskov regarded the [...] "immovability of Russia's 'old ways' as its main liability," [...] critic Viduetskaya insisted. Leskov's attitude towards 'revolutionaries' was never entirely negative, this critic argued; it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw them as totally unprepared for the mission they were trying to take upon themselves, this tragic incongruity being the leitmotif of many of his best known works; (The Musk-Ox, Mystery Man, The Passed By, At Daggers Drawn).|$|E
2500|$|Critics who {{frequently}} admire De Palma's work include Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, among others. Kael {{wrote in her}} review of Blow Out, [...] "At forty, Brian De Palma has {{more than twenty years}} of moviemaking behind him, and he has been growing better and better. Each time a new film of his opens, everything he has done before seems to have been preparation for it." [...] In his review of Femme Fatale, Roger Ebert wrote about the director: [...] "De Palma deserves more honor as a director. Consider also these titles: Sisters, Blow Out, The Fury, Dressed to Kill, Carrie, Scarface, Wise Guys, Casualties of War, Carlito's Way, Mission: Impossible. Yes, there are a few failures along the way (Snake Eyes, Mission to Mars, The Bonfire of the Vanities), but look at the range here, and reflect that these movies contain treasure for those who admire the craft as well as the story, who sense the glee with which De Palma manipulates images and characters for the simple joy of being good at it. It's not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sometimes works in the style of Hitchcock, but that he has the nerve to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In retrospect, the {{majority}} of Leskov's legacy, documentary in essence, {{could be seen as}} part of the 19th century raznochintsy literature which relied upon the 'real life sketch' as a founding genre. But, while Gleb Uspensky, Vasily Sleptsov and Fyodor Reshetnikov were preaching [...] "the urgent need to study the real life of the common people," [...] Leskov was caustic in his scorn: [...] "Never could I understand this popular idea among our publicists of 'studying' the life of the common people, for I felt it would be more natural for a writer to 'live' this kind of life, rather than 'study' it," [...] he remarked. With his thorough knowledge of the Russian provinces, competence in every nuance of the industrial, agricultural and religious spheres, including obscure regional, sectarian or ethnic nuances, Leskov regarded his colleagues on the radical left as cabinet theoreticians, totally rootless in their [...] "studies". Leskov was not indifferent to social injustice, according to Bukhstab. [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> viewed social problems as a strict practitioner for whom only personal experience was worthy of trust while none of the theories based on philosophical doctrines held water. Unlike the Social Democrats, Leskov neither believed in the possibility of an agrarian revolution in Russia, nor wanted it to happen, seeing education and enlightenment, often of religious nature, as the factors for social improvement," [...] wrote the biographer.|$|E

2500|$|They go to {{the cottage}} and Rumplestiltskin states he won't change the man back if they find him because he is {{protecting}} the box. [...] Anna realizes that Rumplestiltskin {{is the person who}} poisoned the Apprentice. He goes on to tell her that the man is just the first line of defense. In order to open the box he needs magic from someone who faced their inner darkness and succeeded as he was planning on Anna not giving the antidote. Anna says that she doesn't have inner darkness and Rumplestiltskin reminds her that due to the contract she will spend {{the rest of her life}} in his tower. Rumplestiltskin taunts Anna by stating that Elsa (Georgina Haig) will be heartbroken since Anna left because of her and become a monster. He also states that the wedding will now be off. Anna refuses to accept this and holds a sword to Rumplestiltskin's heart, demanding him to rip up the contract. He urges her to run him through with the sword, but she collapses after having thought about actually killing Rumplestiltskin. Anna sheds a tear, which Rumplestiltskin collects on his dagger which allows him to open the box. Anna chides Rumplestiltskin for using love as a weapon, but he replies that love is a weapon, it is <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows how to wield it more than others.|$|E
