5|$|Buscetta {{claimed that}} Mafia boss Stefano Bontade {{organized}} De Mauro’s kidnap, because his {{investigations into the}} death of Mattei {{came very close to}} the Mafia, and Bontade’s own role in the affair. Another pentito, Francesco Di Carlo, declared in 2001 that De Mauro was <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> he had learned that one of his former fascist friends, Prince Junio Valerio Borghese, was planning a coup d'état (the so-called Golpe Borghese) with like-minded army officers determined to stop what they considered as Italy's drift to the left. Yet another pentito, Rosario Naimo, who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities after his arrest in October 2010, said that the journalist was <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> of his investigative reporting that damaged the Mafia.|$|E

5|$|By July 1990 the {{government}} began to distribute weapons to civilians in turn, to Krahn and Mandingo who wished to protect themselves. These hastily enlisted civilians became known as '1990 soldiers.' A '1990 soldier' which the President had personally picked, Tailey Yonbu, led a massacre of refugees, mostly Gio and Mandingo civilians, {{on the night of}} July 29/30, 1990 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Sinkor, Monrovia. Some 600 were <b>killed.</b> <b>Because</b> of the previous ethnic purges carried out by Doe's forces, the conflict took on characteristics of an ethnic pogrom.|$|E

5|$|Finally in 520, Vitalian was {{appointed}} ordinary consul for the year, sharing {{the office with}} Rusticius. Nevertheless, the former rebel continued to pose a potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly to his nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527–565). Thus, in July {{of the same year}} he was murdered inside the Great Palace along with his secretary Paulus and his domesticus (aide) Celerianus. According to John of Nikiou, he was <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers, however, put the responsibility for the crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself of a potential rival for his uncle's succession.|$|E

In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested Saddam Hussein had him <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> he feared Abu Nidal would act against him {{in the event of an}} American invasion.|$|E

5|$|The {{disappearance}} of De Mauro remained a mystery and {{a matter for}} many speculations. In May 1994 Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta declared that the Sicilian Mafia {{had been involved in}} the murder of Mattei. He also claimed that De Mauro was <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> of his investigations into the death of Mattei. According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed {{at the request of the}} American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Tom Comstock {{comes home}} {{the next day}} to find his son {{returned}}, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the hit-and-run driver.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule {{does not necessarily mean that}} there was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E

40|$|World War I diary by {{an unknown}} author. From an {{emotional}} and very personal viewpoint, the diarist expresses a changing philosophy on war and its causes. While at the outbreak of war his stance is a very nationalistic one, he later on declares war to be unacceptable and avoidable, blaming it on the press and on those in power. While he maintains that "the German people are good [...] they {{are the victims of}} their higher-ups", he also states that "war is a syndrome of the sickness in mankind's body". "Animals <b>kill</b> <b>because</b> of need [...] only man <b>kills</b> <b>because</b> of hatred". In the officialdom of his time, the diarist states, a candidate's religion and piety mattered a great deal. Being anti-Semitic and of arian origin was tantamount to gaining social acceptance. At war's end Germany is left on its knees, but instead of coming together in a common cause, a time of chaos, demoralization and individual selfishness ensued...|$|R
5|$|Nhu {{then decided}} that his men {{would go to}} Lâm Thao to {{reinforce}} their colleagues. On the way, they stopped at {{the nearby town of}} Kinh Khe, where the instructor, Nguyen Quang Kinh, and one of his two wives were slain by VNQDĐ members in an apparent revenge killing. Kinh had previously been affiliated with the VNQDĐ, whose members took him away. His wife had tried to follow him, so the VNQDĐ captured her as well. French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through Lâm Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's control on the town until the afternoon. They were hopeful that the attack in Yên Bái would have been successfully completed by then, and that the mutineers and people of Yên Bái would come to Lâm Thao and stage their forces before attacking the barracks at Phu Tho. However, they were not fast enough.|$|E

Logan and Mariko travel to Ichirō's house in Nagasaki, and the two slowly fall in love. Meanwhile, Yukio has a vision of Logan dying, and goes to warn him. Before Yukio arrives, Mariko is captured by the Yakuza. After interrogating one of the kidnappers, Logan and Yukio confront Mariko's fiancé, corrupt Minister of Justice Noburo Mori. Mori confesses that he conspired with Shingen to have Mariko <b>killed</b> <b>because</b> Ichirō left control of the company to Mariko, and not Shingen.|$|E
