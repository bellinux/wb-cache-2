5|$|Veracruz is {{the most}} {{dangerous}} place in Mexico for journalists; at least nine <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> been killed since Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa took office in 2010, many of them by the Los Zetas drug cartel. Most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances, and few arrests have been made in their respective investigations. Given the high levels of corruption, criminal impunity, and drug-related attacks against the press all across Veracruz, many local <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> decided to leave the state and relocate in other parts of Mexico. The atmosphere in Veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self-censor and stop reporting on the drug violence. With traditional reporting being too dangerous and intimidating, social media and blogs are often the only outlets for reporting serious crimes.|$|E
5|$|Video game <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> praised {{his design}} and {{fighting}} style {{as one of}} the best of the series.

It won an Environmental Media Award in 1991 {{for being the}} best television episode of the year with an environmental message. Since the episode first aired, the three-eyed fish Blinky has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation. The episode was positively received by television critics for its satire on American politics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.8, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E

5|$|Video game <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> noted {{thematic}} {{similarities between}} the story details of Warriors of Rock and Brütal Legend, an action video game with a world based on heavy metal, developed by Tim Schafer and Double Fine Productions which Activision, at one point, would have published but later dropped the rights. Project lead Brian Bright commented that their inspiration for the game's story was the covers of metal albums, the same material {{that led to the}} world of Brütal Legend.|$|E

A variety of collectibles based on Iori's likeness have been created, including key chains and figurines.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations {{stem from a}} {{clerical}} paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E

5|$|Martínez Pérez was {{the fifth}} {{journalist}} killed in Veracruz during the sexenio of Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa, which started in 2010. The first journalist assassinated was Noel López Olguín (March 2011), followed by Miguel Ángel López Velasco and his son Miseal (June 2011). Then Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz was killed (July 2011), followed by Martínez Pérez (April 2012). Just {{a few days after}} her death, the mutilated bodies of four media professionals were discovered. There would be still another journalist murdered in Veracruz: Víctor Manuel Báez (June 2012). Although not officially counted in the death toll of journalists, at least three <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> been kidnapped and have remained in captivity since 2010: Manuel Gabriel Fonseca Hernández (September 2011), Miguel Morales Estrada (July 2012), and Sergio Landa Rosales (November 2012).|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{was born}} in Panama City, into a {{relatively}} poor mestizo, or mixed-race, family with Native American, African, and Spanish heritage. Noriega's mother has been variously described as a cook or a laundress, while his father, Ricaurte Noriega, was an accountant. Neither had a lengthy presence in his life: his mother died of tuberculosis {{when he was still}} a child. Noriega was brought up by a godmother in a one-room apartment in the slum area of Terraplén. Authors and <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> suggested that Noriega was in fact the illegitimate son of his father and his father's domestic worker, whose family name was Moreno.|$|E

5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. <b>Journalists</b> <b>have</b> regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|The school runs on {{a shoestring}} budget as a {{tradeoff}} for its financial independence and accessibility to low-income students. Tuition is billed on a sliding scale based on what parents can afford. Revenue from rental properties and fundraising supplements tuition income. The Free School started a high school program in 2006. It later spun off as the Harriet Tubman Democratic High School and enrolls about 20 students in both self-directed and traditional classes. Alumni of the school have attended a variety of colleges. <b>Journalists</b> <b>have</b> noted the school's similarity to unschooling and homeschooling, and its work to that of prefigurative politics. The Albany Free School {{is one of the}} few schools remaining from the 1960s and 1970s free school movement. It inspired the program of the Brooklyn Free School.|$|E
5|$|Valor por Tamaulipas ("Courage for Tamaulipas") is a Facebook {{page that}} covered {{security}} updates in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

With over 515,000 likes on Facebook, Valor por Tamaulipas routinely posted messages and photos of crime scenes on its page.

5|$|Journalists {{noted that}} many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked {{negative}} opinion of the game, believed to be tied to the minimal impact on Portal 2s release time. These users cited complaints about the game being too short (with some saying it is only four hours long), the existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions, and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version. <b>Journalists</b> <b>have</b> defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co-op mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E
5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, <b>journalists</b> <b>have</b> learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that <b>journalists</b> <b>have.</b> In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as do other journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E
