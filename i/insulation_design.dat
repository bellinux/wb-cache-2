To cope with that, the power transmission line voltage trends to rise from the extra-high voltage (EHV) to the ultra-high voltage (UHV). 　In UHV transmission systems, the performance of system insulations under switching impulses becomes {{the most important factor in}} the <b>insulation</b> <b>design</b> of the systems because the reduced insulation is adopted in such systems from the economical point of view. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the switching impulse wave-forms for the most adequate <b>insulation</b> <b>design</b> of the UHV transmission systems, and to clarify the switching impulse flashover characteristics. 　As the results, it was clarified that the switching impulse waveforms which occur in the UHV transmission systems vary from 1000 μs to 5000 μs, and moreover, the V-t characteristic curves for positive polarity seem to reach the minimum at about 300 - 500 μs. It has been found from this test that the duration of wave-front at which the flashover voltage reaches the minimum value becomes larger as the gap spacing is longer, and the 50 % flashover voltage curves decrease when the duration of wave-front decreases from 5000 μs to 1800 μs...|$|E

On the other hand, not only computational studies, but also experimental studies are important in understanding the heat and fluid flow in domestic ovens. By having knowledge onhow insulation parameters effect on the energy consumption, getting efficient designs will come through easily. This study focuses on deciding optimum <b>insulation</b> <b>design,</b> by decreasing thermal bridges over itself. Firstly, experiments are performed for determining excessive heat region on a reference oven's insulation. Also these experiments are completed with two different thermocouple layouts in various temperatures and isotherm maps are generated for innerand outer chassis surfaces.

Different insulation designs are devised on the comparison of the conclusions. Standard energy consumption experiments are performed for each insulation designs under the working mode, which the dominant one in heat transfer, is forced convection.

40|$|Asbestos {{has been}} used for many years as an {{ablation}} inhibitor in insulating materials. It has been a constituent of the AS/NBR insulation used to protect the steel case of the RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) since its inception. This paper discusses the development of a potential replacement RSRM <b>insulation</b> <b>design,</b> several of the numerous design issues that were worked and processing problems that were resolved. The earlier design demonstration on FSM- 5 (Flight Support Motor) of the selected 7 % and 11 % Kevlar(registered) filled EPDM (KF/EPDM) candidate materials was expanded. Full-scale process simulation articles were built and FSM- 8 was manufactured using multiple Asbestos Free (AF) components and materials. Two major problems had to be overcome in developing the AF design. First, bondline corrosion, which occurred in the double-cured region of the aft dome, had to be eliminated. Second, KF/EPDM creates high levels of electrostatic energy (ESE), which does not readily dissipate from the insulation surface. An uncontrolled electrostatic discharge (ESD) of this surface energy during many phases of production could create serious safety hazards. Numerous processing changes were implemented and a conductive paint was developed to prevent exposed external insulation surfaces from generating ESE/ESD. Additionally, special internal instrumentation was incorporated into FSM- 8 to record real-time internal motor environment data. These data included inhibitor insulation erosion rates and internal thermal environments. The FSM- 8 static test was successfully conducted in February 2000 and much valuable data were obtained to characterize the AF <b>insulation</b> <b>design...</b>|$|E

It is notable that the traction current circuits were insulated for 220 kV, although they are operated only with 110 kV.

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen the rapid and {{successful}} deployment of ester oils as transformer dielectrics. When evaluating the compatibility of ester oils with existing transformer <b>insulation</b> <b>designs,</b> {{it is essential to}} not only compare the mean breakdown voltages of the oils, but also to consider the role of dispersion and thus the withstand voltage levels (with the acceptable breakdown likelihood). Insulation designers sometimes estimate the withstand voltage of mineral oil from the dispersion of the data, assuming that the breakdown voltages of the oil follow a parametric distribution. However, {{there is a lack of}} discussion as to whether this method would be suitable for estimating the withstand voltages of ester oils. This paper uses samples of breakdown voltages of a synthetic ester, a natural ester and a mineral oil to analyze their distributions, and discusses the applicability of using Weibull and Gaussian distributions to estimate the withstand voltages of the esters. It is found that the distributions of ester breakdown voltages, in particular the lowest breakdown voltage, are similar to those of mineral oil. Consequently there is evidence that from the ac withstand voltage point of view the tested esters are compatible for the use in power transformers...|$|R
