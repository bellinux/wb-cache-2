BACKGROUNDEchocardiograms done in the ICU are often suboptimal. The most common indication is the evaluation of LV wall motion and ejection fraction (EF). METHODSTransthoracic echocardiograms were done in 70 unselected ICU patients. Wall motion was evaluated on standard echocardiography (SE), harmonic echocardiography (HE), and after intravenous (IV) contrast echocardiography (CE) using a score for each of 16 segments. A confidence score was also given for each segment with each technique (unable to judge; not sure; sure). The EF was estimated visually for each technique, and a confidence score was applied to the EF. RESULTSUninterpretable wall motion was present in 5. 4 segments/patient on SE, 4. 4 on <b>HE</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 2), and 1. 1 on CE (p < 0. 0001). An average of 7. 8 segments were read with surety on SE, 9. 2 on <b>HE</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 1), and 13. 7 on CE (p < 0. 0001). Ejection fraction was uninterpretable in 23 % on SE, 13 % on <b>HE</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 14), and 0 % on CE (p = 0. 002 vs. HE; p < 0. 0001 vs. SE). The EF was read with surety in 56 % of patients on SE, 62 % on <b>HE</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 47), and 91 % on CE (p < 0. 0001). Thus, wall motion was seen with more confidence on CE. More importantly, the actual readings of segmental wall motion and EF significantly differed using CE. CONCLUSIONSCE should be used in all ICU patients with suboptimal transthoracic echocardiograms...|$|E
