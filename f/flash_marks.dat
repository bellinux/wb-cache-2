40|$|We {{describe}} and name {{a new species}} of poison-dart frog from the Amazonian slopes of the Andes in Manu Province, Madre de Dios Department, Peru; specifically within the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve and the buffer zone of Manu National Park. Ameerega shihuemoy sp. nov. {{is supported by a}} unique combination of characters: black dorsum with cream to light orange dorsolateral lines, blue belly reticulated with black, and the lack of axillary, thigh and calf <b>flash</b> <b>marks.</b> Within Ameerega, it shares the general appearance of A. altamazonica, A. boliviana, A. hahneli, A. ignipedis, A. petersi, A. picta, A. pongoensis, A. pulchripecta, A. simulans, A. smaragdina, and A. yungicola; each possessing a granular black to brown dorsum, a light labial bar, a conspicuous dorsolateral line running from the snout to the groin, and a metallic blue belly and underside of arms and hind limbs. From most of these species it can be distinguished by lacking <b>flash</b> <b>marks</b> on the axillae, thighs, and calves (absent in only A. boliviana and A. smaragdina, most A. petersi, and some A. pongoensis), by having bright cream to orange dorsolateral stripes (white, intense yellow, or green in all other species, with the exception of A. picta), and by its blue belly reticulated with black (bluish white and black in A. boliviana, green and blue with black marbling in A. petersi, and green and blue lacking black marbling in A. smaragdina). Its mating call also shows clear differences to morphologically similar species, with a lower note repetition rate, longer space between calls, and higher fundamental and dominant frequencies. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16 S mitochondrial rRNA fragment also support the distinctiveness of the new species and suggest that A. shihuemoy is most closely related to Ameerega macero, A. altamazonica, A. rubriventris, and two undescribed species (Ameerega sp. from Porto Walter, Acre, Brazil, and Ameerega sp. from Ivochote, Cusco, Peru). Genetically, the new species is most similar to the sympatric A. macero, from which it clearly differs in characteristics of its advertisement call and coloration. The new species is found near rocky streams during the dry season and near temporary water bodies during the rainy season. Tadpoles are found in lentic water along streams, or in shallow, slow-moving streams. Given its small geographic range, we recommend that A. shihuemoy should be considered 'Near threatened' (NT) according to IUCN Red List criteria...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{three new}} species of poison frogs discovered on recent expeditions throughout Central Peru. Two of these were discovered from the Serranía de Contamana, a small mountain range {{near the town of}} Contamana on the Río Ucayali in Central Peru. The first of these species is similar in appearance to Ameerega petersi, but the two species differ in call and size, have allopatric distributions, and are not close relatives according to a Bayesian phylogeny. This species is also similar morphologically to A. pongoensis, although the latter lacks <b>flash</b> <b>marks</b> above the groin and has a distinct advertisement call. Our phylogenetic data suggest that this species is closely related to A. bassleri, a species which is much larger and usually possesses a brightly-colored yellow or orange dorsum. The second new species has a red dorsum and is similar in appearance to A. bassleri, A. cainarachi, and the third new species described herein, but can be distinguished by its unusual advertisement call. The third new species in this paper was discovered in the upper Huallaga Valley near the towns of Tocache and Juanjui. This species resembles certain populations of A. bassleri and the second new species (mentioned above), but can be diagnosed by its advertisement call which is significantly slower than its closest relatives; approximately one-half the speed of A. bassleri and one-quarter the speed of the second new species. Finally, we discuss the biogeography of the A. bassleri clade in light of these new discoveries. The biogeography of this clade is consistent with the disturbance-vicariance hypothesis, and climatic fluctuations were likely a major driver in th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular polymer processing methods due to its high production rate as well as its ability to produce very intricate geometries at very cheaper cost and within few seconds. There are several flaws which occur while producing plastic parts by Injection moulding, like warpage, shrinkage, <b>flash,</b> sink <b>marks</b> etc. Shrinkage {{is one of the}} most critical problems which causes dimensional changes in the parts during the moulding process. Shrinkage can be minimized by setting optimal process parameters on injection moulding machine. In this study, optimal injection moulding conditions for minimum shrinkage during moulding are found by DOE technique (Taguchi method). Different observations were taken for a material namely Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE). Taguchi method is used to investigate the effects of melting temperature, injection pressure, refilling pressure and cooling time on the shrinkage of LDPE. Taguchi method has two main instruments, which are signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and orthogonal arrays. S/N ratios were used for determining the optimum combinations of the process conditions for shrinkage. The S/N ratio takes both the average and the variability of the quality characteristics into consideration. The results showed that the cooling time was the most effective factor for LDPE followed by refilling pressure and injection pressure was found to be the least effective factor.

The present research reports that spatial separation of pair members resulted in declines in recognition that were similar to those produced with close spacing of pair members. Both for close and separated dot pairs, recognition was best when they were displayed with near simultaneity, which likely generated synchronized spikes in the retina. These results provide cognitive evidence in support of proposals that synchronous neural activity is part of the image encoding process. The physiological literature is surveyed and discussed in an effort to delineate the issues, and a tentative model of retinal response to these stimulus conditions is offered...|$|R

The work {{was made up of}} two large video projection screens, a modern version of the Gramophone, a low coffee table and sofa. The screens displayed a seemingly tranquil view of Central district in Hong Kong at night, including several landmark architectural features that characterize the area. Though it may be seen to resemble Andy Warhol’s infamous Empire (1964), this work was more closely related to its urban content than to any idea of meta-level play with viewing conventions. At the centre of the screens, Ng captured the apparently insignificant flashes of tourist photography taken at the Victoria Peak. Each <b>flash</b> was then <b>marked</b> and etched into a 12-inch disk. The disk was played on the gramophone, producing light and music. The artist wanted to investigate the contradiction between man’s ideas of “possession” and “appreciation” that revolve around the Hong Kong Harbour, an “attraction” to many for over a hundred years. A special video version was also made for the group exhibition “This is HK” curated by Alvaro Rodriguez Fominaya of Para/Site Art Space. The group exhibition was toured to cities such as Barcelona, Seoul, Hamburg, Birmingham, Taipei and Vienna.|$|R

[...] (4:8) His disciples (students) do not understand why he is teaching in parables or even what the meaning of the parables are. <b>Mark</b> <b>flashes</b> forward to later, after the crowds have left and Jesus tells them [...] "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you.

Early Christians used this passage from Isaiah [...] "...to explain the lack of a positive response to Jesus and his followers from their fellow Jews."
