5|$|Following {{her success}} with Smack the Pony, Channel 4 gave Pile a fairly free hand with her next project. Their only {{requirement}} {{was that it}} should have <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a narrative thread to make it more of a sitcom than a sketch show.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E

5|$|Despite the announcement, {{the ambitious}} project became {{inactive}} and was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted and not nearly <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the S$250,000 funds had been raised.

5|$|From 29 January to 4 February, Carlsen {{played in}} the Zurich Chess Challenge, winning the blitz event (+2−1=2) and the {{classical}} event (+3−0=2). He fared worse in the rapid event (+1−2=2), which counted towards the overall standings, but retained <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a lead to win the tournament. The other players in the event were Aronian, Nakamura, Caruana, Gelfand and Anand. On 22 March, Carlsen played a game for his club Stavanger in the final team match for promotion to the Norwegian Premier League. His win over Vladimir Georgiev helped his team to a 3½–2½ win over Nordstrand.|$|E

Around the same time, lying in a bed in an army {{hospital}} ("Before the Lobotomy"), Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness he has seen during wartime and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ("Extraordinary Girl"). He quickly {{falls in love with}} her. His hallucination disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ("Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)").|$|E
5|$|Hot Potato {{features}} seven {{missions and}} seven score challenges. Mission mode requires the player {{to clear out}} a set number of an alien species. There are multiple alien species in the mode and the mission does not finish until the player gets rid of <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a certain species chosen by the game from the road. Score challenge mode tasks the player with clearing away {{a certain number of}} aliens in order to reach a pre-determined score. The game contains bonus levels which are longer than normal levels if the player is able to complete missions under a certain time period.|$|E
5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until we {{get some sort of}} third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas.

The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E

5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E

5|$|When {{the third}} statehouse was {{condemned}} in 1876 the government abandoned the building.

Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone. Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage. Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara.|$|E
