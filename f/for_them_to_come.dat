500|$|... "Customer Loyalty" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. James Poniewozik of Time magazine {{concluded that it}} [...] "showed the stakes behind its characters' paper-pushing lives {{in a way it}} hasn't since Michael Scott left Scranton." [...] He called the first half a [...] "wacky ensemble show", but said that the last part featured elements that allowed the audience to [...] "all but hear the old machinery [...] waking up and sliding into place". Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam's fight was [...] "believable in its arc and its parameters" [...] and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable. Ally Serrigran of Hollywood.com wrote that the [...] "episode was one worth tuning in for." [...] She felt that, for fans of the show who had left when Steve Carell departed, [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] was the right episode <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to the series. She called the fight between Jim and Pam [...] "jarring in and of itself". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam, writing that it [...] "felt just like the kind of argument that two real people would have." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that the episode was [...] "fine" [...] and was composed of [...] "several small storylines, all of which worked". Davinger called the ending [...] "odd" [...] but [...] "effective".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} version of [...] "Grenade" [...] had an [...] "uptempo 1960's surf-style sound with jangle pop" [...] and before a live show in New York, Mars [...] "slowed and stripped it down". The reworked song {{was the last}} track added to the album. In an interview with Sound on Sound, engineer Ari Levine from The Smeezingtons, who carried out the recording and instrumentation on [...] "Grenade", explained that the song was original recorded with [...] "a more guitar‑based arrangement", 15bpm faster. According to Mars, the record was much happier. Mars ended up by playing the song live in showcase for the label and to several booking agents in a slower tempo. The singer and his bandmates rehearsed a lot to that show, yet [...] "Grenade" [...] "sounded terrible". Mars decided to do a [...] "stripped down" [...] version by playing the guitar, while Brody Brown played the piano. The single received praise from the label. The song was reproduced {{in the way you}} hear it. To do so, [...] The Smeezingtons completely rearranged and re‑recorded t, including the vocals, [...] "two days before the album was supposed to be handed in". Levine, added [...] "There was quite a bit of deadline stress involved in that." [...] Despite the time that Grenade took to produce, the writing was among the most difficult songs in album since it took several months to complete. Later, on April 21, 2012, the team said that the last line of the song was the conflict, since it took two months <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with [...] "but you won't do the same". Levine explained which instruments and software was involved in the song: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the population was Xhosa-speaking, and according to the Constitution of the Republic of Transkei, Xhosa was the sole official language, but laws had to be translated into Sotho and English in order <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into effect, and Afrikaans was permissible in court proceedings and for other administrative purposes. [...] In addition, many thousands of northern Transkei residents spoke a small hybrid Nguni–Sotho language, called Phuthi.|$|E
2500|$|The council did not reverse {{four of its}} {{previous}} motions concerning the Marine Corps recruiting center. The council allowed to stand a resolution to [...] "applaud residents and organizations such as Code Pink for [...] ", passively or actively" [...] military recruiting. The parking permit and noise permit for Code Pink was also upheld. Mayor Bates told the San Jose Mercury News: [...] "The Marines {{have the right to}} be in Berkeley.

2500|$|One avian scavenger, the American crow, was {{recently}} evaluated {{as a potential}} vector for CWD. As CWD prions remain viable after passing through the bird's digestive tract, crows represent a possible mechanism {{for the creation of}} environmental reservoirs of CWD. Additionally, the crows' extensive geographic range presents ample opportunities <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in contact with CWD. [...] This coupled with the population density and longevity of communal roosting sites in both urban and rural locations suggests that the fecal deposits at roosting sites may represent a CWD environmental reservoir. Conservative estimates for crows' fecal deposits at one winter roosting site for one winter season ranged from 391,552 - 599,032kg.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrogenated {{vegetable}} oils differ in two major ways from other oils which are equally saturated. During hydrogenation, {{it is easier}} for hydrogen to come into contact with the fatty acids {{on the end of the}} triglyceride, and less easy <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into contact with the center fatty acid. This makes the resulting fat more brittle than a tropical oil; soy margarines are less [...] "spreadable" [...] The other difference is that trans fatty acids (often called trans fat) are formed in the hydrogenation reactor, and may amount to as much as 40 percent by weight of a partially hydrogenated oil. Hydrogenated oils, especially partially hydrogenated oils with their higher amounts of trans fatty acids are increasingly thought to be unhealthy.|$|E
2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 November 1216 Cecilia demised {{all of her}} {{remaining}} {{lands and}} men in Eastleach for 5 years to the monks of Bruerne. On 23 February 1220 Robert de Turville paid the court half a mark to summon Cecilia Devereux to confirm a warrant for 12 virgate (360 acres) of land in Eastleach, Gloucester. On 22 May 1220 Turville claimed the right to warranty the land, and presented a supporting charter. [...] Cecilia acknowledged the previous charter, and requested permission <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to an agreement and grant him a new charter re-affirming his warranty. The right to enter an agreement was withheld as the new charter contained a release by Robert de Turville of estover rights to Cecilia Devereux {{that had not been}} present in the original gift. This issue involved the rights of Turville’s wife, and this had not been defined in the new document. The matter was discharge without a day until they could correct this. The Testa de Nevill records Cecilia Devereux and Galliana de Turville as holding 3 knight’s fees in Eastleach of the fee of Walter de Lacy for ¼ pound.|$|E

500|$|The {{front of}} every pylon held niches for pairs of {{flagpoles}} to stand. Unlike pylons, such flags had stood at temple entrances since the earliest Predynastic shrines.

60|$|The New Red {{sandstones}} {{must have}} come from somewhere.
