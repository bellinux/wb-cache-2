The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The only exception <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia enjoys immunity—the {{president}} {{may not be}} arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> president has {{been caught in the}} act of committing a criminal offense, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream <b>is.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E

25|$|Common {{fractions}} can {{be classified}} as either proper or improper. When the numerator and the denominator are both positive, the fraction is called proper if the numerator {{is less than the}} denominator, and improper otherwise. In general, a common fraction {{is said to be a}} proper fraction if the absolute value of the fraction is strictly less than one—that <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fraction is greater than −1 and less than 1.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{found in}} Harris v.

25|$|The ten-point must {{scoring system}} is in effect for all bouts in Bellator. Three judges score each round with the winner of each round getting 10 points while the loser gets 9 points or less. The only way that an even round can occur <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fighter that won the round has a point deducted for a foul. Rounds scored 10–8 and 10–7 are {{typically}} scored when a fighter wins a round in dominant fashion.|$|E
25|$|Although Torah {{law allows}} for a bat-kohen to marry a challal, convert, or freed slave (Hebrew eved meshukhrar), the Midrash and Talmud cite Rabbi Yochanan's view that a {{daughter}} of the kohen is best off marrying a kohen. Rabbi Yochanan maintains that in the event a bat-kohen marries a non-Kohen, undesired results for the groom are likely to surface, such as poverty or {{the demise of the}} groom. An exception to this taboo <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> groom is a Talmid Chacham.|$|E
25|$|The hastati (sing. hastatus) {{consisted}} of raw or inexperienced soldiers, {{considered to be}} less reliable than legionaries of several years' service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One reason is the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.|$|E

25|$|In most cases, the non-penalized {{team will}} {{have the option of}} declining the penalty; in which case the results of the {{previous}} play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.|$|E
25|$|A beam {{of light}} {{reflects}} off a mirror at an angle of reflection equal to its angle of incidence (if {{the size of a}} mirror is much larger than the wavelength of light). That <b>is,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{beam of light}} is shining on a mirror's surface, at a ° angle vertically, then it reflects from the point of incidence at a ° angle from vertically in the opposite direction. This law mathematically follows from the interference of a plane wave on a flat boundary (of much larger size than the wavelength).|$|E

For example, in 2008, Central Coast Mariners (as the higher-placed team) hosted the Grand Final against the Newcastle Jets at Sydney Football Stadium, due to FFA deciding that Central Coast Mariners home stadium, Central Coast Stadium with a capacity of 20,000, was too small for the event.|$|E

25|$|Like the {{direction}} of a vector a plane associated with a bivector has a direction, a circulation or a sense of rotation in the plane, which takes two values seen as clockwise and counterclockwise when viewed from viewpoint not in the plane.

25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy {{when the market}} rises and sell when it falls {{in order to maintain}} a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> market declines significantly on low volatility so that the capital gain outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall.|$|E
