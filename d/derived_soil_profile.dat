40|$|The {{possibility}} of ecosystem boundary changes in northern Brazilian Amazonia during the Holocene period was investigated using soil organic carbon isotope ratios. Determination {{of past and}} present fluctuations of the forest-savanna boundary involved the measurement of natural 13 C isotope abundance, expressed as delta 13 C, in soil organic matter (SOM). SOM 13 C analyses and radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments were carried out on samples <b>derived</b> from <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> taken along transects perpendicular to the ecotonal boundary. SOM delta 13 C values in the upper soil horizons appeared to be in equilibrium with the overlying vegetation types and did not point to a movement of the boundary during the last decades. However, delta 13 C values obtained from deeper savanna and forest soil layers indicated that the vegetation type has changed in the past. In current savanna <b>soil</b> <b>profiles,</b> we observed the presence of mid-Holocene charcoals derived from forest species : fire frequency at that time was probably greater, and more extensive savanna may have resulted. Isotope data and the presence of these charcoals thus suggest that the forest-savanna boundary has shifted significantly in the recent Holocene period, forest being more extensive during the early Holocene than today. During the middle Holocene, the forest could have strongly regressed, and fires appeared, with a maximum development of the savanna vegetation. At the beginning of the late Holocene, the forest may have invaded a part of this savanna, and fires occurred again. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} temporal fluctuations in the amount and carbon isotope content (δ 13 C) of CO 2 produced by the respiration of roots and soil organisms. These changes have been correlated with diel cycles of environmental forcing (e. g., sunlight and soil temperature) and with synoptic-scale atmospheric motion (e. g., rain events and pressure-induced ventilation). We used an extensive suite of measurements to examine soil respiration over 2 months in a subalpine forest in Colorado, USA (the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux forest). Observations included automated measurements of CO 2 and δ 13 C of CO 2 in the soil efflux, the <b>soil</b> gas <b>profile,</b> and forest air. There was strong diel variability in soil efflux but no diel change in the δ 13 C of the soil efflux (δ R) or the CO 2 produced by biological activity in the soil (δ J). Following rain, soil efflux increased significantly, but δ R and δ J did not change. Temporal variation in the δ 13 C of the soil efflux was unrelated to measured environmental variables, and we failed to find an explanation for this unexpected result. Measurements of the δ 13 C of the soil efflux with chambers agreed closely with independent observations of the isotopic composition of soil CO 2 production <b>derived</b> from <b>soil</b> gas well measurements. Deeper in the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> and at the soil surface, results confirmed established theory regarding diffusive soil gas transport and isotopic fractionation. Deviation from best-fit diffusion model results at the shallower depths illuminated a pump-induced ventilation artifact that should be anticipated and avoided in future studies. There {{was no evidence of}} natural pressure-induced ventilation of the deep soil. However, higher variability in δ 13 C of the soil efflux relative to δ 13 C of production <b>derived</b> from <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> measurements was likely caused by transient pressure-induced transport with small horizontal length scales...|$|R

The dataset considers 19 soil variables that are commonly required for agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop growth simulation, modelling of soil gaseous emissions, and analyses of global environmental change. It presents ‘best’ estimates for: soil drainage class, organic carbon content, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, pH (H 2 O), CECsoil, CECclay, effective CEC, base saturation, aluminium saturation, calcium carbonate content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, particle size distribution (i. e. content of sand, silt and clay), content of coarse fragments (> 2 mm), bulk density, and available water capacity (- 33 to - 1500 kPa). These estimates are presented by FAO soil unit for fixed depth intervals of 20 cm up to 100 cm depth (or less when appropriate) for so-called virtual <b>profiles.</b> The associated <b>soil</b> property values were derived from analyses of some 10, 250 profiles held in WISE using a scheme of taxonomy-based taxotransfer rules complemented with expert-rules.

Widely available geoprocessing tools were applied to estimate native soil organic C (SOC) stocks of Rio Grande do Sul state in southern Brazil {{to a depth of}} 30 cm from previously sampled soil pedons under undisturbed vegetation. The study used a statewide comprehensive soil survey comprising a small-scale soil map, a climate map, and a soil pedon database. Soil organic C stocks under native vegetation were calculated with two different approaches: the Tier 1 method of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a refined method based on actual field measurements <b>derived</b> from <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> data. Highest SOC stocks occurred in Neossolos Quartzarenico hidromorfico (Aquents), Organossolos Tiomorficos (Hemists), Latossolos Brunos (Udox), and Vertissolos Ebanicos (Uderts) soil classes. Before human use of soils, most C was stored in the Latossolos Vermelhos (Udox) and Neossolos Regoliticos (Orthents), which occupy a large area of Rio Grande do Sul. Generally, IPCC default reference SOC stocks compared well with SOC stocks calculated from soil pedons. The total SOC stock of Rio Grande do Sul was estimated at 1510. 3 Tg C (5. 8 kg C m(- 2)) by the IPPC method and 1597. 5 +/- 363. 9 Tg C (7. 4 +/- 1. 9 kg C m(- 2)) calculated from soil pedons.

The results clearly show that an important shift in the relative contribution of tillage and water erosion to total soil redistribution on agricultural land has occurred during recent decades. Historical soil redistribution is dominated by high losses on steep midslope positions and concavities as a result of water erosion, leading to landscape incision and steepening of the topography. In contrast, contemporary soil redistribution is dominated by high losses on convex upperslopes and infilling of slope and valley concavities as a result of tillage, resulting in topographic flattening.

Earlier versions of the dataset, which is continuously updated and growing, have been posted online and are available to the project and the public. The dataset will also be made available through the World Soil Information Service. The current version is released here as version 1. 2...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Behavior {{of mercury}} in <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> with archaeological black earth (ABE) and {{surroundings}} area (SA) from Sítio Ilha de Terra, Caxiuanã, can {{provide information on}} anthropogenic activity of the Amazonian habitat. The samples of ABE and SA <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> were submitted to mineralogical chemical (total and sequential) analysis. The data show that the Hg occurs mainly in goethite and kaolinite in the two <b>soil</b> <b>profiles.</b> The highest concentrations of Hg and Fe are observed in the SA profile. These {{results indicate that the}} prehistoric human occupation contributed to the decrease of the concentration of Hg in soil ABE from Caxiuanã...|$|R

30|$|With {{that aim}} in mind, the focus here {{is on the}} 1 D {{response}} of horizontally stratified soil columns, and on investigating the relationships between corresponding amplification factors on response spectra, and limited number of “site proxies” describing the overall characteristics of the <b>soil</b> <b>profile.</b> A series of 858 real <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> are considered, and their linear viscoelastic responses to vertically incident S waves are computed for 14 distinct, real input waveforms spanning {{a wide range of}} frequency contents. For each site, the geometric average amplification factor is derived from these 14 different loadings, and an artificial neural network approach is used to investigate the correlation between this average amplification factor and various sets of soil characteristics. Sensitivity studies are performed to identify the relative performance of several site proxies, with the goal of proposing optimal combination sets offering a good compromise between physical relevancy and practical affordability. The robustness of the results is tested by conducting the same analysis on two additional sets of <b>soil</b> <b>profiles,</b> termed normalized <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> (NP) and truncated <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> (TP), modified to correspond to a uniform bedrock velocity of 800  m/s.|$|R
40|$|International audienceProximal sensing of soil {{electromagnetic}} properties {{is widely}} used to map spatial land heterogeneity. The mapping instruments use galvanic contact, capacitive coupling or electromagnetic induction. Regardless {{of the type of}} instrument, the geometrical configuration between signal transmitting and receiving elements typically defines the shape of the depth response function. To assess vertical <b>soil</b> <b>profiles,</b> many modern instruments use multiple transmitter-receiver pairs. Alternatively, vertical electrical sounding can be used to measure changes in apparent soil electrical conductivity with depth at a specific location. This paper examines the possibility for the assessment of <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> using a dynamic surface galvanic contact resistivity scanning approach, with transmitting and receiving electrodes configured in an equatorial dipole-dipole array. An automated scanner system was developed and tested in agricultural fields with different <b>soil</b> <b>profiles.</b> While operating in the field, the distance between current injecting and measuring pairs of rolling electrodes was varied continuously from 40 to 190 cm. The preliminary evaluation included a comparison of scan results from 20 locations to shallow (less than 1. 2 m deep) <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> and to a two-layer <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> model defined using an electromagnetic induction instrument...|$|R
40|$|Artists have {{depicted}} soils in paintings since medieval times, {{and most}} landscape and soil paintings {{were made in}} the eighteenth century. The systematic study of soils started later and soil science was dominated by agricultural chemistry for most of the nineteenth century. Since the late 1800 s <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> drawings, paintings and photographs have been depicted in hundreds of textbooks. This paper traces the depiction of <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> in the scientific literature from the late 1700. The first <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> depictions were simple diagrams illustrating different layers and soil processes. Photographs started to appear in textbooks {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. In the 1950 s, several books contained water paintings and from the 1970 s onwards textbooks had colour photographs. <b>Soil</b> <b>profile</b> depictions were merely used to illustrate different orders in a classification system. Since the 1990 s, efforts have been made to depict the <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> in 3 D. The overall trends and pattern found in this analysis not only reflect the technical ability to depict soils (e. g. camera, printing techniques) but also reflect the state of knowledge on the key properties and processes that have formed a soi...|$|R
