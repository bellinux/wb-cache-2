Further, the court found that <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child and custodial parent were linked. The decision led to parents in Ontario being allowed to move with much more frequency. But it caused confusion across Canada regarding the test to be applied in mobility cases. Some provinces followed MacGyver, but British Columbia did not.|$|R
