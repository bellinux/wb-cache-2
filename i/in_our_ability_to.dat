5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E

2500|$|Criticisms {{about the}} {{evidence}} {{used to justify}} the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: [...] "Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement {{of the means of}} inspections." [...] In response to Donald Rumsfeld's reference to European countries that did not support the invasion of Iraq as 'Old Europe', Dominique de Villepin ended his speech with words that would later come to embody the French-German political, economic, and military alliance throughout the beginning of the 21st Century: [...] "This message comes to you today from an old country, France, from a continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity. (...) Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with {{all the members of the}} international community. It believes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> build together a better world." [...] The direct opposition between diplomatic solution and military intervention involving France and the United States which was personified by Chirac versus Bush and later Powell versus de Villepin, became a milestone in the Franco-American relations. Anti-French propaganda exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the New York Post covered on the 1944 [...] "Sacrifice" [...] of the GIs that France had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper The Sun publishing a special issue entitled [...] "Chirac is a worm" [...] and including ad hominem attacks such as [...] "Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe". Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Roy Greenslade in The Guardian published on 17 February.|$|E
2500|$|Ingroup bonding: Oxytocin can {{increase}} positive attitudes, such as bonding, toward individuals with similar characteristics, who then become classified as [...] "in-group" [...] members, whereas {{individuals who are}} dissimilar become classified as [...] "out-group" [...] members. Race {{can be used as}} an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and empathy found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression. This shows that oxytocin may be implicated <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> empathize with individuals of different races and could potentially translate into willingness to help individuals in pain or stressful situations. Moreover, individuals of one race may be more inclined to help individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain. Oxytocin has also been implicated in lying when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of dishonesty in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected. Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit people with which one feels is part of their social group, or in-group. Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. [...] During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals. These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics. [...] Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners. People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin. It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in xenophobic tendencies secondary to this effect. [...] Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific [...] "home" [...] country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.|$|E

2500|$|Brain {{plasticity}} refers <b>to</b> the brain's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> change {{structure and}} function. This ties into the common phrase, [...] "if you don't use it, you lose it," [...] {{which is another}} way of saying, if you don't use it, your brain will devote less somatotopic space for it. One proposed mechanism for the observed age-related plasticity deficits in animals is the result of age-induced alterations in calcium regulation. [...] The changes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> handle calcium will ultimately influence neuronal firing and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> propagate action potentials, which in turn would affect the ability of the brain to alter its structure or function (i.e. its plastic nature). Due to the complexity of the brain, with all of its structures and functions, it is logical to assume that some areas would be more vulnerable to aging than others. Two circuits worth mentioning here are the hippocampal and neocortical circuits. [...] It has been suggested that age-related cognitive decline is due in part not to neuronal death but to synaptic alterations. Evidence in support of this idea from animal work has also suggested that this cognitive deficit is due to functional and biochemical factors such as changes in enzymatic activity, chemical messengers, or gene expression in cortical circuits.|$|R

The tomato is the richest common natural source and its lycopene becomes more bioavailable when the vegetable is cooked {{with a small amount of}} oil, such as olive oil. High levels of lycopene consumption and high blood levels of lycopene consistently have been associated in research studies with support for prostate health, 1 and with the promotion of proper cell replication in the tissues of the digestive tract. 2 Studies have indicated that lycopene offers protection against age-related macular degeneration (i. e., damage to the eyes), against sun damage to the skin, and even against a decline <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> function independently as we grow older. 3 The protective mechanism usually proposed is antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging. Compared with beta-carotene, lycopene is better at scavenging radicals, such as lipid peroxy radicals, and in vitro studies suggest that it is even better than vitamin E in this role. Lycopene is the most abundant carotenoid found in the blood and has been associated with protection of LDL cholesterol against free radical damage, and therefore support for heart health.

Human cultures, widely diverse and varying across the globe, are part of what make us unique and define us as a species.

Accepting this theory poses both problems and benefits: if apes possess culture, how is our relationship with them to change? Do they deserve human rights? Should our conservation practices shift accordingly? In a more positive light, the cultured ape can extend knowledge about human evolution, and even about human culture itself. My goal is to analyze research from professors, primatologists, and anthropologists supporting and opposing these questions and to evaluate this research through an anthropological lens with the intent of bringing nonhuman primate culture to light...|$|R
