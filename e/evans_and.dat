5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nier, , was {{released}} in February 2017. Its music was again composed by Keiichi Okabe and the Monaca team, with Emi <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Nami Nakagawa on vocals, Takanori Goto on guitar, and additional contributions by several artists. A soundtrack album for the game was released worldwide by Square Enix on March 29, 2017. The three-disc, 3:33:43-long album contains all of the music from the game, as well as, like the original game's album, variations on the main theme in multiple languages. Unlike the original Nier, where all of the versions were written and sung by Emi <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> had the same lyrical meanings, the versions in Automata were written and sung by multiple people: the English version by J'Nique Nicole, one in an invented French-derived language by <b>Evans,</b> <b>and</b> the Japanese written by Yoko Taro and sung by Marina Kawano.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{team for}} the event was a young and inexperienced foursome. Mark Tonelli was the oldest {{at the age of}} 23, {{followed}} by Mark Kerry, who turned 21 a month after the Olympics. Both were attending their second Olympics, while Peter <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Neil Brooks were 18 and 17 respectively and had never represented Australia at the Commonwealth, World Championship or Olympic level. <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Brooks were from Western Australia, a state that had never been prominent in Australian swimming. The team members had some contact prior to their Olympic selection; Brooks' family had billeted Tonelli in 1976 when the Australian Olympic team held a training camp in Perth. Brooks cited his experience with Tonelli as a motivating factor in his career.|$|E
5|$|The Kind of Blue musicians {{appeared}} {{together in}} further recorded ventures through the 1960s. Davis {{had made a}} rare post-1953 sideman appearance in 1958 on Adderley's Somethin' Else album; <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Adderley collaborated on the latter's LP Know What I Mean? from 1961. Kelly and Chambers backed Hank Mobley on Soul Station in 1960, and <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Chambers played on the sessions for The Blues and the Abstract Truth by Oliver Nelson in 1961. The rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb backed Coltrane for Coltrane Jazz and one track on his landmark Giant Steps, which featured Chambers throughout. That trio stayed with Davis for the recordings Someday My Prince Will Come and the live sets at the Blackhawk and at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
5|$|The quartet did {{not compete}} {{again as a}} unit {{following}} the Moscow Olympics, as Tonelli retired from swimming immediately after the Games. Australia came third in the 1984 Olympics in the medley relay as the Americans returned to the Olympic fold, with only <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Kerry of the original four swimming in the final, while Brooks swam in the heats. <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Kerry both retired after the 1984 Olympics, and after Brooks retired in 1986, {{the last of the}} Quietly Confident Quartet had departed the Australian swimming scene.|$|E

5|$|The quartet never competed {{as a unit}} {{after the}} Moscow Olympics. Tonelli retired {{immediately}} after the Games, while Kerry took an extended break. The backstroker attempted a comeback in the leadup to the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, but his abbreviated preparation before the selection trials was not enough and he was defeated by other swimmers. This left <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Brooks as the only members of the 1980 team to participate in Australia's medley relay victory at the Commonwealth Games. In 1984, Kerry secured a recall to the team as Australia's preferred backstroker, while Brooks was surpassed by Mark Stockwell as the leading freestyler. Australia came third in the 1984 Summer Olympics in the medley relay as the Americans returned to the Olympic fold; <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Kerry swam in the final, while Brooks did the freestyle leg in the heats. <b>Evans</b> <b>and</b> Kerry retired after the Olympics, and Brooks was not the first-choice swimmer in 1986, meaning that a totally different quartet competed in the medley relay at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Brooks was suspended for drunken behaviour on the flight back to Australia, and then retired, and all {{four members of the}} Quietly Confident Quartet had departed the Australian swimming scene.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 17 was {{the last}} of the Apollo program, landing in the Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972.

Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.|$|E

Ne-Yo has also contributed songs to singers Mary J. Blige, B2K, Faith <b>Evans,</b> <b>and</b> Musiq, among others.|$|E
