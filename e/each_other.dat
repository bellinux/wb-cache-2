5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including Sweaty Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody of the shopping channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong dislike for <b>each</b> <b>other</b> who would try to promote a useless product whilst making snide digs at <b>each</b> <b>other</b> underneath forced smiles and insincere laughter.|$|E
5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, {{evidence}} suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> either members of different prides encountering <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|Bayern Munich has a {{rivalry with}} Borussia Dortmund. Bayern and Dortmund have competed against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for many Bundesliga titles. They also have played against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the DFB-Pokal final in 2008, 2012, and 2014. The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 DFB-Pokal final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a final. Bayern and Dortmund have also played against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the DFL-Supercup in 1989, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. The {{height of the}} rivalry was when Bayern {{defeated}} Dortmund, 2–1 in {{the final of the}} 2013 UEFA Champions League.|$|E

5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together parallel to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise <b>each</b> <b>other</b> individually still remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Ceres and Vesta {{came within}} one degree of <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{in the night}} sky in July 2014.|$|E

60|$|They {{neither of}} them spoke at first, but stood looking, not at <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> faces, but at <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> breasts. At last Barbara stepped forward impulsively and kissed her.|$|R
50|$|PGP users often {{organize}} key signing parties, {{where many}} people meet in person to verify <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> identity using some printed {{certificate of identity}} and then sign <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> keys.|$|R
5|$|Crush and Randy Savage also {{continued}} their feud. They fought <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{during the battle}} royal at Royal Rumble 1994 until Crush eliminated Savage. To end the rivalry, they faced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in a Falls Count Anywhere match at WrestleMania X, which Savage won.|$|E
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach <b>each</b> <b>other</b> they charge one another's scarves. They cannot communicate with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> beyond patterns of singing. Players can help <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{and are not}} necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time}} they remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|In episode 8, Team GSP {{had to pick}} which {{team members}} would fight <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (considering they had 5 members in the quarter-finals). St. Pierre asked each member to pick the fighter they wanted to fight. Johnson and Alex Caceres picked <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and a fight was scheduled. Johnson won by {{unanimous}} decision after two rounds, earning himself {{a spot in the}} semi-finals.|$|E
60|$|Campbells, Macleans, and Macdonalds had {{all this}} while been burning <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> lands, and cutting <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> throats. James visited them, and partly quieted them, incarcerating the Earl of Argyll.|$|R
50|$|Akbar and Lakshmi {{become friends}} after first being {{apprehensive}} about <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> faiths and backgrounds. They respect <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> dreams and ambitions, which much later {{turns into a}} mature loving relationship.|$|R
50|$|According to a United Nations treaty {{both nations}} decided to {{establish}} stronger cultural ties. The two agreed to honor <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> cultural heritage and promote cultural ties in <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> countries.|$|R
5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with <b>each</b> <b>other).</b> While many men talk to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
5|$|Jim and Michael share {{a glance}} at <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> both {{disappointed}} in the days' events.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave {{twelve stars}} Bayer designations, {{labelling}} them Alpha through to Kappa, including two stars next to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as Delta and another two stars near <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as Kappa. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter {{than or equal}} to apparent magnitude6.5. Beta, Gamma and Delta Apodis form a narrow triangle, with Alpha Apodis lying to the east. The five brightest stars are all red-tinged, which is unusual among constellations.|$|E
60|$|Whatever {{the truth}} {{may be about}} love, there is {{certainly}} {{such a thing as}} friendship at first sight. They liked <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> voices, they liked <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> way of smiling and speaking.|$|R
50|$|Marketing to {{suppliers}} {{is aimed}} at ensuring a long-term conflict-free relationship in which all parties understand <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> needs and exceed <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> expectations. Such a strategy can reduce costs and improve quality.|$|R
60|$|The Friend asks {{no return}} but that his Friend will religiously accept and wear and not disgrace his apotheosis of him. They cherish <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> hopes. They are kind to <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> dreams.|$|R
5|$|Lois {{hears about}} Brian on TV, and then discovers {{that her parents}} do not love <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and even raised her {{to believe that a}} {{heterosexual}} couple who hate <b>each</b> <b>other</b> have every right to marry while a homosexual couple who love <b>each</b> <b>other</b> don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E
5|$|M. nigriceps {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black or dark brown; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers. The thorax and pedicel are noticeably darker and brownish red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|Male crickets {{establish}} their dominance over <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by aggression. They start by lashing <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, {{at the same}} time each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E
50|$|After {{previously}} criticising <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> {{coverage of}} Griffin's arrest, Rockhampton's two local newspapers were again at odds over <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> coverage and publicly stated positions regarding {{the events that}} took place in the cemetery.|$|R
6000|$|... "The two wretched lovers cast {{themselves}} upon <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> neck; drank <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> salt tears {{with the}} last kisses; accused themselves {{as the cause of}} <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> death; and then, rising above fear and grief, broke out into triumph at thus dying for and with each other; and proclaiming themselves the martyrs of love, commended their souls to God, and then stepped joyfully and proudly to their doom." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus, neither {{having the}} {{clue to the}} other's secret, they were {{respectively}} puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge of <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> character and mood without attempting to pry into <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> history.|$|R
5|$|Many of the TUF winners {{have gone}} on to fight <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maria and Tommaso's portraits are hung {{alongside}} <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.|$|E
5|$|Max and Steph become {{attracted}} to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Max plunges into grief and remorse for bringing estranged wife Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) {{into the lives}} of the people he cares about. Steph feels sorry for him and invites him out. Max tries to kiss her. Steph and Max began to misread <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and, even as they developed feelings for <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> assume there is no chance at a relationship. When Max took Tom to the safari park to see an elephant named Romeo, that Steph had sponsored for him, Steph found him and they finally told <b>each</b> <b>other</b> that they liked <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and agreed to get into a relationship. Tom initially disapproves of their relationship, but comes around to the idea.|$|E
60|$|How {{the mother}} answered, I can hardly tell; {{but she did}} answer, and they were soon lying in <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> arms, warm with <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> tears. It was almost hard to say which was the happier.|$|R
60|$|Today the {{two girls}} roamed slowly through the gardens of the great court, their arms about <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> waists, pouring the last confidences into <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> ears, for {{tomorrow}} Bertrade had elected to return to Leicester.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I too, poor wretches; and by {{no fault}} of their own or ours either: but if their lords will fall to quarrelling, and then drive <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> cattle, and waste <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> lands, sir, you know--" ...|$|R
