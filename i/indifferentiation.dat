However, cardiac remodling remains limited due to limited cell residency, impact of mechanical forces onto cell survival and tissue hypoxia. Furthermore, lack of cellular electrochemical coupling can lead to arrhythmias. Another point of consideration concerns the use of embryonic stem cells, whereby <b>indifferentiation</b> yields uncontrolled proliferation and possible consequent formation of teratomas. Also iPSCs have been associated with viral infection and eventual oncogenicity. Cardiac tissue engineering is a new technology based on the use of combinations of cells with regenerative capacity, biological and/or synthetic materials, cell signaling agents to induce the regeneration of an organ or damaged tissue. In an ideal scenario, regenerated tissue would reproduce sophisticated asymmetric helicodoidal architecture of the myocardium with the production of specialized extracellilar matrix to stimulate vascularization in the implanted tissue. From a cellular perspective, available techniques are monolayer cell construct onto temperature-sensitive polymer, where their detachment is driven by behavior of the mechanical properties of the synthetic support without the need of any enzymatic digestion such as trypsin. Cardiomyocites sheets have also been successfully implanted with an observed contractile function as a result of inter-cellular communication between the host and graft. However, from a practical point of view, such approach lacks of translational character as all studies share the lack of reproducibility, i.e. a construct of similar characteristics of the native tissue does not guarantee the same results. Another approach resides in the use of hydrogels. Natural hydrogels such as Matrigel, collagen and fibrin have been used as entrapement matrices, wherein the cells to be injected are embedded. However the associated high pressure of injection is associated with a high mortality rate for the cells thereby negatively impacting the benefit ratio of this approach. Furthermore, from a technical point of view, due to the polydispersite of these natural hydrogels, purification is a requisite but very difficult step. Synthetic hydrogels, such as polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, polylactic acid-co-glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, polyacrilamide and polyurethane have been proposed. Metalloproteinase-sensitive polyethylene is of particular interest. Indeed, this polymer modulates its mechanical and biophysical properties accordingly to enzymatic activities associated with cardiomyogenic differentiation of implanted cells. To date, no hydrogel matrix is FDA-approved for stem cell therapy use despite a large number of biomaterials currently commercially available. [...] A general comment on hydrogel based technologies: Natural hydrogel are well-tolerated by the host and cells due to their mimicking the natural ECM in terms of backbone and microstructure. However they suffer from batch to batch variation (a drawback for current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) required for clinical application), high degradation rates, and poor tenability. Synthetic hydrogels are reproducible, tunable and amenable regulatory and manufacturing protocols. Their chemical modification permits the integration of cellular attachment sites and a certain control over degradation rates. Semi-synthetic hydrogels share characteristics of both classes. Indeed, they permit either the modification of the purified natural biopolymers or by coupling the synthetic component with integrin and/or growth factor binding sites.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{immunohistochemical}} expression of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in oral squamous cell carcinoma to better understand the biological behavior of this lesion. The sample consisted of 15 cases of the tongue and 15 of the lower lip. The pattern and intensity of the labeling and the analysis of the percentage of tumor cells immunopositive in membrane for E-cadherin and beta-catenin were related to the anatomic location of the lesion, the presence or absence of nodal metastasis, and the histological gradation of malignancy in the tumor invasion front. The presence or absence of cytoplasmic and nuclear labeling was also recorded. The membrane expression for E-cadherin and beta-catenin predominately displayed a heterogeneous pattern in the carcinomas studied. No significant difference was observed between the expression pattern and the quantity of cells immunopositive for E-cadherin and beta-catenin and the anatomic location of the lesion or the presence or absence of nodal metastasis. However, a statistically significant difference was found between the reduced expressio of these proteins and the high malignancy score. The reduced immunoexpression of these proteins in the membrane may be related to the high degree of cell <b>indifferentiation</b> in cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma with high scores...|$|E
40|$|Basal cell {{carcinoma}} (BCC) and trichoepithelioma (TE) are sometimes diagnostic {{challenges for the}} pathologist {{in terms of their}} differential diagnosis. Although literature is quite rich in information about histologic and immunohistochemical clues to distinguish the differences between both, no single finding must be completely reliable. Moreover, some consider that TE is a better differentiated follicular tumour, while BCC represents a less developed stage in differentiation. For instance, the latter opinion is supported by the evidence of follicular papillae in TE. The formation of a perifollicular nerve plexus happens later than the formation of the follicular papillae {{in the development of a}} normal follicle. The study of the presence of the perifollicular nerve plexus in both tumours which could then provide us with evidence on the stage of differentiation of both tumours. 5 cases of TE and 10 cases of BCC were randomly selected from our archives and an immunohistochemical study for neurofilaments was performed in all the cases. We found a peritumoural nerve plexus in all the cases (TEs and BCCs). Since this plexus is a late sign of differentiation and since both types of neoplasias share it, we conclude that TE and BCC are both terminally differentiated neoplasms. The ability of BCC to infiltrate would have more to do with the acquisition by the tumour of such a property, rather than with a stage of <b>indifferentiation...</b>|$|E

Here, we report {{a patient with}} anultra-rare point mutation [c. 619 C>G, p. Q 207 E] located in a codon adjacent to the most common FOP mutation [c. 617 G>A, p. R 206 H] of Activin A Receptor, type 1 (ACVR 1) and that affects the same intracellular amino acid position in the GSactivation domain as the engineered constitutively active (c. a.) variant p.

However, we found thatthe engineered ACVR 1 (Q 207 D-c. a.) is significantly more active than the classicFOP mutation ACVR 1 (R 206 H) when overexpressed in chicken limbs and <b>indifferentiation</b> assays of chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and myogenesis. Importantly, our studies reveal that the ACVR 1 (Q 207 E) resembles the classic FOPreceptor in these assays, not the engineered ACVR 1 (Q 207 D-c. a.). Notably, reportergene assays revealed that both naturally occurring FOP receptors (ACVR 1 (R 206 H) and ACVR 1 (Q 207 E)) were activated by BMP 7 and were sensitive to deletion of theligand binding domain, whereas the engineered ACVR 1 (Q 207 D-c. a.) exhibited ligand independent activity. We performed an in silico analysis and propose a structuralmodel for p. Q 207 D-c. a. that irreversibly relocates the GS domain into anactivating position, where it becomes ligand independent. We conclude that theengineered p. Q 207 D-c. a. mutation has severe limitations as a model for FOP,whereas the naturally occurring mutations p. R 206 H and p.

40|$|This thesis draws {{mainly on}} psychoanalytic theories, and explicates the {{doubling}} leitmotiv in Bleak House (1971), which portrays Victorian personality as split and its society as fragmented. This {{is seen as}} a suggestion of Dickens 2 ̆ 7 conception of human identity as fragile and vulnerable. Each autonomous character represents a single aspect of personality, so that conflict, when it occurs, is in fact intra-psychic, rather than inter-psychic. The study investigates the problem of the dual or split personality via the quest for identity, and addresses Dickens 2 ̆ 7 perceived need to reward self-effacing characters and punish the assertive. It explores the psychological ramifications of the fragmented personality based on the Object Relations principles of Splitting and Reintegration, and Separation and Individuation, and peruses the realistic development of the characters within psychological parameters. It examines the possibility that, despite Dickens 2 ̆ 7 overt criticism of class divisions and social evils, his ascribing of traits like sexuality and violence to the lower classes, reveals his own ambivalence to class stratifications within Victorian society. The pervasive fog is a metaphor for <b>indifferentiation</b> between various personalities and institutions, and represents both psychic fragmentation and the erosion of law and order and meaning within institutions. The analogous relationship between classes and institutions is discussed in terms of paradigmatic divisions and syntagmatic connections. Special attention is devoted to the submerged dialectic in the dual narrative, under the broad terms of Eros, for the first person feminine narrative and Psyche, for what is considered to be the masculine, omniscient narrator, in order to understand it more fully within the Victorian context of separate spheres for the feminine and masculine, private and public. In concluding, it discusses Dickens 2 ̆ 7 methods of plot and conflict resolution by drawing on his credo of childhood innocence, and the parable of the domestic haven, according to his own peculiar configuration of family...|$|E
40|$|ENGLISH: Social Actor Representation (SAR) {{proposed}} by van Leeuwen (2008) {{is one of}} the ways to uncover the intended meaning or perspective behind a certain text, for example newspapers. In this research social actor framework is adopted in order to analyze two prominent western newspapers, The New York Times (nytimes. com) and The Guardian (guardian. com). The focus of this research was on the representation of the doer of the certain actions, the Muslim society, western countries society, Islamic countries government, as well as western countries government in the articles about Islamic issues posted by those two western media. The reason why the researcher chose Islamic issues to be investigated was since many people speculated that western media launched large-scale propaganda campaign through newspapers. Therefore the researcher wanted to analyze whether the newspapers articles adopted particular SAR strategies in reporting their news related to that speculation through investigating the use of words, clauses and expressions written in the text. This research adopted descriptive qualitative as well as Critical Discourse Analysis approach as the research design. The data were 8 articles downloaded from both newspapers online version published on January to March 2015. The data were analyzed on some stages. First was reading the whole articles in order to get slightly overview about data. Second was analyzing the data based on the theory {{proposed by}} van Leeuwen. The data were categorized into inclusion if the writers shown and performed the existence of certain actor in the text while the data were categorized into exclusion when the writers hid and protected a certain actor in the text. Then the last was making conclusion based on the result of the data analysis. Based on the analysis on the data, the findings revealed that the authors of both newspapers adopted exclusion and inclusion strategies of SAR in reporting their news. The exclusion strategies consisted of suppression and backgrounding, while the inclusion strategies consisted of activation, genericization, specification, assimilation, differentiation, categorization, nomination, as well as overdetermination. Yet, other inclusion strategies, such as <b>indifferentiation</b> and impersonalization could not be found. As the result, the researcher concluded although the titles and the whole articles seemed to report certain news to their readers, in adopting such strategies they were not completely neutral. INDONESIA: Teori mengenai representasi aktor sosial yang dikemukakan oleh van Leeuwen (2008) adalah salah satu cara untuk mengungkapkan maksud tersembunyi atau pandangan di balik sebuah teks, misalnya saja pada koran. Pada penelitian ini, kerangka aktor sosial digunakan untuk menganalisis dua koran asing yang terkenal, yaitu The New York Times (nytimes. com) dan The Guardian (guardian. com) Penelitian ini fokus pada representasi beberapa aktor sosial yaitu pelaku dari tindakan tertentu, masyarakat muslim, masrakat Negara barat, pemerintah Negara Islam dan pemerintah Negara barat pada beberapa artikel yang memberitakan tentang berita yang melibatkan Islam yang dipublikasikan oleh kedua media asing tersebut. Alasan peneliti memilih berita yang melibatkan Islam sebagai subyek penelitian karena dalam kurun waktu beberapa dekade terakhir banyak orang berpikir bahwa media barat melancarkan kampanye propaganda dalam skala besar melalui koran. Sehingga dalam hal ini peneliti ingin meneliti dan mencari tahu apakah artikel-artikel yang terdapat pada kedua koran tersebut menggunakan strategi reprsentasi aktor sosial tertentu dalam melaporkan berita mereka yang berhubungan dengan berita yang melibatkan Islam dengan cara melihat pada penggunaan kata, anak kalimat maupun ekspresi pada teks artikel tersebut. Penelitian ini termasuk pada penelitian deskriptif kualitatif dan juga menggunakan pendekatan Critical Discourse Analysis. Data yang diteliti berupa 8 teks artikel yang diunduh melalui website kedua koran tersebut pada periode Januari hingga Maret 2015. Data yang ada dianalisis melalui beberapa tahapan. Pertama, dengan cara membaca keseluruhan artikel untuk mendapatkan sedikit pandangan tentang data. Kedua, menganalisis data yang ada berdasarkan teori yang dikemukakan oleh van Leeuwen. Data termasuk kategori inclusion jika penulis memunculkan aktor sosial sedangkan data termasuk kategori exclusion jika penulis menyembunyikan aktor sosialnya. Kemudian, mengambil kesimpulan berdasarkan hasil analisis. Berdasarkan hasil analisis data, hasilnya memperlihatkan bahwa penulis dari kedua koran tersebut menggunakan stategi exclusion dan inclusion dalam melaporkan berita mereka. Strategi exclusion yang digunakan terdiri dari suppression dan backgrounding sedangkan strategi inclusion terdiri dari activation, genericization, specification, assimilation, differentiation, categorization, nomination dan overdetermination. Namun, tidak ditemukan beberapa strategi lainnya seperti <b>indifferentiation</b> dan impersonalization. Hasilnya, peneliti menyimpulkan walaupun judul dan keseluruhan artikel terlihat melaporkan berita tertentu kepada pembacanya namun dalam mengadopsi strategi-strategi tersebut para penulis tidak sepenuhnya bisa netral...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho utiliza alguns aspectos da linguagem {{audiovisual}}, através do filme O Rei Leão, dos estúdios Walt Disney, para realizar a analise do valor educativo e da Educação da Sensibilidade do Olhar desta linguagem. Os valores éticos e estéticos são reproduzidos nos filmes e manifestam-se por meio dos elementos cinematográficos da narrativa audiovisual, que querem transmitir virtudes. O desenvolvimento da linguagem e da consciência estão juntos. O mesmo ocorre com, os conceitos (resultantes do processo de nomeação das coisas). A nomeação das coisas e dos objetos não se limita à palavra escrita. A mínima consciência dos desejos, das vontades, do pensar é necessária para que possa ser transmitido aos outros. A Estética, assim como a Ética, são conteúdos da filosofia que emergem do cotidiano. Há complexos de subjetivação constituídos que operam no seio da inteligência, mas também da sensibilidade, dos afetos, dos fantasmas inconscientes e também das grandes máquinas sociais que não podem ser qualificadas de humanas. A fotografia possibilita uma representação do real objetivamente. O cinema é a linguagem da ação na realidade. Com o movimento da/na imagem mudou-se a própria noção da imagem, mudando também a própria percepção da realidade. Com a narrativa audiovisual a natureza da representação do real é alterada. As imagens oferecem uma ilusão de controle sobre a natureza, sendo o duplo do representado, do simulacro. No decorrer do processo histórico o valor mágico da imagem foi se transformando. A propriedade da imagem técnica está na promoção da indiferenciação crítica entre o real e o construído pela tecnologia da era da reprodutibilidade técnica. Por outro lado, a imagem pode se valer da tecnologia para levar a um maior número de pessoas as possibilidades de crítica da realidade, ou seja, convidar a pensar acerca da realidade da “coisa em si”. A participação crítica é problematizadora do naturalizado. Problematizadora de si mesmo no mundo e do mundo em si. A Arte transcende a sua determinação social e se emancipa a partir do real do discurso e do comportamento, preservando, no entanto, sua presença esmagadora. A mudança do foco do olhar também conduziria à abertura para sistemas de valor com implicações sociais e culturais. Na sociedade do espetáculo tudo tem caráter midiático, inclusive a Arte, portanto, desenvolver a sensibilidade para percepção desta nuance da era da reprodutibilidade técnica torna-se necessário. ______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work uses {{some aspects}} of the audiovisual language through the film “Lion King”, from the Walt Disney Studios to realize the analysis of the value of education and the Education of the Vision Sensitivity of this language. The ethical and aesthetic values are reproduced in the films and show themselves through the cinematographic elements of the audiovisual narrative that want to transmit virtues. The ethical and aesthetic values are reproduced in the film and are disclosed by means of the cinematographic elements of the audiovisual narrative that wants to transmit virtues. The developments of the language and of the conscience are together. Exactly it occurs with, the concepts (resulting from the process of nomination of things). The nomination of things and objects {{is not limited to the}} written word. The minimum conscience of the desires, the will, the thought is necessary so that it can be transmitted to others. The Aesthetic, as well as the Ethics, are contents of the philosophy that emerges from the day-to-day. It also has consisting complexes of subjectivity that operate in the seat of intelligence, but of sensitivity, of the affection, the unconscious ghosts and also of the great social machines that cannot be qualified as human beings. The photograph makes possible a representation of the Real objective. The cinema is the language of the action in the reality. With the movement of in/the image changed its proper notion of the image, also switching the proper perception of reality. With the audiovisual narrative the nature of the representation of the Real is modified. The images offer to a control illusion on the nature, duplicating what is represented, simulated. Through the elapsing of the historical process, the magical value of the image was transformed. The property of the technical image is in the promotion of the critical <b>indifferentiation</b> between the Real and what is constructed by the technology in the age of technical reproduction. On the other hand, the image can use technology to reach to a greater number of people the possibility to criticize reality; that is to say, inviting to rethink that concerning reality of the “thing in itself”. The critical participation is problematic to the naturalized one. Problematic of itself exactly in the world and the world in itself. The art transcends its social determination and if it emancipates from Real of the speech and the behavior, preserving, however, its suffocating presence. The change of the focus of the vision would also lead to the opening for systems of values with social and cultural implications. In the society of spectacles everything has a media character, including Art, therefore, to develop sensitivity for the perception of this nuance in the age of technical reproduction becomes necessary...|$|E
