25|$|The {{reduction}} of sea ice has boosted {{the productivity of}} phytoplankton by about twenty {{percent over the past}} thirty years.

So far, Arctic phytoplankton have not {{had a significant impact on}} the global carbon cycle. In summer, the melt ponds on young and thin ice have allowed sunlight to penetrate the ice, in turn allowing phytoplankton to bloom in unexpected concentrations, although it is unknown just <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon has been occurring.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Ulbrich {{introduced}} a hierarchical group system {{inspired by the}} Scouts; following the Meistersinger model, singers could advance from Schüler (beginner) to Sänger (singer), and finally Meister (master). Additional elements, such as patches and a Sängerspiegel ("singer's mirror", equivalent to the Scout Promise) were incorporated. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>this</b> hierarchical group system survived is unknown. However, everyone participated {{in all of the}} public appearances. The idea of a choir camp, which originated in 1930, was re-adopted by president Staehelin in 1932, and a camp was held from October 3–13 in Greifensee that year. The fifth anniversary, which occurred in 1932, was celebrated with a large family night with a lottery and singing.|$|E

500|$|Music {{columnist}} Everett True {{referred to}} [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] as [...] "the most unsettling thing I've heard since Patti Smith uncovered [...] "Piss Factory"... only it's way more personal." [...] In the 1995 book The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll, music scholars Simon Reynolds and Joy Press {{reflected on the}} track, writing: [...] ""Teenage Whore" [...] turns the lowliest member of rock society, the groupie, into the ultimate (anti) heroine. Love rasps out an unclassifiable alloy of growling defiance and retching disgust, while Hole's torturous music grinds out her humiliation and hatred with a creakiness that betrays <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>this</b> howl has been lurking {{in the back of}} the throat." [...] Cultural theorist Jan Jagodzinski also reads the song as the narrative of a groupie and representing a [...] "desublimated ugly aesthetic of the abjected mother." [...] In The Rough Guide to Rock, the song is noted as [...] "coercing the listener into Love's anguish" [...] as well as representing the band's early stylistic choices and aesthetic, characterized by [...] "drone" [...] and featuring [...] "poetic turns of phrase." ...|$|E

[...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5, and mentioned, [...] "Debut director Karan Malhotra shows great promise in making the film visually arresting and maintaining the consistency of performances. But remaking a cult film means you have big shoes to fill. If you’re a loyalist of the late Mukul Anand’s Agneepath, you’re likely to have reservations with this one. But if you leave the comparisons aside and are willing to forgive the faults, Agneepath is worth a watch essentially to savor Hrithik’s performance." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Agneepath 3 out of 5 and said, [...] "It is in the end, an old-fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic, over-the-top style. You're not likely to be bored by the intense action and the solid performances, but prepare to be exhausted by just <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>this</b> film plays on." ...|$|E

We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are so many questions that we have about this show, and that is a good thing. Personally we cannot wait to see <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>this</b> game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter. With the solid introduction to the series, characters, and future storylines, we can't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show. [...] " [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of [...] "Dexter's Top 10 Kills", saying [...] "We all remember our first. First car. First love. First staph infection. And when it comes to Dexter, first kill. No Mike Donovan, the church choir master, wasn't Dexter first dead body, but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter's wicked world of revenge and reckoning."

2500|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for overstating the {{benefits}} or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. [...] A 2007 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report concluded that good evidence for or against water fluoridation is lacking. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy. John Doull, chairman of the 2006 National Research Council committee report on fluoride in drinking water, has stated a similar conclusion regarding {{the source of the}} controversy: [...] "In the scientific community, people tend to think this is settled. I mean, when the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says {{this is one of the}} 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century, that’s a hard hurdle to get over. But when we looked at the studies that have been done, we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should, considering <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>this</b> [...] has been going on.
