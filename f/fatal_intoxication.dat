40|$|Background: Some {{recent studies}} have {{suggested}} a lower risk of <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> in drug-dependent patients under buprenorphine compared to methadone treatment. Methods: Epidemiological reference data for the Munich region suggest that in 2003 approximately 10 % of all substitution patients were treated with buprenorphine, and 87 % with methadone. We studied the proportion of patients under methadone and buprenorphine substitution among drug-related deaths. Data from forensic post-mortem and toxicological analysis were analyzed. Results: Data indicate that in 96 (35 %) of all 272 so-called drug deaths, methadone was involved compared to a single case of buprenorphine, possibly indicating a relatively better risk profile of buprenorphine. Discussion: More prospective studies are necessary to assess the risk of <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> under different substitution regimens. Original Pape...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Substance use {{disorders}} {{have repeatedly}} {{been found to}} lead to premature death, i. e. drug-related death by disease, <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications,</b> or trauma (accidents, suicide, undetermined suicide, and homicide). The present study {{examined the relationship between}} multi-drug substance use and natural and unnatural death. Methods All consecutive, autopsied patients who had been in contact with the Addiction Centre in Malmö University Hospital from 1993 to 1997 inclusive were investigated. Drug abuse was investigated blindly in the case records and related to the cause of death in 387 subjects. Results Every substance apart from alcohol used previously in life added to the risk of unnatural death in a linear way. There were independent increased risks of fatal heroin overdoses or undetermined suicide. Death by suicide and violent death were unrelated to additional abuse. Conclusion The number of drugs used was related to an increased risk of unnatural death by undetermined suicide (mainly <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications)</b> and heroin overdose. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many {{commonly}} used pharmaceuticals such as antidepressants and neuroleptics {{as well as}} some illegal drugs are metabolised by the Cytochrome P 450 enzyme debrisoquine 4 -hydroxylase (CYP 2 D 6). Seven to ten percent of Caucasians lack this enzyme which can lead to adverse reactions and in some cases to unexpected <b>intoxication</b> even with <b>fatal</b> outcome, upon administration of drugs in normal therapeutic doses. 236 individuals who had died due to intoxication of pharmaceuticals were genotyped for CYP 2 D 6 and compared to a reference group of 281 blood donors. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) method was used to identify five CYP 2 D 6 alleles: * 1 (wt), * 2, * 3, * 4 and * 6. Allele * 5, a complete gene deletion, was identified by a multiplex amplification of long DNA fragments. The prevalence of the CYP 2 D 6 PM genotype in the <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> was lower (4. 7 %) compared to the blood donors (8. 5 %).

40|$|In postmortem {{investigations}} of <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> {{it is often}} challenging to determine which drug/s caused the death. To improve the interpretation of postmortem blood concentrations of sedative and hypnotic drugs and/or clonazepam, all medico-legal autopsies in Sweden - where these drugs had been detected in femoral vein blood during 1992 - 2006 - were identified in the databases of the National Board of Forensic Medicine. For each drug, concentrations in postmortem control cases - where {{the cause of death}} was not intoxication and where incapacitation by drugs could be excluded - were compiled as well as the levels found in living subjects; drugged driving cases and therapeutic drug monitoring cases. Subsequently, <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> were assessed with regards to the primary substances contributing to death, and blood levels were compiled for single and multiple drug intoxications. The postmortem femoral blood levels are reported for 16 sedative and hypnotic drugs, based on findings in 3560 autopsy cases. The cases were classified as single substance intoxications (N = 498), multiple substance intoxications (N = 1555) and postmortem controls (N = 1507). Each autopsy case could be represented more than once in the group of multiple intoxications and among the postmortem controls if more than one of the included substances were detected. The concentration ranges for all groups are provided. Overlap in concentrations between <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> and reference groups was seen for most substances. However, the concentrations found in single and multiple intoxications were significantly higher than concentrations found in postmortem controls for all substances except alprazolam and triazolam. Concentrations observed among drugged drivers were similar to the concentrations observed among the therapeutic drug monitoring cases. Flunitrazepam was the substance with the highest number of single intoxications, when related to sales. In summary, this study provides reference drug concentrations primarily to be used for improving interpretation of postmortem drug levels in obscure cases, but which also may assist in drug safety work and in pharmacovigilance efforts...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} case of <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxication</b> by the {{application}} of a transdermal fentanyl patch upon a superficial bleeding abrasion of a 2 -year-old girl. The grandmother discovered the body of the child in bed at approximately 7 a. m. External examination revealed a properly developed, nourished, and hydrated child, with some vomit in the nostrils and inside the mouth. There was no evidence of trauma besides small contusions and abrasions on the knees, with a patch placed over the largest abrasion. Closer inspection revealed that this was transdermal fentanyl patch. Internal examination and microscopic analysis revealed regurgitation of stomach content, cerebral and pulmonary edema, and liver congestion. Toxicology analysis revealed trace levels of fentanyl in the blood just above the limit of detection (2 ng/mL), while concentrations in the urine, liver, and kidney were approximately 102, 28, and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Investigation discovered that the child injured her knee while playing the evening before. The grandmother applied the patch to cover the injury, unaware that she had used a fentanyl transdermal patch instead of simple band-aid. Although fatal intoxications are uncommon among young children in high-income countries, it is of major interest to raise awareness of such events especially since a great majority of these are preventable.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Risk {{factors for}} suicide and <b>fatal</b> {{accidental}} <b>intoxication</b> are extensively studied, while {{risk factors for}} intoxications/injuries of undetermined intent are less well known. The latter have shown an overlap with suicides, but also with <b>fatal</b> accidental <b>intoxications.</b> The objective was to analyze potential differences and similarities in the patterns of risk factors for accidental intoxications, injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent, and suicides, respectively. METHODS: A follow-up register study was conducted, using data from ASI interviews with clients {{in the criminal justice}} system in Sweden (n= 6744), followed in the National Causes of Death Register. A set of risk factors from the ASI interview were tested in bivariate analysis with the respective cause of death, yielding significant risk factors further analyzed in three Cox regression models. RESULTS: In Cox regression analyses, death from <b>fatal</b> accidental <b>intoxication</b> was associated with male gender (HR 4. 09), use of heroin (HR 2. 86), and use of cannabis (HR 1. 94), and death from intoxication/injury of undetermined intent was associated with use of heroin (HR 3. 48), binge drinking of alcohol (HR 2. 46) and previous psychiatric hospitalization (HR 2. 41), while negatively associated with depression (HR 0. 33). Death from suicide was associated with previous suicide attempts (HR 2. 78) and use of sedatives (HR 2. 17).

40|$|In Sweden about 550 {{individuals}} die {{every year}} due to drug intoxication. A {{challenge for the}} forensic toxicologist is {{to determine whether or}} not the analytical results can explain intoxication as a cause of death. The most common drugs found among intoxication cases are psychiatric drugs and analgesics. Many of these drugs are metabolised by CYP-enzymes such as CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 2 C 19. Genetic variations, polymorphisms, in the genes coding for these enzymes can lead to an inactive enzyme resulting in poor metabolism, which can lead to adverse drug reactions, even with fatal outcome. The CYP 2 D 6 gene can be multiplied, which can lead to an ultra-rapid metabolism if the alleles are active. Another polymorphism, in the CYP 2 C 19 gene, can also lead to an ultra-rapid metabolism. This increased metabolism can result in insufficient drug plasma concentration and, with that, failed treatment. Alternately, if the drug is a pro-drug and has to be activated by these enzymes, it can lead to a high amount of active metabolites. There is a large inter-individual variation of these polymorphisms and also a large variation between different populations. Additional information about an individual’s pharmacogenetics may possibly facilitate the interpretation of the postmortem result and contribute to solve the “toxicological puzzle”. The general aim of this thesis was to study if genetic variation in the drug metabolising enzymes, CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 2 C 19 can contribute to <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxication.</b> Reliable and rapid SNP and CNV assays suitable for forensic samples using PCR and pyrosequencing were developed for CYP 2 D 6 and genotype frequencies in a Swedish population were shown to be in concordance with earlier published data. SNP assays were established for polymorphisms in the CYP 2 C 19 gene. Genotype distributions in <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxication</b> cases were compared with Swedish blood donors and significant difference between the materials were established. The allele CYP 2 D 6 * 4 was found to be less frequent among the intoxication cases, as compared with the blood donors. No differences in CYP 2 C 19 genotype frequencies were found between the materials. These findings are the opposite of our hypothesis that we expected to find an increased number of individuals carrying genetic variations, leading to poor metabolism among <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxication</b> cases. However, we are convinced that information concerning an individual’s genotype can be of importance in specific intoxication cases. Further studies are required to illuminate this question. Two further autopsy materials were studied; suicide cases (intoxications excluded) and natural death cases. A significant increased number of individuals carrying more than two active CYP 2 D 6 alleles among the suicide cases were found compared to natural death cases. Furthermore, we found some significant differences between the materials when the individuals in each material were grouped according to how many active CYP 2 D 6 alleles they carry in combination with the CYP 2 C 19 genotype, which was divided into six subgroups. We do not currently have any explanation for the differences between the materials...|$|E

Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, {{has been found}} by numerous studies {{to be an effective}} and safe medication in the treatment of opioid dependence. At present, buprenorphine is available as a monodrug or in a fixed 4 : 1 ratio combination with naloxone. A diminished risk of diversion and abuse for the buprenorphine–naloxone combination is likely but not firmly established. Conventional formulations are given sublingually to avoid the hepatic first-pass effect. A novel film tablet is available only in the US and Australia. Other novel, sustained-release formulations (implant, depot) are currently being developed and tested. Recent studies, including a Cochrane meta-analysis, suggest that the retention with buprenorphine is lower than for methadone, but that buprenorphine may be associated with less drug use. Higher doses of buprenorphine are associated with better retention rates. Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect at the opioid receptor with regard to respiratory depression, and may cause fewer <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> than methadone.

40|$|In {{forensic}} toxicology, several <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> with fentanyl {{have occurred}} in the recent past, but there are rare discussions in the lit-erature of postmortem fentanyl blood concentrations subsequent to lethal and non lethal applications. To study this problem, we ana-lyzed postmortem blood concentrations (vena femoralis) of 118 cases with therapeutic use of fentanyl and compared them with serum levels of 27 living persons after therapeutic administration of fentanyl patches (Durogesic). Basically, blood concentrations in postmortem specimens cannot be directly compared with in vivo serum levels: in our study, we observed that postmortem fentanyl blood concentrations were on average up to nine times higher than in vivo serum levels at the same dose. These differences could be explained by postmortem redistribution, but they were higher than expected {{on the basis of the}} physical and chemical properties of fentanyl alone. The special pharmacokinetics of the drug after long term transdermal application seem to play an important role in this phenomenon. In addition, there was no clear correlation between transdermal fentanyl dose and blood or serum concentrations, either antemortem or postmortem.

50|$|In pharmacology, {{efficacy}} (Emax) is a {{term used}} to describe the maximum response achievable from a drug. There is little information available on Methedrone and its efficacy. According to users, the doses of Methedrone vary from 50 to 500 mg with a duration of effects range from 45 minutes to two hours. There are two cases known of <b>fatal</b> <b>intoxications</b> with Methedrone. In the first case, the postmortem femoral blood sample of the patient contained a concentration of 8.4 µg/g Methedrone, the patient died after 16 hours (but other compounds such as diazepam were also detected in his blood). In the second case the concentration of Methedrone in the postmortem femoral blood sample was 9.6 µg/g and methedrone was the only toxic compound detected. Recent studies to these fatal cases suggest that the Methedrone alone was responsible for these deaths and that the concentrations in the femoral blood represent the fatal levels of methedrone. Also, these studies show that there is little window range between a fatal dose and a non-fatal dose, this means that the safety gap is small. A fatal dose is more than 8 µg/g whereas the dose among the living cases which were studied varied from 0.1 to 4.8 µg/g blood. Knowing this, it is concluded that the dose of efficacy of Methedrone is around 8 µg/g blood, leading to death.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: The <b>fatal</b> carbon {{monoxide}} <b>intoxication</b> is still persists {{as a public}} health problem in Tunisia. The reduction of its frequency requires the implementation of a well-structured prevention plan based on epidemiological data from a national registry. The identification of these data requires mandatory reporting of this type of intoxication in Tunisia.|$|R

The two cases we present here illustrate exemplarily the pros and contras of colchicine therapy. In the first case, colchicine was successfully given for recurrent febrile attacks due to acute rheumatic fever. The second patient unfortunately had a <b>fatal</b> colchicine <b>intoxication.</b> The pharmacology of colchicine, the clinical features associated with overdose and the options for treatment are discussed. Colchicine should not be given in combination with macrolides, especially in patients with renal insufficiency...|$|R
