5|$|Amongst {{non-governmental}} organizations (NGOs) working to end child marriage are Girls not Brides, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the <b>International</b> <b>Center</b> for Research on Women (ICRW) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). Although not explicitly {{included in the}} original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the percentage of women aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with empowering women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the Girl Child in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{prepared}} by TAC member M. H. Arnold {{at the request}} of the TAC Chairman as background to consideration of the possible expansion of the CGIAR. A draft was discussed at TAC 50, and then by a small panel appointed to examine the evolving relationship between IARCs and national research systems. The revised version was presented at TAC 51 to a joint meeting with center directors and board chairs and at the CGIAR meeting, May 1990. After reviewing basic CGIAR precepts, the paper takes a clean slate approach to discussion of the rationale for international agricultural research, and for <b>international</b> <b>centers.</b> It addresses the relationships between <b>international</b> <b>centers</b> and national systems, and the task of strengthening the latter. Finally, it discusses the possible division of responsibilities among <b>international</b> <b>centers,</b> considering structures built on disciplines, limiting factors, eco-systems, commodities, and geographical regions. It concludes that two sets of centers one with commodity responsibilities, and the other with eco regional responsibilities might best meet the needs of the developing countries, but notes that enabling mechanisms, either in or outside the CGIAR, are required to assist national systems to deal with <b>international</b> <b>centers</b> in terms of their own national priorities...|$|R
