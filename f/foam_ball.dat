Popeye's Seaport offered eleven children's' attractions, including an interactive <b>foam</b> <b>ball</b> play structure and an interactive water play area. DinoSphere took {{the place of the}} park's Australian Walk-A-Bout attraction (also the former home of the [...] "Dinosaurs!" [...] attraction).

40|$|Recently, {{bistable}} springs {{have been}} proven as a viable propulsion method for the standard 1. 75 " <b>foam</b> <b>balls</b> used in Nerf® projectile toys. This technology was developed at M. I. T. by William Fienup and Barry Kudrowitz, who designed a single-shot hand-popper that utilized a large bistable spring. The goal {{of this research was}} to design and develop a projectile toy capable of safely firing multiple <b>foam</b> <b>balls</b> in succession, using this novel propulsion. A structured design process was followed and this toy, the shot-popper, was brought to the alpha-prototype level. Largely this project was a success. Between the shot-popper, and the flat model that came before it, every module of the toy was shown to function as desired. by Matthew C. Blanco. Thesis (S. B.)

5000|$|Parker Brothers {{originally}} developed Nerf, {{beginning with a}} four-inch (102 mm) polyurethane <b>foam</b> <b>ball.</b> In 1969, Reyn Guyer, a Minnesota-based games inventor, came to the company with a volleyball game that was safe for indoor play, and after studying it carefully, Parker Brothers decided to eliminate everything but the <b>foam</b> <b>ball.</b> In 1970, the Nerf ball was introduced as the [...] "world's first official indoor ball", the name [...] "Nerf" [...] being a slang term for the foam padding used in off-road racing. Marketing slogans promised that one can [...] "Throw it indoors; you can't damage lamps or break windows. You can't hurt babies or old people." [...] Some of the first TV commercials for the balls were joint promotions with General Foods' Kool-Aid drink mix, with Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Michael Nesmith of the Monkees playing with the balls on a living room soundstage (Kool-Aid sponsored the 1969-70 Saturday morning reruns of the Monkees' 1966-67 TV series). The ball filled a strong consumer need and by the year's end, more than four million Nerf balls had been sold. The four-inch (102 mm) ball {{was followed by a}} large version called the [...] "Super Nerf Ball". Shortly after, in 1972, a basketball game called [...] "Nerfoop" [...] and the Nerf football joined the family, with the latter quickly becoming Nerf's most popular ball.|$|E

The balls are used for different reasons and the <b>foam</b> <b>ball</b> is used for most games with a ball. For Multisphere, all balls are used unless it is being played {{in a room with}} hard floors, in that case eight balls are used. Tubes are used for almost every physical game for starting positions, voids, tubes, towers and columns. Other equipment in the board game are track pieces, discs, clips, z shaped platform pieces, cannons, blocks, a ball flipper, a beam and card pieces,and a 7 cm x 7 cm x 7 cm plastic cube for playing a series of physical games. The cube is used for a container and to connect onto the cube platform for the electronic games. A reducer also comes with the cube, allowing it {{to reduce the size of}} the open top of the cube.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} types of ovipositional substrates and shelters on egg deposition, hatchability and survival rate of Orius albidipennis (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) were studied under laboratory conditions of 26 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 10 % RH and 16 : 8 L/D photoperiod, using eggs of Anagasta kuehniella (Zell.) as food. Four types of ovipositional substrates were investigated; i. e., bean Phaseolus vulgaris (L.) pods, geranium leaves, sweet pepper seedlings and corn ear silk in free and non-free choice tests. For egg deposition, results showed that this parameter was significantly affected by the tested ovipositional substrate in free (P= 0. 0001) and non-free (P= 0. 0001) choice tests and oviposition was in the order of bean pods ! geranium leaves ! sweet pepper seedling ! corn ear silk. Moreover, hatchability also differed significantly among the tested materials being highest of 72. 61 % in bean pods and lowest of 52. 52 % in sweet pepper seedling. In addition, white <b>foam</b> <b>balls,</b> small rolled carton, vermiculate and rice hull were evaluated as shelters to reduce cannibalism under lab conditions. Data indicated that the highest egg-adult survivorship was recorded when using white <b>foam</b> <b>balls,</b> with an average of 92. 57 %. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the final}} stunt the winning {{team of the}} Eel Tank Relay is split up again, and will pit both {{remaining}} contestants against each other. The first segment involves both contestants retrieving four (4) flags which are hung from window sills. Adding to the challenge to this segment are 3 things: rain sprinklers, air cannons which blast wind from the windows, and a <b>foam</b> <b>ball</b> cannon (which {{is similar to the}} ones in the ball factory in Curious George Goes to Town at Woody Woodpecker's KidZone) which shoots balls. Once all flags are retrieved, the players end up getting into a yellow convertible where they must wait until they reach the top (28 feet in the air - 15 degree angle). Once the car reaches the top, the contestant will retrieve flags from the car. Once again, the volunteers picked before the show will be impeding the contestants by triggering rain sprinklers. Once all flags are retrieved, the contestant will be able to pick up a [...] "rocket launcher" [...] to shoot at a target. When this happens, three pyrotechnic cues are hit, and the building facade falls on the Host and the winner is declared.|$|E
