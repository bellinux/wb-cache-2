Under the <b>future</b> <b>scenarios</b> considered, the study found that BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars ( [...] to [...] cheaper), while PHEVs, will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios, and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices. The reason for the different savings among PEVs is because BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel, while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines.

2500|$|Despite these improvements, Word 2013 {{stopped using}} ClearType. The reasons invoked are, {{in the words}} of Murray Sargent: [...] "There is a problem with ClearType: it depends {{critically}} on the color of the background pixels. This isn’t a problem if you know a priori that those pixels are white, which is usually the case for text. But the general case involves calculating what the colors should be for an arbitrary background and that takes time. Meanwhile, Word 2013 enjoys cool animations and smooth zooming. Nothing jumps any more. Even the caret (the blinking vertical line at the text insertion point) glides from one position to the next as you type. Jerking movement just isn’t considered cool any more. Well animations and zooms have to be faster than human response times in order to appear smooth. And that rules out ClearType in animated scenarios at least with present generation hardware. And in <b>future</b> <b>scenarios,</b> screens will have sufficiently high resolution that gray-scale anti-aliasing should suffice." ...|$|E
2500|$|A study {{published}} in 2011 by the Belfer Center, Harvard University, found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars over the vehicles’ lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices. This finding was estimated comparing their lifetime net present value at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the U.S. market, and assuming no government subidies. According to the study estimates, a PHEV-40 is [...] more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine, while a battery electric vehicle (BEV) is [...] more expensive. The study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years, assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase.

In particular, we focus on time-unreferenced predictions, which do not contain any explicit future time reference and hence are more difficult to be retrieved. As a second contribution, we propose estimating the validity of predictions by automatically searching for realworld events corresponding to the predictions. This kind of analysis aims to help detect predictions that are no longer valid as well as help estimating prediction accuracy of information sources.

2500|$|In a November 2009 interview, Monáe {{revealed}} {{the title and}} concept behind her album, The ArchAndroid. The album was released on May 18, 2010. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather – also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite – becomes a messianic figure to the android community of Metropolis. Monáe noted that she plans to shoot a video for each song on The ArchAndroid and create a film, graphic novel and a touring Broadway musical based on the album. The Metropolis concept series draws inspiration {{from a wide range}} of musical, cinematic and other sources, ranging from Alfred Hitchcock to Debussy to Philip K. Dick. However, the series puts Fritz Lang's 1927 silent film Metropolis, which Monáe referred to as [...] "the godfather of science-fiction movies", in special regard. Aside from sharing a name, they also share visual styles (the cover for The ArchAndroid is inspired by the iconic poster for Metropolis), conceptual themes and political goals, using expressionistic <b>future</b> <b>scenarios</b> to examine and explore contemporary ideas of prejudice and class. Both also include a performing female android, though to very different effect. Where Metropolis android Maria is the evil, havoc-sowing double of the messianic figure to the city's strictly segregated working class, Monáe's messianic android muse Cindi Mayweather represents an interpretation of androids as that segregated minority, which Monáe describes as [...] "... the Other.

This research was undertaken in Khon Kaen, the Northeast of Thailand, employed both qualitative and quantitative methods to obtain the required data.

40|$|Aim: An {{economic}} model {{was used to}} evaluate the potential economic impact and cost–effectiveness of companion diagnostic testing for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials 2 ̆ 6 methods: A decision analysis model examined alternative patient management strategies for patients with advanced NSCLC who were not amenable to surgical treatment. A review of the literature provided the variables used to develop a timely base case and sensitivity analysis. A potential <b>future</b> <b>scenario</b> was also modeled. The model includes three options: conventional treatment (CT), new treatment (NT) and companion diagnostic (CD) strategy. Results: In the base case analysis based upon current data, the cost per life-year saved for CT, NT option and CD was US 43, 367, US 47, 394 and US 47, 779, respectively. The cost per life-year saved for CT, NT option and CD in a potential <b>future</b> <b>scenario</b> with more expensive, effective targeted therapy was US 47, 748, US 69, 255 and US 66, 369, respectively. Conclusion: In the <b>future</b> <b>scenario,</b> CDs have an incremental cost–effectiveness of US 56, 829 per life-year saved when compared with NT as a first-line treatment.
