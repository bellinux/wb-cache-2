He also shortened the prayer book (adopting Wise's Minhag America version), added a late Friday night service, and created patriotically themed services <b>for</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and National Fast Day. When more pews {{were required to}} accommodate the worshipers, they were first added to the men's and women's sections, then family pews were added {{where men and women}} could sit together.

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; he died in his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event was packed, with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E
5|$|Monica (Courteney Cox) {{tells her}} friends {{that she will}} not be cooking a turkey <b>for</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> because of the large amount of {{leftovers}} it will create. Chandler does not eat turkey {{as a result of his}} dislike of all Thanksgiving foods (a result of childhood trauma), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow's character) is a vegetarian and Rachel was having an aversion to poultry from her pregnancy. This left only Monica, Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of hers and Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). Rachel does not remember him, and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner.|$|E

5|$|On November15, {{a massive}} {{evacuation}} of residents began to remove survivors from unsafe conditions. Two flights to California {{took place on}} the first day of evacuation, carrying a total of 154people. Thousands of residents were also brought to Wake Island for shelter. Military Air Transport Service planes from the United States mainland, Japan, the Philippines, and Hawaii were called in for the operation. On November16, residents were warned of a possible typhoid epidemic and urged to get inoculations for the disease. Over a three-day span, roughly 30,000people were given preventative shots for the disease. In contrast to their previous ban on alien workers, the Government of Guam requested 1,500carpenters, masons, and other building workers from the Philippines. By November21, the Navy Supply Depot planned to have enough supplies for the entire populous shipped until replenishment arrived. In order to shelter homeless, the United States Navy set up tent villages across the island. Military kitchens were also established to provide food.

25|$|A new rite <b>for</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> after Adoption {{preceded the}} {{revision}} of the Old 'Churching of Women' service. Baptism could now {{be incorporated into the}} main Sunday service, the result of other influences intended to bring it back into the mainstream of worship. The Baptism of those able to answer for themselves was much more prominent, a result of the influence of those who questioned infant baptism in a post-Christian society. The questions, however, now addressed to the godparents or the person baptised directly, no longer required the renunciation of the devil or 'the vain pomp and glory of the world' or 'the carnal desires of the flesh' but instead a turning to Christ, a repentance from sin and a renunciation of evil. Likewise the ancient Apostles Creed was replaced by three tritheistic questions, which were criticised (by, among others, John Habgood, sometime Archbishop of York) as being unknown to the credal discussions of the Church, Eastern or Western, modern or ancient.|$|E
25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself and no one else. Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions <b>for</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} to Hannah A. (née Morrow) and Robert C. Martin (a brick merchant) in New York City on June 6, 1883. He was the {{youngest}} of nine children (seven boys, two girls). The family home was then situated between 8th and 9th Ave., on 31st St. in Manhattan. The Martin clan moved way up to Central Harlem on Edgecombe Ave. in 1891. They relocated within Central Harlem, to 129th St. and 5th Ave. in 1898. They belonged to the 24th Street M.E. Church (till 1891) and Calvary M.E. Church (till 1908). Paul's father Robert was the superintendent of their Sunday schools. Martin immensely enjoyed drawing as a boy. He studied commercial art at the National Academy of Design in New York City from 1902-06 (summer only 1906). He began working for the New York Tribune around 1905. This led to a seven-year stint as its art manager. Martin and family members moved from Upper Manhattan to Maplewood, New Jersey in 1908. He started competing in sanctioned tennis tournaments one year later. Martin married Lauretta Willey in 1912. (Her brother would own the Willey Book Co.) Their first rented home was in the University Heights section of the Bronx in 1912. They relocated a block away in 1915. He was employed with the O. J. Gude Company and Gotham Studios from c.1915–20. These two were giants in the advertising world. Martin joined the Artists' Guild and went freelance in early 1921. Paul and Lauretta moved from the Bronx to a rural area of Millwood, New York, in 1925. Their first owned home doubled as a working studio (upper floor) from 1925 to 1932. Its centerpiece was a long flat-top table that held the canvases, drawing pads, paint brushes and tubes. Also nearby were art books, easels and props for photo shoots. He occasionally used family members as models. Uncle Paul's niece Edna is shown, writing down the license number of a boy's wagon (for knocking over her doll carriage), on the Liberty cover of September 12, 1925. She's also highlighted on an American Junior Red Cross poster. His mother-in-law is shown basting a turkey <b>for</b> <b>Thanksgiving,</b> on the People's Home Journal cover of November 1928.|$|E
