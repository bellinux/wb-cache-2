An age distributed population {{is placed on the}} lattice and moves on it. The displacement from a site to a nearest neighbor empty site, allows individuals to change the number and identities of their contacts. The dynamics on the lattice is governed by an attractive interaction between individuals belonging to the same age-class. The parameters, which regulate the pattern dynamics, are <b>fixed</b> <b>fitting</b> the data on the age-dependent daily contact numbers, furnished by the Polymod survey. A simple SIR transmission model with a nearest neighbors interaction and some very basic adaptive mobility restrictions complete the model. The model is validated against the age-distributed Italian epidemiological data for the influenza A(H 1 N 1) during the [Formula: see text] season, with sensible predictions for the epidemiological parameters. For an appropriate topology of the lattice, we find that, whenever the accordance between the contact patterns of the model and the Polymod data is satisfactory, there is a good agreement between the numerical and the experimental epidemiological data.

40|$|The long {{standing}} mystery of smallness of diffractive dissociation of hadrons to large effective masses (the Pomeron-proton cross section is only 2 mb) witnesses that the gluonic clouds of valence quarks {{are so small}} (r 0 = 0. 3 fm) that soft interaction hardly resolves those gluons (diffraction is ∝ r 4 0). A color-dipole light-cone (LC) approach is developed which incorporates a strong nonperturbative interaction of the LC gluons. The energy dependent part of the total hadronic cross section is calculated in a parameter-free way employing the nonperturbative LC wave functions of the quark-gluon Fock states. It rises with energy as s ∆, and we predict ∆ = 0. 17 ± 0. 01, {{as well as the}} normalization. However, the energy independent part of the cross section related to inelastic collisions with no gluon radiated (gluons are not resolved) cannot be calculated reliably and we treat it as an adjustable parameter which is <b>fixed</b> <b>fitting</b> just one experimental point for total cross section. Then the energy dependence of the total cross section (the Pomeron part) and the elastic slope are fully predicted, as well as the effective Pomeron trajectory in impact parameter space, in a good agreement with data. These results naturally explain the x-dependence of the diffractive DIS observed at HERA. Although diffraction is expected to be dominated by soft interactions the observed effective ∆ is about twice as large as one (0. 08) known for total cross sections. Diffractive excitations of large effective mass correspond to diffractive gluon radiation and should be associated with our calculated ∆. 1. Diffraction: evidence for small gluonic spots in the proton The cross section of single diffraction in hadronic collisions (pp unless specified) can be expressed in terms of the so called Pomeron-proton total cross section [1, 2], dσ(pp → pX) dt dM 2 X ∝ σ IPp to...|$|E
