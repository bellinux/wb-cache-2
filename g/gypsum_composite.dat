40|$|Subject: the {{effectiveness}} of using compositions {{with the use of}} basalt fibers is proven, but the composition must be selected depending on the binder and additives chosen. Research objectives: we examine the possibility of waste recycling of basalt fiber production during manufacturing of modified <b>gypsum</b> <b>composite</b> material with improved characteristics. Materials and methods: as a raw material, a gypsum binder of Samara production was used. As a reinforcement additive, a disperse waste of basalt fiber production of Tver region was used. Studying characteristics of the gypsum binder and modified mixture, and also comparative analysis of these characteristics by average density, total porosity, strength in compression and flexure of the <b>gypsum</b> <b>composite</b> were carried out using standard techniques. Results: dependence of physical and mechanical properties of the modified gypsum material on the content of the basalt fiber additive is established. It was found that an increase in concentration of the additive requires an increased water content or additional use of plasticizer.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{preparation}} of hierarchically porous composites have been developed and explored. The first involved templating mixed slurries of hydrogel beads with two different average bead size distributions with gypsum slurry which allows for precise control over the porosity, pore size distributions and hierarchical microstructure of the hardened composite after the evaporation of {{the water from the}} hydrogel beads. The other technique utilised the viscosity of methylcellulose solution to suspend gypsum particles as they form an interlocked network. By varying the volume percentage of methylcellulose solution used, it is possible to control the porosity of the dried sample. The mechanical and thermal insulation properties of the composites as a function of both their porosity and pore size were investigated. Both methods demonstrate an inexpensive approach for introducing porosity in <b>gypsum</b> <b>composites</b> which reduces their thermal conductivity, improves their insulation properties and allows economic use of the matrix material whilst controlling their mechanical properties.

E-PG, in such a state, as it is disposed of to stackpiles, cannot {{be used as a}} binding material, due to the acidic impurities present in it. Mechanical activation of E-PG and neutralization of acidic impurities by use of cement not only greatly increases E-PG strength, but also gives hydraulic properties.

It was determined, that not only does the activity and mineral composition of pozzolanic component have an influence on CaO concentration, but also does mechanical activation. The neutralization in mixtures with opoka is preformed not only by Portland cement, but also by the finely dispersed carbonates (30 % – 35 %) present in opoka.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of post-consumer plastic waste is a challenging task {{due to the}} commingled nature of the waste composition. Commingled plastic recycling {{is one of the}} most economically viable ways to manufacture plastics waste into commercial products. Similar to virgin polymers, fillers can be added to recycled plastics to improve engineering properties of the final products. The common operations of commingled plastic recycling however lack in depth knowledge in relation to the selection of the appropriate fillers, additives, and optimum processing variables. This project aimed to investigate three types of mineral fillers, talc, wollastonite and gypsum, for their abilities to modify the mechanical properties of commingled recycled plastic composites. The effectiveness of the fillers to improve the mechanical properties was considered to be influenced by interface bonding (between the filler and matrix) and extrusion variables. These factors were also investigated in this research. Mechanical test results showed that the talc reinforced composites were significantly better in mechanical properties compared to the <b>gypsum</b> and wollastonite <b>composites</b> (tensile strength and modulus improved by 170 % and 20 %, respectively at 0. 26 v/v loading). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that gypsum formed large agglomerates in the matrix leading to inferior mechanical properties. The interface adhesion between filler and matrix was evaluated using several established models. The tensile or flexural strength of the composites was satisfactorily predicted using Turcsanyi and Nicolais-Narkis equations. For the tensile and flexural modulus of the composites the Einstein equation was found to give a good correlation. In attempt to enhance the adhesion, the mineral fillers were pre-treated with silane coupling agents, 3 methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane (γ-MPS) and 3 -aminopropyltriethoxy silane (γ-APS) before being blended with the plastics. This did not result in any significant improvement to the material properties. The γ-APS treatment, however, increased the tensile properties of the composites by approximately 5 % compared to the γ-MPS treatment. The SEM investigations showed that the γ-APS treatment provided better adhesion of filler particles and hence voids were less likely to form in the matrix compared to the γ-MPS composites. Extruder parameters like screw rotation and barrel temperature did not have a significant influence on the mechanical properties of filler-recycled plastic composites. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.)

40|$|Atmospheric {{tests and}} other {{experiments}} with nuclear materials {{were conducted on}} the Frenchman Flat playa at the Nevada National Security Site, Nye County, Nevada; residual radionuclides are known to exist in Frenchman Flat playa soils. Although the playa is typically dry, extended periods of winter precipitation or large single-event rainstorms can inundate the playa. When Frenchman Flat playa is inundated, residual radionuclides on the typically dry playa surface may become submerged, allowing water-soil interactions that could provide a mechanism for transport of radionuclides away from known areas of contamination. The potential for radionuclide transport by occasional inundation of the Frenchman Flat playa was examined using geographic information systems and satellite imagery to delineate the timing and areal extent of inundation; collecting water samples during inundation and analyzing them for chemical and isotopic content; characterizing suspended/precipitated materials and archived soil samples; modeling water-soil geochemical reactions; and modeling the mobility of select radionuclides under aqueous conditions. The physical transport of radionuclides by water was not evaluated in this study. Frenchman Flat playa was inundated with precipitation during two consecutive winters in 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011. Inundation allowed for collection of multiple water samples through time as the areal extent of inundation changed and ultimately receded. During these two winters, precipitation records from a weather station in Frenchman Flat (Well 5 b) provided information {{that was used in}} combination with geographic information systems, Landsat imagery, and image processing techniques to identify and quantify the areal extent of inundation. After inundation, water on the playa disappeared quickly, for example, between January 25, 2011 and February 10, 2011, a period of 16 days, 92 percent of the areal extent of inundation receded (2, 062, 800 m 2). Water sampling provided valuable information about chemical processes occurring during inundation as the water disappeared. Important observations from water-chemistry analyses included: 1) total dissolved solids (TDS) and chloride ion (Cl-) concentrations were very low (TDS: < 200 mg/L and Cl-: < 3. 0 mg/L, respectively) for all water samples regardless of time or areal extent; 2) all dissolved constituents were at concentrations well below what might be expected for evaporating shallow surface waters on a playa, even when 98 to 99 percent of the water had disappeared; 3) the amount of evaporation for the last water samples collected at the end of inundation, estimated with the stable isotopic ratios δ 2 H or δ 18 O, was approximately 60 percent; and 4) water samples analyzed by gamma spectroscopy did not show any man-made radioactivity; however, the short scanning time (24 hours) and relative chemical diluteness of the water samples (TDS ranged between 39 and 190 mg/L) may have contributed to none being detected. Additionally, any low-energy beta emitting radionuclides would not have been detected by gamma spectroscopy. From these observations, it was apparent that a significant portion of water on the playa did not evaporate, but rather infiltrated into the subsurface (approximately 40 percent). Consistent with this water chemistry-based conclusion is particle-size analysis of two archived Frenchman Flat playa soils samples, which showed low clay content in the near surface soil that also suggested infiltration. Infiltration of water from the playa during inundation into the subsurface does not necessarily imply that groundwater recharge is occurring, but it does provide a mechanism for moving residual radionuclides downward into the subsurface of Frenchman Flat playa. Water-mineral geochemical reactions were modeled so that changes in the water chemistry could be identified and the extent of reactions quantified. Geochemical modeling showed that evaporation; equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide and calcite; dissolution of sodium chloride, <b>gypsum,</b> and <b>composite</b> volcanic glass; and precipitation of composite clay and quartz represented changes in water as it disappeared from the playa. This modeling provided an understanding of the water-soil geochemical environment, which was then used to evaluate the potential mobility of residual radionuclides into the playa soils by water. Because there is no information on the chemical forms of anthropogenic radionuclides in Frenchman Flat playa soil, it was assumed that soil radionuclides go into solution when the playa is inundated. In mobility modeling, a select group of radionuclides were allowed to sorb onto, or exchange with, playa soil minerals to evaluate the likelihood that the radionuclides would be removed from water during playa inundation. Radionuclide mobility modeling suggested that there would be minimal sorption or exchange of several important radionuclides (uranium, cesium, and technetium) with playa minerals such that they may be mobile in water when the playa is inundated and could infiltrate into the subsurface. Mobility modeling also showed that plutonium may be much less mobile because of sorption onto calcite, but the amount of reactive surface area of playa soil calcite is highly uncertain. Plutonium is also known to sorb onto colloidal particles suspended in water, suspended colloidal particles will move with the water, providing a mechanism to redistribute plutonium when Frenchman Flat playa is inundated. Water chemistry, stable isotopes, and geochemical modeling showed that residual radionuclides in Frenchman Flat playa soils could be mobilized in water when the playa is inundated with precipitation. Also, there is potential for these radionuclides to infiltrate into the subsurface with water. As a result of the information obtained both during this study and the conclusions drawn from it, additional data collection, investigation, and modeling are recommended. Specifically: sampling the playa soil to search for evidence of surface-water infiltration and the presence of radionuclides; developing a preliminary unsaturated flow and transport model to guide soil sampling; characterizing the chemical forms of radionuclides on the playa surface and any radionuclides that might have migrated into the subsurface; and, refining the unsaturated flow and transport model with data obtained from sampling and analysis of soil samples to guide any future sampling, development of remediation strategies, and defining risk-based boundaries for Frenchman Flat playa...|$|R

Este estudo investigou a possibilidade do uso de fibras vegetais do pseudocaule da bananeira e polpa de embalagens de cimento para o desenvolvimento de compósitos que se destacam por suas propriedades de reforço e térmicas. O aproveitamento de materiais renováveis pode ajudar a reduzir as agressões ao meio ambiente. As embalagens de cimento Portland são em papel tipo Kraft e na sua grande maioriasão descartadas no meio ambiente. No entanto, elas contêm fibras na forma de polpa (celulose) que podem ser utilizadas como reforço em matrizes. Para a obtenção da polpa oriunda de sacos de cimento, estes foram cortados em pedaços e passados em um triturador de papel. Em seguida o {{material}} triturado era imerso em água e passado em liquidificador industrial. Nas misturas elaboradas com a fibra de bananeira foram testadas porcentagens da fibra em 2 % e 4 % e relação água/gesso variando de 0, 4 a 0, 7. O traço com 4 % de fibra e relação água/gesso 0, 5 conduziu a uma resistência de 2, 80 MPa, enquanto que o traço com 2 % de fibra e 0, 4 de relação água/gesso produziu um compósito com resistência de 5, 87 MPa. Observa-se que ao diminuir a proporção de fibra no compósito e a relação água/gesso, a resistência aumentou devido aos vazios que também diminuíram. Para a otimização das misturas realizadas com a polpa variou-se relação água/gesso. Os traços foram moldados sempre para a proporção de 1 kg de gesso/ 0, 08 kg da polpa / 0, 01 do aditivo retardador. A variação da relação água/gesso foi testada até se chegar nas melhores resistência e trabalhabilidade. A melhor relação água/gesso é de 0, 7. Através dos resultados obtidos pelo método de placa quente protegida, constatou-se bons resultados das propriedades térmicas principalmente dos compósitos elaborados com gesso e polpa de embalagens de cimento. O teste de condutividade térmica do compósito utilizando o método da placa quente mostrou que houve redução em relação ao gesso sem reforço.

However, as they contain pulp fibers (cellulose) can be used as reinforcement in matrix. To obtain the pulp coming from cement bags, they were cut into pieces and passed in a paper shredder. Then the crushed material was immersed in water and passed on an industrial blender. In mixtures prepared with the fiber banana fiber percentages of 2 % and 4 % and the water / gypsum ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 7 were tested.

40|$|Cold-formed {{steel stud}} walls {{are a major}} {{component}} of Light Steel Framing (LSF) building systems used in commercial, industrial and residential buildings. In the conventional LSF stud wall systems, thin steel studs are protected from fire by placing one or two layers of plasterboard on both sides with or without cavity insulation. However, there is very limited data about the structural and thermal performance of stud wall systems while past research showed contradicting results, for example, about the benefits of cavity insulation. This research was therefore conducted to improve the knowledge and understanding of the structural and thermal performance of cold-formed steel stud wall systems (both load bearing and non-load bearing) under fire conditions and to develop new improved stud wall systems including reliable and simple methods to predict their fire resistance rating. Full scale fire tests of cold-formed steel stud wall systems formed the basis of this research. This research proposed an innovative LSF stud wall system in which a composite panel made of two plasterboards with insulation between them was used to improve the fire rating. Hence fire tests included both conventional steel stud walls with and without the use of cavity insulation and the new composite panel system. A propane fired gas furnace was specially designed and constructed first. The furnace was designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve as proposed by AS 1530. 4 (SA, 2005). A compression loading frame capable of loading the individual studs of a full scale steel stud wall system was also designed and built for the load-bearing tests. Fire tests included comprehensive time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens using K type thermocouples. They also included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of stud walls until failure. The first phase of fire tests included 15 small scale fire tests of <b>gypsum</b> plasterboards, and <b>composite</b> panels using different types of insulating material of varying thickness and density. Fire performance of single and multiple layers of gypsum plasterboards was assessed including the effect of interfaces between adjacent plasterboards on the thermal performance. Effects of insulations such as glass fibre, rock fibre and cellulose fibre were also determined while the tests provided important data relating to the temperature at which the fall off of external plasterboards occurred. In the second phase, nine small scale non-load bearing wall specimens were tested to investigate the thermal performance of conventional and innovative steel stud wall systems. Effects of single and multiple layers of plasterboards with and without vertical joints were investigated. The new composite panels were seen to offer greater thermal protection to the studs in comparison to the conventional panels. In the third phase of fire tests, nine full scale load bearing wall specimens were tested to study the thermal and structural performance of the load bearing wall assemblies. A full scale test was also conducted at ambient temperature. These tests showed that the use of cavity insulation led to inferior fire performance of walls, and provided good explanations and supporting research data to overcome the incorrect industry assumptions about cavity insulation. They demonstrated that the use of insulation externally in a composite panel enhanced the thermal and structural performance of stud walls and increased their fire resistance rating significantly. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. This research also included steady state tensile tests at ambient and elevated temperatures to address the lack of reliable mechanical properties for high grade cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. Suitable predictive equations were developed for calculating the yield strength and elastic modulus at elevated temperatures. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed non-load bearing and load bearing stud wall systems under fire conditions. Idealized hot flange temperature profiles have been developed for non-insulated, cavity insulated and externally insulated load bearing wall models along with suitable equations for predicting their failure times. A graphical method has also been proposed to predict the failure times (fire rating) of non-load bearing and load bearing walls under different load ratios. The results from this research are useful to both fire researchers and engineers working in this field. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF walls under fire conditions, and developed an innovative LSF wall system with increased fire rating. It has clearly demonstrated the detrimental effects of using cavity insulation, and has paved the way for Australian building industries to develop new wall panels with increased fire rating for commercial applications worldwide...|$|R
