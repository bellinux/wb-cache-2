5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into <b>four</b> <b>groups.</b> The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} of the Voyager missions, Jupiter's moons were {{arranged}} neatly into <b>four</b> <b>groups</b> of four, based on commonality of their orbital elements.

5|$|The Kadazan-Dusun, {{located on}} the western coast of Sabah, refer to their agung {{ensemble}} as a tawag or bandil, which consists of six to seven large gongs in shoreline groups and 7–8 large gongs for those in interior valleys.

5|$|The {{process of}} using the 256 {{graphics}} tiles on the NES was handled with special programming techniques. The team streamlined the process by dividing the number of tiles into two groups of 128 and separating them into enemy characters and protagonists.

5|$|After Operation Maiglöckchen, the {{division}} shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying the Partisans {{access to the}} security zone. Since its arrival in the zone {{the division}} had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included <b>four</b> <b>groups</b> of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's Zeleni kadar (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200 deserters.|$|E
5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into <b>four</b> <b>groups,</b> each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E
5|$|From 1998 to 2011, {{the teams}} {{were divided into}} <b>four</b> <b>groups</b> and played {{each other in a}} round robin format {{preliminary}} round, and the top 3 teams in each group advance into the qualifying round. The qualifying round is another round of group play with two groups of six, with the top four teams in each group advancing into the knockout playoff stage. The bottom four teams in the preliminary round played in another group as well; this group determined relegation. After a round-robin format, the bottom two teams were usually relegated to play in Division I the following year.|$|E

The tanks were split into <b>four</b> <b>groups</b> of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric timers which sequenced the booster pumps on the tanks. B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other racing series such as Formula One, Formula E has a specific qualifying mode, {{in which the}} twenty drivers are divided up into <b>four</b> <b>groups,</b> leaving enough space on track for everyone to produce lap times without interference by other drivers. Each group had ten minutes on track and the fastest time of each driver determined the grid position. A lottery determined which drivers started in which group. With five-minute breaks between the groups, qualifying had an overall length of 55 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The 13 {{teams were}} drawn into <b>four</b> <b>groups,</b> with Group 1 {{containing}} four teams, {{and the others}} containing only three. Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If two teams had tied on points to win a group, a play-off would {{have been used to}} decide the group winner; however, this was not necessary. The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the Shrine {{is based on the}} ancient Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the Parthenon in Athens. It is a {{structure}} of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on the north and south through classical porticos, each of eight fluted Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by <b>four</b> <b>groups</b> of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing Peace, Justice, Patriotism and Sacrifice. The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is Neo-Classical.|$|E
5|$|The format {{used in the}} 2007 World Cup {{involved}} 16 teams allocated into <b>four</b> <b>groups</b> of four. Within each group, {{the teams}} played {{each other in a}} round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points {{in the same way as}} the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage. The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Canadian {{officials}} protested that two players on the British team—James Foster and Alex Archer—had played in Canada but transferred without permission to play for clubs in the English National League. The IIHF agreed with Canada, but Great Britain threatened to withdraw the team if the two were barred from competing. To avoid a conflict, Canada withdrew the protest shortly before the Games began. The tournament consisted of <b>four</b> <b>groups</b> and fifteen teams. Great Britain became the first non-Canadian team to win gold; Canada won silver and the United States bronze. World War II forced the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Winter Olympics.|$|E
