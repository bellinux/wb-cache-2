5|$|Political {{tensions}} between CharlesI and Parliament {{in the second}} quarter of the 17thcentury led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's Trained Bands, a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, CharlesI attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron, the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir <b>John</b> <b>Conyers.</b> By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} rediscovery and {{development}} of a tradition of Ciceronian academic scepticism in British philosophy between c. 1660 -c. 1760. It considers this tradition alongside two others, recently recovered by scholars, which were recognised by contemporaries to offer opposing visions of man, God and the origins of society: the Augustinian-Epicurean, and the neo-Stoic. It presents <b>John</b> Locke, <b>Conyers</b> Middleton and David Hume as the leading figures in {{the revival of the}} tradition of academic scepticism. It considers their works in relation to those of Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, and Bernard Mandeville, whose writings refashioned respectively the neo-Stoic and Augustinian-Epicurean traditions in influential ways. These five individuals explicitly identified themselves with these late Hellenistic philosophical traditions, and sought to contest and redefine conventional estimations of their meaning and significance. This thesis recovers this debate, which illuminates our understanding of the development of the â€˜science of manâ€™ in Britain. Cicero was a central figure in Lockeâ€™s attempt to explain, against Hobbes, the origins of society and moral consensus independent of political authority. Locke was a theorist of societies, religious and civil. He provided a naturalistic explanation of moral motivation and sociability which, drawing heavily from Cicero, emphasised the importance of menâ€™s concern for the opinions of others. Locke set this within a Christian divine teleology. It was Lockeâ€™s theologically-grounded treatment of moral obligation, and his attack on Stoic moral philosophy, that led to Shaftesburyâ€™s attempt to vindicate Stoicism. This was met by Mandevilleâ€™s profoundly Epicurean response. The consequences of the neo-Epicurean and neo-Stoic traditions for Christianity were explored by Middleton, who argued that only academic scepticism was consistent with Christian belief. Hume explored the relationship between morality and religion with continual reference to Cicero. He did so, in contrast to Locke or Middleton, to banish entirely moral theology from philosophy. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Geoffrey Elton's {{model of}} Tudor politics, which {{emphasized}} the importance of political institutions and which dominated our understanding of Tudor politics for much of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, has been challenged by a number of historians for over twenty years. They have re-{{emphasized the importance}} of social connections and cultural influences and turned attention away from studying the privy council to studying the court. In doing so, they have gone back to re-examine earlier approaches by Sir <b>John</b> Neale and <b>Conyers</b> Read which Elton had challenged. Yet, these new socially and culturally derived approaches, recently labelled 'New Tudor political history', remain varied and its practitioners sometimes at odds with each other. Focusing on both established seminal works and recent research, this review considers the different elements of these approaches in relation to Tudor court politics. It assesses the methodological problems they raise and identifies what shortcomings still remain. It demonstrates that Tudor politics are increasingly defined as based on social networks rather than institutional bodies, making issues of access to, and intimacy with, the monarch central. Our understanding has been further enhanced by exploration of political culture and its relationship to political action. However, the review points to the need to integrate more fully the political role of women and the relationship between the court and the wider political community into our understanding of Tudor politics, as well as place England into a European context...|$|R

25|$|The United States National Health Care Act is a {{perennial}} {{piece of legislation}} introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Representative <b>John</b> <b>Conyers</b> (D-MI). The act would establish a universal single-payer {{health care system in}} the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare, the United Kingdom's National Health Service, and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples. The bill was first introduced in 2003 and has been reintroduced in each Congress since. During the 2009 health care debates over the bill that became the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 676 was expected to be debated and voted upon by the House in September 2009, but was never debated. In the wake of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, in which a push for universal healthcare featured prominently, single-payer proposals gained traction. <b>John</b> <b>Conyers</b> reintroduced his bill in the House of Representatives in January 2017. Four months later, the bill was supported by 112 co-sponsors, surpassing {{for the first time the}} 25% mark of co-sponsorship. In September of the same year, Bernie Sanders himself, together with 16 co-sponsors, introduced a Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate (S. 1804).|$|E
