5|$|In July 1840, a {{delegation}} headed by Adolphe Crémieux and Sir Moses Montefiore left for Egypt {{to save the}} Jews of Damascus. Crémieux and Montefiore requested Muhammad Ali to transfer the investigation to Alexandria or have the case considered by European judges. However, their request was denied. The delegation, concerned primarily {{with the release of}} the imprisoned Jews of Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.|$|E

Hale volunteered on September 8, 1776, to go behind enemy lines and report on British troop movements.

25|$|Following {{the arrest}} and {{imprisonment}} of Abune Tewophilos, Patriarch of Ethiopia, by the Marxist Derg regime that had deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, Pope Shenouda III refused to recognise the cleric who was installed as the Ethiopian Patriarch's successor. He, {{along with the}} Holy Synod, argued that the removal of Patriarch Abune Tewophilos was illegal and contrary to canon law, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> political interference. In {{the eyes of the}} Church of Alexandria, Abune Tewophilos remained the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia.|$|E

Lizano suspects poachers were involved, saying Mora was targeted for protecting the turtle nests. [...] Chacón said drug traffickers, who often are also poachers, were likely behind the killing.

This included a financial settlement to the family. The formal apology was made at the National Palace by Guatemalan President Álvaro Colom on 20 October 2011, to Jacobo Árbenz Villanova, the son of the former president, and a Guatemalan politician. Colom stated, [...] "It was a crime to Guatemalan society and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> aggression to a government starting its democratic spring."

The decision triggered much criticism and a PIL was filed in the Calcutta High Court to revoke the award. The petitioner took objection to the conferral of the award and its posthumous mention of Bose, saying that honouring a personality higher than the award is [...] "ridiculous", and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> [...] "carelessness" [...] to classify such a person with past and future recipients. It said that the award cannot be conferred to Bose posthumously as the Government had not officially accepted his death on 18 August 1945. The petitioner requested the whereabouts of Bose from 18 August 1945 till date, {{based on the information}} collected by the 1956 Shah Nawaz Committee and the 1970 Khosla Commission. Bose's family members expressed their unwillingness to accept the award.|$|E

They were married in the Bolton Street Registry office, although none of her family were present as she had not informed them of the wedding. She wrote 'cinema usherette' as her occupation on the marriage certificate, {{even though she had}} never been one. They spent their honeymoon eating at Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where their son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema. She walked into 9Newcastle Road waving the marriage licence and said to her family, [...] "There!—I've married him." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> defiance against her father, who had threatened to disown her if she ever cohabitated with a lover.

50|$|From the emic {{perspective}} of the alchemist, the <b>act</b> of takwin <b>was</b> <b>an</b> emulation of the divine creative and life-giving powers of Genesis and Resurrection and tapped the physical and spiritual forces in nature. At the same time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> through which the alchemist was inwardly transformed and purified, a spiritual regeneration.

Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain".

They had four daughters (three surviving), Ellen (1805–1883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons. The sons—Maurice (1803), Morgan [...] (1804), John (1810), and Daniel (1816)—all sat in Parliament. The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faoláin suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.|$|E

In most of the editions since 1574, the Shulhan ‘Arukh was printed with HaMapah, thus creating an interesting tension that was realized on the printed page. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> integrating the Sephardic tradition and its accommodation into the Ashkenazi world, the confirmation of the authority and its undermining appearing on the same page." ...|$|E

He also promised security {{in the face of the}} growing problem with delinquency during Arzú's tenure in the office. In contrast to 1995, the issue of the homicides in Mexico was brought up, and became a central electoral issue. Portillo immediately admitted that he had shot the two students, but claimed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> self-defense. He said that he had fled from the Mexican authorities, rather than face trial, both because of his political affiliations, and because he was a foreigner in Mexico. These revelations enhanced Portillo's as a [...] "tough, no-nonsense" [...] politician.
