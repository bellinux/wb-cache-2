Historically this has been conducted by post, but in recent years <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> place on the Watford Observer's website. This system was earmarked for change to a match-by-match rating system in 2009, but in March 2010, the Observer decided to revert to the traditional method of voting.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> 13billion (13) years for light {{to travel to}} Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|The Bayreuth canon {{consists}} of those operas by the German composer Richard Wagner (1813–1883) {{that have been}} performed at the Bayreuth Festival. The festival, which {{is dedicated to the}} staging of these works, was founded by Wagner in 1876 in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth, and has continued under the directorship of his family since his death. Although it was not originally held annually, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> place in July and August every year since the 75th anniversary season in 1951. Its venue is the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which was built for the first festival. Attendance at the festival is often thought of as a pilgrimage made by Wagner aficionados.|$|E

5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> the committee {{many years to come}} to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|E
5|$|The UEFA Super Cup is {{an annual}} {{association}} football match contested between {{the winners of}} the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. Established in 1972, it was contested between {{the winners of the}} European Cup (or UEFA Champions League since 1993) and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup until 1999, when the latter was discontinued by UEFA. The last Super Cup disputed in this format was the 1999 UEFA Super Cup between Lazio and Manchester United, which Lazio won 10. The competition was originally played over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium in the winter months, but since the 1998 edition, it consists of a single match played at a neutral venue in August. Between 1998 and 2012, the Stade Louis II in Monaco hosted the Super Cup, but since 2013, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> place every year at a different stadium across Europe.|$|E

If the Committee determines that no {{violation of a}} right contained in the ICCPR has occurred then no further action will be taken. However, if the Committee decides a breach has occurred then the State must submit an 'update' to the Committee of the steps that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> to address the violation within three months in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 3 of the ICCPR. In Article 2, paragraph 3 the State has agreed to remedy any breaches of rights contained within the covenant. This response is also transmitted to the original author.|$|E

25|$|Value {{investing}} is {{an investment}} paradigm which generally involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis, though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> many forms since its inception. It derives from the ideas on investment that Benjamin Graham and David Dodd began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text Security Analysis. As examples, such securities may be stock in public companies that trade at discounts to book value or tangible book value, have high dividend yields, have low price-to-earning multiples or have low price-to-book ratios.|$|E

25|$|The term post-anarchism was {{originated}} by Saul Newman, {{and first}} received popular attention {{in his book}} From Bakunin to Lacan {{to refer to a}} theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> {{on a life of its}} own and a wide range of ideas including post-modernism, autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Lewis Call, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and Michel Onfray.|$|E
25|$|Since 4 April 2005, as per the Gender Recognition Act 2004, it is {{possible}} for transgender people to change their legal gender in the UK, allowing them to acquire a new birth certificate, affording them full recognition of their acquired sex in law for all purposes. Transgender people must present evidence to a Gender Recognition Panel, which considers their case and issues a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC); they must have transitioned two years before a GRC is issued. It is not a requirement for sex reassignment surgery to have taken place, although such surgery will be accepted as part of the supporting evidence for a case where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> place. There is formal approval of medical gender reassignment available either on the National Health Service (NHS) or privately.|$|E
