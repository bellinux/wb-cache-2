5|$|Afterward, <b>Grant</b> {{suggested}} {{to his colleagues}} that they should {{catch up with the}} presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, <b>Grant</b> directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; <b>Grant</b> knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, <b>Grant</b> started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what <b>Grant</b> believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|Any Canadian citizen or {{corporate}} body can petition for a <b>grant</b> of new arms or registration of existing arms. In general, eligibility for a <b>grant</b> of arms {{is based on}} an individual's contributions to the community, although the exact criteria for grants or registrations have not been published. A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, and who are accordingly entitled to a <b>grant</b> of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to <b>grant</b> them supporters.|$|E

5|$|Blue Bombers {{management}} {{decided that}} they needed a new coach prior to the 1957 season. On January 30, 1957, <b>Grant</b> accepted the Blue Bombers head coaching position after impressing management with his ability to make adjustments on offense and defense as a player. Club president, J.T. Russell, thought that <b>Grant</b> could coach even though nobody else did. <b>Grant</b> would remain the {{head coach of the}} Blue Bombers until 1966. At age 29 (he would be 30 by the time he coached his first game), <b>Grant</b> became the youngest head coach in CFL history.|$|E

50|$|Block <b>grants</b> or even sector-specific <b>grants</b> are preferable, {{from the}} point of view of local {{authority}} freedom of action, to <b>grants</b> earmarked for specific projects. It would be unrealistic to expect all specific project <b>grants</b> to be replaced by general <b>grants,</b> particularly for major capital investments, but excessive recourse to such <b>grants</b> will severely restrict a local authority's freedom to exercise its discretion with regard to expenditure priorities. However, the part of total resources represented by <b>grants</b> varies considerably between countries, and a higher ratio or project-specific <b>grants</b> to more general <b>grants</b> may be considered reasonable where <b>grants</b> as a whole represent a relatively insignificant proportion of total revenue.|$|R
5|$|During November 2002, Metropolitan Partners filed a <b>grant</b> {{request to}} the West Virginia Economic Development <b>Grant</b> Committee. It {{received}} $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements.

Max Winter, the Minnesota Vikings founder, contacted <b>Grant</b> in 1961 {{and asked him to}} coach the new NFL expansion team. <b>Grant</b> declined the offer and remained in Winnipeg until 1967 when Winter and General Manager Jim Finks were successful in luring <b>Grant</b> to Minnesota.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grant</b> gave speeches for Garfield but {{declined}} to criticize the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock, a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac. Garfield won the election. <b>Grant</b> gave Garfield his public support and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration. On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot by an assassin and died on September 19. On learning of Garfield's death from a reporter, <b>Grant</b> wept bitterly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grant</b> {{graduated}} in 1843 from the United States Military Academy at West Point {{and served in}} the Mexicanâ€“American War. After the war, he married Julia Dent in 1848, and together they had four children. <b>Grant</b> retired from the Army in 1854 and struggled financially in civilian life. When the Civil War began in 1861, he rejoined the U.S. Army and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1862, <b>Grant</b> took control of Kentucky and most of Tennessee, and led Union forces to victory in the Battle of Shiloh, earning a reputation as an aggressive commander. In July 1863, {{after a series of}} coordinated battles, <b>Grant</b> defeated Confederate armies and seized Vicksburg, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River and dividing the Confederacy in two. After Grant's victories in the Chattanooga Campaign, Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general and Commanding General of the Army in March 1864. <b>Grant</b> confronted Robert E. Lee in a series of bloody battles, trapping Lee's army in their defense of Richmond. <b>Grant</b> coordinated a series of devastating campaigns in other theaters, as well. In April 1865, Lee surrendered to <b>Grant</b> at Appomattox, effectively ending the war. Historians have hailed Grant's military genius, and his strategies are featured in military history textbooks, but a minority contend that he won by brute force rather than superior strategy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grant</b> {{nominated}} Sherman his Army successor as general-in-chief {{and gave}} him control over War bureau chiefs. When Rawlins took over the War Department, He complained to <b>Grant</b> that Sherman was given too much authority. <b>Grant</b> reluctantly revoked his own order, upsetting Sherman and damaging their wartime friendship.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grant</b> quickly {{raised and}} {{recruited}} {{a company of}} volunteers, and was given the captaincy, accompanying them to Springfield. He perceived that the war would be fought mostly by volunteers, not career soldiers. Governor Richard Yates offered <b>Grant</b> a militia commission to recruit and train volunteer units, which he accepted, but still wanted a field command. He made several efforts through his professional contacts. Major General George B. McClellan refused to see him, remembering the day in Oregon in 1853 when he saw <b>Grant</b> on a drunken spree. With the aid of his advocate, Representative Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois, <b>Grant</b> was promoted to Colonel on June 14 and charged with disciplining the unruly 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Transferred to northern Missouri, <b>Grant</b> was promoted to Brigadier General, backdated to May 17, 1861.|$|E
5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} Cary <b>Grant</b> for the role. <b>Grant</b> {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. <b>Grant</b> then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. <b>Grant</b> was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. <b>Grant</b> met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E
5|$|Hiram Ulysses <b>Grant</b> {{was born}} in Point Pleasant, Ohio, on April 27, 1822, to Jesse Root <b>Grant,</b> a tanner and merchant, and Hannah <b>Grant</b> (nÃ©e Simpson).

Grant's great-grandfather fought in the French and Indian War, and his grandfather, Noah, served in the American Revolution at Bunker Hill.

5|$|In 1869, <b>Grant</b> was {{urged by}} popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with {{military}} assistance {{and to give}} them U.S. diplomatic recognition. <b>Grant</b> and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating. <b>Grant</b> and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation. Fish, diligently and against popular pressure, {{was able to keep}} <b>Grant</b> from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. The Sickle's peace negotiations failed in Madrid, but <b>Grant</b> and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion. <b>Grant</b> and Fish sent a message to Congress, written by Fish and signed by <b>Grant.</b> The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, calming national fears.|$|E
