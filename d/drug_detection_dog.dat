40|$|Introduction and Aims. Canines {{are often}} used by police for <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> and deterrence. However, their {{effectiveness}} has been questioned. This paper aims to describe the experience of regular illicit drug users when in contact with <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs.</b> Design and Methods. Regular ecstasy users (n = 2127) were interviewed across Australia between 2008 and 2010 {{as part of the}} Ecstasy and Related Drugs Reporting System. Results. Over the 3 year period, there was increased visibility of <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> by regular ecstasy users. New South Wales was the jurisdiction with the most reported sightings, mainly occurring at festivals or live music events. Despite this police presence, however, detection and deterrence rates remained low. Approximately two-thirds of participants who had seen the <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> had <b>drugs</b> in their possession at the most recent sighting, yet less than 7 % were positively identified by dogs. Further, the majority of participants in possession of drugs took no actions after sighting the dogs, whereas a small group hastily consumed the drugs. Discussion and Conclusions. The low proportion of reported positive notifications from the dogs by the participants who had drugs on them at the time of sighting questions the accuracy and effectiveness of this procedure. Despite the increased visibility of police <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs,</b> regular ecstasy users continue to use and be in possession of illicit drugs in public, suggesting a limited deterrence effect. The hasty consumption of drugs upon sighting the dogs also raises health concerns.

50|$|On {{the evening}} of March 27, 2012, Dennys Rodriguez was stopped by a police officer on a highway near Waterloo, Nebraska, after the officer {{observed}} him swerve out of his lane of traffic. When the officer approached the vehicle, he reported an “overwhelming” scent of air-fresheners emanating from the car. After questioning Rodriguez and another passenger in the car, the officer placed a call for backup and conducted a records check on the vehicle’s passenger. The officer handed a warning ticket to Rodriguez, and then proceeded to walk Floyd, his <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dog,</b> around the outside of Rodriguez’s vehicle. When the dog indicated the presence of drugs, the officer searched the car and discovered methamphetamine inside the vehicle. The officer reported that approximately seven or eight minutes passed between the time he issued the warning ticket to the time at which the dog indicated the presence of drugs.|$|E

However, the district court denied the motion. On January 17, 2013, Rodriguez filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to review the denial of his motion to suppress. On January 31, 2014, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s decision to deny Rodriguez’s motion to suppress the evidence.

5000|$|In Harris, one of {{the major}} points raised by a number of the amici curiae is that a dog's {{training}} or certification does not necessarily reflect that dog's reliability in the field. They point to what they say are [...] "the most comprehensive data available on the rate of false alerts in real-world settings" [...] - several years' of studies undertaken by an independent government agency in Sydney, Australia, under the Police Powers (<b>Drug</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>Dogs)</b> Act 2001. [...] Police dogs went through an initial 6 weeks of training to detect cannabis, ecstasy, methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin, received additional training weekly, and were tested and re-certified every three months. The police dogs would randomly sniff individuals at train stations, licensed premises, on streets and sidewalks, at nightclub strips, shopping centers, concerts, and other public locations - the dog would sit next to a person if it alerted. In the first 9 months of 2011, dogs alerted (and police searched) 14,102 times, and drugs were found only 2,854 times—a false alert rate of 80%. Those results, they say, are surprisingly consistent - in 2010, the false alert rate was 74%. [...] Further still, the study found that individual dog's performance varied wildly, with accuracy rates ranging from a high of 56% to a low of 7%, with two-thirds of the dogs performing below the average. The New South Wales' Ombudsman summarized his report by saying: [...] "Despite the best efforts of police officers, the use of <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> has proven to be an ineffective tool for detecting drug dealers. Overwhelmingly, the use of <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> has led to public searches of individuals in which no drugs were found, or to the detection of (mostly young) adults in possession of very small amounts of cannabis for personal use. These findings have led us to question whether the Drug Dogs Act will ever provide a fair, efficacious and cost effective tool to target drug supply. Given this, we have recommended that the starting point, when considering this report, is to review whether the Drug Dogs Act should be retained at all." ...|$|R

40|$|Background Significant {{research}} {{attention has}} been given to understanding the processes of drug policy reform. However, there has been surprisingly little analysis of the persistence of policy in the face of opposition and evidence of ineffectiveness. In this article we analysed just such a case – police <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> policy in NSW, Australia. We sought to identify factors which may account for the continuation of this policy, in spite of counter-evidence and concerted advocacy. Methods The analysis was conducted using the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF). We collated documents relating to NSW <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> policy from 1995 to 2016, including parliamentary records (NSW Parliament Hansard), government and institutional reports, legislation, police procedures, books, media, and academic publications. Texts were then read, coded and classified against the core dimensions of the ACF, including subsystem actors and coalitions, their belief systems and resources and venues employed for policy debate. Results Three coalitions were identified as competing in the policy subsystem: security/law and order, civil liberties and harm reduction. Factors that aided policy stability were the continued dominance of the security/law and order coalition since they introduced the drug dog policy; a power imbalance enabling the ruling coalition to limit when and where the policy was discussed; and a highly adversarial policy subsystem. In this context even technical knowledge that dogs infringed civil liberties and increased risks of overdose were readily downplayed, leading to only incremental changes in implementation rather than policy cessation or wholesale revision. Conclusion The analysis provides new insights into why the accumulation of new evidence and advocacy efforts can be insufficient to drive significant policy change. It poses a challenge for the evidence-based paradigm suggesting that in highly adversarial policy subsystems new evidence is unlikely to generate policy change without broader subsystem change, such as reducing the adversarial nature and/or providing new avenues for cross-coalition learning...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} history of drug {{detection}} dogs in law enforcement, critically examines their ability to successfully detect illicit substances, and investigates the legal repercussions of dog alerts in the field. While drug dog programs have experienced substantial success in the U. S. with annual drug seizures valued between $ 2 and $ 3 billion, experiments on police-trained dogs have shown that though canines have incredible sensitivity in controlled settings, other factors including the breed of the dog, handler bias, and even {{the race of the}} suspect have been shown to significantly reduce a dog’s detection accuracy. These reports raise serious questions about the efficacy of drug detecting dogs, and if a dog alert should generate probable cause for a search or seizure of property that is otherwise protected under the Fourth Amendment. In particular, the threat of racial discriminatory practices raises the concern that dogs can be used to inappropriately extend law enforcement authority against ethnic minorities. Though these canines must complete a rigorous training course in order to search for narcotics, police are not required to keep careful records of their dogs’ performances on drug detection. As exemplified by a successful investigation and the subsequent removal of the ineffective <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> program in New South Wales, this article calls the U. S. to similarly investigate the accuracy of its drug sniffs in order to protect its citizens from seemingly unreliable dog alerts and the warantless searches and seizures that follow...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aims. At present {{there is}} little {{research}} into the use of <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs.</b> The present study sought to explore the use of <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> in Sydney, Australia, utilising multiple data sources.

Data were taken from interviews with 100 regular ecstasy users and 20 key experts {{as part of the}} 2006 New South Wales arm of the Ecstasy and Related Drugs Reporting System, and secondary data sources. Results. The majority of regular ecstasy users reported taking some form of precaution if made aware that dogs would be at an event they were attending. A small proportion of the sample reported consuming their drugs when coming into contact with <b>detection</b> <b>dogs.</b> One group of key experts viewed the use of <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> as useful; one group disliked the use of <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> though cooperated with law enforcement when dogs were used; and one group considered that <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> contribute to greater harm.

The present study suggests that regular ecstasy users do not see <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> as an obstacle to their drug use. Future research is necessary to explore in greater depth the experiences that drug users have with detection dogs; the effect <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> may have on deterring drug consumption; whether encounters with <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> contribute to drug-related harm; and the cost–benefit analysis of this law enforcement exercise. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Drugs (p. 22) We wish to {{highlight}} our disappointment that the passive <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> {{continues to be}} no longer used during the week {{in conjunction with the}} search procedures. We reiterate our recommendation first expressed in the 2010 report and expressed to Mr Brian Purcell when we met him that Cloverhill receives a full time dog this year. Whilst we accept that the visits here are generally screened, it is felt by the committee that the presence of the dog acts as a deterrent. Again this year we received a number of complaints from prisoners who objected to their visitors being searched because there were screen visits here. All visitors and staff who enter Cloverhill prison are searched including the visiting committee. The committee have always recognised screen visits as a proven efficient non confrontational method, together with the netting on the exercise yard, for reducing and stopping drugs being smuggled into prison. Whilst on a humanitarian level screen visits restrict contact with a prisoner’s family and friends, it is in our opinion for the greater good. The smuggling in of drugs continues to remain a problem in the prison system. In our 2008 report we first suggested and strongly recommended exploring the possibility of establishing a Drug Free unit within this prison and again we strongly suggest exploring the possibly of doing a feasibility study. We are disappointed to note that there has been no developments in this area but accept that this may be difficult on a Practical level in a predominately remand setting. Merchant Quay Addiction Counsellors (p 23) Addiction counsellors from Merchants Quay are now fully operational here since December 2008. They provide an on site addiction counsellng service in Cloverhill as part of the "Keeping Drugs out of Prison Strategy" (2005). The aims and objectives of the counselling service is the delivery of high quality addiction counselling services offering evidence-based counselling interventions with clearly defined care plans and goals. The service is provided by Accredited Addiction Counsellors. Counselling interventions include: brief interventions; motivational Interviewing and Motivational Enhancement therapy; 12 -step facilitation programme; relapse prevention; cognitive–behavioural therapy; development of alternative coping strategies and harm reduction approaches. The counselling service continues to work within international best practice; in the model of 'Continuum of care'. The Cloverhill Prison counselling team consists of 1 full time counsellor and a volunteer counsellor since November who works two days a week. The team leader is based in Wheatfield Prison. They have reported to us that their ccess to clients has remained good in 2011 following on from the improvement in 2010. The service continues to work within a multi-disciplinary setting in the prison and the focus continues to be on care and case management. The service continues to provide a range of counselling interventions and exit strategies where appropriate. Due to the nature of a remand prison, prisoners are often there for a short time. Relapse prevention and brief focus interventions and exit strategies {{are an integral part of}} the interventions for the clients. Referrals come from The Psychiatric Team, The Methadone Team, The Chaplains, Governor and his officers or prisoners may self refer. The method of self referral is becoming more frequent as the service is becoming more widely known throughout the prison community as a valuable resource and support for those motivated to move into recovery from Addiction. Once referred, the client is usually assessed within one week and if meeting all the assessment criteria is taken on the counsellor’s caseload immediately. Statistic supplied by the counselling services show that in 2011 they assessed 181 clients. And had a total caseload 231 new clients some of which were assessed in 2010 and were not seen till early in the New Year. They provided a total of 735 counselling session throughout 2011 and there was a total client contact of 968. The committee received no complaint about the service in 2011. We did see a number of prisoners who informed us that they were seeing the addiction counsellors. This is an area we will continue to be monitored during 2012...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} the {{background}} to this proposed legislation, looking at {{the development of the}} relevant statutory law, along with the debate about the use of drug sniffer dogs. On 19 September 2012 the NSW Attorney General, Greg Smith, introduced into the Legislative Assembly a Bill to extend the scope of the use of <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> or "sniffer" <b>dogs</b> without warrant in Kings Cross and on CityRail lines - the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Amendment (Kings Cross and Railway <b>Drug</b> <b>Detection)</b> Bill 2012 [the 2012 Bill]. As explained in the explanatory note, the object of the Bill: is to authorise the use by police officers of <b>dogs</b> for general <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> (without warrant) on the streets and other public places in the Kings Cross precinct. The Bill also adds additional train lines on which police officers may use dogs for that purpose so that all suburban train lines on which CityRail operates train services are covered. The 2012 Bill would insert new subsection 148 (1) (d) into the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 [LEPRA], to extend the use of sniffer <b>dogs</b> for general <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> in authorised places (without warrant) to include "persons at any public place in the Kings Cross precinct". It would also amend the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 to extend the use of <b>drug</b> <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> to all CityRail suburban train lines. On one view, the 2012 Bill does not involve the introduction of any new principle or practice into the criminal law. Rather, it can be said to extend the geographical fields of operation for defined police powers under s 148 of LEPRA. On the other hand, the 2012 Bill applies to an entire neighbourhood, which is partly residential in nature. In this respect its scope of operation can be said to be quite different to the current law, which is targeted to particular premises and events, as well to specified train lines. The purpose of this e-brief is to set out {{the background to}} this proposed legislation, looking at the development of the relevant statutory law, along with the debate about the use of drug sniffer dogs...|$|R

50|$|A <b>detection</b> <b>dog</b> or {{sniffer dog}} is {{a dog that}} is trained to use its senses to detect {{substances}} such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, currency, blood, and contraband electronics such as illicit mobile phones. The sense most used by <b>detection</b> <b>dogs</b> is smell. Hunting dogs that search for game, and search dogs that work to find missing humans are generally not considered <b>detection</b> <b>dogs.</b> There is some overlap, {{as in the case}} of cadaver dogs, trained to search for human remains.
