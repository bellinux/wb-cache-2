Tools such as the Jacob 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ladder</b> pre-production design tactic {{have been developed to}} ensure that voices of both engineers and educators are heard. However, it is unclear how development team members experience and perceive their collaborative work while designing a virtual game using such tactics. This phenomenological study examined the experiences of agile software team members using Jacob 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ladder</b> pre-production design as an interdisciplinary collaboration tool while designing a virtual learning game. Seven design team members (3 educators and 4 engineers) participated in semi-structured interviews and transcripts were analyzed via an inductive coding process that {{led to the development of}} key themes. Findings indicated that using Jacob 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ladder</b> design tactic influenced the experience of the team by keeping the team focused on common goals and learner needs, organizing the team work, supporting interdisciplinary collaboration, and promoting shared understandings of the software platform limitations. Individuals played various roles, appreciated diverse views, recognized prior experience and idea sharing, and felt the design tactic supported flexibility for interdisciplinary collaboration. By linking integration strategies to interdisciplinary collaboration, findings from this study may be used by organizational leaders to consider best practices in team building for virtual learning game design, which will further support the development of effective games and growth of the edutainment industry...|$|R

Used in this work approach theoretical efficiently alleviates excessive computational cost of the traditional ab initio methods, used in computational chemistry, with identical level of accuracy. Our high-level reference calculations show that protonation of HSNO molecule will most readily occur at the S atom (with energy release 17 kcal/mol), compared to N atom (energy release 5 kcal/mol) or O atom (energy release 7 kcal/mol). S-N bond in HSNO elongates by 0. 572 Å and weakens by 11. 1 kcal/mol upon protonation at the S at-om, gaining noticeable anharmonic character. Deprotonation of HSNO is thermodynami-cally unfavorable, with energy loss 170 kcal/mol, accompanied with S-N bond shorten-ing by 0. 149 Å.

40|$|Purpose: Knowledge maps (KMaps) are a {{relatively}} new concept. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the factors that encourage or impede the adoption of KMaps by computer software maintenance professionals. Design/methodology/approach: In total, six prototypes were developed for a muti-national software organisation and demonstrated during 19 semi-structured interviews conducted to establish adoption factors. Data were analysed qualitatively through NVivo™ software, according to the steps in Carney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ladder</b> of Analytical Abstraction. Findings: Encouragement factors were found to be those that organisational management has direct control over such as communicating and promoting KMaps and appointing a management champion. Impeding factors were those under the control of software maintenance management and are more difficult to manage. They focused on personal factors (staff 2 ̆ 7 s perception of the usefulness and ease of use of KMaps), subjective norms (peer influence and culture), behavioural control (training) and the design of the KMap itself. Research limitations/implications: While the research has provided an exploratory KMap Adoption (KAM) Model, it has done so through the lens of innovation adoption and diffusion theories. There are opportunities to examine the topic in a wider manner to provide a more holistic view of KMap adoption. Practical implications: From adoption factors, the study 2 ̆ 7 s explanatory framework, named the KAM, was synthesized and recommendations are made for push and pull strategies to maximise encouragement and minimise impediment factors identified in KAM.

The major themes that emerged from the data analysis of the private sector included the use of CBT as a means to solidify social relationships among locals and tourists and its ability to encourage repeat vacations. The major themes that materialized from interviewing the government workers included the need for the education of residents regarding the importance of their roles as stakeholder participants and the obligation by the relevant officials to stem any potential for criminal activity that could occur through CBT implementation.

40|$|The {{motif of}} Jacob s vision in John 1 : 51 {{is used to}} prove that Jesus was the apocalyptic Son of Man who {{fulfilled}} the promise {{that was given to}} Jacob through his dream in Genesis 28 : 12. This dream was different from Joseph s (Gn 37 : 9) or Abimelech s (Gn 20 : 8). From the gate of heaven that Jacob mentioned after the dream, it is possible to interpret the vision of Jacob eschatologically. In Ezekiel s vision (Ezk 1 : 1) and Daniel s vision (Dn 7 : 13), there are eschatological approaches about the open heaven and the one that comes from heaven. Therefore the vision of Jacob through the dream in Bethel was interpreted eschatologically by later traditions. The interpretation of the Rabbinic tradition about Jacob s dream has an eschatological perspective. For example: the author of Jacob <b>s</b> <b>Ladder,</b> the first century CE Pseudepigraphon, interpreted it as an eschatological vision according to their interpretation of the archangel in Genesis 5 - 7. The Rabbi in Genesis Rabba also interpreted it as a celestial icon as it is perceived in mysticism. Jacob s dream is mentioned in the Testament of Levi, and the dream of Levi is added to it. The dream of Levi is an extension of Jacob s dream. Levi was invited to heaven by the angel to receive the priesthood. It is a celestial interpretation of Jacob s vision. In the tradition of the intertestamental period, the Son of Man was understood as an eschatological figure.

40|$|The study {{examines}} social and physical connections and images {{that define the}} sense of place of three community gardens managed by the City of Portland. Most research on community gardens focuses on social group connections {{and their impact on}} community revitalization and empowerment. Few studies consider the impact of physical and social connections to community gardens from the perspective of individual gardeners in constructing their sense of place. No studies have yet examined the relationship between spatial images, space connections, and empowerment feelings related to community gardens. This study is intended to initiate a discussion on the empowerment experience of individual gardeners and their images associated with community gardens in the context of sense of place. Thirty gardeners participated in the study. The use of the narrative photo storytelling method applied through de Certeau 2 ̆ 7 s practice of everyday life and narrative city approach enabled gardeners to express in their own terms connections to space and experience of empowerment achieved through community gardening. The study proposes the concept of the Natural Realm as the context for sense of place of Portland Community gardens. Natural Realm deemphasizes the human-centric view of nature. Community gardeners most commonly experience empowerment by perceiving community gardens as sacred places where people feel well because they can grow healthy food, practice green domesticity, and learn from nature in a beautiful setting. The study applies Rocha 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ladder</b> of empowerment to examine the relevance of individual and group action in fulfilling empowerment goals in the context of sense of place.

The temperature dependence is induced by two effects i no triplon can be excited on a rung where a thermally activated triplon is present and ii conditional excitation processes take place if a thermally activated triplon is present. Both effects diminish the one triplon spectral weight upon heating. It is shown that the second effect is the dominant vertex correction in the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The matrix elements describing the conditional triplon excitation in the two leg Heisenberg ladder with additional four spin ring exchange are calculated perturbatively up to order 9. The calculated results are compared to those of an inelastic neutron scattering experiment on the cuprate ladder compound La 4 Sr 10 Cu 24 O 41 showing convincing agreement for established values of the exchange constant...|$|R
