40|$|The world {{natural gas}} reserve is plentiful. Instead of using {{gasoline}} to power ground vehicles, usage of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) {{can improve the}} environment and reduce energy cost. However, most engines that runs on CNG are converted from gasoline based engine. Hence, the engines are not optimized for CNG. Other problems of converted engines are loss of power due to slower burn rate of CNG and gas displacement effect of CNG, hotter exhaust gas which degrade engine’s reliability, low mileage per tank and higher NOx. Since, converted engines are gasoline base engine, a <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> engine system can be developed to reduce the stated problems. Are activity controlled approach was incorporated where both gasoline and CNG are mixed before going into the combustion chamber. With this technique, when a blend of high reactive 35 % gasoline and 65 % CNG was used, the engine had its engine performance such torque, power and efﬁciency increasing by 10 %. Also, the engine emissions such as hydrocarbon was reduced by 50 % and carbon monoxide emission was reduced by 75 % and NOx emission was reduced by 50 % when compared with CNG baseline.

40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} found to emit more NOx and smoke {{emissions}} {{in addition to its}} rapid depletion. Hence {{it is very important to}} find a best alternate fuel, which can fully or partially replace diesel which emits fewer pollutants to the atmosphere from diesel engines. <b>Dual</b> <b>fuel</b> approach is a well established technique to make use of different types of fuels in diesel engines. In the present work, an experimental investigation has been conducted to perform the optimization studies on the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine using LPG as primary fuel and HOME as pilot fuel on a DI Diesel Engine.

40|$|Natural gas (NG) -diesel <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engines {{have been}} criticized for their high {{emissions}} of unburned methane. The past research on methane emissions from <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engines has focused on the measurement of methane concentration in exhaust gases. The development of approaches capable of minimizing methane emissions requests the detailed spatial distribution of methane in-cylinder during the combustion and post combustion processes. However, it is difficult to experimentally measure the spatial distribution of methane in-cylinder. This research presents a numerical study on the combustion process of a NG-diesel <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine using the computational fluids dynamics (CFD) model CONVERGE coupled with a reduced primary reference fuel (PRF) mechanism. The model was validated against the heat release process and the emissions of nitrogen oxide, methane and carbon monoxide measured in a single cylinder <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine. The validated CFD model was applied to investigate the combustion of methane and n-heptane and the spatial distribution of methane in the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine. This is most likely the first attempt to visualize the spatial distribution of methane in <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engines using CFD. The objective {{of this study is to}} numerically simulate the methane combustion process, especially the methane present outside the pilot spray, quantify the methane combustion in each combustion stage, and visualize the spatial methane distribution in cylinder. The results showed that the momentum produced by the pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and combustion pushed the combustion products of pilot fuel and methane within the pilot spray plume toward the unburned methane-air mixture. Such a movement enhanced the mixing of the hot combustion products and the relatively cold unburned methane-air mixture during the main combustion process and dominated the combustion of methane presented outside the pilot fuel spray plume.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} harmful {{exhaust gas emissions}} from internal combustion engines, researchers are continuously looking for alternative fuels and combustion techniques, and in this context the use of natural gas as a supplement for conventional fuels has been suggested.

Therefore, in such an application natural gas has {{to be used with}} high reactivity fuel, usually diesel fuel. In these applications diesel fuel is used solely as a high energy ignition device, while natural gas is used as primary fuel.

For this a single-cylinder four-stroke water cooled direct injection (DI) compression ignition (CI) engine provided with CMFIS (Conventional Mechanical <b>Fuel</b> <b>Injection</b> System) was rightfully converted to operate with CRDi injection systems enabling high pressure injection of Rubber seed oil methyl ester (RuOME) in the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> mode with induction of varied gas flow rates of hydrogen and hydrogen enriched CNG (HCNG) gas combinations. Experimental investigations showed a considerable improvement in <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine performance with acceptable brake thermal efficiency and reduced emissions of smoke, hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and slightly increased nitric oxide (NOx) emission levels for increased hydrogen and HCNG flow rates. Further CRDi facilitated <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine showed improved engine performance compared to CMFIS as the former enabled high pressure (900 bar) injection of the RuOME and closer to TDC (Top Dead Centre) as well. Combustion parameters such as ignition delay, combustion duration, pressure-crank angle and heat release rates were analyzed and compared with baseline data generated. Combustion analysis showed that the rapid rate of burning of hydrogen and HCNG along with air mixtures increased due to presence of hydrogen in total and in partial combination with CNG which further resulted into higher cylinder pressures and energy release rates.

Dual-fuel HCCI combustion needs lower intake air temperature than gasoline HCCI combustion, which reduces the requirements on heat management system.

40|$|When {{natural gas}} is port/manifold {{injected}} into a compression ignition engine, the mixture of air and the {{natural gas is}} compressed during the compression stroke of the engine. Due to {{the difference in the}} values of specific heat capacity ratio between air and natural gas, the temperature and pressure at the time of pilot <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> are different when compared to a case where only air is compressed. Also, the presence of natural gas affects the peak in-cylinder (adiabatic flame) temperature. This significantly affects the performance as well as emissions characteristics of natural gas based <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> in CI engine. Natural gas has been extensively tested in a single cylinder compression ignition engine to obtain performance and emissions maps. Two pilot fuels, diesel and RME, have been used to pilot natural gas combustion. The performance of the two liquid fuels used as pilots has also been assessed and compared. Tests were conducted at 48 different operating conditions (six different speeds and eight different power output conditions for each speed) for single fueling cases. Both the diesel and RME based single fueling cases were used as baselines to compare the natural gas based <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> where data was collected at 36 operating conditions (six different speeds and six different power output conditions for each speed). Performance and emissions characteristics were mapped on speed vs brake power plots. The thermal efficiency values of the natural gas <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> were lower when compared to the respective pilot fuel based single fueling apart from the highest powers. The effect of engine speed on volumetric efficiency in case of the natural gas based <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> was significantly different from what was observed with the single fueling. Contours of specific NOX for diesel and RME based single fueling differ significantly when these fuels were used to pilot natural gas combustion. For both of the single fueling cases, maximum specific NOX were centered at the intersection of medium speeds and medium powers and they decrease in all directions from this region of maximum values. On the other hand, an opposite trend was observed with <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> cases where minimum specific NOX were observed {{at the center of the}} map and they increase in all direction from this region of minimum NOX.
