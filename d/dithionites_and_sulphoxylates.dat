40|$|Sodium <b>dithionite</b> <b>and</b> {{thiourea}} dioxide are two typical reducing agents {{commonly used in}} industry. This paper compared the thermal hazards of sodium <b>dithionite</b> <b>and</b> {{thiourea dioxide}} based on DSC-TG (Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetry) thermal analysis, small-scale self-heating experiments and FTIR smoke gas analysis. From the thermal analysis (DSC-TG), sodium dithionite starts to lose crystal water at the temperature around 60 °C which makes the sodium dithionite very unstable at relatively lower temperature. The decomposition of sodium dithionite has a close correlation with oxygen while the decomposition of thiourea dioxide has little relationship with oxygen. Small-scale self-heating experiments were designed to reflect the self-heating and spontaneous combustion properties of the characteristic dimension 20 cm. The small-scale self-heating experiments {{show that there is}} a little gap between the Critical Ambient Temperature (CAT) of sodium <b>dithionite</b> <b>and</b> thiourea dioxide. From FTIR smoke gas analysis, the smoke of thiourea dioxide (decomposition or combustion) is far more dangerous than sodium dithionite. Although the risk of spontaneous combustion for sodium dithionite is higher than thiourea dioxide, the thermal hazards of thiourea dioxide are far higher than sodium dithionite as the decomposition and combustion of thiourea dioxide would release far more heat and dangerous smokes...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{adaptations of}} <b>dithionite</b> <b>and</b> urea-dithionite tube tests are accurate, reliable, {{inexpensive}} methods for detecting hemoglobin S. More than 3, 000 individuals have been screened (120 determinations per hour; reagent cost, 2 to 4 cents per test). The dithionite reagent consists of potas-sium phosphate, sodium <b>dithionite,</b> <b>and</b> saponin. When S hemoglobin contacts this reagent, the red cells lyse, and the hemoglobin deoxygenates and sickles, forming a hydrophobic-bond-dependent nematic liquid crystal {{system that is}} manifested as turbidity. The resulting AutoAnalyzer curve is strikingly and diagnostically different from that produced by hemoglobin A in the same reagent. Specificity of the automated dithionite test may be enhanced by use of the automated urea-dithionite test, which consists of a specimen set of two aliquots: one traverses a dithionite line, the other a urea-dithionite line. A comparison of transmittance in the two lines yields typical diagnostic curves because the urea disperses the sickling, with a consequently increased transmittance over that of the dithionite aliquot...|$|R

In the thermal decomposition studies, the overall rate showed a 3 / 2 -order dependence on <b>dithionite</b> concentration <b>and</b> a half-order dependence on hydrogen ion concentration.
