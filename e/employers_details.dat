50|$|Madagascar is {{a source}} country for women and {{children}} subjected to human trafficking, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. An estimated 6,000 Malagasy women are currently employed as domestic workers in Lebanon, with a smaller number in Kuwait. Many of these women come from rural areas and are often illiterate or poorly educated, making them more vulnerable to deception and abuse {{at the hands of}} recruitment agencies and <b>employers.</b> <b>Detailed</b> information regarding situations of forced labor and other abuses experienced by Malagasy domestic workers in Lebanon came to light during the year. Numerous trafficking victims returning to Madagascar reported harsh working conditions, physical violence, sexual harassment and assault, confinement to the home, confiscation of travel documents, and withholding of salaries.

30|$|In {{the needs}} assessment, {{literature}} research into behavioral and environmental conditions of prolonged sick leave {{was supplemented with}} focus group discussions with patients to establish performance objectives for patients, gynecologists, family physicians (FP), occupational physicians (OP) and employers. Performance objectives for the non-patient target groups were mainly to acquaint themselves with recommendations for their patients (gynecologist, FP, OP) or to show involvement and discuss a work-reintegration plan with their employee (<b>employer).</b> <b>Detailed</b> recommendations for resumption of work were developed in a Delphi study by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Performance objectives for patients were to acquaint themselves with information (recommendations, surgery- and care-related issues, telephone numbers), to not extend their sick leave beyond the recommended period on their own initiative, to develop a work-reintegration plan and discuss it with their employer, to identify barriers for a safe return to work, to exchange experiences with other patients and to receive answers to questions and uncertainties. Determinants were identified as the patient’s attitude, social influence, self-efficacy and skills, as well as external barriers and facilitators.|$|R
40|$|Challenged by the {{obligation}} to introduce a work-integrated learning component into the National Diploma in Human Resource Management (HRM), on the one hand, and faced with a restraining national curriculum that does not provide for a credit bearing experiential learning component, on the other hand, called for innovative thinking. Realizing the importance of assisting unemployed students to seek employment prompted {{the design of the}} HRM experiential learning guide to start with a personal development plan. This part comprise the compilation of a curriculum vitae; drafting a covering letter; preparing for an interview; completing a basic personality profile; determining own decision-making style; and a diversity exercise. The experiential learning guide further contains outcomes based HRM-specific experiential learning requirements. The program consists of 18 main areas, grouped into four role clusters {{based on the work of}} the Standards Generating Body: Human Resources Management & Practices. The experiential learning guidelines further specify the assessment criteria and present the learner with a number of portfolio compilation aids, checklists, <b>employer</b> <b>detail</b> and learner evaluation forms. This article reflects on the assessment of the portfolios of the first three groups of students that completed their experiential learning.

30|$|The {{paper at}} hand adds to this literature. It explores the {{relationship}} between the risk of employees leaving the firm and firms’ commitment to continuing vocational training (CVT)b. For this purpose, it exploits a survey conducted in 2011 among 1.238 firms with at least 5 employees in Germany (BIBB-FluCT survey). In this survey, <b>employers</b> gave <b>details</b> pertaining to their investment in continuing training as well as labor turnover in their firm. Additionally, they provided geographical information that can be utilized to ensure that a potential relationship between training and turnover is independent of local market conditions.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether referrals from employers’ business and professional contacts {{matter in the}} hiring process. Additionally, we examine whether the effect of referrals varies depending on: (1) the signaling role of education during the hiring process, and (2) applicants’ level of education. Based {{on a combination of}} a factorial survey and an experimental design with a sample of English employers, we measure the effect of referrals on employers’ hiring assessments. We find only weak evidence that referred applicants are considered more trainable than otherwise identical applicants that do not have a tie with the <b>employer.</b> More <b>detailed</b> analyses show that referrals do matter for employers who consider education a noisy signal, in line with the argument that informal recruitment can represent a strategy for employers to compensate for poor signaling.

30|$|We define occupations and {{industries}} using the one-digit code {{used in the}} IFLS. The dataAppendixcontains {{the description of the}} occupation and industry codes. 6 Respondents’ occupation and industry came from the employment module, including the retrospective questions in each survey wave. We identify an employer change when respondents indicated that they were not on the same job as the previous year. We then construct employer and industry tenure based on these employer changes. Occupation may change within a spell with the same <b>employer.</b> A more <b>detailed</b> explanation is available in the data Appendix.|$|R

40|$|FOREWORD The Secretary of State for Education and Employment {{established}} the Skills Task Force {{to assist him}} in developing a National Skills Agenda. An {{important part of this}} remit was to provide evidence on the nature, extent and pattern of skill needs and shortages and their likely future development. The research evidence assembled by the Task Force was summarised in “Skills for all: Research Report from the National Skills Task Force”, published in June 2000. An important contribution to the evidence was made by a major programme of new research. This included two <b>employer</b> surveys, <b>detailed</b> case studies in seven different industries and a review of existing surveys. We are grateful to all those who participated in this research and so contributed to the work of the task force. This report provides more detailed information on one element of this research. Details of associated reports are listed in the rear of this publication. It {{should be noted that the}} views expressed, and any recommendations made, within this report are those of the individual authors only.

In my rigorous work I try to span the given questions on a large scale. At the beginning, I engage in historical rootage of the given institute and point out its development. I state particular legal regulations which had in general the importance to development of labour law, however, especially for the field of employment termination. In this part I also deal with the legal regulations of an employment discharge, just as it was contained in the labour code from 1965. In the successive chapter I already devote to the employment discharge in terms of the valid legal regulations. I cl arify here the term of discharge, its essentials, form, content, delivering, appeal, cancellation time, periods for claiming the discharge. I also deal here with subjects of the discharge and their competence to perform legal acts. I also describe here the discharge given by the employee and the discharge given by the <b>employer</b> in <b>detail.</b> In other two parts I point out the cases of discharge prohibition and I discourse briefly about the institute of collective redundancies of employees. Consequently, I solv e the questions connected with the employment [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 San Francisco {{implemented}} {{major health}} reform, {{becoming the first}} city to adopt a pay-or-play employer health spending mandate. It also created Healthy San Francisco, a new “public option” low-cost health access plan for the uninsured. This study evaluates employer-level health benefit offering responses to the pay-or-play mandate {{in the first year}} of implementation using the 2008 Bay Area Employer Health Benefits Survey and a difference-in-difference estimator. Although 92 % of firms subject to the mandate already offered insurance prior to enactment, we find that 76 % of firms had to expand benefits to comply with the minimum hourly spending requirement for each worker. Nevertheless, most surveyed San Francisco employers (61 %) were supportive of the law. There is substantial employer demand for the public option, with 18 % of firms using Healthy San Francisco for at least some employees, yet there is little evidence of firms dropping or restricting existing insurance offerings in the first year after implementation. A non-trivial portion of firms chose to meet the mandate by paying into health reimbursement accounts (14 %). These results confirm that <b>employer</b> mandate <b>details</b> can have crucial effects on employer behavior. While there are important geographic and political characteristics of San Francisco that are important to bear in mind, San Francisco’s early experience suggests that implementation of a strong pay-or-play mandate is indeed feasible. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, A. W. N. Pugin, still a teenager, {{was working for}} two highly visible <b>employers,</b> {{providing}} Gothic <b>detailing</b> for luxury goods. For the Royal furniture makers Morel and Seddon he provided designs for redecorations for the elderly George IV at Windsor Castle in a Gothic taste suited to the setting. For the royal silversmiths Rundell Bridge and Co., Pugin provided designs for silver from 1828, using the 14th-century Anglo-French Gothic vocabulary that {{he would continue to}} favour later in designs for the new Palace of Westminster. [...] Between 1821 and 1838 Pugin and his father published a series of volumes of architectural drawings, the first two entitled, Specimens of Gothic Architecture, and the following three, Examples of Gothic Architecture, that were to remain both in print and the standard references for Gothic Revivalists {{for at least the next}} century.|$|R
40|$|Has greater {{turbulence}} among firms fueled rising wage {{instability in}} the U. S. ? Gottschalk and Moffitt ([1994]) find that rising earnings instability was responsible for one third to {{one half of the}} rise in wage inequality during the 1980 s. These growing transitory fluctuations remain largely unexplained. To help fill this gap, this paper further documents the recent rise in transitory fluctuations in compensation and investigates its linkage to the concurrent rise in volatility of firm performance documented by Comin and Mulani [2005] among others. After examining models that explain the relationship between firm and wage volatility, we investigate the linkage in three complementary panel data sets, each with its own virtues and limitations: the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (detailed information on workers, but no information on <b>employers),</b> COMPUSTAT (<b>detailed</b> firm information, but only average wage and employment levels about workers), and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's Community Salary Survey (wages and employment for specific occupations for identified firms). We find complementary support for the hypothesis in all three data sets. We can rule out straightforward compositional churning as an explanation for the link to firm performance in high-frequency (over spans of 5 years) wage volatility, although not in more persistent fluctuations (between successive 5 -year averages). We conclude that the rise in firm turbulence explains about sixty percent of the recent the rise in the high frequency (5 -year) volatility of wages. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish whether employers specify the requirement of CPD when recruiting managers and, in doing so, to open up the debate on the importance attached to CPD by employers. Design/methodology/approach – An observational analysis was undertaken of job advertisements placed in four regional newspapers and a national online job web site over a two-month period (August and September 2006). Findings – From the newspaper job advertisements scrutinized none indicated CPD either directly or indirectly as a requirement for managerial jobs. Job experience (84 per cent) and personal attributes (82 per cent) were the most important requirements indicated for managerial jobs. An online national jobs web site, however, implied or specifically mentioned CPD for only five managerial posts. Research limitations/implications – Some of the job advertisements provided very scant details. The study has only taken a surface view of the posts, as opposed to a detailed reviewing of the person specification for jobs. Targeting “Managers” focused on only middle level positions and even this could have excluded some posts. Practical implications – The lack of CPD evidence now challenges employers to consider the importance of CPD when preparing managerial job advertisements. Originality/value – The paper highlights the gap between the value of CPD and its absence in job advertisements and discusses the impact of the findings on relevant stakeholder groups. It argues the need for <b>employers</b> to <b>detail</b> CPD implicitly or explicitly in job advertisements to enhance the quality of job applicants...|$|R
50|$|In the United States the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) {{requires}} <b>employers</b> to keep <b>detailed</b> records {{regarding the}} identity of workers and hours worked for all workers who are protected under federal minimum wage laws. Most states require that employers also provide each worker with documentation every pay period detailing that worker's hours, wages and deductions. As of September 2011 Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia did not require this documentation. A 2008 survey of wage theft from workers in Illinois, New York, and California found that 57% of low wage workers did not receive this required documentation and that workers who were paid in cash or on a weekly rate {{were more likely to}} experience wage theft. Anecdotal evidence suggests that tip theft, which is a legally complex issue distinct from wage theft and not necessarily {{under the control of the}} same laws governing the payment of wages, may also be common in instances where employer record keeping does not comply with the law.|$|R
40|$|This report {{derives from}} the project "Improving survey {{measurement}} of income and employment (ISMIE) " which investigates measurement error in survey data on income and employment, using a UK sub-sample of the European Household Community Panel (ECHP). In this paper we describe the process of collecting validation data and the outcomes of the process. Validation data were obtained from two sources: employers' records and government benefit data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The former provided information on occupation and employment status, gross and net pay, membership of company pension schemes and industry sector. The latter provided histories of benefit receipt and tax credits, for example, child, disability, housing and unemployment benefits, pensions and income support. In the survey interview, respondents were asked for written permission both to obtain their DWP records and to contact their employer. They {{were also asked to}} provide information that would facilitate the process of obtaining the validation data: National Insurance number (NINO) and <b>employer</b> contact <b>details.</b> Subsequently, DWP records were extracted using a non-hierarchical matching strategy, based on different combinations of identifying variables obtained in the survey (NINO, sex, date of birth, name and postcode), and a survey of employers was carried out (mail, with telephone follow-up). The representativeness of the validation samples obtained depends on the co-operation of both survey respondents and providers of validation data, as well as errors in the matching process. We report permission rates, proportions providing matching items, match rates for the DWP data and response rates to the employer survey. We identify correlates of these measures of success at each stage of the validation process in terms of substantive characteristics of the survey respondents. Variation by subgroups is identified and implications for the representativeness of the validation sample are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{curriculum}} {{review and revision}} are used to review and revise the Library and Information (LIS) curriculum at the University of Zululand, South Africa. Firstly, as an exercise in product analysis, {{a case study of}} the graduates of the University of Zululand between 1996 and 1999 was conducted. Graduates were traced to their current places of employment and interviewed together with their employers in order to determine whether the knowledge, skills and attitudes gained during training were adequate for their current job requirements. Secondly, a market-type analysis was conducted by scanning job advertisements in the field of library and information science appearing in a popular national weekly newspaper over a period of three years. Details regarding date and location of advertisement, type of <b>employer,</b> job <b>details</b> and job specifications and requirements in terms of qualifications, experience, knowledge, skills and attitudes were captured from this source and analysed. Whereas the aforementioned two methods still enjoy popularity, arguably, they alone do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of the demand and supply matrix that can enhance effective and beneficial LIS education for service and employability of graduates. Evidently, the public sector and in particular the public and academic libraries, dominate this specific segment of the employment market in South Africa. Sound education in the fields of management, information and communication technologies, information searching, analysis and synthesis, as well as the ability to perform practical work is regarded as essential. The use of the aforementioned two methods exploits techniques which play a crucial verification role and which effectively supplement other methods such as reviewing existing curriculum and literature, consulting with colleagues and observing national and international trends as well as the focus-group method for academic programme development. Other intervening variables in the study are discussed. The paper addresses issues that can benefit theoretical and methodological issues in library and information science education and curriculum development. 1...|$|R
50|$|The case caused {{considerable}} disquiet {{in legal}} circles {{for many years}} and {{there were a number of}} attempts to have it re-opened. The evidence put forward by the prosecution had emanated from witnesses who could hardly be described as being of sterling character. Dickson was a convicted prostitute and thief who, two years after the Cameo trial, was sentenced with others to a lengthy prison term for the violent robberies of a number of her clients. Northam had been a criminal since the age of 14 and had spent much of the 1940s in and out of prison. Graham shared a similar background. All three stood to gain by their testimony. The detective who led the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Herbert Balmer, had difficulty in corroborating much of the prosecution evidence during the trial and many prosecution witness statements bore the sign of police coaching. <b>Employer's</b> timesheets, which <b>detailed</b> Connolly's movements on the day of the murder, had been amateurishly tampered with. Witness statements that favoured the accused men were held back by the police, a fact later discovered by a local businessman, Luigi Santangeli, who set out to investigate the crime on behalf of Connolly in the 1990s and was given access to the case files by Merseyside Police.|$|R
