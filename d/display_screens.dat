Flight information <b>display</b> <b>screens</b> for airline passengers are provided at the Heathrow Express ticket office near these platforms. Baggage check-in facilities for airline passengers were provided in 1999 in the Lawn but progressively replaced by retail units. An integrated timetable is offered between Paddington and Rosslare Europort in Ireland via the Stena Line ferry from Fishguard Harbour railway station with through ticketing to stations and a daily morning and evening service in both directions, changing at Newport, Cardiff or Swansea. This route has been in existence since 1906.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} {{stage on}} which Jarre and his musicians performed {{was built on}} top of four large barges. Large purpose-built <b>display</b> <b>screens</b> were built, {{and one of the}} buildings {{to be used as a}} backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.|$|E

The lateral region is smaller than the cohesive region, and image information of the half-images are enrolled in a lateral direction forced in a sub-pixel of a matrix <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> (10) i. e. liquid crystal <b>display</b> <b>screen.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> for <b>displaying</b> a point of views visible from lateral offset viewing zones comprising a beam splitter grid. USE - Method for displaying image information on an auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> that is utilized for displaying a point of views visible from lateral offset viewing zones (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method enables displaying the image information of three dimensional images on the auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> with better quality by the user in a convenient manner...|$|R

The controller evokes potential information by visual simulator. It constructs high quality data collection system by an EEG amplifier, then abstracts {{the characteristics of the}} EEG signal by signal processing algorithm and controls the movement of image on the 3 D <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> by transforming them into controlling signal.

Some of WMS's product designs reflected the changing demographics of its industry. Younger players raised on video games often seek more challenging experiences, both physical and mental, than do women age 55 to 65 – the traditional audience for slot machines. Accordingly, some of the company's machines incorporate surround sound, flat-panel <b>display</b> <b>screens</b> and animated, full-color images.|$|E

Williams {{spent most of the}} second half of 1991 designing the stage. Owens was insistent that her ideas be given priority, as she thought that men had been making all of U2's creative decisions and were using male-centred designs. With bassist Adam Clayton's support, she recruited visual artists from Europe and the United States to arrange images for use on the <b>display</b> <b>screens.</b> These people included video artist Mark Pellington, photo/conceptual artist David Wojnarowicz, and satirical group Emergency Broadcast Network, who digitally manipulate sampled image and sound. Pellington envisaged a collection of text phrases into the visual displays, inspired by his working with artist Jenny Holzer. The idea was first put into practice in the video for Achtung Babys lead single, [...] "The Fly". Bono devised and collected numerous phrases during development of the album and the tour. Additional pre-recorded video content was created by Eno, Williams, Kevin Godley, Carol Dodds, and Philip Owens.|$|E
