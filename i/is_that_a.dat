5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|A further {{complication}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> certain {{proportion of}} the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E
40|$|Abstract I aim to {{show that}} {{standard}} theories of counterfactuals are mistaken, not in detail, but in principle, and I aim to say what form a tenable theory must take. Standard theories entail a categorical interpretation of counterfactuals, on which to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state something, not relative to any supposition or hypothesis, but categorically. On the rival suppositional interpretation, to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state <b>that</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C relative to the supposition <b>that</b> it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A.</b> The two interpretations make incompatible predictions concerning the correct evaluation of counterfactuals. I argue that the suppositional interpretation makes the correct prediction...|$|R
2500|$|Third, in {{the realm}} of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and {{arguments}} whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce [...] "No quadrangle <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> square <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rhombus" [...] from [...] "No square <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quadrangle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rhombus <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle" [...] or from [...] "No rhombus <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> square <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quadrangle".|$|R

5|$|A second effect <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, {{and will}} have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{gene for}} aposematism might be recessive and {{located on the}} X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> move must {{be made on the}} board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers {{of faith in the}} Bates method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{examining}} the health impact of sugars are inconclusive. The United Nations meta-analysis and WHO studies showed contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms. Other studies indicated variable results between health effects, particularly on obesity, {{and whether the}} research {{was funded by the}} sugar industry or those by independent sponsors. The 'empty calories' argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> diet high in added sugar will reduce consumption of foods that contain essential nutrients.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E
5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually {{rule the world}} through an authoritarian world governmentâ€”which will replace sovereign nation-statesâ€”and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E

5|$|The main {{benefit of}} breast {{brachytherapy}} compared to whole breast irradiation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> high {{dose of radiation}} can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs.

The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1â€“2 months).|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} lesson learned <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of ecosystems, including the one that contains Yellowstone, are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires.
