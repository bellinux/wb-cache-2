50|$|When clipped in, <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> {{should not}} be {{shortened}} by clipping in another pocket to the same carabiner. Failure of the pocket stitching results in the <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> disconnecting from the anchor, with potentially fatal consequences. If shortening the <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> when clipped in, in order to eliminate dangerous slack, a second carabiner {{should be used to}} connect to the anchor.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> is a teaser {{consisting}} of a [...] "chain" [...] of plastic lures run without hooks. The <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> mimics a possible school of baitfish, food for a larger predator. The purpose of a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> is to attract pelagic fish to the stern of a boat into the lure [...] "spread", which consists {{of a number of}} lures rigged with hooks.|$|R

50|$|Commodore-specific {{printers}} {{were attached}} to the C64 via the serial port and were capable of being <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> to the system with other serial port devices such as floppy drives. By convention, printers were addressed as device #4-5 on the CBM-488 serial bus.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of LED instruments {{is that they}} can be controlled directly using DMX and do not require additional dimmers; the intensity of the LEDs being adjusted by circuitry on board the fixture. Because of their low power consumption several units can be <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> to one power supply.|$|E

50|$|In {{electrical}} and electronic engineering a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> is a wiring scheme in which multiple devices are wired together in sequence or in a ring. Other than a full, single loop, systems which contain internal loops cannot be called <b>daisy</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> DNA is {{the process}} of when DNA {{undergoing}} PCR amplification becomes tangled and forms a 'daisy chain.' During PCR, primers or dNTP's will eventually be used up and limit further reactions; it is when the primers deplete that causes <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining.</b> Since the denaturing and annealing processes still continue without primers, the single-stranded DNA molecules reanneal to themselves. However, this reannealing does not always occur to another complementary strand. It is this imperfect match up that causes 'tangles'. These tangles look like a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like the Apple IIe before it, the Macintosh {{provided}} an optional external keypad which also included arrow keys that <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> to the CPU via the telephone-cord connectors. Though introduced with the Macintosh in January 1984, Apple did not ship it until September 1984 at a retail price of US$99.|$|E
50|$|Proxies can be <b>daisy</b> <b>chained.</b> Chaining {{anonymous}} proxies {{can make}} traffic analysis {{far more complex}} and costly by requiring the eavesdropper {{to be able to}} monitor different parts of the Internet. An anonymizing remailer can use this concept by relaying a message to another remailer, and eventually to its destination.|$|E
50|$|Cable {{length is}} limited to 4.5 m, {{although}} up to 16 cables can be <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> using active repeaters; external hubs, or internal hubs are often present in FireWire equipment. The S400 standard limits any configuration's maximum cable length to 72 m. The 6-conductor connector is commonly found on desktop computers, and can supply the connected device with power.|$|E
40|$|For many {{positive}} odd integers n, whether prime or not, the set Un of units of Zn contains members t, u, v and w, say with respective orders τ, ψ, ω and π, such {{that we can}} write Un as the direct product Un = 〈t〉×〈u〉×〈v〉×〈w〉. Each element of Un can then be written in the form thuiv jwk where 0 ≤ h<τ, 0 ≤ i<ψ, 0 ≤ j<ωand 0 ≤ k<π. We can then often use the structure of 〈t〉×〈u 〉 ×〈v〉×〈w 〉 to arrange the τψωπ elements of Un in a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain,</b> i. e. in a circular arrangement such that, as we proceed once round the chain in either direction, the set of differences between each member and the preceding one is itself the set Un. We describe <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> based on such 4 -factor decompositions as <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> with four generators. We study {{the existence of such}} arrangements, and we note their relationships with the previously studied <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> with three generators. The smallest prime values n for which <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> with four generators exist are 571 and 1051. ...|$|R

50|$|When used on 16-bit {{systems such}} as the PDP-11, the drive stored roughly 1.2 megawords. When used on 12-bit {{systems such as}} the PDP-8, the drive stored 1.6 megawords (so roughly the same bit capacity, albeit {{formatted}} differently). Multiple drives were <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> from their controller using Unibus cabling; a terminator was installed in the farthest drive.|$|E
50|$|The 5500 {{series are}} often used as Top Of Rack (TOR) {{switches}} and client access-switches in wiring cabinets in offices or campus networks. The 5500P series are mainly client access switches connecting VOIP phones and (<b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> or directly connected) workstations. The -P series are also used to power other devices than phones, such as WiFi Access-points, IP camera's or thin clients.|$|E
50|$|The latter {{generated}} a non-maskable interrupt, freezing any {{software running on}} the Spectrum and allowing it to be saved to disk. This made it simple to store tape-based games on disk, to take screenshots and to enter cheat codes. A duplicate expansion connector at the back allowed other peripherals to be <b>daisy</b> <b>chained,</b> although {{the complexity of the}} DISCiPLE meant that many would not work correctly.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> is a strap, {{several feet}} long and {{typically}} constructed from one-inch tubular nylon webbing of the same type used in lengthening straps between anchor-points and the main rope. The webbing is bar tacked at roughly two-inch intervals (or, in the past, tied) to create a length of small loops for attachment. Unlike the use of similar devices in backpacking, <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> in technical rock climbing {{are expected to be}} of sufficient strength to be [...] "load bearing,". <b>Daisy</b> <b>chain</b> pockets however are not rated to full strength, and can only take static loads.|$|R

50|$|Most 3DO systems shipped with a {{standard}} controller, as well as A/V and power cables. The 3DO controllers were unique in that the system base unit contained only one controller port and the controllers could be physically <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> together via a port {{on the back of}} each controller. Up to eight controllers could be linked together in this fashion. All controllers for each 3DO console are compatible with one another.|$|E

The drive can be <b>daisy</b> <b>chained,</b> however this feature is not supported on the Macintosh.|$|E
50|$|Digital Video (DV) is a {{standard}} protocol used by some digital camcorders. All DV cameras that recorded to tape media had a FireWire interface (usually a 4-conductor). All DV ports on camcorders only operate at the slower 100 Mbit/s speed of FireWire. This presents operational issues if the camcorder is <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> from a faster S400 device or via a common hub because any segment of a FireWire network cannot support multiple speed communication.|$|E

50|$|Mixer 14:2 - Reason's mixer is used {{to group}} {{numerous}} device outputs into a stereo output. It has fourteen stereo channels with level meters, fixed bass and treble EQ and four stereo auxiliary sends. It is possible to mute or solo any given channel, as well as alter its level, pan and auxiliary output level. The console has chaining master inputs to allow several line mixers to be <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> together, effectively allowing for an unlimited number of channels.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{versions of}} the Justifer for the Genesis and SNES were modeled after the replica revolvers used in the original arcade version of Lethal Enforcers. The blue Justifier gun connects directly to the console. Optionally, a pink Justifier can be <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> into the blue gun for use by a second player. The pink Justifier was only available directly from Konami via mail-order and is compatible with both, the SNES and Genesis models of the blue gun.|$|E
50|$|These {{are mostly}} single-die LEDs used as indicators, {{and they come}} in various sizes from 2 mm to 8 mm, {{through-hole}} and surface mount packages. They usually do not use a separate heat sink. Typical current ratings range from around 1 mA to above 20 mA. The small size sets a natural upper boundary on power consumption due to heat caused by the high current density and need for a heat sink. Often <b>daisy</b> <b>chained</b> as used in LED tapes.|$|E
