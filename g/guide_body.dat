A system generates and controls the fluid pressure in the cushion. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The brake for a running yarn/ribbon {{has at least one}} flexible cushion, which is operated by the brake body. At least one cushion can also be the brake body, and it has a replaceable and flexible mantle shrouding on the braking side. The <b>guide</b> <b>body</b> has a guide groove to take the moving yarn/ribbon. The cushion is held by a support (4), on the side away from the moving yarn/ribbon, and it can be fixed to the support. The brake pressure applied to the moving yarn/ribbon is set according to its registered tension. One cushion can apply a braking action to at least two running yarns/ribbons.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{different}} cognitive processes are "embodied" is widely debated. Previous studies have implicated sensorimotor regions such as lateral intraparietal (LIP) area in perceptual decision making. This {{has led to the}} view that perceptual decisions are embodied in the same sensorimotor networks that <b>guide</b> <b>body</b> movements. We use event-related fMRI and effective connectivity analysis to investigate whether the human sensorimotor system implements perceptual decisions. We show that when eye and hand motor preparation is disentangled from perceptual decisions, sensorimotor areas are not involved in accumulating sensory evidence toward a perceptual decision. Instead, inferior frontal cortex increases its effective connectivity with sensory regions representing the evidence, is modulated by the amount of evidence, and shows greater task-positive BOLD responses during the perceptual decision stage. Once eye movement planning can begin, however, an intraparietal sulcus (IPS) area, putative LIP, participates in motor decisions. Moreover, sensory evidence levels modulate decision and motor preparation stages differently in different IPS regions, suggesting functional heterogeneity of the IPS. This suggests that different systems implement perceptual versus motor decisions, using different neural signatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a piezo-electrical drive device for performing linear movements {{relative to the}} axis (1), comprising two piezo-electrical clamping devices (23, 31) arranged at a spacing along the axis (1) and acting radially onto the axis (1), {{and at least one}} piezo-actuator (32, 33) acting {{in the direction of the}} axis (x), whereby the mutual distance of the clamping devices (23, 31) can be changed in dependence on the change in length of the piezo-actuator (32, 33), and, when such a movement step is performed, only one of the two clamping devices (32, 31) is engaged with the axis (1). The task of creating a drive device which ensures a high degree of positioning and guiding accuracy, is achieved in particular by using a specially shaped <b>guiding</b> <b>body</b> (2) performing the movement and supporting the axis (1) at the same time.

40|$|Previous work on transaccadic {{memory and}} change {{blindness}} suggests {{that only a}} small part of the information in the visual scene is retained following a change in eye position. However some visual representation across different fixation positions seems necessary to <b>guide</b> <b>body</b> movements. In order to understand what information is retained across gaze positions it seems necessary to consider the functional demands of vision in ordinary behavior. We therefore examined eye and hand movements in a naturalistic task, where subjects copied a toy model in a virtual environment. Saccadic targeting performance was examined to see if subjects took advantage of regularities in the environment. During the first trials the spatial arrangement of the pieces used to copy the model was kept stable. In subsequent trials this arrangement was changed randomly every time the subject looked away. Results showed that about 20 % of saccades went either directly to the location of the next component to be copied, or to its old location before the change. There was also a significant increase in the total number of fixations required to locate a piece after a change, which could be accounted for by the corrective movements required after fixating the (incorrect) old location. These results support the idea that a detailed representation of the spatial structure of the environment is typically retained across fixations and used to guide eye movements...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the <b>guided</b> <b>body</b> scan on cigarette cravings and nicotine withdrawal symptoms in temporarily abstinent smokers. In light of evidence that a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support can result in even greater success rates than either strategy alone (Stead & Lancaster, 2012), study one was the first randomised placebo-controlled trial to examine how the body scan interacts with traditional nicotine replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the magnitude of an anti-placebo effect meant that neither the nicotine nor placebo patches had an effect on ratings of withdrawal symptoms and tobacco cravings. The results did however show that the body scan produced significant post intervention reductions relative to baseline, whilst unexpectedly finding that the control audio also yielded similar levels of efficacy. This cast doubt on the theory that the body scan reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms via the promotion of non-judgemental acceptance of thoughts and feelings, although the idea that both audio interventions acted as a form of cognitive distraction seemed more plausible. The secondary aim was therefore to explore whether cognitive distraction is a mechanism underlying the efficacy of the body scan, with study three comparing a <b>guided</b> <b>body</b> scan to two distraction tasks. The results indicated that relative to baseline, all three interventions produced reductions in withdrawal symptoms up to 10 minutes post task, however the body scan out performed the two distraction tasks in reducing the desire to smoke. This implies that whilst the processes associated with cigarette withdrawal might be vulnerable to disruption via cognitive distraction, the desire for a cigarette is less susceptible. Instead, the body scan may provide additional benefits via the moderation of negative affect or a relaxation response...|$|R
