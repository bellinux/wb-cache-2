50|$|Although less {{expensive}} mechanical debarkers were adequate for smaller logs harvested from young trees on redwood tree farms, hydraulic barkers remained in operation until all old growth trees had been harvested from company timberlands. The United States Environmental Protection Agency published <b>hydraulic</b> <b>barking</b> category effluent limitations in the 1970s. Wastewater discharged from debarking could average {{no more than}} 2.5 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and 12 pounds of total suspended solids (TSS) per thousand board feet of lumber produced (0.5 kg BOD and 2.3 kg TSS per cubic meter of lumber). Daily waste discharge rates could be three times as high as 30-day averages, but pH was required to remain between 6 and 9.|$|E
25|$|The Hacienda is {{significant}} for various reasons. First, it contains {{the only remaining}} example of the <b>Barker</b> <b>hydraulic</b> turbine, {{which was the first}} reaction type turbine ever made. It was nominated as a Mechanical Engineering landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in July 1994.|$|R
