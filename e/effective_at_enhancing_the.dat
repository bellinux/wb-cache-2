40|$|AbstractCold {{atmospheric}} plasma (CAP) {{treatment was}} used on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), a common articulating counter material employed in hip and knee replacements. UHMWPE is a biocompatible polymer with low friction coefficient, yet {{does not have}} robust wear characteristics. CAP effectively cross-links the polymer chains of the UHMWPE improving wear performance (Perni et al., Acta Biomater. 8 (3) (2012) 1357). In this work, interactions between CAP treated UHMWPE and spherical borosilicate sphere (representing model material for bone) were considered employing AFM technique. Adhesive forces increased, {{in the presence of}} PBS, after treatment with helium and helium/oxygen cold gas plasmas. Furthermore, a more hydrophilic surface of UHMWPE was observed after both treatments, determined through a reduction of up to a third in the contact angles of water. On the other hand, the asperity density also decreased by half, yet the asperity height had a three-fold decrease. This work shows that CAP treatment can be a very <b>effective</b> technique <b>at</b> <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> adhesion between bone and UHMWPE implant material as aided by the increased adhesion forces. Moreover, the hydrophilicity of the CAP treated UHMWPE can lead to proteins and cells adhesion {{to the surface of the}} implant stimulating osseointegration process...|$|R

General surgical procedures are associated with significant risk of precipitating VTE, and despite the surging evidences, it is often overlooked. The study attempted at estimating the prevalence of VTE and bleeding risk factors coupled with the adequacy of thromboprophylaxis administered. MethodologyThe study spanning 1 -year duration was executed through collection of data from patients older than 18 years, admitted to the general surgery department of a tertiary care hospital. The data were collected using internally validated data collection form and the appraisal of data was done using SPSS 18. ResultsAmong the 400 subjects enrolled, number of patients in low, moderate, and high risk, as per the Caprini score, was 24 %, 35 %, and 41 %, respectively, with the difference being significant with p< 0. 001. Bleeding risk was positive in 28 % subjects and 36 % received any form of prophylaxis other than early ambulation. 28 % subjects were identified to have received adequate thromboprophylaxis. ConclusionAlthough the prevalence of 41 % individuals {{at high risk for}} VTE is comparable to the global prevalence of 41. 5 %, prophylactic adequacy of 28 % was lower than the 33 % observed globally.

40|$|Objectives: Recent figures {{indicate}} that {{nearly a quarter}} of Australian adolescents are overweight or obese. Despite the well-established role of physical activity and healthy eating in reducing prevalence of obesity, there remains a lack of effective interventions that promote sustained behavior engagement. This paper aims to describe the theory-based integration and implementation of self-determination theory and goal setting theory in a family-based lifestyle intervention. Although these theories have been shown to independently predict motivation for behavior, a limited number of studies have described behavior-change techniques at a level to allow for effective evaluation and replication, and no studies have combined the theories in a healthy lifestyle behavior intervention. Methods: Behavior change techniques and the associated change mediators are described in relation to need-supportive environments provided by instructors and extended to parents in the home environment. Methods for motivating and promoting sustained engagement in adolescent physical activity and healthy eating and parent behaviors to support these lifestyle changes are discussed within the context of need-satisfaction and goal setting. Conclusions: This study will contribute to understanding processes for developing and implementing behavior-change techniques based on the integration of two theories of motivation. Future interventions aimed at promoting maintenance of physical activity and healthy eating behaviors in overweight and obese adolescents will benefit by being informed of which techniques are <b>effective</b> <b>at</b> <b>enhancing</b> motivation within <b>the</b> intervention context and home environment.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{addresses}} the fundamental role of expert evidence advanced {{in support of}} the defence of criminal incapacity. It was endeavoured to illustrate that the scientific entities of forensic psychiatry and psychology fulfil an essential and pivotal role in establishing and assessing the defence of criminal incapacity. The study proposed to illustrate the interaction between the professions of law and medicine on the backdrop of the defence of criminal incapacity. Recommendations were provided with <b>the</b> aim of <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> dialogue between the professions of law and medicine when the defence of criminal incapacity falls to be assessed. The study was approached from a dual dimensional perspective illustrating both the need for mental health experts as well as the need for adequately trained and experienced mental health experts to provide expert testimony as to an accused’s mental state when the defence of criminal incapacity is raised. The motivation for the current study is enumerated and the concepts of “criminal capacity”, “non-pathological criminal incapacity”, “pathological criminal incapacity” and “expert evidence” are, amongst others, conceptualized. It is indicated that expert evidence plays an essential role not only in cases where pathological criminal incapacity, or put differently, criminal incapacity attributable to mental illness or mental defect is raised, but also in instances where non-pathological criminal incapacity is raised as a defence. The role of the mental health expert is addressed with reference to battered woman syndrome evidence advanced {{in support of the}} defence of non-pathological criminal incapacity. It is illustrated that the defence of non-pathological criminal incapacity is in need of reform. It is in addition illustrated that legislative reform is essential to establish the defence of non-pathological criminal incapacity and to create legal certainty. The inconsistent approach in the application of expert evidence to the defence of criminal incapacity is emphasized with specific focus on the semantic distinction between the defences of non-pathological criminal incapacity and pathological criminal incapacity. The role and application of the DSM-IV in the definition and assessment of mental disorders is addressed in conjunction with the various obstacles associated with the application of the DSM-IV to the defence of criminal incapacity. The nature and scope of the basic rules of expert evidence as they would apply to mental health professionals acting as expert witnesses in support of the defence of criminal incapacity are addressed. The assessment of the probative value of expert evidence is addressed and the complexities associated therewith are espoused. The numerous ethical dilemmas faced by mental health experts are illustrated and recommendations are provided aimed at eliminating these dilemmas. A comparative study of selected principles pertaining to expert evidence in the United States of America is embarked upon to illustrate the need for a codification of the rules of expert evidence as well as <b>effective</b> guidelines aimed <b>at</b> <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> scientific reliability and validity of expert evidence advanced in support of the defence of criminal incapacity. Finally, conclusions are drawn and motivated recommendations are made. Law reform is proposed in the form of draft proposals for legislative reform in respect of the defence of criminal incapacity as well as a draft ethical code of conduct for mental health experts providing expert testimony in cases where the defence of criminal incapacity is raised.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is rapidly}} reshaping the server administration landscape. The {{widespread use of}} virtualization and the increasingly high server consolidation ratios, in particular, have introduced unprecedented security challenges for users, increasing the exposure to intrusions and opening up new opportunities for attacks. Deploying security mechanisms in the hypervisor to detect and stop intrusion attempts is a promising strategy to address this problem. Existing hypervisor-based solutions, however, are typically limited to very specific classes of attacks and introduce exceedingly high performance overhead for production use. In this paper, we present Slick (Storage-Level Intrusion ChecKer), an intrusion detection system (IDS) for virtualized storage devices. Slick detects intrusion attempts by efficiently and transparently monitoring write accesses to critical regions on storage devices. The low-overhead monitoring component operates entirely inside the hypervisor, with no introspection or modifications required in the guest VMs. Using Slick, users can deploy generic IDS rules to detect {{a broad range of}} real-world intrusions in a flexible and practical way. Experimental results confirm that Slick is <b>effective</b> <b>at</b> <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> security of virtualized servers, while imposing less than 5 % overhead in production...|$|E

Methods: The influence of fibers on the ultimate internal pressure capacity of a prestressed concrete containment vessel (PCCV) was investigated through {{a comparison of the}} ultimate pressure capacities between conventional and fiber-reinforced PCCVs. Steel and polyamide fibers were used. The tension behaviors of conventional concrete and fiber-reinforced concrete specimens were investigated through uniaxial tension tests and their tension-stiffening models were obtained. Results: For a PCCV reinforced with 1 % volume hooked-end steel fiber, the ultimate pressure capacity increased by approximately 12 % in comparison with that for a conventional PCCV. For a PCCV reinforced with 1. 5 % volume polyamide fiber, an increase of approximately 3 % was estimated for the ultimate pressure capacity.
