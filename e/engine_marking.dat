50|$|In September 2015, Porsche {{revealed}} {{the second generation}} of 991 Carrera models at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Both Carrera and Carrera S models break with previous tradition by featuring a 3.0 turbo-charged 6-cylinder boxer <b>engine,</b> <b>marking</b> {{the first time that}} a forced induction engine has been fitted to the base models within the 911 range.|$|E
50|$|The Bonneville and Catalina, {{already the}} smallest-selling of GM's B-body line, {{suffered}} a serious drop in demand following the economic recession {{that began in}} the spring of 1979. With that, GM decided to pull the plug {{at the end of the}} 1981 model year. Along with them went the 301 <b>engine,</b> <b>marking</b> the end of Pontiac V8s. From now on, the division would use Chevrolet engines.|$|E
50|$|The Daimler Sovereigns {{were based}} on {{contemporary}} Jaguar bodyshells, chassis and engines in an example of badge engineering. Jaguar Cars took over The Daimler Company in 1960 and the 1966 Sovereign was the second Daimler {{to be based on}} a Jaguar model. The first was the 2½ litre V8 with an engine designed by Edward Turner. Unlike the Daimler 2½ litre, the Sovereign had a Jaguar <b>engine,</b> <b>marking</b> the end for the Turner designed engines.|$|E

50|$|The Fiat 1400 was {{introduced}} at the 1950 Geneva Motor Show. It {{was the first}} unibody Fiat automobile. In 1953 {{the introduction of a}} diesel version with a 1900 cc <b>engine</b> <b>marked</b> another Fiat first, although the diesel version was known as the 1400 Diesel.|$|R
50|$|GM ceased {{production}} of the Northstar series in July 2010, with the final cars to receive it, the Cadillac DTS, Buick Lucerne, and Cadillac STS, rolling off the line in 2011. Newer Cadillac V8 models like the CTS-V use the GM LS small-block OHV <b>engine,</b> <b>marking</b> {{a return to a}} simpler push rod engine design. The North star has been plagued from the beginning with reliability issues, particularly head gaskets that fail when head bolts pull out of the block, allowing coolant to seep into the oil system. To exacerbate the situation, the entire engine must be completely removed to replace the head gasket, and a solution implemented to repair the head bolts. The cost to repair is usually upwards of $3000, and involves adding inserts (Normserts, timeserts) in the block to better grip the bolts. The LC3 supercharged variant, with its sealed deck design, has been largely immune from these issues. Cadillac implemented design changes throughout the Northstar's run (particularly 2000 and 2004), lengthening the head bolts and making the threads coarser, but even the 2004+ engines have experienced head gasket failures. The only way to bulletproof the engine is to tap deeper, drill extremely coarse threads, and stud the head to the block.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} mapping {{manufacture}} of BMW twelve-cylinder engines {{in accordance with}} current legislation. Thesis described the issue of engine construction and materials with respect to current requirements. Beginning of bachelor’s thesis {{is dedicated to the}} history od the BMW brand, especially to founders, first made vehicles and iconic vehicles. Carmaker has celebrated 25 years anniversary of V 12 engines in 2012. Third chapter is dedicated to <b>engine</b> <b>marking,</b> because <b>engine</b> <b>marking</b> is difficult to understand. The next chapter is the most comprehensive because it contains a list of engines, including their description and comparison with the competition. In addition to passenger vehicles is thesis briefly focused on sport cars engines and prototypes that were never been mass-produced. The last chapter is devoted to the used technique, primarily to variable valve timing and variable valve lift. Furthermore, it aims to High Precison Injection, Electronic throttle control valves, CAN-Bus and marginally also TwinPower Turbo. In conclusion of the thesis is list of sources, tables and pictures of all engines and pictures explaining used techniques...|$|E

25|$|After {{the attempt}} at making the first {{difference}} engine fell through, Babbage worked {{to design a}} more complex machine called the Analytical Engine. He hired C. G. Jarvis, who had previously worked for Clement as a draughtsman. The Analytical <b>Engine</b> <b>marks</b> the transition from mechanised arithmetic to fully-fledged general purpose computation. It is largely on it that Babbage's standing as computer pioneer rests.|$|R
50|$|Why these <b>Mark</b> <b>engines</b> (and other <b>Mark</b> <b>engines)</b> carried number names {{which were}} not {{horsepower}} ratings, not displacement numbers, and not consistent from one motor to another, is a real mystery. Why was the 20 hp Mercury a Mark 25, and the 40 hp Mercury a Mark 55, while the 30 hp job was the Mark 30? No one really knows.|$|R

25|$|An {{industrial}} revolution, {{especially in}} the production of paper, began on the Owendoher and Dodder rivers and many mills were erected. In the beginning of the 19th century most of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills. The introduction of steam <b>engines</b> <b>marked</b> the end of this era and replaced the need for mills. Many of the old buildings fell into disrepair and were demolished, and their millraces filled in.|$|R
50|$|The {{dawn of the}} {{internal}} combustion <b>engine</b> <b>marked</b> {{the beginning of a}} significant change in military engineering. With the arrival of the automobile {{at the end of the}} 19th century and heavier than air flight at the start of the 20th century, military engineers assumed a major new role in supporting the movement and deployment of these systems in war. Military engineers gained vast knowledge and experience in explosives. They were tasked with planting bombs, landmines and dynamite.|$|R

50|$|In 1964, Major met João Miguel dos Santos Simões {{who was at}} {{that time}} trying to get the various {{individual}} mill societies together. This {{led to the formation of}} The International Molinological Society in 1973, of which Major was a founder member. Major became chairman in 1977 and remained in that position until 1993. In 1970, Major's first book, Mills of the Isle of Wight was published. The publishing in 1978 of Animal-Powered <b>Engines</b> <b>marked</b> the first in-depth study of that subject.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a system}} consisting of multiple, relatively inexpensive <b>marking</b> <b>engines.</b> The <b>marking</b> <b>engines</b> are interconnected using highly reconfigurable paper paths. The paths {{are composed of}} hypermodules (bidirectional nip assemblies and sheet director assemblies) {{each of which has}} its own computation, sensing, actuation, and communications capabilities. Auto-identification is used to inform a system level controller of the potential paths through the system as well as module capabilities. Motion control of cut sheets, which of necessity reside physically within multiple hypermodules simultaneously, requires a new abstraction, namely a sheet controller which coordinates control of a given sheet as it moves through the system. Software/hardware co-design has provided a system architecture that is scalable without requiring user relearning. Here the capabilities are described of an exemplary system consisting of 160 modular entities and four <b>marking</b> <b>engines.</b> The throughput of the system is very nearly four times that of a single print engine...|$|R
50|$|The last DKW was the F102, {{coming into}} {{production}} in 1964 {{as a replacement}} for the old-looking AU1000. However, the F102 sold poorly - largely due to its two-stroke engine technology which was at the limit of its development, resulting in Auto Union's parent - Daimler-Benz, to offload the company to Volkswagen. The car was re-engineered with a four-stroke engine and relaunched under the resurrected Audi brand as the F103. The transition to four-stroke <b>engines</b> <b>marked</b> the end of the DKW marque for cars, and the rebirth of the Audi name.|$|R
5000|$|Blue Origin {{began work}} on the BE-4 in 2011.

Blue Origin did not {{announce}} the new engine to the public until September 2014. [...] In September 2014—in a choice labeled [...] "a stunner" [...] by Space News—the large US launch vehicle manufacturer and launch service provider United Launch Alliance selected the Blue BE-4 as the main engine for a new primary launch vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|After the Normandy landings, some Spitfires (Griffon and Merlin <b>engine</b> <b>marks)</b> were {{retained}} in Britain {{to counter the}} V-1 flying bomb offensive in mid-1944 {{as part of the}} ADGB. Supplies of a new aviation fuel, which was called [...] "150 Grade", arrived from America in March 1944 and sufficient quantities were available to be used by ADGB fighters as the V-1 offensive started. The new fuel enabled the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon engines to operate at higher boost pressures, especially at lower altitudes, {{for the duration of the}} anti-V-1 campaign.|$|R

50|$|Kew Bridge Pumping Station was {{originally}} opened in 1838 by the Grand Junction Waterworks Company, following {{a decision to}} close an earlier pumping station at Chelsea due to poor water quality. In the years up to 1944 the site expanded, ultimately housing six steam pumping engines as well as four Allen diesel pumps and four electric pump sets. The steam engines were retired from service in 1944, although two were kept on standby until 1958, when a demonstration run of the Harvey & Co. 100 inch <b>engine</b> <b>marked</b> the final time steam power would pump drinking water at the site.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the high pressure expansive <b>engine</b> <b>marked</b> a watershed {{in the evolution of}} steam power technology, allowing the attainment of major fuel economies. In Britain, Cornish engineers took the lead in the exploration of this specific technological trajectory. Notwithstanding its superior fuel efficiency was widely popularized, the high pressure expansive engine did not find widespread application in other steam-using regions (in particular in Lancashire), where the favourite option remained the Watt low pressure engine. In this paper, we provide a reassessment of the factors accounting for the precocious adoption of the high pressure steam engine in Cornwall and for its delayed fortune in the rest of Britain...|$|R
