5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, the block {{was home to}} one of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated on the block. By 1970, the block was densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad urban renewal initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the urban renewal effort a steady revenue stream and eminent domain authority.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{and moving}} out of their {{homeland}} in Scandinavia and northern Germany, the Germanic peoples had lived in today's Poland for several centuries, during which period many of their tribes also migrated out in the southern and eastern directions (see Wielbark culture). With {{the expansion of the}} Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under the Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to the <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for the safer and wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent.|$|E

5|$|Following from draft {{plans in}} August 2016, a new {{planning}} application was submitted by Interesting <b>Developments</b> <b>on</b> 16 January 2017 {{to convert the}} pub back into a house as it appeared around 1900, demolishing the 20th century extensions and modifications and restoring historic features such as the interior fireplaces and the oculus window, A separate part to the planning application included three two-storey two-bedroom terraced houses to be constructed on the pub garden, along with a redesigned and landscaped car park to include a charging station. An additional house {{to the rear of}} the pub was considered but not proposed; campaigners criticised the absence of plans to preserve some historic features, the partial demolition of the building and the proximity of the new buildings. Despite objections, planning permission was granted by Medway Council on 13 June 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 Pracheachon's spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk {{for failing}} to tackle inflation, unemployment, and {{corruption}} in the country. Non Suon's criticisms gave Sihanouk the impetus to arrest Pracheachon leaders, and according to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local political <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> behalf of foreign powers. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon's secretary-general, disappeared, and its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. However, Sihanouk allowed Sangkum's left-wing politicians to run again in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.|$|E

5|$|Noel Park {{in north}} London is a planned {{community}} {{developed in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries consisting of 2,200 model dwellings, designed by Rowland Plumbe.

It is one of four <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> the outskirts of London built by the Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company). From 2003 to sometime in 2009, the name was also given to a small park near the southern edge of Noel Park, formerly known– and now known again– as Russell Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{artillery}} fire progressively intensified until 23 June, while the RSK mobilised and counterattacked against the HV {{positions at the}} Miljevci Plateau. However, the mobilisation yielded only 227 additional troops, and the counterattack failed. An UNPROFOR assessment concluded the situation might deteriorate further and engulf all of the pink zones. To address the situation, UNPROFOR military commander Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar met with Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Milan Ramljak and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia General Anton Tus in Zagreb the same day, {{in order to discuss}} the <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> the Miljevci Plateau. Skirmishes continued on 24 June, accompanied by some {{artillery fire}}. Morale of the RSK troops plummeted though, causing a TO garrison based in nearby Trbounj to abandon its barracks.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} these {{religious}} <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written during the coming centuries. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanuja exists in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the later Kingdom of Mysore wrote Vaishnavite works upholding the teachings of Ramanuja. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. The later saints of Madhvacharya's order, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraja, Vadiraja Tirtha and devotees (dasa) such as Vijaya Dasa, Gopaladasa and others from the Karnataka region spread his teachings far and wide. His teachings inspired later philosophers like Vallabha in Gujarat and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal. Another wave of devotion (bhakti) in the 17th century–18th century found inspiration in his teachings.|$|E

5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} these {{religious}} <b>developments</b> <b>on</b> the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of metaphysics and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written over the next centuries. Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, {{and a host of}} Basavanna's followers, including Chenna Basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, and Kondaguli Kesiraja wrote hundreds of poems called Vachanas in praise of Lord Shiva. The esteemed scholars in the Hoysala court, Harihara and Raghavanka, were Virashaivas. This tradition continued into the Vijayanagar empire with such well-known scholars as Singiraja, Mallanarya, Lakkana Dandesa and other prolific writers of Virashaiva literature. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanujacharya exists today in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the succeeding Mysore Kingdom wrote Vaishnavite works supporting the teachings of Ramanujacharya. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism.|$|E

30|$|Overall {{this study}} {{examines}} the role of financial <b>development</b> <b>on</b> corporate investment {{in terms of their}} influence on financing constraints and isolated effect of financial <b>development</b> <b>on</b> corporate investment. This study also tries to test whether the effect of financial <b>development</b> <b>on</b> the investment-cash flow sensitivity depends on the period of study, size of the firm, financial constraints and group affiliation of the firm. The data set consists of 617 firms during 1999 – 2014. We estimate the impact of financial sector <b>development</b> <b>on</b> the investment-cash flow sensitivity by using the system-generalized method of moments (GMM). The major findings of the paper are: (i) Financial development reduces the financial constraints faced by the firm, thereby, declines the investment-cash flow sensitivity and have positive impact on corporate investment. (ii) The effect of the financial <b>development</b> <b>on</b> financial constraints is more (less) during (before) the crisis period and for the firms which pay low (high) dividends and also, the individual effect of financial development is more for low dividend paying firms and during the crisis period. (iii) The effect of the financial <b>development</b> <b>on</b> financial constraints is stronger for smaller and standalone firms than the larger and group affiliated firms and also, financial development have its positive impact on corporate investment across the firm size and ownership style such as group afflation.|$|R
