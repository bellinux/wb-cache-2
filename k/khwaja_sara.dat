As most of Pakistan's official government and business documents are in English, the term [...] "third gender" [...] has been chosen to represent individuals (either male or female, neither, and/or both) that identify themselves as, transsexual, [...] transgender person, cross-dresser (zenana in Urdu), transvestite, and eunuchs (narnbans in Urdu). In June 2009, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered a census of khawaja sara, who number between 80,000 and 300,000 in Pakistan. In December 2009, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the Chief Justice of Pakistan, ordered that the National Database and Registration Authority issue national identity cards {{to members of the}} community showing their distinct gender.

Some of these attained high-status positions in society. An early {{example of such a}} high-ranking eunuch was Malik Kafur, a Hindu boy captured and enslaved (along {{with tens of thousands of}} other Hindus who were typically captured during such raids), during the raids of the Delhi Sultanate into Gujarat. Eunuchs in Imperial palaces were organized in a hierarchy, often with a senior or Chief Eunuch (Urdu: <b>Khwaja</b> <b>Saras),</b> directing junior eunuchs below him. Eunuchs were highly valued for their strength and trustworthiness, allowing them to live amongst women with fewer worries. This enabled eunuchs to serve as messengers, watchmen, attendants and guards for palaces. Often, eunuchs also doubled as part of the King's court of advisers.|$|R

Murad (which means desire; the English title was Eunuch's Motherhood), was an award-winning biographical Telefilm drama made by Evergreen Media Europe for Pakistan's television channel Indus TV that aired in 2003. The cast had the country's top male television actors playing [...] "hijras": Sohail Asghar, Nabeel, Qazi Wajid, Kamran Jilani.

She has sent him away to live at a hostel so she can earn a living as a dancer, after her son gets cross with her, due to teasing (verbal and sexual) they face while dancing. This {{was the first time that}} influential male actors came out to support [...] "hijra" [...] rights during interviews; noting that in Pakistani English at that time eunuch was the term to describe a transgender person, and [...] "khwaja sara" [...] (also khwaja sira) had not yet replaced what is now considered a derogatory term due to decades of heckling and name calling, [...] "hijra".

The story involves a young lady who is arranged to marry. It turns out her husband is transgender. The story unfolds trans community and their deprived and isolated world. It portrays eloquently how they, too, are not far away from the human emotions and feelings and their world not much different from the heterosexual community. Even though they are in plain sight, they are tthey are taboo subjects and are not taken seriously. This makes them suffer endlessly in silence wrapped in slurs. The 33-episode series therefore touches on transgender abuse, women abuse, poverty, immorality of arranged marriages, and child abuse.
