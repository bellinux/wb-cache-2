50|$|Bay al-salam- It’s {{similar to}} a forward {{contract}} where the buyer pays in advance for the delivery of raw materials or <b>fungible</b> <b>goods</b> at a given date. The spot price of the item includes the profit {{of the person who}} has taken the task of purchasing good and, of course, the cost of the product.|$|E
50|$|Establishing {{chain of}} custody is made of both a chronological and logical procedure, {{especially}} important when the evidence consists of <b>fungible</b> <b>goods.</b> In practice, this most often applies to illegal drugs which have been seized by law enforcement personnel. In such cases, the defendant at times disclaims any knowledge of possession of the controlled substance in question. Accordingly, the {{chain of custody}} documentation and testimony is presented by the prosecution to establish that the substance in evidence was in fact {{in the possession of}} the defendant.|$|E
50|$|Resale price {{maintenance}} prevents resellers from competing too fiercely on price, {{especially with regard}} to <b>fungible</b> <b>goods.</b> Otherwise, resellers worry it could drive down profits for themselves {{as well as for the}} manufacturer. Some argue that the manufacturer may do this because it wishes to keep resellers profitable, thus keeping the manufacturer profitable. Others contend that minimum resale {{price maintenance}}, for instance, overcomes a failure in the market for distributional services by ensuring that distributors who invest in promoting the manufacturer's product are able to recoup the additional costs of such promotion in the price that they charge consumers.|$|E
50|$|A mutuum was a {{loan for}} consumption. It {{was the oldest}} {{contract}} in re, growing in importance after 326 BC when the lex Poetalia was passed. It {{could be used by}} people without the right of commercium - a package of rights to participate in the ius civile and to undertake remedies. It involved the delivery of certain types of <b>fungible</b> <b>goods,</b> such as money, food, and drink. Ownership was transferred, as was possession. In a strict sense then, because ownership passed, it should not be considered a loan. The mutuum obliged the borrower not to return the thing itself, because its use would involve consumption, but a similar thing in quantity, quality and size.|$|E
40|$|There is pessimism {{about the}} {{manufacturing}} industry in Japan. The Japanese electronics industry, especially, {{has been seen}} as losing its competitive advantage, especially by comparison with South Korean and Chinese products. However, evaluating manufacturing competitiveness is not only a factor of total sales or end-product market share. Measures should also consider the uniqueness of products, such as non fungible production and manufacturing process (custom-made products and processes). Japanese end-product manufacturers such as Sony or Panasonic are losing competitiveness in the market, while industrial component suppliers, which mostly manufacture automotive and electronics intermediate products, have been developing strong relationships and networks. There has not been much research into Japanese intermediate component suppliers and their manufacturing capability. This study proposes that the future trend of Japanese manufacturing competitiveness is in transforming from end-products to intermediate components, and seeks to empirically prove that the key to this transformation is the suppliers ’ ability to produce non <b>fungible</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|E
