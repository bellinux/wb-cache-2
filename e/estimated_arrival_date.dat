40|$|Amazon's {{desire to}} provide the "Earth's largest selection" comes at a {{tremendous}} cost. In addition to managing the orders for thousands of vendors/suppliers and millions of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), Amazon must keep track of all the inbound shipments in order to manage its inventory efficiently. Although estimated delivery dates are routinely received {{for each of these}} inbound shipments, only about half of the purchase orders actually arrives by these dates. Since knowing exactly how much to order is based in part by what has already been ordered in the past and when those shipments will arrive, this inaccuracy makes determining optimal purchase order quantities difficult for future orders. So in order to optimize the inbound process, Amazon must either improve the accuracy of these estimates or account for the inherent variation. This thesis establishes a model that exposes the underlying variation for each inbound arrival signal based on historical error rates. Our approach is to map all inbound signal sources and then create a classification-tr-e model that minimizes the joint variance of the prediction errors. Simulations indicate that such a model can be used to generate new <b>estimated</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> that reflect the likelihood of arrival. In addition, this thesis also takes a step further to outline some potential vendor policy changes for eliminating the root causes of procurement lead time variance. by Michael Chun. Thesis: M. B.

40|$|The Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus) is a loosely colonial (Graul 1975) upland shorebird that breeds {{across the}} xeric tablelands {{of the western}} Great Plains and shortgrass prairie {{ecoregion}} of North America (Knopf and Wunder 2006). This is a species of conservation concern throughout its range because of apparent range-wide population declines (Knopf and Wunder 2006). The U. S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (USSCP) recently classified the species as globally highly imperiled (Brown et al. 2001; USSCP 2004). Reasons for the decline of Mountain Plovers are not fully understood. Habitat destruction and the tendency of the species to nest in agricultural fields, where nests may be susceptible to destruction from agricultural practices, {{have been identified as}} possible causes (Shackford et al. 1999, Dreitz 2005, Knopf and Wunder 2006). In 2002 the Nebraska Prairie Partners (NPP), a cooperative partnership between the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory (RMBO) and Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (NGPC), initiated a project to identify the extent of the breeding distribution and population size of Mountain Plover in Nebraska. The NPP made a concerted effort to gain access to private lands in the southwestern panhandle before initiating systematic research and monitoring activities focused on Mountain Plover ecology. Specific monitoring activities included roadside surveys, early spring visual checks in areas where plover were found in previous years, and monitoring nests in agricultural fields (nest marking) throughout May and June of most years. In addition, surveys of randomly selected 200 x 200 meter patches (patch surveys) were conducted in late April and May of the 2004 – 2007 field seasons. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an updated, descriptive assessment of Mountain Plover in Nebraska. We base our conclusions on six years (2002 – 2007) of Mountain Plover monitoring data in the southwestern panhandle of Nebraska. We reviewed data collected from our monitoring activities to reassess the status of Mountain Plover in Nebraska including (1) <b>estimated</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of spring migrants and departure dates of fall migrants, (2) nesting chronology and time intervals of peak nesting activity, and (3) a general distribution of breeding Mountain Plovers in the southwest panhandle...|$|R

DALP-TS allows exploration of solutions with <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> outside the acceptable region by applying penalties to these violations.

DALP-TS utilizes a similar approach by penalizing both early and late arrivals; however, rather than utilizing the required delivery date, DALP-TS considers the more restrictive latest <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> Pallets arriving prior to their earliest <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> incur a penalty equal to the difference between the earliest <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> multiplied by the pallet weight and a scaling factor, which is detailed in Sect.  4.5. 5.

40|$|Animals {{adjust to}} {{seasonal}} challenges in physical, behavioural and spatial ways. Such adjustments are {{commonly associated with}} diet changes that often can be characterised isotopically. We introduce the 'double diet switch model', with which the occurrence and timing of two subsequent diet switches of an individual animal can be traced with a single sample assayed for stable isotopes. We demonstrate the model for Sanderling, Calidris alba, a small shorebird that migrates from the Nearctic tundra breeding grounds to the intertidal flats of the Wadden Sea; during this migration some birds may stage in the North Atlantic areas. The 'double diet switch model' successfully predicted the occurrence and timing of two diet switches in 59 Sanderlings captured in the Wadden Sea in July-September. Excluding birds that likely had over-summered at North Atlantic staging areas, the model predicted that Sanderlings departed from the Arctic on 13 July (range: 9 - 17 July), had a staging duration of 18 · 6 days in the North Atlantic, and arrived in the Wadden Sea on 1 August (31 July- 1 August). The estimated mean Arctic departure dates coincided with the mean hatching date, suggesting that many individuals failed to produce young or left the care to a partner. <b>Estimated</b> mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> matched the main arrival period in the Wadden Sea obtained from observation data. In this study we did not use lipid-free tissues, which may bias model predictions. After correcting for lipid components, the estimated departure date was 11 days later and the staging duration 8 · 5 days shorter, while <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> was similar. The 'double diet switch model' successfully identified the occurrence and timing of two subsequent diet switches. The 'double diet switch model' will not only apply to switches between three isotopic levels (as in the case study on Sanderling) but also to scenarios where the second switch reverses to the initial isotopic level. Due to this general applicability, the model {{can be adapted to}} a wide range of taxa and situations. Foreseeable applications include changes in habitat and food type, ontogenetic development or drastic phenotypic changes such as the metamorphosis in insects and amphibians...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of long-distance {{migratory birds}} {{is assumed to}} partly be {{under the influence of}} genes, as demonstrated by selection experiments. Furthermore, competition for early arrival among males may lead to condition-dependent migration associated with fitness benefits of early arrival achieved by individuals in prime condition. Here I present field data on the repeatability and the heritability of <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> in a trans-equatorial migratory bird, the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, and I test for a genetic correlation between <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and the expression of a condition-dependent secondary sexual character.

40|$|Abstract Phenology is an {{important}} part of life history that is gaining increased attention because of recent climate change. We use game theory to model phenological adaptation in migratory birds that compete for territories at their breeding grounds. We investigate how the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the timing of arrival is affected by changes in the onset of spring, the timing of the resource peak, and the season length. We compare the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> with the environmental optimum, that is, the mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> that maximizes fitness in the absence of competition. When competition is strong, the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> responds less than the environmental optimum to shifts in the resource peak but more to changes in the onset of spring. Increased season length may not necessarily affect the environmental optimum but can still advance the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> Conversely, shifting a narrow resource distribution may change the environmental optimum without affecting the ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> The ESS mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and the environmental optimum may even shift in different directions. Hence, treating phenology as an evolutionary game rather than an optimization problem fundamentally changes what we predict to be an adaptive response to environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the benefits of}} early <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of migratory birds, a hidden and often ignored component of males 2 ̆ 7 fitness is the higher chance of early-arriving birds to obtain extra-pair fertilizations. Here we investigated how extra-pair paternity might affect the relationship between male <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and number of fertilizations in a model study system, the European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. For this purpose, we sampled and genotyped breeding pairs, unpaired males and offspring (including embryos from unhatched eggs when possible) of a Dutch pied flycatcher population. Detailed information on <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of males, egg laying date of their social mates and nest success was also recorded. Early-arriving males had early-laying females and males with early-laying females had a higher probability of siring extra-pair eggs and obtain more fertilizations. However, male <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> alone did not correlate with the probability to gain extra-pair paternity and neither {{to the amount of}} fertilized eggs. Both early- and late-arriving males had a higher probability of losing paternity in their own nest compared to birds with an intermediate <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> Finally, late-arriving males were more likely to remain unpaired but, interestingly, a few of these birds obtained paternity via extra-pair copulations. Because earlier <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> did not lead to more extra-pair fertilizations and because such relationship seems to be driven mainly by the female 2 ̆ 7 s laying date, we conclude that the contribution of extra-pair paternity to the overall fitness benefits of early male <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> is relatively small...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} novel {{hypothesis}} that <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> in migratory birds represents a reliable indicator of male quality {{that can be}} used by females as a cue in extrapair mating decisions. Secondary sexual characters are often condition-dependent, and competition for early arrival leads to condition-dependent migration. Hence, both secondary sexual characters and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> are predicted to be condition-dependent indicators of male phenotypic quality. We studied the relationship between expression of a secondary sexual character, <b>arrival</b> <b>date,</b> and condition, respectively, and extrapair paternity in a Spanish population of barn swallows, Hirundo rustica. By using microsatellite markers to determine paternity, we showed that 17. 8 % of all offspring (N = 674) and 32. 4 % of all broods (N = 170) were due to extrapair paternity. Quasi-parasitism (in which the male nest owner fathered the offspring, but the eggs were laid by another female) occurred in 2. 6 % of all nestlings and 2. 9 % of all broods. Individuals were consistent in the frequency of extrapair paternity among first, second, and third broods. Males with long outermost tail feathers, arriving early and in prime body condition, had little extrapair paternity in their nests. This was also the case when controlling for the confounding effects of male age. Partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of tail length, <b>arrival</b> <b>date,</b> and body condition on extrapair paternity. Body condition accounted for most of the variance in extrapair paternity, whereas tail length and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> accounted for a smaller proportion of the variance. Body condition was strongly correlated with tail length and <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> However, because females cannot directly assess condition or <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> (males arrive before females), females may obtain an indirect measure of condition and migration ability from tail length and other phenotypic traits of males. This suggests that extrapair paternity depends on the effects of condition, through its indirect effects on <b>arrival</b> <b>date,</b> tail length, and other variables. Copyright 2003. ...|$|R

40|$|Timing {{of arrival}} in long-distance {{migration}} could have fitness consequences: arrival too early impairs survival chances, whereas arrival too late reduces current reproductive success. Evolution thus may have favoured a phenotype that {{arrived at the}} optimal time. However, individuals within populations of long-distance migrant species arrive over a considerable time span, and often show consistency in whether they are early or late. This repeatability in arrival varies between studies, and we hypothesise it {{to be affected by}} conditions encountered en route or in winter. Here we report on the spring <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca to their Dutch breeding sites during eight consecutive years. Our field <b>estimates</b> of <b>arrival</b> were highly accurate, as validated by geolocator data on 13 individuals. Years differed in mean <b>arrival</b> <b>dates.</b> Within years and sexes, <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> generally spanned more than two weeks. First-year individuals arrived on average 4 - 5 days later than older individuals. Using repeated <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of more than 500 individuals we show that (1) the overall arrival repeatabilities were similar for females and males, (2) arrival repeatabilities varied temporally, with individuals in consecutive years having sometimes moderate (R = 0. 2) and sometimes rather high (> 0. 40) repeatabilities, and (3) individual females arrived later in their first than in their second year. In females, repeatabilities of <b>arrival</b> and laying <b>dates</b> were similar. We hypothesize that individual flycatchers have a high individual consistency in their spring migration departure date from the wintering grounds. However, previous studies suggest the expression of this individual schedule to be affected by environmental circumstances at the wintering grounds or by what is encountered en route, determining whether this variation is still present at arrival on the breeding grounds. Sexes seemed to differ in this respect, as year-to-year variation in repeatabilities of timing was explained by individual consistency in females, but not in males.

The study species included 1 raptor, 3 waders and 5 passerines.

For a shorebird population that has significantly advanced migration in recent decades, we show that individual <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> are highly consistent between years, but that the <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of new recruits to the population are significantly earlier now than in previous years. Several mechanisms could drive {{advances in}} recruit arrival, none of which require individual plasticity or rapid evolution of migration timings. In particular, advances in nest-laying dates could result in advanced recruit arrival, if benefits of early hatching facilitate early subsequent spring migration.

40|$|In migratory birds, <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and {{hatching}} date are two key phenological markers {{that have}} responded to global warming. A body of knowledge exists relating these traits to evolutionary pressures. In this study, we formalize this knowledge into general mathematical assumptions, and use them in an ecoevolutionary model. In contrast to previous models, this study novelty accounts for both traits-arrival date and hatching date-and the interdependence between them, revealing when one, the other or both will respond to climate. For all models sharing the assumptions, the following phenological responses will occur. First, if the nestling-prey peak is late enough, hatching is synchronous with, and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> evolves independently of, prey phenology. Second, when resource availability constrains {{the length of the}} pre-laying period, hatching is adaptively asynchronous with prey phenology.

40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{advanced}} the phenology of many organisms. Migratory animals face particular problems because {{climate change in}} the breeding and the wintering range may be asynchronous, preventing rapid response to changing conditions. Advancement in timing of spring migration may have carry-over effects {{to other parts of}} the annual cycle, simply because advancement of one event in the annual cycle also advances subsequent events, gradually causing a general shift in the timing of the entire annual cycle. Such a phenotypic shift could generate accumulating effects over the years for individuals, but also across generations. Here we test this novel hypothesis of phenotypic response to climate change by using long-term data on the Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea. Mean breeding date advanced by almost three weeks during the last 70 years. Annual <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> at the breeding grounds during a period of 47 years was predicted by environmental conditions in the winter quarters in the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic and by mean breeding date the previous year.

Learning affected <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> as shown by a positive correlation between <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> in year (i + 1) relative to breeding date in year (i) and the selective advantage of early breeding in year (i). This provides a mechanism for changes in <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> being adjusted to changing environmental conditions. This study suggests that adaptation to changing climatic conditions can be achieved through learning from year to yea...|$|R
40|$|As a {{response}} to climate warming, many animals and plants {{have been found to}} shift phenologies, such as appearance in spring or timing of reproduction. However, traditional measures for shifts in phenology that are based on observational data likely are biased due to a large influence of population size, observational effort, starting date of a survey, or other causes that may affect the probability of detecting a species. Understanding phenological responses of species to climate change, however, requires a robust measure that could be compared among studies and study years. Here, we developed a new method for <b>estimating</b> <b>arrival</b> and departure <b>dates</b> based on site-occupancy models. Using simulated data, we show that our method provided virtually unbiased estimates of phenological events even if detection probability or the number of sites occupied by the species is changing over time. To illustrate the flexibility of our method, we analyzed spring arrival of two long-distance migrant songbirds and the length of the flight period of two butterfly species, using data from a long-term biodiversity monitoring program in Switzerland. In contrast to many birds that migrate short distances, the two long-distance migrant songbirds tended to postpone average spring arrival by ∼ 0. 5 days per year between 1995 and 2012. Furthermore, the flight period of the short-distance-flying butterfly species apparently became even shorter over the study period, while the flight period of the longer-distance-flying butterfly species remained relatively stable. Our method could be applied to temporally and spatially extensive data {{from a wide range of}} monitoring programs and citizen science projects, to help unravel how species and communities respond to global warming...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{changes in}} {{migration}} distances and propensity for migration associated with climate change {{have suggested that}} these traits can evolve rapidly. Part of this rapid response to selection {{may be due to}} maternal effects that facilitate changes in the underlying physiology of migration. We hypothesize that exposure to large amounts of antioxidants in the egg will facilitate assimilation and metabolism of dietary antioxidants later in life, thereby allowing offspring to better cope with extreme strenuous exercise such as the bursts of rapid migration shown during spring migration. We tested the relationship between temporal change in mean <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of migratory birds since 1960 and concentrations of 2 antioxidants in the eggs of 14 species of birds. Only egg concentration of vitamin E {{was a significant predictor of}} advancement in spring <b>arrival</b> <b>date.</b> Furthermore, we experimentally manipulated egg content of vitamin E in barn swallows Hirundo rustica and subsequently recorded <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> of yearling male recruits. <b>Arrival</b> <b>date</b> advanced significantly by > 1 standard deviation due to treatment, providing experimental evidence for a relationship between egg concentration of vitamin E and subsequent migration behavior. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal effects have played an important role in the evolution of bird migration...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change can}} benefit {{individual}} species, but when pest species are enhanced by warmer temperatures agricultural productivity may be placed at greater risk. We analyzed {{the effects of}} temperature anomaly on <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> and infestation severity of potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae Harris, a classic new world long distance migrant, and a significant pest in several agricultural crops. We compiled E. fabae <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> and infestation severity data at different states in USA from existing literature reviews and agricultural extension records from 1951 - 2012, and examined the influence of temperature anomalies at each target state or overwintering range on the <b>date</b> of <b>arrival</b> and severity of infestation. Average E. fabae <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> at different states reveal a clear trend along the south-north axis, with earliest arrival closest to the overwintering range. E. fabae arrival has advanced by 10 days over the last 62 years. E. fabae arrived earlier in warmer years in relation to each target state level temperature anomaly (3. 0 days / °C increase in temperature anomaly). Increased temperature had a significant and {{positive effect on the}} severity of infestation, and <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> had a marginal negative effect on severity. These relationships suggest that continued warming could advance the time of E. fabae colonization and increase their impact on affected crops...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization has {{a marked}} {{effect on the}} {{reproduction}} and other ecological and behavioural traits of many living organisms, including birds. In migrant birds, survival and reproductive output {{is influenced by the}} (mis) synchronization of arrival with the availability of resources. Many recent studies have shown that arrival timing is related to temperatures en-route and at destination. Because urban areas are "heat islands", with higher temperatures that influence earlier vegetation and invertebrate development, this should favour earlier arrival of migrant birds to cities rather than to rural areas. In this paper, we analysed differences between urban and rural habitats in mean dates and trends of first <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of 18 species of migratory bird species in western Poland during 1983 - 2010. For many individual species, and overall, mean first <b>arrival</b> <b>date</b> was significantly earlier in rural areas than in urban areas (significant for 11 species). However, the trend towards earlier first <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> was stronger in urban areas for 15 of the 18 species (significantly stronger in four species). Consequently, <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> in urban areas are fast approaching, or have now matched or passed those in rural areas. These findings suggest that recent environmental changes may have more rapidly changed the migratory habits of birds occupying urban habitats than those occupying rural habitats...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the spring}} <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of migrant birds have been {{reported}} {{from a range of}} locations and many authors have focused on long-term trends and their relationship to temperature and other climatic events. Perhaps more importantly, changed <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> may have consequences for the breeding dates of birds which strongly influence breeding success. In this paper we take the opportunity provided by a monitoring scheme of the white stork (Ciconia ciconia) to examine several features of the timing of arrival and breeding in relation to chick production in Slovakia during the period 1978 – 2002. First <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> ranged from 5 th March to 30 th April, and hatching dates varied between 26 th April and 8 th July. Generally, early arriving pairs started breeding earlier and a shorter interval between the arrival of the first partner and breeding, expressed here as hatching date, resulted in higher breeding success...|$|R
