5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell <b>demand</b> <b>response</b> services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E

25|$|Demand-Side Management (DSM) {{consists}} of the implementation of different policies and measures that serve to influence the demand for a product. When talking about electricity, it {{is often referred to}} as Conservation and Demand Management (C or CDM), as it aims to reduce electricity demand, either by using more efficient technologies or by changing wasteful habits. C also addresses reductions in peak demand via <b>Demand</b> <b>Response</b> (DR) programs. <b>Demand</b> <b>Response</b> does not lower total electricity demand; rather, it shifts demand out of the peak times.|$|E

25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. <b>Demand</b> <b>response</b> may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E

Whole-electricity System Investment Model is a holistic and comprehensive electricity system analysis model, which simultaneously optimises the long-term investment decisions against real-time operation decisions {{taking into account the}} flexibility provided by demand. The optimisation considers the impact of <b>demand</b> side <b>response</b> across all power subsystems, i. e. generation, transmission and distribution systems, in a coordinated fashion. This allows the model to capture the potential conflicts and synergies between different applications of <b>demand</b> side <b>response</b> in supporting particularly intermittency management at the national level, improving capacity margin, and minimising the cost of electrification.

40|$|Abstract: Heterogeneity in {{consumer}} behaviour creates differences in <b>demand</b> <b>responses,</b> which may create problems with aggregation across consumers. If aggregation problems exist, results from estimation based on aggregate data may prove difficult to interpret. Using estimation results from micro data to predict aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>responses</b> may also create disaggregation bias (the reverse aggregation problem). The {{aim of this}} paper is to discuss potential problems of using micro data to predict aggregate demand, and how such problems relate to the linear and non-linear aggregation problem. We also expand the theories of linear and non-linear aggregation to the case in which prices vary across agents. We formulate and test criteria for aggregation by using data on Norwegian household electricity consumption. We find clear evidence of aggregation problems, as heterogeneity in both price and income derivatives are significant. We thus expect to experience problems with aggregation when analysing Norwegian household electricity consumption. Keywords: Aggregation problems, Electricity demand, Microeconometric...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyse and compare short-run factor <b>demand</b> <b>responses</b> to price changes in the primary {{aluminium}} industry in Western Europe and the Africa-Middle East (AME) region. We outline a Translog variable cost function model, which is estimated employing a panel data set at the individual smelter level over the time period 1990 - 2003. The empirical results show evidence of limited - but far from insignificant - price-induced factor <b>demand</b> <b>responses</b> in the short-run. Overall aluminium smelters in the AME-region show evidence of higher estimated short-run own- and cross-price elasticities than their competitors in Western Europe, at least {{when it comes to}} labour and electricity demand. One important reason for this result is the greater number of pot lines with slightly different technologies at each smelter as well as the more intense use of the Prebake technology in the AME-region making retrofits in existing plants less costly than in Western Europe. The results also suggest that in both regions the demand for electricity has over time become less sensitive to short-run price changes, while the labour and material <b>demand</b> <b>responses</b> to price changes have increased but only in the AME-region. The liberalisation of the Western European electricity markets in combination with the rigid labour markets {{in this part of the}} world suggest that the shift in production capacity from the western world to the AME-region as well as China may continue.

Results show inelastic piped water <b>demand</b> <b>responses</b> for all rate structures at historically low prices similar to findings from a prior econometric study for Amman. However, piped water demand turns more elastic when prices rise above $ 0. 50 /m 3 with uniform rates showing the most elastic response.

They also illustrate trade-offs among rate structures and rate structure components for key rate-setting objectives such as to encourage water conservation, recover costs, promote efficiency, and more equitably allocate costs among users...|$|R
