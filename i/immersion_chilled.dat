40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine effects of carcass electrical stimulation and alternative carcass chilling methods on texture and yield of early-harvested boneless broiler-breast fillets. New York dressed broiler carcasses were electrically stimulated for 90 s immediately after defeathering. Control carcasses were held similarly for 90 s but not stimulated. After evisceration, half the stimulated and half the control carcasses were chilled for 3 h in ice-water (extended <b>immersion</b> <b>chilled).</b> Remaining carcasses were chilled in ice-water for 1 h and then stored for an additional 2 h (conventionally chilled). Breast fillets (Pectoralis major muscles) were manually harvested immediately after chilling (3. 5 h post-mortem). After weighing and overnight storage, all muscles were cooked and evaluated for shear values and cooked yields. Fillets from stimulated carcasses required significantly less force to shear and exhibited greater cooked yields than those from non-stimulated carcasses. Fillets from conventionally chilled carcasses exhibited greater yield than those from extended chilled carcasses, but chilling method did not affect shear values...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler {{carcasses}} lost greater weight when stored 4 {{days than}} when stored 1 or 3 days and lost greater weight after 6 and 8 days than after 4 days, particularly at high refrigerated storage temperatures. Carcasses stored at —. 5 C (31 F) lost significantly less weight than those stored above the freezing point of water. Whole carcasses lost significantly less weight than did cut-up carcasses. Carbon dioxide (C 02) -chilled carcasses lost less weight than did standard-immersion-chilled carcasses, because {{they picked up}} less water in the chilling process. The superficial freezing on C 02 -chilled carcasses delayed microbial growth and resulted in slightly longer shelf-life of C 02 -chilled carcasses than of those <b>immersion</b> <b>chilled,</b> particularly when comparisons were at higher refrigerated storage temperatures. Carcasses stored at 3. 9 C (39 F) had strong off odors by about 9 days of storage; at 1. 0 C (34 F) by about 14 days; and at- 2. 2 C (28 F) by about 35 days. Whole carcasses without giblets had a longer shelf-life than did cut-up carcasses, but whole carcasses stuffed with giblet packs had a shorter shelf-life than did cut-up carcasses...|$|E

40|$|One {{objective}} of the present investigation was to compare Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery incidence from commercially processed turkeys immediately prior to and following pre-chill and <b>immersion</b> <b>chiller</b> intervention strategies being used in three distinct turkey processing facilities. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 100 carcass rinse samples prior to and following each post-evisceration, pre-chill intervention and following <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Two of three plants demonstrated a trend of decreased Salmonella on carcasses following the Inside Outside Bird Wash (IOBW), with reductions of 13 %, and 11 % being observed for Plants 1 and 2, respectively. Results for reductions of Campylobacter contamination were not as straightforward, with only Plant 3 showing decreased levels (11 % reduction) following the IOBW. Plant 2 used an additional pre-chill intervention, a low pressure, acetic acid final wash, which was not shown {{to be effective in}} causing an additional reduction in either Salmonella or Campylobacter on carcasses. In all three plants, properly managed <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> systems were the most effective microbial intervention for achieving Salmonella andCampylobacter reduction on processed turkey carcasses. While not as effective, the IOBW present in each plant likely contributed to the effectiveness of <b>immersion</b> <b>chiller</b> interventions. If managed properly these intervention points have demonstrated themselves as a viable means to effectively reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter on processed turkeys. Another objective was to modify the scalder environment to an alkaline pH and determine the effects of thermal killing of Salmonella and Campylobacter. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 50 carcass rinse samples prior to and following scald tank immersion and following feather removal were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Modification of the scald water to alkaline conditions (pH 9 - 10) did not result in increased thermal killing of Salmonella or Campylobacter on turkey carcasses, as hypothesized before the investigation. Alkaline conditions are known to facilitate a more efficacious pluck and aid in the detachment of bacteria. Due to this, the bacteria that were recovered at these points on the processing line could have {{had an impact on the}} observed data...|$|R

A second study using commercial chilling volumes was conducted with 3. 3 L/kg (low) or 6. 7 L/kg (high) distilled water in the chiller. Prechill broiler carcasses were removed from a commercial processing line, cut into left and right halves, and one-half of each pair was individually chilled in a bag containing low or high volume of water.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The first objective of this investigation was to identify a practical and efficient sampling and culture procedure for recovering Salmonella and Campylobacter from commercially processed turkey carcasses. To investigate this objective, several carcass rinsing and bacteriologic culture procedures were compared to identify a method for completing the second objective of the investigation, which was to conduct a microbiological survey of commercial turkey processing. During this large-scale survey of six independent turkey processing facilities, the effects of management practices and chosen microbial intervention strategies during <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> on Salmonella or Campylobacter recovery were investigated. In two experiments, several carcass rinsing and culture procedures were compared to identify a method that was accurate, sensitive, inexpensive and logistically feasible for Salmonella recovery from processed turkey carcasses. Briefly, this method consists of rinsing carcasses in 200 mL of buffered peptone water (BPW) in a large polyethylene bag, aseptic collection of rinse fluid into sterile polypropylene culture bottles, pre-enrichment of recovered rinse fluid in additional BPW, selective enrichment in Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (RV), and plating to double modified lysine iron agar (DMLIA) plates. Also, from the same sample of collected carcass rinse fluid, Campylobacter can be selectively cultured by direct enrichment in Bolton's complete enrichment medium followed by plating to Campy-cefex agar plating medium. This method of recovering Salmonella or Campylobacter was used to complete research directed at objective 2. Following a microbiological survey of commercial turkey processing, observed data led to the following conclusions. Our data indicate that most commercial turkey processing facilities apply effective management during <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> to reduce the presence of foodborne pathogens on commercially processed turkeys. Importantly, assessment of chiller management within each plant was predictive of recorded microbiologic data. Obtained data indicated that facilities implementing the most stringent <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> management practices were associated with the most effective Salmonella or Campylobacter remediation on processed carcasses. Further, if assessments of management reflected poor practices or oversight, microbiologic data were similarly reflective of such trends. Data from this investigation suggest that properly managed <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> systems are capable of reducing the incidence of Salmonella or Campylobacter on post-chill processed poultry carcasses...|$|R
40|$|Poultry are {{considered}} a major source for campylobacteriosis in humans. A total of 1866 Campylobacter spp. isolates collected through the poultry processing chain were typed using flaA-restriction fragment length polymorphism to measure the impact of processing on the genotypes present.

Isolates were obtained from whole chicken carcass rinses of chickens collected before scalding, after scalding, before <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling,</b> after <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> and after packaging {{as well as from}} individual caecal samples. A total of 32 genotypes comprising at least four isolates each were recognised. Simpson's Index of Diversity (D) was calculated for each sampling site within each flock, for each flock as a whole and for the clinical isolates. From caecal collection to after packaging samples the D value did not change in two flocks, decreased in one flock and increased in the fourth flock. Dominant genotypes occurred in each flock but their constitutive percentages changed through processing. There were 23 overlapping genotypes between clinical and chicken isolates.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the use of chlorine or ozone as sanitizing agents in the water of chicken <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling,</b> using the residual levels usually applied in Brazil (1. 5 ppm), comparing the effects of these treatments on the microbiological, physicochemical, and sensory characteristics of carcasses. Chicken carcasses were chilled in water (4 degrees C) with similar residual levels of ozone and chlorine until reaching temperatures below 7 degrees C (around 45 min). The stability of carcasses was assessed during 15 days of storage at 2 +/- 1 degrees C. Microbiological, surface color (L*, a*, b* parameters), pH value, lipid oxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances index), and sensory evaluation (on a 9 -point hedonic scale for odor and appearance) analyses were carried out. The presence of Salmonella was not detected, coagulase-positive staphylococci counts were below 10 (2) CFU/ml of rinse fluid, and Escherichia coil and total coliform counts were below 10 (5) CFU/ml of rinse fluid until the end of the storage period for both treatments. Psychrotrophic microorganism counts did not differ (P > 0. 05) between chlorine and ozone treatments, and both values were near 10 (9) CFU/ml of rinse fluid after 15 days at 4 +/- 1 degrees C. pH values did not differ between treatments (P > 0. 05) or during the storage period (P > 0. 05). In addition, neither chlorine nor ozone treatment showed differences (P > 0. 05) in the lipid oxidation of carcasses; however, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances index of both treatments increased (P 0. 05) in their acceptance scores for odor and overall appearance, but in the evaluation of color, ozone showed an acceptance score significantly higher (P <= 0. 05) than that for the chlorine treatment.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of a dry-AC method on shear force and water-holding capacity (WHC) of broiler breast meat deboned 4 h postmortem compared to hot-boned (no chill) or immersion-chilled meat. Ready-to-cook broiler carcasses were hot-boned, chilled by ice water immersion (0. 3 °C, 50 min) or chilled by cross-flow cold, dry air (0. 7 °C, 150 min). Pectoralis (p.) major and p. minor were removed from the bone at 4 h postmortem. Shear force was measured using a Warner-Bratzler (WB) method and WHC was estimated using cooking yield, drip loss, amount of bound water (filter paper method) and water uptake (swell/centrifugation method). Regardless of muscle type, the WB shear force value of AC samples was significantly lower than that of hot-boned samples; however, there was no difference in the shear force between AC and IC. Regardless of measurement methods, there were no differences (P > 0. 05) in WHC between the three treatments. These results demonstrate that when compared to no chill, AC followed by 4 h postmortem deboning can lead to a difference in WB shear values while WHC properties can be retained.

Prior to allowance for on-line reprocessing, contaminated carcasses had to be transferred to a salvage line where they were manually rinsed and cleaned with chlorinated water. In accordance with USDA guidelines, all on-line reprocessing procedures must result in pre-chill poultry carcasses of equal or improved microbiological quality in comparison to carcasses that are visibly clean. The objective of the following study was to demonstrate the efficacy of the Precure™ (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) antimicrobial as an effective on-line reprocessing treatment. Precure™ is listed as a solution of GRAS acids for use by FDA and is listed as a safe and suitable ingredient by USDA for use on poultry. In this study, fully automated Precure™ application systems were installed in three USDA-inspected broiler processing facilities. Visibly clean, uncontaminated carcasses (control group) and visibly contaminated Precure™-treated (pH = 1. 5) carcasses were sampled (400 mL Butterfield’s Phosphate Diluent) on-site prior to <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> and were shipped on ice and overnight to MCA Services (Rogers, AR) for microbiological evaluation. Upon arrival at the laboratory (Escherichia coli using Petrifilm™ 3. The lower detection level for all groups of organisms was 1 colony forming unit per mL.

40|$|Thermophilic campylobacters are {{the leading}} cause of {{foodborne}} bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, with broiler chicken meat considered the primary vehicle of transmission. Therefore, there is an urgent need to control the pathogen in commercial poultry operations. Understanding the ecology of Campylobacter spp. in poultry production is foundational to the development of effective management strategies and should consider the entire supply chain. The broad objective of this thesis was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the ecological dynamics of Campylobacter in an Australian commercial broiler chicken operation using a novel (semi-) quantitative analytical approach. A miniaturised most probable number (mMPN) method was developed and applied to assess the on-farm levels of Campylobacter spp. colonisation at weekly intervals in two conventional and two free-range broiler flocks. Three of the flocks were subsequently sampled at four points along the processing line: post-pick, post-evisceration, pre-chill and post-chill. The genetic diversity of C. jejuni and C. coli isolates (n = 222) was determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism of the flaA gene (flaA-RFLP) and semi-automated repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting (rep-PCR; DiversiLab®). Low-level colonisation of the flocks was established as early as day 7, with rapid intrashed transmission and proliferation within each grow-out house. All birds delivered to the processing plant were colonised consistently with high populations (mean 7. 8 ± 0. 1 log 10 cells/g caeca) of Campylobacter spp. Substantial within- and between-flock variation in the quantitative loads of Campylobacter was evident through primary production and processing. Overall, a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) reduction in C. jejuni and C. coli was observed following <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling.</b> Both typing methods revealed tremendous genetic diversity, evidence of sequential colonisation, and dominance of particular genotypes during primary production. Although common subtypes persisted throughout processing, carcasses often became contaminated with new strains originating either from preceding flocks or the abattoir environment.

The outcomes from this study will aid in the development and assessment of targeted and multi-pronged approaches to control Campylobacter in commercial broiler chicken operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of elevated carcass temperature in combination with rapidly declining pH or with postrigor muscle on turkey breast meat quality. Two groups of twelve turkey carcasses with similar ultimate pH values were selected based on 15 min postmortem (PM) breast muscle pH (rapid-glycolyzing (RG), pH 6. 0). One side of each carcass was held near 40 °C and <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> was delayed until 110 min PM (DC), while the other side was chilled at 20 min PM (IC). Raw breast meat quality was assessed using measurements of colour and protein extractability, while quality characteristics of cooked product were assessed using cook yield and torsion gelometry. The extractability and degradation of 10 specific proteins was monitored using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Additionally, holding postrigor turkey breast meat at 40 °C was evaluated as a model for mimicking changes due to rapid PM glycolysis. Sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein extractability was reduced for breast samples from RG and DC carcasses as well as for postrigor meat held at 40 °C (P < 0. 05). All colour values ('L*a*b*') increased for DC ground breast meat. Strain at fracture for breast meat gels was lower for RG samples. Both stress and strain at fracture and cook yield were reduced for DC breast meat gels. The reduction in meat quality measurements was additive for RG samples that were delay-chilled. Densitometry of Western blot analyses revealed that the extractability of glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, and M-protein was reduced for RG or DC samples. Increased myosin degradation was observed for samples from either RG or DC carcasses with up to 20 % of myosin degraded in RG/DC samples. Nebulin degradation was also more extensive in RG samples than for controls. Heating postrigor breast increased myosin degradation, however, differences in the banding pattern of myosin fragments compared to samples from RG carcasses were observed. These results provide conclusive evidence that rapid PM glycolysis and delayed chilling have detrimental effects on turkey breast meat quality. The association of postmortem protein degradation with meat of reduced quality merits further investigations into the relationship between postmortem proteolytic activity and meat quality...|$|R

40|$|James et al. (2006) have {{reviewed}} {{previous studies}} {{related to the}} chilling of fresh products. The goal of chilling is always to limit the growth of pathogenic and food spoilage microorganisms. It has been proved that chilling reduces the number of both types of microorganisms {{on the surface of}} fresh products. In Europe dry air is the preferred chilling method. This method is believed to have clear microbiological advantages but James et al. (2006) show that the published data do not support this belief and direct contact chilling methods might even have larger microbiological advantages. However, in a continuous production line, chlorination or other additive is needed to prevent accumulation of micro-organisms. This is not acceptable in Europe. The rate of chilling has some influence on the taste, texture and appearance of the fresh product. Very rapid chilling will generally lead to robust structure while very slow chilling can produce soft texture. Pederson (1979) has compared the costs of different chilling methods in Denmark. When only energy costs were considered, the cost of a countercurrent water <b>immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> system was one fifth that of an air chilling method. Slush ice is often preferred in immersion systems since cooling takes place without freezing damage of the product while the heat removal takes place at a low temperature. For 70 % slush ice content of the slurry, the cooling time is lowest while with 35 % slush ice the highest weight gain is attained (around 5 %). When air is used, short chilling times require low air temperatures and high air velocities. James et al. (2006) report for a specific product a chilling time (38 to 4 oC) 150 minutes with 0. 75 m/s and 1 oC, 60 minutes with 4. 1 m/s and - 7 oC, and 17 minutes with - 40 oC. Short chilling times impose low air temperatures and so low evaporating temperatures and high energy consumption of the primary refrigeration cycle. In this paper the immersion of fresh products in melting carbon dioxide hydrate crystals, produced at + 8 oC and 30 bar, is proposed for rapid chilling of fresh products. First the chilling time of a specific fresh product from 30 to 4 oC making use of a â€œshock freezer (2 m/s air velocity, air at - 10 oC) and applying a slurry of CO 2 hydrate crystals is compared. Also the effect of these two methods on the weight loss of the product is compared. Then the chilling of chicken products making use of the proposed method is experimentally verified. Also the microbiologic contamination of samples chilled using high speed dry air, immersion in melting water and immersion in CO 2 hydrate slurry are compared.

There was no difference in the shape of freezing curves, regardless of the freezing method, concentration of the juice and its producer and the applica-tion of sonication either. Regardless the concentration or the US pre-treatment, it has been observed that the specific time required to freeze the product in the immersion method was shorter than in the shock freezing. Along with the increase of concentrations of carrot juice the freezing point decreased, regardless of the producer. The freezing point of carrot juices, after the application of the US, slightly decreased. Research in this study confirms the reports of the reduced freezing time after the application of ultrasound in case of carrot juices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the levels of}} moisture, protein, water to protein ratio, and water absorption during chilling of chicken giblets (heart, liver, and gizzard) to set legal limits of water absorption during this process. The survey was conducted in the southern Brazil, the largest broiler-producing region of this country. Giblets (heart, liver, and gizzard) were collected fresh from the processing line after evisceration and at the exit of the <b>chiller</b> after the <b>immersion</b> process from two processing plants. One of the plants (PP 1) processes small chickens (1, 100 g live weight) and PP 2 processes chickens with 2, 800 g live weight. In total, 448 samples were collected. Laboratory tests were performed in duplicate for each parameter measured. The results show that moisture levels of fresh giblets {{were higher in the}} gizzard, followed by the liver and the heart, whereas in chilled giblets, the gizzard still maintained the highest moisture level, but was followed by the heart and then the liver. Both in fresh and chilled samples, the liver presented the highest protein content, followed by the gizzard and the heart. Water to protein ratios were higher in chilled than in fresh samples, and was highest in the heart, followed by the gizzard and the liver. After <b>immersion</b> in the <b>chiller,</b> the heart presented the highest water absorption rate (6. 59 %), which was significantly higher compared with those of the liver (4. 16 %) and the gizzard (4. 51 %). Considering that the water absorption rates obtained both in fresh and chilled chicken giblets were below 8. 00 %, the following upper limits of water absorption are suggested for chicken giblet processing in Brazil: 7. 0 % for the heart, and 5. 0 % for the gizzard and the liver...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that pre-slaughter stress of cattle reduces beef quality because of its effect on post mortem muscle pH. Spray washing in the cattle yard is a hygiene requirement of the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) {{in order to reduce the}} contamination of carcasses. However, the washing stresses the animal. This study investigated the effect of spray-washing cattle on beef quality. Spray washing of cattle resulted in considerably more variation in the ultimate pH (pHu) of the meat (5. 52 to 6. 48) compared to meat from dry animals (5. 50 to 5. 79). The increased variability in pHu was reflected in the meat shear force values from the spray-washed animals, which ranged from 5. 2 to 14. 5 kgF, while that from the dry animals ranged between 4. 8 and 8. 6 kgF. There was a tendency for meat from spray-washed animals to be tougher than meat from dry animals (p = 0. 089). The effect of spray washing on calpain I autolysis, desmin and troponin T degradation during post mortem period was determined. Results showed that spray washing tended to cause an increase (p = 0. 07) in post mortem degradation of desmin but had no significant effect on troponin T degradation or calpain I autolysis. The second part of the research investigated the effect of post-slaughter processing conditions on turkey breast meat tenderness, and the biochemical basis for the toughening of turkey breast meat. Anecdotal evidence showed that consumers perceived turkey breast meat as being tough. The preliminary results of this research indicated that the tenderness of turkey breast meat was variable and the mean shear force was higher than would be acceptable to consumers. The observed toughening of turkey breast meat may be a result of post-slaughter treatments of turkey carcasses, such as the rate of carcass cooling, stunning method and carcass deboning time. The effect of these factors on turkey breast meat tenderness were investigated in this research. Post-slaughter temperature and pH of turkey breast muscle was measured at different times. The carcass temperature ranged from 32 °C to 36 °C at 15 minutes post slaughter. <b>Immersion</b> <b>chilling</b> (1 st water bath and 2 nd ice slush bath) rapidly reduced the internal breast muscle temperature to about 10 °C by 75 min after stunning. In all three experiments (2, 3 & 4), cold blast treatment significantly decreased the internal breast muscle temperature compared to the breast muscle that was chilled only. The breast muscle temperature immediately after a cold blast treatment (about six hours post-slaughter) ranged from 2 - 6 °C. In this study, the mean pH of turkey breast muscle at 15 min post-slaughter was 6. 52, indicating that turkey breast muscle exhibited accelerated rigor mortis compared to lamb or beef. The pH of turkey breast muscle at six hours post-slaughter was close to the ultimate pH, which ranged from 5. 80 to 5. 96. Results of this research showed that turkey processing conditions have a toughening effect on the resulting breast meat. Deboning of turkey breast muscle three hours post-slaughter caused between a 80 % and 90 % increase in toughness of the meat compared to muscle aged on the bone for 24 hours. The use of a blast freezer to rapidly cool the breast also toughened the meat by an average of 30 %. The mechanisms responsible for the meat toughening were both muscle contraction and a reduction of proteolysis. The sarcomere length of muscles deboned three hours post mortem was significantly shorter than muscles deboned at 24 hours post mortem. The myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), which is a measure of proteolysis, was significantly higher for muscles aged on bone for at least 24 hours compared to muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter. It is known that meat tenderness improves during post mortem ageing. Results of experiment 4 showed that six days extended ageing of pre-rigor or post-rigor deboned turkey breast muscle significantly improved the meat tenderness. In both muscles deboned at 3 hand 24 h post mortem, there was a 25 % decrease in the shear force values after the 6 -day ageing period. During the ageing period, MFI increased significantly both for muscles deboned at three hours post-slaughter (p = 0. 025) and for the muscles aged on bone for 24 hours prior to deboning (p = 0. 018). Activities of calpain I, II and calpastatin were measured at three different times during post-slaughter ageing (0, 3 and 24 hours) in muscles aged on bone for 24 hours and muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter and then, aged for 24 hours. The activity of calpain I rapidly declined with increasing post mortem time to the extent that only trace levels were detected at three hours, and no calpain activity was detected at 24 hours post mortem. In contrast, there was no loss in calpain II activity over the post mortem period. Calpastatin retained only 35 % of its at-death activity in turkey breast muscle at three hours post-slaughter and there was no calpastatin activity at 24 hours post-slaughter. Furthermore, deboning time had no significant effect on the activity of calpain I, II and calpastatin at 24 hours post mortem. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the observed toughening of turkey breast meat originates from the rapid cooling of turkey carcasses and the three hours post slaughter deboning time. The mechanism of the toughening of turkey breast muscle deboned three hours post mortem is likely to be a direct result of cold shortening rather than reduced calpain activity. This suggests that the reduced proteolysis as measured by MFI is a result of reduced accessibility of the cal pain to myofibrillar protein because of the shortened sarcomere length of muscles deboned at three hours post slaughter and then aged for 24 hours...|$|R

The purpose of the following studies was to evaluate three selected diagnostic and intervention strategies for the potential to improve the microbiological quality of poultry meat with regard to Salmonella contamination. Sampling methodologies were evaluated and compared for sensitivity of Salmonella detection on commercially processed poultry carcasses. Additionally, this same study evaluated potential sites of Salmonella contamination and cross-contamination during specific stages of processing. Another study evaluated the benefit of non-selective pre-enrichment for the detection of low levels of sublethally injured Salmonella enteritidis. The final study investigated the use of a combination of d-limonene and citric acid for the ability to remove Salmonella enteritidis from commercially processed poultry skin. Swab, skin, and carcass rinse samples were obtained from commercially processed poultry carcasses at selected stages within a commercial processing plant. In these studies, culture of excised skin from the ventral aspect of the thoracic inlet was determined to be equal in sensitivity to carcass rinse for the detection of Salmonella. Culture of cotton swabs used to manually swab a similar area in the thoracic inlet region was not effective for detection of Salmonella. These experiments also provided evidence that the site of <b>chill</b> <b>immersion</b> could be a major source for cross-contamination between negative and positive flocks. In order to evaluate the benefit of non-selective pre-enrichment, a standard non-selective pre-enrichment method followed by selective enrichment was compared to a direct selective enrichment method for the ability to detect sublethally injured Salmonella. While a marginal advantage of the non-selective pre-enrichment method was observed, either culture procedure was capable of detecting injured Salmonella at levels incapable of infecting neonatal chicks. In the study designed to evaluate a combined treatment of d-limonene and citric acid for Salmonella decontamination, the combined treatment was effective in causing 8 to I 0 -fold reductions in recoverable Salmonella from processed poultry thigh skin following 30 s exposure at 26 C. Increasing the temperature from 26 C to 55 C resulted in approximately-' 30 -fold reductions in recoverable Salmonella. Possible effects on carcass quality and consumer acceptability remain to be determined...|$|R
40|$|The western rock lobster (WRL), Panulirus cygnus is a decapod {{crustacean}} {{which is}} found in abundance in the coastal waters of Western Australia and which supports a major fishery of economic importance for the State, with an annual harvest ranging between 10 - 12 million kilograms. The growth of the existing markets in Asia for live exports and the competition exerted by other countries marketing spiny lobsters prompted {{the need for the}} Industry to assess and develop post-harvest handling procedures likely to contribute to an improved quality of live product. The physiological responses of P. cygnus to handling and transportation were virtually unexplored. The objectives of this project were, (i) to generate information with regard to the biological phenomena underlying morbidity and mortality of lobsters during live export shipments, (ii) to investigate the physiological responses of P. cygnus to the post-harvest handling practices currently used by the WRL industry in their five export program and, (iii) to identify protocols by which post-harvest handling techniques could be modified to reduce the occurrence of morbidity and mortality during five export. These objectives were achieved through, (i) a field survey conducted {{during the course of the}} 1992 / 93 fishing season, investigating the relative influence of environmental factors and processing techniques on the incidence of lobster morbidity+mortality during simulated live shipments and, (ii) a series of field experiments that monitored the physiological responses elicited by lobsters to post-harvest handling procedures and simulated live shipment conditions. From the field survey, it appeared that the rate of morbidity+mortality experienced in simulated live shipments, within the three processing units surveyed, averaged 5. 22 +/- 0. 63 %, with a highly significant difference (p [less than] 0. 001) between the ++processing units. Scrutiny of the data revealed a major influence of two factors directly related to post-harvest handling procedures: a) the time spent under normal commercial conditions in packaging export cartons and, b) the ambient temperature within the export cartons. Following 30 - 36 hrs in packaging, the percent mortality increased twofold, from 5. 2 +/- 0. 0 % recorded following 20 - 24 hrs to 10. 4 +/- 2. 3 %. With regard to the ambient temperature within the export carton, temperatures between 17. 5 and 20. 0 degrees celsius appear to be optimal for P. cygnus survival while temperatures above 20. 0 degrees celsius induce significantly greater morbidity and mortality. A number of factors were identified as having a potential influence on lobster physiological responses to post-harvest handling conditions:a) Immediately after harvesting, lobsters are subjected to a range of transport environment options, according to their origins: i. e., (i) direct delivery from fishing vessels by local fishermen to the processing facility, (ii) onshore transportation by truck from coastal depots and, (iii) transport in baskets on board carrier-boats from the Houtman Abrolhos Islands. b) After delivery, lobsters are subjected to sorting and grading procedures, with a concomitant exposure to air and disturbance. c) Recovery in holding tanks is usually allowed for a period ranging between 24 to 72 hours. d) Prior to being packed in export cartons, lobsters are subjected to a short period (30 sec to 3 min) of <b>immersion</b> in <b>chilled</b> water (8 - 12 degrees celsius), the procedure varying from one processor to the other. e) During subsequent periods of transit in export cartons, (up to 48 hrs) lobsters are subjected to aerial exposure and fluctuating ambient temperature. A comparison of the physiological profiles of lobsters from different origins revealed significant differences, with respect to a ++range of physiological variables. On the basis of visual estimates of health status, lobsters from the "local" origin exhibited a consistently superior condition, when compared to "coastal" and "carrier-boat" animals. The examination of physiological variables revealed consistent trends reflecting the visual assessments. "Local" lobsters exhibited significantly lower levels in anaerobic metabolic waste concentrations, with the haemolymph lactate titre between 2. 77 +/- 0. 19 and 4. 33 +/- 0. 56 mmol L(subscript) - 1, compared with the other groups, between 5. 23 +/- 0. 24 and 8. 86 +/- 1. 29 mmol L(subscript) - 1. A 250 to 300 % increase in haemolymph ammonia concentration was observed between "coastal" and "carrier-boat" groups and the "local" lobsters, at 0. 32 +/- 0. 02 mmol L(subscript) - 1. Significantly higher pH values were recorded for the "local" group, at 7. 72 +/- 0. 04, compared with values below 7. 64 +/- 0. 04 for the other groups. "Local" lobsters recorded 8 to 15 times less circulating glucose, at 0. 11 +/- 0. 03 mmol L(subscript) - 1, having 50 % more ATP in their muscle tissues, at 6. 07 +/- 0. 15 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 and 250 % more arginine phosphate, at 6. 56 +/- 0. 72 mu mol g(subscript) - 1. An assessment of the efficiency of the industry sorting procedures revealed differences between selected and rejected animals with regard to the ATP and arginine phosphate concentrations in their muscle tissues with, as a common trend for both variables, selected animals recorded higher values. Significant differences were identified within the "local" group of lobsters, with selected animals recording 40 % more ATP, at 6. 92 +/- 0. 63 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 and 30 % more arginine phosphate, at 7. 77 +/- 1. 01 mu mol g(subscript) - 1. A monitoring of the physiological profiles of lobsters subjected to extended (up to 8 hours) periods of onshore transportation in trucks revealed a significant ++reduction in their health status. A consistent and almost linear fall in the concentration of total adenylate (35 %), to 5. 46 +/- 0. 50 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 and phosphagen reserve (70 %),to 2. 77 +/- 0. 26 mu mol g(subscript) - 1, were recorded throughout the 8 hour period. For up to 6 hours the concentration of lactate in the leg muscle tissues increased by 0. 95 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 h(subscript) - 1 and then by 4. 7 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 h(subscript) - 1,to reach 20. 57 +/- 1. 61 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 after 8 hours. Haemolymph glucose and ammonia titres recorded a 3. 5 fold increase over the first 6 hours, to reach 2. 14 +/- 0. 54 and 1. 17 +/- 0. 16 mmol L(subscript) - 1, respectively, the last period (6 to 8 hours) being characterised by a 1. 6 and 1. 9 fold decrease in concentration. Lobsters were able to maintain their haemolymph pH close to 7. 77 during the first four hours, with a concomitant rise in haemolymph calcium concentration. From the results, it appeared that, under current industry procedures, extending the period during which lobsters are transported in spray trucks to more than 6 hours is conducive of altered physiological status. An assessment of the effects of short periods (up to 60 min) of aerial exposure and disturbance revealed significant changes in the physiological profiles of lobsters. When exposed to air, lobsters exhibited a significant fall in haemolymph pH, a rise in lactate concentration, and a depletion in energy reserves. Lobsters left undisturbed were able to buffer an incipient acidosis for up to 40 min (7. 78 +/- 0. 03), after which a decline in pH was recorded to reach 7. 71 +/- 0. 02. Conversely, disturbed animals experienced an uncompensated acidosis and a decrease by 0. 7 of a unit over a 60 minute period. Similarly, undisturbed lobsters did not demonstrate behavioural signs of stress while disturbed animals exhibited dramatically diminished responses ++to handling after 60 min of exposure. Both disturbed and undisturbed animals recorded a decline in ATP/ADP, to reach after 40 min, 8. 31 +/- 0. 77 and 5. 05 +/- 0. 45, respectively, compared to 13. 18 +/- 1. 69 (control). During the last period (40 to 60 min), the undisturbed animals recorded a 40 % decrease in ATP concentration, to reach 4. 42 +/- 0. 16 mu mol g(subscript) - 1, while a 53 % decline was recorded in the disturbed group, to 3. 59 +/- 0. 41 mu mol g(subscript) - 1. During aerial exposure, the phosphagen reserve recorded a 55 % decrease in the disturbed animals, at 4. 82 +/- 1. 37 mu mol g(subscript) - 1, compared to 20 % in the undisturbed group, at 8. 64 +/- 0. 87 mu mol g(subscript) - 1. A 100 % increase in lactate ion concentration was recorded in the muscle tissues of disturbed animals to reach 5. 53 +/- 0. 49 mu mol g(subscript) - 1, compared to a 15 % increase in the undisturbed group, at 2. 83 +/- 0. 29 mu mol g(subscript) - 1. The monitoring of the physiological profiles of lobsters during extended periods (up to 72 hrs) of recovery in holding tanks revealed significant shifts in their physiological profiles and that a return to a steady state occurred only after 8 to 48 hours following re-immersion, according to the environmental conditions and the origin of the animals. Resting levels were identified after 24 hours for the haemolymph pH (close to 8. 00), for the concentration in lactate, ions in the muscle tissues (2. 00 to 3. 00 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 for the haemolymph glucose titre (0. 30 to 0. 60 mmol L(subscript) - 1), for the haemolymph ammonia titre (close to 0. 25 mmol L(subscript) - 1), for ATP (6. 50 to 7. 70 mu mol g(subscript) - 1), and for the phosphagen reserve (12. 2 to 16. 70 mu mol g(subscript) - 1). Longer periods ([greater than]/= 48 hrs) were required for full recovery to occur when lobsters were stored at high stocking density and when lobsters were not isolated from their ++artificial environment. Extending the recovery period to 72 hrs resulted in slight changes in the physiological profiles of lobsters, with a 20 % decline in ATP/ADP, a 10 % decrease in phosphagen concentration in the muscle tissues of the lobsters and subdued behavioural responses for those lobsters held at higher stocking densities.
