40|$|A fishing {{productivity}} {{refers to}} production capability of a fishing gear in time, volume, or {{area of fishing}} ground. The principle of hand line fishing is fishing with a natural bait. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the productivity of hand line and to compare the fishing productivity based on <b>fishing</b> <b>time.</b> The research was a case study on one unit hand line during 30 trips in April ??? June 2014. The calculation of fishing productivity (total fish/minute) of hand line was based on the ratio between fish production and actual <b>fishing</b> <b>time.</b> Non-parametric Cruscal-Wallis were used to compare fishing productivity in different times. The regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between fishing productivity and number of natural bait and <b>fishing</b> <b>time.</b> The main production of hand line was Speckled-Fin Rockod (Epinephelus ongus).

The productivity for first fishing ground was 0. 07673 fishes/minute, productivity for second fishing ground was 0. 09134 fishes/minute, and productivity for third fishing ground was 0. 06784 fishes/minute.

40|$|Abstract only. The paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} recreational fisher behaviour in which fishers maximize their individual utility by adjusting <b>fishing</b> <b>time,</b> trips, catch and size of fish caught. It investigates the optimal behaviour or an individual fisher with and without constraints such as bag limits. The model is used to assess how constraints such as bag limits affect the optimal number or trips and <b>fishing</b> <b>time.</b> It investigates how an improvement in abundance, as reflected in expected catch rates, will impact upon trips and <b>fishing</b> <b>time.</b> This has implications for the likely success of management options designed to enhance abundance. The model is used to indicate what adjustments (e. g. fees, closed seasons) are potentially needed in situations {{where there is a}} positive response to an improvement in catch rates.. The theoretical model is general. The empirical analysis is for the West Coast Demersal fishery using previously collected survey data on individual fishers. This data is used to estimate a trip function in which annual trips are variously a function of catch rate, trip cost, income, species targets and satisfaction to derive an estimate of the responsiveness fishing trips/time to catch rates...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Growing {{demand for}} limited {{quantities}} of fish {{has led to}} systematic planning for the conservation and management of U. S. fishery resources. There {{is a need for}} better understanding of the complex biological and social environment on which regulation for conservation, social, and economic purposes is imposed. The behavior of commercial fishermen, who in many instances use multi-purpose vessels to exploit multi-species fisheries, is difficult to assess and predict. The purpose of this thesis is to describe and analyze selected aspects of Oregon commercial fishing fleets. The focus of this study is on the short-run decision-making behavior of Oregon trawl fishermen for the period 1974 - 1979. A general review of the activities of Oregon's multi-purpose fishing fleets is followed by an attempt to measure the responses of trawl vessel operators to varying economic and biological conditions. Several models of the short-run allocation of <b>fishing</b> <b>time</b> by a multi-purpose vessel operator are developed. The limited amount of economic literature on multi-purpose fleet behavior is briefly reviewed. An important feature not explicitly recognized in the theoretical models is that fishermen operate in an uncertain environment. Fishermen are hypothesized to react to expectations about economic returns in the fisheries which they can exploit. Simple Nerlovian agricultural supply response models were adapted for statistical analysis of the allocation of <b>fishing</b> <b>time.</b> Fishermen's short-run behavior was hypothesized to depend on expectations of current rather than normal returns to <b>fishing</b> <b>time.</b> Four versions of models which explain allocation of <b>fishing</b> <b>time</b> for a stable subfleet of trawl vessels were estimated using ordinary least squares regression. Monthly days of fishing by fishery were significantly explained by variables representing expected gross revenues per unit of effort, weather conditions and seasonal regulations. The analysis also indicates that fishermen are able to respond rapidly to perceived variations in gross returns. In the shrimp and crab fisheries, elasticities of days fished with respect to expected gross returns were estimated to be in the range of 0. 45 to 0. 40. Regulatory implications are that: (1) fisheries managers need to monitor the effects of regulation with little delay and (2) the use of taxes and subsidies to shift significant amounts of effort among fisheries {{is not likely to be}} successful. Additional research effort could profitably be spent to refine measurement of the explanatory variables, or to measure the response of individual fishermen to suitable explanatory variables...|$|E

The two syntheses yield significantly different results.

40|$|During trap-fishing {{investigations}} on {{the crab}} Cancer johngarthi along Baja California peninsula's southwestern coast, Baja California Sur, Mexico, conducted between 2002 and 2006, information was gathered to assess fishing efficiency {{in terms of}} the number of crabs caught per trap during one hour of operation (catch per unit of effort, CPUE = c/ht). As a result of vessel operation issues, some trap lines were abandoned, whereas vessels returned to land for repairing, and because the effective <b>fishing</b> <b>time</b> for these traps was significantly longer than normal, the information so obtained was regarded as reflecting the potential effect on fishing of traps lost during fishing operations (ghost fishing). Of 651 line sets analyzed, involving 45, 152 traps, 77 % had effective fishing times below 60 h, 14 % between 70 and 150 h and 9 % between 150 and 5, 500 h. There is an exponential reduction in CPUE with increasing <b>fishing</b> <b>time</b> that could be associated to trap saturation. The number of crabs per trap also decreased with immersion time, fitting a power function. After 1, 000 h of immersion, each trap may contain 7 – 18 crabs. Four hundred traps were lost over the course of 14 fishing trips. However, because the fishery is in the early development phases, the implementation of measures to avoid or restrain ghost fishing is deemed convenient...|$|E

40|$|Unintended {{mortality}} in longlines {{emerged in the}} early 1990 s {{as one of the}} most important threats for pelagic seabirds worldwide. Most of the studies were focused on highly developed industrial fisheries, overlooking bycatch in small-scale artisanal fisheries. However, bycatch in small-scale fisheries might have negative effects similar to those of industrial fisheries when they overlap with hotspot areas of top predators. Moreover, different types of fishing gear coexist in the same oceanographic area, particularly in highly exploited marine ecosystems such as the western Mediterranean. We quantify for the first time the influence of trawling regime on Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea bycatch in the western Mediterranean longline artisanal fishery. The availability of trawling discards has substantial influence on the foraging and breeding ecology of many seabirds, and trawling inactivity may drive shearwaters to seek alternative food resources, such as baits used in longline fishing. Based on our previous knowledge of the system, we also tested other variables affecting bycatch over 8 yr (1998 to 2005). Within this 2 -fishery framework, we found that trawling regime, longline <b>fishing</b> <b>time</b> and breeding stage were key factors explaining shearwater attendance to longline vessels, but mainly trawling regime and <b>fishing</b> <b>time</b> increased the incidental capture of Cory’s shearwaters. More specifically, during the pre-breeding and chick-rearing periods, bycatch dramatically increased during sunrise sets in the absence of trawling activity. Importantly, this study indicates the need for an integrated multi-fisheries management approach for the conservation of seabirds and highlights the necessity of banning longline fishing during periods of trawling inactivity.
