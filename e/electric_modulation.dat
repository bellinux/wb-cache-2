To overcome the capacitance limitation and improve the response speed, we proposed a novel silver-graphene-dielectric-graphene-semiconductor vertical structure.

Bilayer graphene {{in the presence}} of a perpendicular magnetic field and a unidirectional weak <b>electric</b> <b>modulation</b> is considered.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the far-infrared (FIR) absorption of a {{two-dimensional electron gas}} in a periodically modulated quantizing magnetic field. The magnetic field varies along only one spatial direction and the external time-dependent electric field is linearly polarized along that axis. The mutual Coulomb interaction of the electrons is treated self-consistently in the ground state and in the absorption calculation within the Hartree approximation. The effects of the magnetic material {{on top of the}} heterostructure as a grating coupler is included in the time-dependent incident FIR electric field. We show that similar to an <b>electric</b> <b>modulation,</b> the absorption can be directly correlated to the underlying electronic energy bands. In addition, the magnetic modulation leads to absorption spectra with a richer structure due to the quite different static response of the electron density to the modulation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{equivalent}} {{magnetic noise}} of the magnetoelectric (ME) layered composite sensors has been investigated for various modulation techniques. The ME thin film response to an <b>electric</b> <b>modulation</b> or a magnetic modulation can be sensed by using either a charge amplifier or a coil wound around the sample and then demodulated by a synchronous detector. The equivalent magnetic noise for these excitations methods has been compared.

Particularly, graphene-based materials are envisioned as terahertz modulators, filters and ultra-broadband sources. However, the understanding of terahertz generation from those materials is still not clear, thus limits us recognizing the potential and improving device performances. Graphite, the mother material of graphene and a typical bulk semi-metal, is a good system to study semi-metals and graphene-based materials. Here we experimentally modulate and maximize the terahertz signal from graphite surface, thus reveal the mechanism - surface field driving photon induced carriers into transient current to radiate terahertz wave. We also discuss the differences between graphite and semiconductors; particularly graphite shows no temperature dependency from room temperature to 80 C.

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) {{periodic}} <b>electric</b> <b>modulations</b> of a 2 D {{electron gas}} split each Landau level into the well-known butterfly-type spectrum {{described by a}} Harper-type equation multiplied by an envelope function. This equation is slightly modified for 2 D magnetic modulations but the spectrum remains qualitatively the same. The same holds if both types of modulations are present. The modulation strengths do not affect {{the structure of the}} butterfly-type spectrum, they only change its scale or its envelope. The latter is described by the ratio α of the flux quantum h/e to the flux per unit cell. Exact numerical and approximate analytical results are presented for the energy spectrum {{as a function of the}} magnetic field. For integer α the internal structure collapses into a band for all cases. The bandwidth at the Fermi energy depends on the modulation strength, the electron density, and, when both modulations are present, on the phase difference between them.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of magnetoplasmon spectrum of a {{two-dimensional electron gas}} {{in the presence of}} Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI), one-dimensional weak <b>electric</b> <b>modulation</b> and a perpendicular magnetic field. The intra-Landau-band magnetoplasmon spectrum is determined in the presence of spin-orbit interaction within the self consistent field approach at finite temperature. Due to Rashba effect, the spin of finite-momentum electrons feels a magnetic field perpendicular to the electron momentum in the inversion plane. The magnetoplasmon spectrum of the modulated two-dimensional electron gas (M 2 DEG) system is found to exhibit beating of Weiss oscillations due to Rashba effect which is the focus of this work. This effect is absent in the magnetoplasmon spectrum of M 2 DEG if Rashba spin-orbit interaction is not taken into account. In addition, our finite temperature theory ficilitates analysis of effects of temperature on the magnetoplasmon spectrum of M 2 DEG in the presence of RSOI. We find that the beating pattern is damped but continues to persist at a finite but low temperature. Comment: Accepted in Physica...|$|E

40|$|Torque can be {{provided}} to magnetization in nanomagnets directly by electric current and/or voltage. This technique enables electric current (voltage) -to-spin conversion without electromagnetic induction, and has been intensively studied for memory device applications. Among the various kinds of torque, torque induced by spin-orbit splitting has recently been found. However, quantitative understanding of bulk-related torque and interface-related torque is still lacking because of their identical symmetry for current-in-plane devices. In this paper, we propose that a pure interface-related torque can be characterized by spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance with a current-perpendicular-to-plane tunnel junction. Epitaxial Fe-MgO-V tunnel junctions are prepared to characterize the interface-related torque at Fe-MgO. We find that the current-driven torque is negligible, and a significant enhancement of the voltage-driven torque is observed when the MgO barrier thickness decreases. The maximum torque obtained is as large as 2. 8 × 10 ^{− 5 }[*][*]J/(Vm^{ 2 }), which {{is comparable to the}} voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy of 180 [*][*]fJ/Vm. The voltage-driven torque shows strong dc-bias-voltage dependence that cannot be explained by conventional voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy.

The partial fixed positive charges of the Si 3 N 4 passivation layer do not affect the polarization effect of the AlGaN/GaN heterojunction. The surface electric field tends to the uniform distribution due to the new electric field peak formed by the partial fixed positive charges, which modulates the surface electric field by applying the <b>electric</b> field <b>modulation</b> effect.
