50|$|<b>Ethacridine</b> lactate (<b>ethacridine</b> monolactate monohydrate, acrinol, {{trade name}} Rivanol) is an {{aromatic}} organic compound based on acridine. Its formal name is 2-ethoxy-6,9-diaminoacridine monolactate monohydrate. It forms orange-yellow crystals with a melting point of 226 °C {{and it has}} a stinging smell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethacridine</b> is {{also used}} as an agent for second {{trimester}} abortion. Up to 150 ml of a 0.1% solution is instilled extra-amniotically using a foley catheter. After 20 to 40 hours, 'mini labor' ensues. In China, an intra-amniotic method has also been used. <b>Ethacridine</b> as an abortifacient {{is found to be}} safer and better tolerated than 20% hypertonic saline.|$|E
40|$|Background: Abortion is a {{major health}} and social issue in our country. Techniques for abortions are highly varied in {{different}} areas of country. Present study is to compare newer abortificient misoprostol versus traditionally used <b>ethacridine</b> lactate method. Objective: To observe the efficacy and safety of misoprostol as a second trimester abortificient and to compare it with <b>ethacridine</b> lactate. Methods: This is a prospective study of 100 women with 12 – 20 weeks of gestation. Inclusions were according to MTP Act. 400 ug misoprostol was inserted vaginally followed by 200 ug every 4 hourly in study group (n= 50). 150 - 200 ml of <b>ethacridine</b> lactate was injected extraamniotically in control group (n= 50). Latent phase, active phase and induction abortion interval was noted and compared Results: Average induction abortion interval was 12. 24 hours in misoprostol as compared to 27. 6 hours in <b>ethacridine</b> lactate (P value < 0. 01). The women undergoing D & E due to incomplete abortion was higher with <b>ethacridine</b> group 12 (24 %) as compared to misoprostol group 8 (14 %) (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Misoprostol is faster, convenient, and safer than <b>ethacridine</b> lactate for 2 nd trimester abortion...|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} in local cancer {{treatment}} is {{infection of the}} resulting superficial tumour necrosis. The malodorous oozing lesions not only severely interfere with the patient’s quality of life but may also result in serious sequelae such as accelerated wasting, sepsis, and death. We developed a new formulation of the well-known antiseptic drug <b>Ethacridine</b> lactate in powder form to prevent such infections in local antineoplastic therapy. In a pilot study, the powder was applied in four patients receiving either an intralesional treatment with a platinum-based gel {{in the course of}} a study or photodynamic therapy. In all four patients with cervical respectively facial wounds with a surface of up to 80 cm 2 a virtually dry and odorless scabby lesion resulted with no signs of infection.

40|$|<b>Ethacridine</b> lactate (EAL) is an {{antiseptic}} in solutions of 0. 1 %. It is {{also used}} as an agent for second trimester abortion. Two simple and sensitive spectrophotometric methods (Method A and Method B) were developed for the estimation of EAL in pharmaceutical formulations. Method A {{is based on the}} condensation of the primary aromatic amino group of <b>ethacridine</b> lactate with an aromatic aldehyde (p-Dimethylamino- cinnamaldehyde) to form a chromophore with absorption maximum of 600 nm. Method B is based on redox reaction followed by complex formation of EAL with IO 3 -Metol reagent to form a stable chromogen, which can be estimated at 520 nm. Method A obeys Beer’s law in the concentration range of 2 to 12 μg/mL and method B in the range of 20 to 100 μg/mL. Interference studies were conducted to see the influence of excipients with the proposed methods. The common excipients usually present in dosage forms do not interfere in the proposed method A and method B. The optical characteristics, regression analysis data and precision of the methods were also calculated. The methods were validated for use in routine quality control of EAL in pharmaceutical formulations...|$|E
40|$|Antiseptics {{used for}} the oral cavity were tested for the {{inactivation}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A quantitative bioassay system with a HTLV-Ⅰ - carrying human T-cell line, MT- 4 {{was used to evaluate}} virus inactivation. The tested compounds were as follows: povidone-iodine; benzethonium chloride; benzalconium chloride; chlorhexidine digluconate; methylrosaniline chloride; benzalconium chloride; chlorhexidine digluconate; methylrosaniline chloride; and <b>ethacridine</b> lactate. These compounds were tested at final concentrations of 1. 0 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 01 % and 0. 001 %, in {{the presence or absence of}} 10 % fetal calf serum. The immunofluorescence assay for the HIV antigen showed that povidone-iodine, benzethonium chloride, and chlorhexidine digluconate were effective in the inactivation of HIV at concentrations for oral use. However, in the presence of protein, benzethonium chloride and chlorhexidine digluconate were ineffective at the indicated concentrations for oral use. Although benzalconium chloride was effective at 0. 1 %, this concentration cannot be used orally. <b>Ethacridine</b> lacate and methylrosaniline chloride were not effective at non-cytotoxic concentrations.

40|$|Among the nonantimicrobial {{agents that}} are {{available}} and useful {{for the prevention of}} traveler’s diarrhea are bismuth subsalicylate–containing preparations, which can provide a rate of protection of up to 65 % when taken 4 times daily. In one study, the probiotic Lactobacillus GG was found to provide 49 % protection against traveler’s diarrhea, but results with this agent and other probiotics have been highly variable and geographically inconsistent. Tannin albuminate plus <b>ethacridine</b> lactate provided 36 % protection, but it is not widely available. Among the nonantimicrobial agents {{that are available}} and useful for the treatment of traveler’s diarrhea are bismuth subsalicylate–containing preparations, which reduce the passage of loose stools by 16 %– 18 %. The antisecretory and antimotility agent loperamide reduces the passage of loose stools by ∼ 50 % and has been especially useful, in combination with antimicrobial agents, in reducing the total duration of posttreatment diarrhea to a matter of hours.

40|$|Abstract. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK 5) is a {{potential}} target for prostate cancer treatment, the enzyme being essen-tial for prostate tumor growth and formation of metastases. In the present study, we identified agents that target prostate cancer cells based on CDK 5 expression. CDK 5 activity was suppressed by transfection of PC 3 prostate cancer cells with a dominant-negative construct (PC 3 CDK 5 dn). PC 3 CDK 5 dn and PC 3 control cells were screened for compounds that selec-tively target cells based on CDK 5 expression, utilizing the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. MTS proliferation, clonogenic and 3 D growth assays were performed to validate the selected hits. Screening of 3, 360 compounds identified rutilantin, <b>ethacridine</b> lactate and cetalkonium chloride as compounds that selectively target PC 3 control cells and a tilorone analog as a selective inhibitor of PC 3 CDK 5 dn cells. A PubMed literature study indicated that tilorone may have clinical use in patients. Validation experiments confirmed that tilorone treatment resulted in decreased PC 3 cell growth and invasion; PC 3 cells with inactive CDK 5 were inhibited more effectively. Future {{studies are needed to}} unravel the mechanism of action of tilorone in CDK 5 deficient prostate cancer cells and to test combination therapies with tilorone and a CDK 5 inhibitor for its potential use in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{other species}} {{investigated}} so far, the human {{is able to}} oxidize drugs and environmental chemicals during the early fetal stage (1, 2). Many epoxides from olefmic and aromatic compounds {{are known to be}} short-lived, reactive, intermediary metabolites (3) causing mutagenic (4) and carci-nogenic (5) effects as well as tissue necrosis (6). Indirect (7) and direct (8) evidence for epoxidation reactions in human fetal liver has been obtained, although not with drugs as substrates. In view of the established capacity of the human fetus to oxidize drugs and other exogenous compounds, it was considered important to investigate whether human fetal liver catalyzes the formation of an epoxide from carbamazepine, a commonly used anticonvulsant drug. This epoxide is present in plasma of carbamazepine-treated patients (9). Livers were obtained from eight fetuses (gesta-tional age, 15 - 21 weeks) aborted for socio-medical reasons. Microsomes were isolated as described previously (7). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry ci a!. (10). Incubation mixtures (1 ml) contained MgCl 2 (5 mM), glucose- 6 -phos-phate (5 mM), glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogen-ase (2 units), Tris-HCI buffer (200 mM, pH 7. 5), NADP (I mM), microsomes (2. 5 - 3. 8 mg of pro-tein per ml), and carbamazepine (2 mM) added in 40 sl of acetonitrile; reaction time was 20 or 30 min. Formation of epoxide was roughly linear with time. The reaction was stopped by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold dichloromethane to which 10, 1 1 -dihydrocarbamazepine had been added as internal standard. Carbamazepine 10, 1 1 -epoxide (CE) was determined by high-pressure liquid chro-matography (HPLC) (9). All investigated preparations catalyzed the for-mation of CE (table 1). The rates in microsomes from cesarean fetuses (mean, 27 pmol/min/mg) varied about 4 -fold; they seemed to be lower when the fetus was aborted with <b>ethacridine,</b> perhaps because of autolysis of the liver before delivery o...|$|E
40|$|Background: The rate of cesarean {{delivery}} {{has significantly}} increased in China {{in the last}} decade. Women with prior cesarean history {{tend to have a}} higher risk of uterine rupture during termination of the pregnancy in mid-trimester than those without such a history. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influences of the potential risk factors on uterine rupture in women with prior cesarean. Methods: We conducted this retrospective study of women with prior cesarean section, who underwent mid-trimester pregnancy termination between January 2006 and December 2013 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The protocol was oral administration of mifepristone and misoprostol for the patients with the gestational ages below 16 weeks or intra-amniotic injection of <b>ethacridine</b> lactate (EL) for those with at least 16 weeks of gestational ages. The thickness of the lower uterine segment (LUS) was measured before the termination of pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to study the risk factors of uterine rupture. Results: The total rate of successful abortion was 93. 9 % (62 / 66). Four patients failed in induction, and one of them received curettage, whereas the other three experienced uterine rupture (4. 5 %). The successful rates of abortion were 85. 7 % (30 / 35) for women treated with mifepristone-misoprostol and 86. 1 % (31 / 36) for those treated with EL. There was {{a significant difference in the}} mean LUS thickness between the uterine rupture group (3. 0 ± 2. 0 mm) and the nonrupture group (7. 0 ± 3. 0 mm) (P < 0. 05). The LUS thickness of < 3 mm was associated with uterine rupture during mid-trimester pregnancy termination in women with prior cesarean (odds ratio, 94. 0; 95 % confidence interval 4. 2 - 2106. 1) after adjusted maternal age, gestational age, interdelivery interval and prior cesarean section. Severe bleeding that required transfusion occurred in one case (1. 5 %). Conclusions: Both the mifepristone-misoprostol and the EL regimens were effective and safe for the termination of mid-trimester pregnancy in women with prior cesarean. A thinner LUS is associated with a relatively high risk of uterine rupture...|$|E
