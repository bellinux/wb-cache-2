2500|$|When the {{capacitor}} is discharging, {{the strength}} of the electric field is decreasing and the common orientation of the molecular dipoles is returning to an undirected state in a process of relaxation. Due to the hysteresis, at the zero point of the electric field, a material-dependent number of molecular dipoles are still polarized along the field direction without a measurable voltage appearing at the terminals of the capacitor. This is like an electrical remanence. The oriented dipoles will be discharged spontaneously over time and the voltage at the electrodes of the capacitor will decay exponentially. The complete discharge time of all dipoles can be days to weeks depending on the material.

40|$|The <b>high</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> {{of housing}} {{construction}} has been spreading all over Japan, {{for the improvement}} of indoor environment and the efficiency of energy consumption.

In the meantime, CO 2 is emitted through many activities in daily life.

50|$|To {{minimize}} {{distortion of}} the pulse shape, a pulse transformer needs to have low values of leakage inductance and distributed capacitance, and a high open-circuit inductance. In power-type pulse transformers, a low coupling capacitance (between the primary and secondary) is important to protect the circuitry on the primary side from high-powered transients created by the load. For the same reason, <b>high</b> <b>insulation</b> resistance and high breakdown voltage are required. A good transient response is necessary to maintain the rectangular pulse shape at the secondary, because a pulse with slow edges would create switching losses in the power semiconductors.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of straw-bale {{construction}} over conventional building systems {{include the}} renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and <b>high</b> <b>insulation</b> value.

Research has been done using moisture probes placed within the straw wall in which 7 of 8 locations had moisture contents of less than 20%. This is a moisture level that does not aid in {{the breakdown of the}} straw. However, proper construction of the straw-bale wall is important in keeping moisture levels down, just as in the construction of any type of building.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh voltage {{insulation}} breaks {{are used}} in cryogenic lines with gas or liquid (helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc.) at a temperature range of 4. 2 - 300 K and pressure up to 30 MPa to insulate the parts of an electrophysical facility with different electrical potentials. In 2013 JSC “NIIEFA” delivered 95 <b>high</b> voltage <b>insulation</b> breaks to the IO ITER, i. e. 65 breaks with spiral channels and 30 breaks with uniflow channels. These <b>high</b> voltage <b>insulation</b> breaks were designed, manufactured and tested {{in accordance with the}} ITER Technical Specifications: «Axial Insulating Breaks for the Qualification Phase of ITER Coils and Feeders». The <b>high</b> voltage <b>insulation</b> breaks consist of the glass-reinforced plastic cylinder equipped with channels for cryoagent and stainless steel end fittings. The operating voltage is 30 kV for the breaks with spiral channels (30 kV HV IBs) and 4 kV for the breaks with uniflow channels (4  kV HV IBs). The main design feature of the 30  kV HV IBs is the spiral channels instead of a linear one. This approach has enabled us to increase the breakdown voltage and decrease the overall dimensions of the <b>high</b> voltage <b>insulation</b> breaks. In 2013 the manufacturing technique was developed to produce the <b>high</b> voltage <b>insulation</b> breaks with the spiral and uniflow channels that made it possible to proceed to serial production. To provide the acceptance tests of the breaks a special test facility was prepared. The helium tightness test at 10 - 11 m 3 Pa/s under the pressure up to 10 MPa, the high voltage test up to 135  kV and different types of mechanical tests were carried out at the room and liquid nitrogen temperatures...|$|R
