5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> such situations, {{and how to get}} help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{eventually}} {{reach an}} underground temple where the Thugs worship Kali with human sacrifice. They {{watch as the}} Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial fire pit, burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession {{of three of the}} five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the final two stones. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is put to work in the mines alongside the enslaved children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. After defeating Chattar Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time before it has a chance to enter the fire. They go back to the mines to free the children, but Indy is caught up in a fight with a hulking overseer. The Maharajah, who was also entranced, attempts to cripple Indy with a voodoo doll. Shorty spars with the Maharajah, ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance. With his strength returned, Indy kills the overseer. The Maharajah then tells Shorty <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mines. While Mola Ram escapes, Indy and Shorty rescue Willie and retrieve the three Sankara stones, the village children escape.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, punk band Lucky Boys Confusion {{covered the}} {{song for the}} EP <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> Alive.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{released}} <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> Alive on June 13, 2006. It contained {{four new}} songs and {{a cover of}} Dramarama's [...] "Anything, Anything".|$|R

500|$|At this time, {{several of}} his {{siblings}} wrote {{to him about the}} Nation of Islam, a relatively new religious movement preaching black self-reliance and, ultimately, the return of the African diaspora to Africa, where they would be free from white American and European domination. He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, [...] "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison", he quit smoking and began to refuse pork. After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little concluded that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname [...] "Satan", became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.|$|E
500|$|In {{producing}} the third series, {{the goal was}} to [...] "raise the bar" [...] higher to satisfy and surprise the audience. The second series finale [...] "Smoke and Mirrors" [...] ended on a cliffhanger which left Tom's fate open. The producers were unsure whether Macfadyen would return at the time they began storylining. Brenton had already written the first two episodes as if he was not coming back. When Macfadyen announced his return for those episodes, they had to be rewritten. Brenton went through a [...] "nightmare" [...] rewriting the first episode as he [...] "dug this enormous hole, and [...] had no idea <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] It became a long process of growing the story where Tom turns the tables against Joyce. To make a suitable send off to the character, Brenton did not want Tom to be disillusioned; instead he wanted him to [...] "sort of [...] a human being," [...] as there have been real life instances where spies are attracted to the idea that [...] "the world's a stage to them all the time," [...] but later on they start to unravel.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E

"Yes, I reckon there's more'n a {{thousand}} who are jest aching <b>to</b> see <b>how</b> I can row {{in one of}} them dandy boats," [...] Master Sam added; [...] "but if you get into any kind of a scrape, an' don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> come <b>to</b> me.

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{composed}} of older b-sides and demos, plus a new song, [...] "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us." [...] "Biggest Mistake" [...] was previously released on Stubhy's side project Shock Stars' 2007 EP Feel for a Heartbeat. [...] "When Bad News Gets Worse" [...] was previously released on Lucky Boys Confusion's 2006 EP <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> Alive.|$|R
500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore. He later recalled, [...] "I realized that the whole episode was framed around Byers telling his story to a Baltimore homicide detective. So I figured 'what the heck? Homicides a great show, so why not try to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing around in my backyard, and [...] I just turned to him and said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda! X is the assassin, it's not some other character, it's our X. [...] He wouldn't kill the Gunmen, 'cause he's trying to help Mulder.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Each episode {{ended with}} an {{extended}} instrumental performance of [...] "The Muppet Show Theme" [...] by the Muppet orchestra before Statler and Waldorf gave {{the last laugh}} of the night. Some last laugh sequences featured other Muppets on the balcony. For example, in one episode, the Muppets of Sesame Street appeared behind the duo who told them: [...] "How should {{we know how to}} get to Sesame Street? We don't even know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this stupid theater box!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Minos {{justified}} his accession as {{king and}} prayed to Poseidon for a sign. Poseidon sent a giant white bull {{out of the}} sea. Minos was committed to sacrificing the bull to Poseidon, but then decided to substitute a different bull. In rage, Poseidon cursed PasiphaÃ«, Minos' wife, with zoophilia. Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow and PasiphaÃ« was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, again named Asterius, the Minotaur, half man half bull. Daedalus then built a complicated [...] "chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way" [...] called the Labyrinth, and Minos put the Minotaur in it. To {{make sure no one}} would ever know the secret of who the Minotaur was and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, Icarus, along with the monster. Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.|$|E

2500|$|When {{it became}} clear that the crowd was not going to disperse, a group of 77 National Guard troops from A Company and Troop G, with bayonets fixed on their M1 Garand rifles, began to advance upon the {{hundreds}} of unarmed protesters. As the guardsmen advanced, the protesters retreated up and over Blanket Hill, heading out of the Commons area. Once over the hill, the students, in a loose group, moved northeast along the front of Taylor Hall, with some continuing toward a parking lot in front of Prentice Hall (slightly northeast of and perpendicular to Taylor Hall). The guardsmen pursued the protesters over the hill, but rather than veering left as the protesters had, they continued straight, heading toward an athletic practice field enclosed by a chain link fence. Here they remained for about 10 minutes, unsure of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the area short of retracing their path. During this time, the bulk of the students congregated to the left and front of the guardsmen, approximately [...] away, on the veranda of Taylor Hall. Others were scattered between Taylor Hall and the Prentice Hall parking lot, while still others were standing in the parking lot, or dispersing through the lot as they had been previously ordered.|$|E
