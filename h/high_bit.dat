25|$|In July 1992, the X/Open {{committee}} XoJIG {{was looking}} for a better encoding. Dave Prosser of Unix System Laboratories submitted a proposal for one that had faster implementation characteristics and introduced the improvement that 7-bit ASCII characters would only represent themselves; all multibyte sequences would include only bytes where the <b>high</b> <b>bit</b> was set. The name File System Safe UCS Transformation Format (FSS-UTF) and most of the text of this proposal were later preserved in the final specification.|$|E

25|$|The Generic Graphics Library (GEGL) {{was first}} {{introduced}} as part of GIMP on the 2.6 release of GIMP. This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release, GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit-depth color operations; because of this less information is lost when performing color operations. When GEGL is fully integrated, GIMP will have a higher color bit depth and better non-destructive work-flow. Current distribution versions of GIMP only support 8-bit of color, which is much less than what e.g. digital cameras produce (12-bit or more). Full support for <b>high</b> <b>bit</b> depth is included with actual Gimp 2.9 Development version. For accelerations OpenCL is available for some operations.|$|E
