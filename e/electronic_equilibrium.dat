40|$|AbstractThe CuB metal {{center is}} at the core of the active site of the heme–copper oxidases, {{comprising}} a copper atom ligating three histidine residues one of which is covalently bonded to a tyrosine residue. Using quantum chemical methodology, we have studied the CuB site in several redox and ligand states proposed to be intermediates of the catalytic cycle. The importance of the His–Tyr crosslink was investigated by comparing energetics, charge, and spin distributions between systems with and without the crosslink. The His–Tyr bond was shown to decrease the proton affinity and increase the electron affinity of both Tyr- 244 and the copper. A previously unnoticed internal <b>electronic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> between the copper atom and the tyrosine was observed, which seems to be coupled to the unique structure of the system. In certain states the copper and Tyr- 244 compete for the unpaired electron, the localization of which is determined by the oxygenous ligand of the copper.

Materials and methods: In this work a Monte Carlo (MC, EGS 4) simulation for dosimerty study was performed for the 6 MV home made SRT unit of the University Hospital of Patras (Hellas). The results were compared with conventional small field dosimetry techniques such as ionization chamber, TLD's, and films (conventional and radiochromic). Hence, a comparison of many of the dosimetric techniques currently being used in small field dosimetry was attempted. Results: It was shown that all techniques are in reasonable agreement (within ± 2 %) and that Monte Carlo can be used as a reliable reference for the dosimetry of the SRT beams, especially where lateral <b>electronic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> does not exist, as long as accurate simulation can be achieved. Conclusion: This study is only limited by the insurance of accurate simulation of the linear accelerator, which can be a difficult task since it is limited by the availability of the manufacturer's designs and the availability of computers and computer time for adequate runs, but it could become a useful tool for Monte Carlo simulations, as it contains detailed analysis of the run parameters and component modules selection. © 2004 Zerbinis Medical Publications...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has set the basic criteria for assessing skin dose stemming from hot particle contaminations. Compliance with IO CFR 20. 1 01 requires that exposure to the skin be evaluated over a I CM 2 area at a depth of 0. 007 cm. Skin exposure can arise from both the beta and gamma components of radioactive particles and gamma radiation can contribute significantly to skin doses. The gamma component of dose increases dramatically when layers of protective clothing are interposed between the hot particle source and the skin, and in cases where the hot particle is large in comparison to the range of beta particles. Once the protective clothing layer is thicker than the maximum range of the beta particles, skin dose is due solely to gamma radiation. Charged particle equilibrium is not established at shallow depths. The degree of <b>electronic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> establishment must be assessed for shallow doses to prevent the overassessment of skin dose because conventional fluence-to-dose conversion factors are not applicable. To assess the effect of <b>electronic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> selected thicknesses of tissue equivalent material were interposed between radiochromic dye film and a 6 OCo hot particle source and dose was measured as a function of depth.

40|$|Charge {{transfer}} {{is a fundamental}} process that underlies a multitude of phenomena in chemistry and biology. Recent advances in observing and manipulating charge and heat transport at the nanoscale, and recently developed techniques for monitoring temperature at high temporal and spatial resolution, imply the need for considering electron transfer across thermal gradients. Here, a theory is developed for the rate of electron transfer and the associated heat transport between donor-acceptor pairs located at sites of different temperatures. To this end, through application of a generalized multidimensional transition state theory, the traditional Arrhenius picture of activation energy as a single point on a free energy surface is replaced with a bithermal property that is derived from statistical weighting over all configurations where the reactant and product states are equienergetic. The flow of energy associated with the electron transfer process is also examined, leading to relations between {{the rate of heat}} exchange among the donor and acceptor sites as functions of the temperature difference and the electronic driving bias.
