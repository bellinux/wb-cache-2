5|$|Marrakesh <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} centre {{for healthcare}} in Morocco, {{and the regional}} rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the}} greatest in the world at the time. A strong Andalusian influence was evident in the hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as Seville, Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in Greek antiquity <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{object of}} apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded {{the merit of}} its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had {{significant impact on the}} debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History of Slavery in Antiquity among his works for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{now known}} as Opuntia ficus-indica, or the Indian fig cactus, <b>has</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} source of food. The original species {{is thought to have}} come from central Mexico, although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties (cultivars), including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias. Both the fruit and pads are eaten, the former often under the Spanish name tuna, the latter under the name nopal. Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless. The nopal industry in Mexico was said to be worth US$150million in 2007. The Indian fig cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived, and was soon after brought to Europe. It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area, both naturally and by being introduced—so much so, early botanists assumed it was native to the area. Outside the Americas, the Indian fig cactus is an important commercial crop in Sicily, Algeria and other North African countries. Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten, generally under the same name, tuna. Flower buds, particularly of Cylindropuntia species, are also consumed.|$|E
