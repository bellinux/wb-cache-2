5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Superman in December 1978, it was widely assumed that Donner would be {{recalled}} to complete {{the remainder of the}} sequel. However, a number of events led to Donner's eventual replacement as director of the movie. Most importantly, producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind announced that Marlon Brando's completed scenes for Superman II would be excised from the movie {{in order for them to}} avoid having to pay the actor the reported 11.75% of gross U.S. box-office takings he was now demanding for his performance in the sequel. Donner publicly lambasted this decision, announcing that he would make the film his way or not at all. The April 1978 issue of the sci-fi magazine Starburst quotes Donner as saying, [...] "That means no games... They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> me to do it.

The court, {{on the advice of}} Melina, met after so many years his brother Tonio and set off for Sicily. The meeting with Don Calogero and his men takes place in an abandoned quarry in Sirenuse, a Sicilian town, in the rain. The boss tells Tonio that it was he who put the bomb under the car of Don Rosario and that home movie that has no value because Galimberti has resigned and became associate justice because of pressure from the prosecutor Donelli, who had received Saints from some parts of the pornographic film. So Don Calogero sends Saruzzo forward to take the Saints without the exchange. Hearing, however, the screams of the little Antonia in the car and the fears of Saints, the good Tonio chooses his real family instead of Don Calogero. He shoots to the head and kills Saruzzo, takes hostage Don Calogero throat forcing his minions not to shoot and sends Saints to take the child. But Calogero hits Tonio with a knife hidden in his jacket, so the young man is shot repeatedly by picciotti and falls to the ground. However, still he managed to shoot and kill Don Calogero and some thugs, falling from the wall of the quarry and die as their boss under a barrage of bullets. Santi, brought Antonia safe thanks to Tony, grab the gun of his brother dying and revenge killing, in self-defense, the last remaining picciotti.

My point of view is determined by the theme of the woman?s emancipation, which I do analyse and identify on mentioned examples.

In conclusion, I recover the key-stone of every, not only woman?s emancipation: to recognize that I don?t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> more than I am able to, to understand what I am allowed to, to put up with it and to find love to myself; to oneself...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of risk perception on intentions to quit smoking and post-treatment abstinence. DESIGN: Prospective and longitudinal. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 237 adult smokers (mean age 56 years) receiving medical care from home health-care nurses. Participants did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to quit smoking to participate, but received cessation counseling {{within the context of}} their medical care. MEASUREMENTS: Three measures of risk perception were given pre- and post-treatment: perceived vulnerability, optimistic bias and precaution effectiveness. Smoking status was verified biochemically at end of treatment and at 2, 6 and 12 months later. FINDINGS: Principal components analysis supported the theoretical discriminability of the risk perception measures, and intercorrelations provided evidence for concurrent and predictive validity. Elevated risk perception was associated with a variety of socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics. Optimistic bias was associated significantly with older age and ethnic minority status. Smokers in pre-contemplation had lower perceived vulnerability and precaution effectiveness and greater optimistic bias than those in contemplation and preparation. Smokers in preparation had higher perceived vulnerability and lower optimistic bias than those in earlier stages. Change in perceived vulnerability predicted smoking cessation at follow-up. Optimistic bias predicted a lower likelihood of cessation and precaution effectiveness predicted a greater likelihood of smoking cessation, but only among those with a smoking-related illness. CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving medical care from home health-care nurses, change in perceived vulnerability to smoking-related disease is predictive of smoking cessation. In those with smoking-related illnesses, optimistic bias predicts continued smoking while precaution effectiveness predicts cessation...|$|E
3000|$|In {{the next}} step, {{immigrants}} as the target group of integration policy are conceptionalized as intentional actors interacting with policies as institutions providing incentives and opportunities. Scholars have broadly acknowledged {{the nature of}} the integration process as a complex interaction between society and individual and integration outcomes cannot be studied solely by focusing on immigrants themselves or natives and characteristics of their institutions (Heckmann, 2006). An institutionalist perspective runs the risk of ignoring immigrants’ agency. A coherent framework for the analysis of integration outcomes requires a combination of both, individual intentional behavior and structural boundaries. As Hansen (2012, p. 8) noted previously, states must ensure “real opportunities and incentives to immigrants” and “immigrants themselves will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> these opportunities”. In a similar vein, Freeman (2004) described immigrant integration as the intersection between immigrants’ strategies and the regulatory frameworks of the receiving state. Bridging the perspective of immigrants as intentional actors and the perspective of policies as institutions should therefore be combined to analyse outcomes of integration policies. Such a perspective is offered by actor-centered institutionalism that explains policy outcomes as the product of intentional actions of individuals and the institutional context structuring these actions (Scharpf, 2000). Moreover, individuals are characterised by specific capabilities and subjective action orientations (Scharpf, 1997). By capabilities, Scharpf refers to the power of actors to enact their decisions, and contains all resources that enable an actor to influence an outcome. Action orientations are the characteristic perceptions and preferences of an individual, in other words the aspirations to perform a particular action. Accordingly, integration capabilities and integration aspirations can be understood as subsets of more general capabilities and aspirations in life. The capability-aspiration framework essentially conceptualises immigrant integration outcomes as the product of immigrants’ capabilities and aspirations both shaped by integration policies. 5 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Social support {{may help}} smokers quit and buffer against factors that hinder quitting. The study's aims are to examine which types {{of social support}} are {{effective}} for quitting smoking among Latino smokers and whether social support buffers the effects of depressed mood on smoking cessation. Design, Setting, Subjects. Participants were Latino smokers with children with asthma (N = 131, mean age = 37 years, 73 % female). They did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to quit smoking to participate. Smoking status was biochemically verified at a 3 -month follow-up. Measures. Social support was assessed as {{whether or not the}} participant had a significant other, level of perceived general support (Interpersonal Support Evaluation List) and level of perceived partner support for smoking cessation (Partner Interaction Questionnaire). Depressed mood was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression scale. Analysis. Hierarchical logistic regression. Results. Thirty percent of those with a partner quit smoking versus 14. 3 % of those without a partner. 43. 5 % of those with high levels of perceived positive partner support quit smoking vs. 17. 4 % of those with low levels. There was a significant interaction between whether or not a smoker had a partner and depressed mood on quitting: among those not partnered, quit rates were higher among those with low levels of depressed mood (37 %) than among those with high levels of depressed mood (9 %; odds ratio = 1. 147, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 031 – 1. 276, p <. 02). Among those partnered, quit rates were not significantly different between those with high vs. low levels of depressed mood. Conclusions. This paper is the first to examine multiple sources of support for smoking cessation in Latino smokers; partner support and the presence of a significant other are associated with quitting smoking...|$|E

50|$|In some {{theories}} {{a desire}} plus a belief about {{the means of}} satisfying that desire are always what is behind an action. Agents aim, in acting, to maximize the satisfaction of their desires. Such a theory of prospective rationality underlies much of economics and other social sciences within the more sophisticated framework of Rational Choice. However, many theories of action argue that rationality extends far beyond calculating the best means to achieve one's ends. For instance, a belief that I ought to do X, in some theories, can directly cause me to do X without my <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do X (i.e. <b>have</b> a desire <b>to</b> do X).
