The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for [...] "interminable days" [...] while the Putsch ran its course. Szigeti writes: [...] "... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition <b>I</b> <b>pictured</b> with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment to me than all the other discomforts put together".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{her first}} name is Kate, she chooses to go by KT, saying [...] " [...] just {{makes me think of}} a buxom lass baking bread for her man working in the fields. I have no problem with that, but it's just not really how <b>I</b> <b>pictured</b> being a rock star." [...] Also, Tunstall spells {{her first name}} KT (as opposed to Katie) to {{differentiate}} herself from fellow singer Katie Melua. She also asserted that she derived [...] "KT" [...] from K-T impact, the name of a geological event that caused extinction of dinosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{earned their}} fourth win {{of the season}} against former Braves pitcher Alex Wood and the Los Angeles Dodgers in a {{lopsided}} 8–1 game at Turner Field. Wood said after the game that it [...] "was not really the way <b>I</b> <b>pictured</b> coming back {{here for the first}} time. Fastball command was the most frustrating thing. I don't even know if I've walked in a run before in my professional career. The walks were pretty frustrating. It was a tough one to swallow, but I have another one in five days." [...] Despite a 3-1 lead, the Dodgers scored four unanswered runs to snap the Braves four-game win streak. A Yasmani Grandal double in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers a 2–1 victory in the Braves's fourth extra-inning game of the season.|$|E

2500|$|The A.V. Club {{called the}} album a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] in their mixed review, adding [...] " [...] When {{you get down}} to it, the samples and interludes on Zombie's solo debut, Hellbilly Deluxe, are merely window {{dressing}} for compact, overdriven, anthemic money shots like 'Superbeast', 'Demonoid Phenomenon', and 'Living Dead Girl'." [...] In their 2010 review of the album, Bloody Disgusting wrote [...] "Putting aside the futuristic sounds and crisp production, everything about the album screamed out vintage horror. I imagined creepy black and white laboratories where glass vials and tubes bubbled with menacing liquids. <b>I</b> <b>pictured</b> a dark night where clouds slowly moved past a full moon. I envisioned foggy forests where tree branches looked like skeleton arms. With that kind of atmosphere, the album already felt like a fine wine: aged and more enjoyable for it." [...] They later criticized the length of the album, and claimed that some songs felt like [...] "filler" [...] tracks. PopStops also praised the album, writing [...] "This is an album that rarely ever gets out of overdrive. Zombie growls his lyrics over a bed of car crash crunching guitars and pounding industrial rhythms. No surf music here." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album artwork premiered on 22 August 2011, and {{features}} Roberts {{next to a}} collection of vintage artefacts wearing a modern interpretation of Cinderella's glass slippers. The album artwork was shot at Master Shipwright's House in London, which Roberts described as [...] "run-down reality {{with a hint of}} fairytale". The concept of the artwork was to relate to the different sounds of the album, which Roberts described as [...] "red" [...] and [...] "blue" [...] tracks, claiming she wanted [...] "to be on parallel with the art and clothes". The emerging detailing in electro music, as Roberts described it was something she wanted present in the artwork, whilst talking to Rolling Stone she said [...] "I wanted that rhythm to be present in the imagery, the way <b>I</b> <b>pictured</b> it. There's a lot going on with the sounds on this record; it was important to me that the visual side was equally eclectic, so that it came full circle. This is a full package. For the album photograph shoot, Roberts worked alongside shoe designer Atalanta Weller to produce the shoes for the album. The [...] "21st century" [...] Cinderella style glass slippers were produced for the album campaign, Roberts explained about the shoes and fashion in relation to the record saying; [...] "that will play a big part in the campaign for the record [...] the crystals represent a massive part in the theme of the album". The shoe, a wedge, is in Webber's signature style and whilst talking to Vogue Webber called her intrigue at working with Roberts due to them being an unlikely pairing. Webber called Roberts' style [...] "incredible" [...] and [...] "extremely distinctive, luxurious and original": ...|$|E

I am a sensible fellow, I believe--I believe, on looking back, I mean--and modest I am sure; but all this goes on notwithstanding. I repair to the enchanted house, where there are lights, chattering, music, flowers, officers (I am sorry to see), and the eldest Miss Larkins, a blaze of beauty. She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers in her hair--forget-me-nots--as if SHE had any need to wear forget-me-nots. It is the first really grown-up party that I have ever been invited to, and I am a little uncomfortable; for I appear not to belong to anybody, and nobody appears {{to have anything to}} say to me, except Mr. Larkins, who asks me how my schoolfellows are, which he needn't do, as I have not come there to be insulted.|$|R

The algorithm detects scene cuts at Ptype pictures by monitoring the percentage of Intramacroblocks per P picture. while scene cuts at <b>I</b> <b>pictures</b> are detected by matching the macroblocks type of the two P pictures at the GOP boundaries.
