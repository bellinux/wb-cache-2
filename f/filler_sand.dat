40|$|The {{secondary}} steel refining process uses <b>filler</b> <b>sand</b> as a thermal insulating barrier {{that separates the}} liquid metal from direct contact with slide-gate system of the steel ladle. The effective use of this practice must provide a high free opening rate, impacting on increased productivity and quality of steel, {{reducing the number of}} stops, thermal loss and even the steel re-oxidation. Both operational parameters and material properties have influence on the free opening rate. In the present work, two chromite-silica sands were analyzed, and some composition changes were proposed. The properties of these materials and the relevant process parameters were evaluated according to the free opening rate under normal operational conditions.

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interaction}} between refractory and liquid steel. The aim of this work is to understand the interaction behavior between refractory and liquid steel regarding steel cleanliness. The effect of different refractories on different inclusions in Al-killed steel was studied in a furnace. The sintering mechanism of <b>filler</b> <b>sand</b> were also investigated in laboratory. In the industrial trials, the attachments of different oxides {{on the walls of}} submerged entry nozzle (SEN) were discussed in the cases of high strength low alloy steel (HSLA) and ultra-low carbon steel (ULC). It is found that the effect of alumina and spinel refractory on all the three types of inclusions is very little, while MgO refractory influences the inclusions depending on the activity of dissolved oxygen in liquid steel. At low oxygen level, alumina inclusions could transform into spinel inclusions with the help of MgO refractory, while the effect on spinel and calcium aluminate inclusions is not evident. On the other hand, when the activity of dissolved oxygen is high enough, the evolution of spinel inclusions from alumina inclusions could not be seen. The reaction between chromite and silica grains leading to liquid formation is the main mechanism for the sintering of <b>filler</b> <b>sand.</b> The factors viz. steel composition, silica size and content, operation temperature and process holding time have a strong influence on the sintering of the <b>filler</b> <b>sand.</b> Smaller size and higher content of silica in sand, steel grades containing higher Mn and Al contents, higher temperature and longer holding time would result in serious sintering. The choice of the sand needs to take those factors into account. The results show that solid alumina particles are always agglomerated on the inner wall of SEN in the case of ULC steel. The top slag with high FeO and MnO contents is considered as the main reason of this kind of attachments. The removal of slag might be a good method to avoid the attachments. In the case of HSLA steel, liquid calcium aluminate inclusions could attach on the inner wall of SEN as well. The smoothness of the inner wall of the SEN holds the key of liquid attachments. In addition, the attachment situation on the outer wall of SEN depends on the operations. The oxygen entrainment through the mold powder would result in the formation of plate-like alumina attachments. The control of reoxidation due to oxygen entrainment would help to avoid this situation. QC 20160816 </p...|$|E

Silicon carbide (SiC) particles with an average diameter of 50 mu M were oxidized in air at 1100 - 1600 degrees C to form SiC@SiO 2 core-shell structure. As the oxidation temperature increases, silica weight-ratio increases from 0. 8 to 7. 9 wt. %, equivalent to a calculated shell thickness of 20 - 157 nm, respectively. The crust thickness can be tailored by adjusting the shell thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the core shell structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l.

ABSTRACT: As the use of foamed bitumen mixtures in the road pavements of the Southern African region continues to grow, so the need for sound mix design procedures and performance criteria for these mixes becomes paramount. Four years of fundamental and developmental research into foamed bitumen mixes has been combined with practical experience obtained from laboratory and field application of foamed mixes, as well as previous publications on these mixes, to provide guidelines for their usage. This paper proposes: - methods for the optimisation of the foamed bitumen properties and the setting of suitable limits for its characteristics dependent on type of application, - guidelines for {{the selection of the}} ideal aggregate structure for cold foamed mixes including separate <b>filler,</b> <b>sand</b> and large aggregate considerations, - procedures for carrying out cold mix design in the laboratory (including mixing, compaction and curing) - procedures for manufacturing half-warm foamed mixes in the laboratory, - for road structures incorporating foamed mix layers. In particular, the spatial composition of the aggregate {{plays an important role in}} determining the behaviour of a foamed mix. To this end,procedures are provided that enable the interaction of moist filler and foamed bitumen to be modelled in terms mastic stiffness as well as optimal blending of aggregate fractions for most suitable foamed mix properties. The proposed guidelines of this paper are pertinent to the Southern African region.

Water soluble salts are quite often present in historical constructions and are considered {{to be one of the}} main damaging and powerful reasons for deterioration of porous masonry. According to the previous research devoted to restoration mixtures as well as analysis of historical binders, compositions keeping the ratio binder (calcium or dolomitic lime) to <b>filler</b> (<b>sand)</b> 1 : 3 were elaborated. Different additives as portlandcement, natural pozzolana or trass in amount of 12 % for experimental model samples were used. The investigation included visual observation, microscopical evaluation of state of samples, mercury porosity measurements before and after exposure in salts solutions, profiles of distribution of nitrate, sulphate and chlorine ions and crystalline phases in all depths samples by chemical and XRD analysis as well as measurements of compressive strength, density. Laboratory scale studies indicated that both the dynamics and rate of water absorbtion, ability to draw in solution of salts, resistence to salt crystallisation and compressive strength is in strong correlation with the porosity, density of samples as well as type of binder and additives. Obtained experimental data can further serve as a data base for planning practical restoration activities in salinated environments and where application of lime based grouts is essential.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{consortium}} of three durability index test methods consisting of oxygen permeability, sorptivity and chloride conductivity {{were used to}} evaluate the potential influence of four (4) common SANS 10197 cements on strength and durability of concrete. Twenty four (24) concrete mixtures of water-cement ratios (w/c’s) = 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 65 were cast using the cement types CEM I 42. 5 N, CEM II/A-M (V-L) 42. 5 N, CEM IV/B 32. 5 R and CEM II/A-V 52. 5 N. The concretes investigated fall in the range of the normal strength, medium strength and high strength concretes. Samples were cast into cubes and panels for extraction of the test discs. Other variables investigated were the effect of using <b>filler</b> <b>sand</b> in the mixtures and the influence of compaction method. It was found that the marked differences in oxygen permeability and sorptivity results observed at normal and medium strengths tended to disappear at high concrete strengths. Also, the influence of the different cement types on the durability properties diminishes at high strengths with a slight bias towards better performance by low strength cement containing higher proportion of extenders. The cements of low strength and/or that contained no extenders (CEM 32. 5 R, CEM I 42. 5 N) showed greater sensitivity to sorptivity relative to other cement types, with water sorptivity values of the former increasing significantly with increase in w/c of the mixtures. Results also show that while concrete resistance to chlorides generally improves with increase in strength, the level of chloride resistance appears to reach a limit beyond which no further improvement is achieved with high strengths. It appears that incorporation of extenders is necessary for superior chloride resistance even with high strengths...|$|E

The hardened specimens were then removed from the molds and cured in water until an age of 28  days in a constant temperature room at a temperature of 23  ±  3  °C.|$|R
50|$|Flowing screeds {{are made}} from inert <b>fillers</b> such as <b>sand,</b> with a binder system based on calcium sulphate. Consequently they can look very similar to a sand/cement screed Flow screeds are often {{preferred}} to traditional cement based screeds as they are faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is most often used in combination with underfloor heating installation as the reduced thickness provides for more effective and efficient heat transfer. One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement. It is anything but difficult to pour, with fluid properties that consider an expedient application and quicker drying time. There aren't any bigger advantages of this product than when combined with underfloor heatingsystem, a lesser thickness of liquid flooring screed, when compared with conventional screeds, minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to user requirement hence raising the efficacy of your underfloor heating method.|$|R
5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and <b>filler</b> (limestone <b>sand)</b> content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high binder content gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder. The method for this asphalt binder modification is by adding cellulose fibre and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|R
40|$|In {{comparison}} with steel, concrete, and polymeric pipes, glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) pressure pipes use more expen-sive raw materials. Thus, despite of their attractive structural performance, mainly {{in terms of}} mechanical strength combined with low weight, the higher cost can be a limitation in many applications. In this scenario, an alternative to reduce the final price of GRP pipes is the addition of quartz <b>sand</b> <b>filler.</b> In this experimental and numerical study, filament-wound E-glass/polyester pipes with nominal inside diameter of 300 mm and wall thickness of 5. 7 mm were produced with the incorporation of quartz <b>sand</b> as <b>filler</b> and tested to failure under internal pressure. The mechanical behavior of the composite pipes was evaluated experimentally, throughout short-time hydraulic failure pressure tests, as well as using finite element analysis (FEA). In the FEA simulations, the shell wall was modeled as an axisymmetric layered orthotropic material. A good agreement, varying from 96 % to 98 %, was obtained between the average hydraulic failure pressure measured and FEA predicted failure pressures, using Tsai–Hill and Hoffman failure criteria, respectively...|$|R
25|$|Not all fly ashes meet ASTM C618 requirements, {{although}} {{depending on}} the application, {{this may not be}} necessary. Ash used as a cement replacement must meet strict construction standards, but no standard environmental regulations have been established in the United States. 75% of the ash must have a fineness of 45µm or less, and have a carbon content, measured by the loss on ignition (LOI), of less than 4%. In the U.S., LOI must be under 6%. The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly, due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance. This makes it necessary that, if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production, it must be processed using beneficiation methods like mechanical air classification. But if fly ash is used also as a <b>filler</b> to replace <b>sand</b> in concrete production, unbeneficiated fly ash with higher LOI can be also used. Especially important is the ongoing quality verification. This is mainly expressed by quality control seals like the Bureau of Indian Standards mark or the DCL mark of the Dubai Municipality.|$|R
