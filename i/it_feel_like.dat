5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E

500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{said that}} both [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and the earlier single [...] "Poker Face" [...] are {{comparable}} with the musical styles of first single [...] "Just Dance" [...] {{but added that}} [...] "never once does <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> Gaga is deliberately repeating herself; instead, her faults only come from covering territory that she's obviously not prepared for." [...] Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post said that even though Gaga turns somewhat serious while disapprovingly singing [...] "Paparazzi", the song comes across as flat and faceless as well as vapid. Erika Howard of the New Times Broward-Palm Beach called it the most telling track from the album.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Love. Angel. Music. Baby., Stefani decided to release a studio album {{containing}} a mixture of leftover tracks and newly recorded ones, titled The Sweet Escape (2006). The record featured Stefani rapping on several tracks, but also contained the dance-pop genre that was explored on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.. It yielded two more top ten singles, [...] "Wind it Up" [...] and [...] "The Sweet Escape", both released in 2006; the latter track became the singer's second single to reach number two on the Billboard Hot 100, following her collaboration [...] "Let Me Blow Ya Mind" [...] with Eve in 2001. Themes from the record include fashion, in addition to romantic situations and details of her career and personal life. Stefani took a hiatus from her solo career to continue work on a sixth studio album with No Doubt, Push and Shove, which was released in late 2012. A line of non-album singles was released following the aforementioned record, including [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Spark the Fire", both released in 2014.

The sequence used [...] "muted and mottled, burnt umber and steel blue and cold grey" [...] colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the later created by Method Design) which were [...] "a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors" [...] and [...] "vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray", respectively.

500|$|Dead Head Fred {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics.

[...] IGN said [...] "The tale of revenge in a dark world is twisted [...] unapologetically humorous". [...] Other publications were not as impressed, however, with one reviewer stating [...] "...the overused profanity just makes <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it's been designed by teenagers desperately trying to be edgy." [...] The game's supernatural themes elicited comparisons to The Darkness and Grim Fandango. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation.

Commenting on the introduction of Oliver Queen's Green Arrow persona in the season six episode [...] "Arrow", IGN's Chris Carabott felt that the series took its time developing a character that fit {{the style of the}} show. Carabott acknowledged that Green Arrow's costume, though not exactly like in the comics, respects the spirit of the character in its design; the gadgets he uses make <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the producers are taking a page out of the Justice League Unlimited book, which makes for [...] "quality entertainment".|$|E

Five songs from the album were included in the poll's singles list, including [...] "Tightrope" [...] (number two), [...] "Cold War" [...] (number 22), [...] "Wondaland", [...] "Locked Inside", and [...] "Sir Greendown" [...] (all tied for number 549).|$|E
500|$|Unlike most {{anthropomorphic}} cars, {{the eyes}} of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, and the characters from Tex Avery's One Cab's Family short and Disney's own Susie the Little Blue Coupe), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, [...] "From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at {{the front end of the}} car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character. This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik.|$|E

Den of Geek's Simon Brew also gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "if you were awaiting a simple, easy-to-explain blockbuster of a Doctor Who series finale, you simply didn't get it here.

500|$|Bloody Fun Day {{received}} {{a positive response}} from video game critics. Psychotronic, reviewer for Jay is Games, called it [...] "an exceptionally well-crafted and deep game" [...] and [...] "refreshingly original", saying the developer [...] "gets more interesting with every new title". Kotaku Australia's David Wildgoose stated the game is [...] "rather addictive". Vue Weekly writer Darren Zenko stated that the game is addictive, finding himself playing for more than 8 hours in a day. Psychotronic disliked the lack of variety in levels, due to only one island shape being available and no enemies being present. He also highlighted the lack of special effects when using the reapers' abilities, since Cuties all die using the same animation {{regardless of whether they}} are killed with a reaper's scythe or a special ability.

[...] Troob elaborated, [...] "Beauty and the Beast was, for its time, very forward-looking, and 'Happy Working Song' is deliberately retro." [...] Troob decided to alter and deliberately steer the song away from Menken and Schwartz's original 1970s-inspired musical arrangement in an attempt to [...] "make <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the 1950s" [...] by [...] "manipulating instruments [...] textures." ...|$|E

He also praised the prison experiment subplot, writing that it [...] "introduced a who's who of recognizable guest stars, all of whom could clearly rerun on a show that loves to build a large cast of periphery characters."
