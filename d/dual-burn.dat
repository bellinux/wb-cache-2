40|$|Review of {{the results}} of a Mars surface-to-orbit launch vehicle study using an {{upgraded}} atmospheric density profile and an ascent trajectory optimization program. Orbit insertion was achieved with velocity losses less than those found in an earlier study. Values of thrust-to-mass ratio which minimize velocity losses for <b>dual-burn</b> vehicles were found to be significantly greater than the values of thrust-to-launch-mass ratio for the minimum-velocity-loss continuous-burn vehicle. The use of a two-stage solid-propellant vehicle employing a spin-stabilized second stage offers an attractive design option for a Mars surface-to-orbit launch vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the Cassini mission are to deliver a spacecraft into orbit about Saturn and a Probe into the atmosphere of Titan. Two fundamental constraints drive {{the design of the}} initial Saturn orbit and thus affect the mission performance. The first requirement is safe passage through the ring system upon Saturn arrival; the second is delivery of the Probe to Titan with an acceptable relative approach velocity. These constraints lead to the selection of a <b>dual-burn</b> insertion strategy, with maneuvers at periapsis and apoapsis of the initial orbit. Additional science goals constrain the Saturn arrival date and may affect the timing of the orbit insertion burn...|$|E
