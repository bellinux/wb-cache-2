We take 42 countries as our sample and collect six imperfect capital <b>market</b> <b>measures</b> (ICAM), ie., the stock market capitalization ratio, number of publicly-listed firm, stock turnover ratio, bank loan ratio, long-term debt ratio and the interest spread. Using a two-step approach, negative relationships between the sensitivity and the six imperfect capital <b>market</b> <b>measures</b> are found, but are significant only {{when the number of}} publicly-listed firms, the bank loan ratio, and the turnover ratio are used as the imperfect capital <b>market</b> <b>measure.</b> We also find that the bad “legal environment indicators (macro governance) ” increases cash-flow sensitivity. The fast real GDP growth, however, has no effect on the cash-flow sensitivities. Hence, an increase in capital market depth and better macro governance will reduce the cash-flow sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} some {{insights}} into the acceptability of <b>marketing</b> <b>measures</b> in public transport. In a stated choice experiment {{respondents were asked to}} evaluate three different measures: fare adjustment, seat guarantee, and extra service. All <b>marketing</b> <b>measures</b> were specified in combination with a certain time period and number of bus lines. More than 560 respondents living in the region of North-Holland participated in the experiment. The choices were analyzed using binary logit models. The results indicate that respondents are not very sensitive to differences in time period, number of bus lines, and the distinguished levels of the <b>marketing</b> <b>measures.</b> The most important measure is fare adjustment. Some differences between public transport users and non-users are found. Public transport users prefer a fare adjustment on one specific bus line most. Respondents who do not use public transport prefer a 100 percent seat guarantee during 12 months on all bus lines...|$|R

Results of the study indicate that director ownership and foreign ownership have non-linear relationship with MTBV using quadratic function. While family ownership and ownership by government-linked investment companies have linear relationship. Director ownership has negative relationship which indicate the entrenchment effect at the lower stake. However, director ownership has positive relationship meaning the alignment effect occurs at the higher stake. However, foreign ownership has alignment effect at the lower stake and entrenchment effect at the higher stake. Government-linked investment companies has negative relationship.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{financial}} reports on stock market behavior {{is a central}} issue of research in accounting and finance. A number of studies investigate how financial information becomes impounded in security prices and affects investment decisions. Prior studies on the determinants of the bid-ask spread investigate the effect of <b>market</b> risk <b>measures,</b> and provide evidence that the bid-ask spread is a positive function of risk. Other studies report on an association between <b>market</b> risk <b>measures</b> and accounting risk measures. The present study extends this line of research by examining the effect of risk, proxied by accounting risk measures, on the bid-ask spread. The results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions provide evidence of a statistically significant association between certain accounting ratios and the bid-ask spread, and indicate that accounting risk measures account for more variability in the bid-ask spread than <b>market</b> risk <b>measures.</b> Most notably, {{the results indicate that}} a model which includes both accounting risk <b>measures</b> and <b>market</b> risk <b>measures</b> is a better fitted model that one which includes either accounting risk <b>measures</b> or <b>market</b> risk <b>measures</b> alone...|$|R

The differences in success measures become apparent, and especially when comparing works from the fields of general management and finance research. Moreover, the difference between accounting-based and market-based measurements {{plays an important role}} when reviewing studies on turnaround outcomes. Eberhart et al. (1999) find that market-based measures yield positive abnormal returns after Chapter 11 bankruptcy for US firms, a success measure primarily employed in the finance research field. However, Hotchkiss (1995) offers contradictive results that employ accounting measures, predominantly used in general management research. Although scholars rely on <b>market</b> <b>measures</b> to argue that relative and absolute accounting measures can be subject to managerial manipulation, the counterparty claims <b>market</b> <b>measures</b> are biased by expectations (Eberhart et al. 1999; Franzen et al. 2007; Furrer et al. 2007).|$|R
