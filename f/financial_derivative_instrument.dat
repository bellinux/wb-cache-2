Uncertain finance is a new field where the risk processes are described by uncertain processes. An asset price is assumed to follow a specific uncertain differential equation other than a stochastic differential equation. In this paper, Asian option models are proposed for uncertain financial market. Besides, Asian option pricing formulae are derived and some mathematical properties are investigated. Since the average price {{is presented in the}} Asian pricing formula which is difficult to compute, Yao-Chen formula is employed to solve this problem.

30|$|Recently, credit {{derivatives}} {{have become an}} important means of managing international bank and financial market credit risk. Loan credit default swaps (LCDS), first promoted in America and subsequently in Europe by the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA), by 2006 had become a powerful <b>financial</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>instrument</b> in the dispersal, transfer and hedging of mortgage loan credit risk. Credit Loan Default Swaps have the particularity that their reference entity is the mortgage loan. It is widely believed that {{credit derivatives}} to some extent were {{to blame for the}} 2007 sub-prime debt crisis in the United States. They did, however, also serve to objectively isolate the financial institutions, especially in the banking system, from risks, thereby freeing many banks from possible default bankruptcies. Credit derivatives should be carefully developed to create optimal conditions to lighten the impact of loan risk for banks. We should learn from the sub-prime debt crisis in the United States to enhance supervision in the credit derivatives market, we should research thoroughly the pricing theory of credit derivatives under conditions of incomplete information to achieve optimal pricing, and we should build a more effective model to better resemble the real financial market.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose or}} {{objective}} of this dissertation was to analyse the current income tax treatment of <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> in South Africa. In the context of <b>financial</b> markets, <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> are mainly used for hedging and speculation. The dissertation considers whether the current South African Income Tax Act deals with the income taxation of derivatives with respect to gains and losses and the timing of those gains and losses. With regards {{to the nature of}} gains and losses arising from derivative transactions, the aspect which was considered is whether gains and losses were of a capital or revenue nature in the context of speculation or hedging. With regards to the timing of gains or losses, the dissertation considers when gains and losses should be brought into taxable income of a taxpayer. The following examples of <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> were analysed: cross currency swaps, index options, credit default swaps and contracts for differences (CFDs). These derivatives were analysed with respect to the nature and timing of the gains or losses when hedging or speculating.

40|$|Until {{reporting}} periods ending on or after 31 December 1997, disclosure of financial instruments was unregulated in Australia. This thesis examines moti. v ati. n g factors for Australian firms' voluntary <b>derivative</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures during the unregulated reporting regime spanning 1992 - 1997. It proposes that managers' disclosure strategies are {{a consequence of}} explicit and implicit contractual arrangements aimed at protecting and enhancing individuals'and firms' financial reporting reputations and maximising firm value. Aims Financial statement preparers' preferences can be revealed through voluntary reporting practices andlor lobbying activity. By investigating firms' voluntary disclosure practices in response to proposed accounting regulation and professional requirements, this study contributes to understanding costlbenefit tradeoffs with respect to information disclosures. Specifically, the thesis examines two dimensions of voluntary <b>derivative</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures. The first dimension focuses on predicting {{the degree to which}} Australian firms comply with the disclosure requirements contained in an exposure draA (ED 65) and an Industry Statement issued by Australian accounting standard setting bodies and the Australian Society of Corporate Treasurers (ASCT) respectively. The thesis examines disclosures longitudinally, transcending' {{reporting periods}} where the disclosures are purely voluntary to periods where coercive pressure is exerted on firms for transparency in relation to their <b>derivative</b> <b>instrument</b> activities. It tests whether changes in derivative disclosures across the different reporting regimes are significantly associated with changes in disclosure pronouncements. The thesis then tests for systematic differences in the characteristics of high and low disclosure firms. The tests use variables grounded in costly contracting theory as well as variables developed using a legitimacy framework. This extends the extant literature by: (a) simultaneouslayp piying these alternate frameworks; and (b) applying legitimacy theory to a financial reporting issue, as distinct from a social or environmental issue. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this study are: (1) Why, and to what degree, do Australian entities voluntarily comply with the <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure requirements contained in ED 65 and the ASCT Industry Statement? (2) Are there any systematic differences in the characteristics of entities with high disclosure compliance versus low disclosure compliance in relation to <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments?</b> Scope The thesis studies the voluntary disclosure responses of Australian financial statement preparers to <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure requirements proposed by ED 65 and the ASCT Industry Statement. Given that regulation governing <b>derivative</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures did not become effective until reporting dates on or after 31 December 1997, this thesis studies voluntary disclosures in firms' 1992 - 1997 annual reports. Using a self-constructed disclosure index, firms are assigned an integer score determined by the presencelabsence in their annual report of a range of <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> information. The information score relates to policy, risk, and net market value disclosures. Conclusions A change in the number and quality of <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> disclosures during 1992 - 1997 reporting periods is evident. Early 1990 s <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures {{are more likely to be}} by large firms or firms in the extractive industry. The disclosures increase significantly in 1995, coinciding with the period when the ASCT Industry Statement and exposure draft are issued. This suggests that managers reassess <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure strategies in line with the increased probability of mandated disclosure requirements and the pressure on financial statement preparers to he professionally responsible. Firms subject to public scrutiny and firms with professional affiliations with the body issuing the industry statement and the Group of 100 companies are particularly responsive to the demand for <b>derivative</b> <b>instrument</b> activity transparency. Apart from firm leverage, variables grounded in costly contracting theory are generally not significant predictors of <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures. This study is significant in that the results highlight the potential for professional organisations, other than the accounting profession, to influence the content of financial information contained in annual reports. This is an important consideration for accounting regulators. It indicates the need of regulators to respond in a timely manner to financial accounting issues in order to maintain their credibility and legitimacy. Whilst other interpretations may be possible, the findings also highlight the importance managers attach to firms' <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures as a means of personal and corporate reputation and legitimacy maintenance and enhancement. Furthermore, the study introduces firm attributes that are new to financial accounting disclosure choice studies and in doing so demonstrates the benefits of simultaneously applying alternative paradigms to voluntary reporting issues...|$|R

BA is facing financing and interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, fuel price risk, credit risk and other risks. Therefore, BA employs a mixture of swaps, options, forward and futures to hedge against these risks. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against near-term foreign exchange risk, uses interest rate swaps to hedge against financing and interest rate risks, and uses a number of derivatives that are available the over the counter markets (such as options and forward contracts). During the financial year of 2006, the derivatives used by BA were generally found to be effective. Moreover, a numerical example is used to show how forward/futures and options can protect BA against the movement of fuel price risk.

40|$|The {{profits of}} many {{businesses}} are strongly affected by weather related events, and insurance against weather related risks (acts of God) {{has been a}} traditional domain for transfer of (certain) of these risks. Recent innovations in the capital market have now provided financial instruments to transfer and hedge some of these risks. Unlike insurance solutions, however, using these <b>financial</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>instruments</b> creates {{a situation in which}} the return to the purchaser of the instrument is no longer perfectly correlated with the loss experienced. Such a mismatch creates new risks which must be examined and evaluated as part of ascertaining cost effective risk management plans. Two newly engendered risks, basis risk (the risk created by the fact that the return from the <b>financial</b> <b>derivative</b> is a function of weather at a prespecified geographical location which may not be identical to the location of the firm) and credit risk (the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract may not perform), are analyzed in this article. Using custom tailored derivatives from the over the counter market can decrease basis risk, but increases credit risk. Using standardized exchange traded derivatives decreases credit risk but increases basis risk. Here also the effectiveness of using hedging methods involving forwards and futures having linear payoffs (linear hedging) and methods using derivatives having nonlinear payoffs such as those involving options (nonlinear hedging) for the purpose of hedging basis risk are examined jointly with credit risk.
