5|$|Peak oil, an <b>event</b> <b>based</b> on M. King Hubbert's theory, is {{the point}} in time when the maximum rate of {{extraction}} of petroleum is reached, after which {{it is expected to}} enter terminal decline. Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise, peak, fall, and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time. It is often confused with oil depletion; however, peak oil {{is the point}} of maximum production, while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{large and}} {{damaging}} tsunami that was generated {{was out of}} proportion relative {{to the size of}} the <b>event,</b> <b>based</b> on its short-period body wave magnitude. The Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency assigned a magnitude of 6.8, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a similar value of 6.1 (both body wave magnitude) that were calculated from short-period seismic waves (1–2 seconds in the case of the USGS). The USGS then presented a moment magnitude of 7.2 that was calculated from 5–100-second surface waves, and Harvard University subsequently revealed that a moment magnitude of 7.7 had been resolved based on even longer 150-second surface waves.|$|E

5|$|Hata's major {{contribution}} to Nanking Massacre studies is his book Nankin jiken ("The Nanking Incident"), published in 1986, {{which is a}} detailed study of the <b>event</b> <b>based</b> on Japanese, Chinese, and English sources that was later noted by historians such as Daqing Yang {{to be one of}} the few impartial works of scholarship written on the massacre during the period. The book is known for its relatively low estimate of the death toll, which Hata put at up to 40,000 because he based the number of civilian killing on the work of Lewis S.C. Smythe who conducted survey of massacre in the immediate aftermass (War Damage in Nanking Area, Dec.1937 to March 1938, Urban and Rural Surveys) and also exclude Chinese soldiers. Hata's book is acknowledged as the first to discuss what might have caused the massacre, whereas previous books had focused only on the event itself. Hata argued that the Japanese Army's lack of military police and facilities to detain POWs, its ignorance of international laws, and the Chinese General Tang Shengzhi's decision to flee the city without formally surrendering, which left large number of plain-clothes soldiers within the civilian population which was followed by excessive mopping-up operations by the Japanese, among the factors which led to the slaughter.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, WWE premiered a new {{pay-per-view}} <b>event</b> <b>based</b> around inter-brand matches. At the time, The Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw {{after winning}} the United States Champion and was subsequently booked against SmackDowns Intercontinental Champion, John Morrison. In the build up to their first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of The Dirt Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable to the successful Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty. At Bragging Rights, Miz pinned Morrison to become {{the only member of}} the Raw roster to win an interpromotional match. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner. At the Tribute to the Troops in December, Miz rolled up Morrison for the win in a singles match. The two had another match the following March, when John Morrison and his new partner R-Truth challenged for the Unified Tag Team Championships held by The Miz and the Big Show. Morrison was finally able to defeat The Miz in a singles match, however Morrison could not pick up the victory for the titles at WrestleMania XXVI.|$|E

Two-time Olympian Amro El-Geziry, who finished behind Hamad at the African Championships, and his younger brother Omar ranked among the top 10 modern pentathletes, not yet qualified, in the men's <b>event</b> <b>based</b> on the UIPM World Rankings as of June 1, 2016. With the Egyptian men to guarantee their selection at the 2016 World Championships, the choice of four modern pentathletes going to the Games was determined by the NOC.

25|$|High Adventure is {{an event}} run by the Leicestershire Scout County in March of each year. The {{location}} of the event is kept secret until the Explorers arrive at base camp on Friday evening. Recent events {{have been in the}} Brecon Beacons and mid Wales. Saturday is an orienteering <b>event</b> <b>based</b> on the hills. A number of manned check points are in place. Groups then spend a night at a wild camp before getting up on Sunday to take part in various challenges and activities {{on the way back to}} base camp. The group with the highest score wins, with another award being given to the team that has shown the best skills, or just enjoyed the event the most. In the 1990s the event attracted approx 40 groups of Venture Scouts from across the country. After being restarted in 2009, it has attracted between 20 and 25 groups from Leicestershire.|$|E

The latter total was estimated as a one-in-1,147-year <b>event,</b> <b>based</b> {{on the history of}} local rainfall totals. In the city of Baguio, the precipitation reached , enough to flood the town [...] deep. The Binga and Ambuclao dams in Benguet were unable to support the rains from the storm, forcing them to be opened and flood three towns in neighboring Pangasinan. Minor street flooding occurred along the west coast near Manila.|$|E
500|$|Israel entered one triathlete {{to compete}} at the Games, {{signifying}} the nation's Olympic debut in the sport. [...] Ron Darmon was ranked among the top 43 eligible triathletes in the men's <b>event</b> <b>based</b> on the ITU Olympic Qualification List as of 15 May 2016. On the topic {{of being the first}} Israeli triathlete at the Olympics, he said [...] "Records can be broken but being the first one, that can never be taken away. I'm pretty happy about that." [...] He also said that he did not expect to qualify for Rio, and that he expected his first Olympic qualification to be for Tokyo. Darmon trains in Australia with coach Warwick Dalziel. He received surgery for a broken collarbone in 2015 and had to train to get back in Olympic form. He placed 26th out of 55 participants, with a total time of 1:48.41, 3:40 behind the winner.

Laetitia Beck (world no. 237) {{qualified}} directly {{among the top}} 60 eligible players for the women's <b>event</b> <b>based</b> on the International Golf Federation (IGF) World Rankings as of 11 July 2016. This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, but i think what i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful." [...] Beck finished tied for 31st with a score of two over par. Her best round was the third round, where she was tied for 13th place.|$|E
500|$|But the [...] "free floating" [...] {{hypothesis}} presented its own difficulties; it did {{not explain}} the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating {{from the rest of}} the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank [...] "within a couple of years" [...] of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated, an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see Ongoing investigation below). Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the river bank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed. The Cooper Research Team later challenged Palmer's conclusion, citing evidence that the clay layer was a natural deposit. That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the <b>event</b> (<b>based</b> on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the <b>event,</b> <b>based</b> on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E
