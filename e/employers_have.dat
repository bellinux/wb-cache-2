25|$|South Africa has a {{progressive}} income taxation system {{which is based}} on the premise that the wealthy should contribute a greater proportion towards supporting the State than the poor. This means that the more a person earns the higher percentage tax they pay. By law all <b>employers</b> <b>have</b> to register all employees as taxpayers regardless of their tax liability. In terms of individual income tax South Africans pay the 31st highest average income tax rate in the world.|$|E
25|$|Over recent years, many <b>employers</b> <b>have</b> {{closed their}} {{defined benefit schemes}} to new members, and {{established}} defined contribution or money purchase arrangements instead. In this arrangement, the employer (and sometimes also the employee) makes regular payments (typically a percentage of salary) into a pension fund, and the fund is used to buy a pension when the employee retires. So the amount of pension depends {{on a number of}} factors including the accumulated amount of the fund, interest rates and projected mortality rates at the time the individual retires.|$|E

In March 2009, the New Zealand High Court associate justice David Gendall allowed for the serving of legal papers on Craig Axe by the company Axe Market Garden via Facebook. <b>Employers</b> <b>have</b> also used Facebook as a means to keep tabs on their employees and have even been known to fire them over posts they have made.|$|E

Their factory on Hollis Lane is now a housing estate and the former offices were converted into flats and serviced office suites. Dema Glass's factory near Lockoford Lane shut as is now host to a Tesco Extra and the Proact Stadium, Chesterfield F.C.'s new home ground. GKN closed its factory and the site is now being turned into a business park.|$|E
25|$|Michigan saw a {{sharp decline}} in the labor force {{starting}} in 2008 and lasting until 2011, which resulted in 800,000 jobs lost. In 2009, Michigan's unemployment rate hit a record-high 14.2 percent. During that same period Michigan saw its population base shrink. In 2011, Bolger worked with Republicans in the house to pass tax, education and pension reform measures, and <b>employers</b> <b>have</b> responded positively to the changes. Since the reforms were passed in 2011, more than 300,000 jobs returned to the state. During Bolger's time as Speaker from 2011 through 2014, Michigan had the fifth highest job growth in the nation, and the state's unemployment rate decreased to 6.7 percent.|$|E

25|$|The Act {{revised the}} Wagner Act's {{requirement}} of employer neutrality, to allow employers to deliver anti-union messages in the workplace. These changes confirmed an earlier Supreme Court ruling that <b>employers</b> <b>have</b> {{a constitutional right}} to express their opposition to unions, so long as they did not threaten employees with reprisals for their union activities nor offer any incentives to employees as an alternative to unionizing. The amendments also gave employers the right to file a petition asking the Board to determine if a union represents a majority of its employees, and allow employees to petition either to decertify their union, or to invalidate the union security provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} view of {{the labor}} market has low-wage labor markets characterized as monopsonistic competition wherein buyers (<b>employers)</b> <b>have</b> significantly more market power than do sellers (workers). This monopsony could be a result of intentional collusion between employers, or naturalistic factors such as segmented markets, search costs, information costs, imperfect mobility and the personal element of labor markets. In such a case a simple supply and demand graph would not yield the quantity of labor clearing and the wage rate. This is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged, instead of using the upward labor supply curve shown in a supply and demand diagram, monopsonistic employers would use a steeper upward sloping curve corresponding to marginal expenditures to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition. Also, the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation.|$|E
25|$|Unions and <b>employers</b> <b>have</b> also {{employed}} arbitration {{to resolve}} employee and union grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America made arbitration a central {{element of the}} Protocol of Peace it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second {{decade of the twentieth}} century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during World War II, when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The War Labor Board, which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy in three cases which {{came to be known as}} the Steelworkers' Trilogy. The Court held that grievance arbitration was a preferred dispute resolution technique and that courts could not overturn arbitrators' awards unless the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. State and federal statutes may allow vacating an award on narrow grounds (e.g., fraud). These protections for arbitrator awards are premised on the union-management system, which provides both parties with due process. Due process in this context means that both parties have experienced representation throughout the process, and that the arbitrators practice only as neutrals.

Historically the major <b>employers</b> <b>have</b> been the salt industry and agriculture. [...] Salt is still manufactured at British Salt, which employs around 125 people. The {{close proximity to}} the M6 motorway has {{led to the creation of}} a large distribution and business park, with companies such as Tesco and ERF locating to the site.
