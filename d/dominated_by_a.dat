5|$|Although {{the first}} {{municipal}} council of Gaza {{was formed in}} 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities. Like other regions and cities in Palestine at the time, Gaza was economically and politically <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> number of powerful clans, particularly the Shawa, Husseini, and Sourani families. Two destructive earthquakes occurred in 1903 and 1914.|$|E

The campaign was overseen by Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, whom Bo had worked with previously in Liaoning.|$|E

The following year, Charles also forced Donch to renounce his two fortresses in Zólyom in exchange for one castle in the distant Kraszna County (in present-day Romania).

Ironically, by 1943, the Court was often <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> equally infamous team of economic radicals who favored government regulation at seemingly all costs — Even at the expense of judicial review...|$|R
5|$|Granvin is a port on the Hardangerfjord and was {{the center}} for freight {{transport}} in Hardanger. Hardanger is <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small number of large industrial companies, primarily smelters, which were responsible for more than 80 percent of the line's cargo volume. While Hardanger in the 1980s had a population of 40,000, Granvin had a population of 1,000 {{and was the}} smallest municipality in Hardanger. Granvin served as a ferry hub for services by Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap (HSD), and in 1980 there up to two daily services with the local ferry services in Hardanger, in addition to fast ferries to both Bergen and Stavanger. Buses operated to Granvin from Norheimsund and Kvanndal.|$|E

Turkish Statistical Institute announced that 76.3 billion TL was spent for healthcare in 2012; 79.6 percent of which was covered by the Social Security Institution and 15.4 percent of which was paid directly by the patients. In 2012, there were 29,960 medical institutions in Turkey, and on average one doctor per 583 people and 2.65 beds per 1000 people.|$|E
5|$|Henn decided, {{before taking}} on a spiritual career, that he would become a teacher. He {{began his career as}} an {{assistant}} master at Hurstpierpoint College, West Sussex (one of the Woodard Schools, a series of eleven schools founded by Nathaniel Woodard). There, he became interested in education through religion, and became an ordained priest in 1891. He then became Chaplain at Hurstpierpoint in 1892. Henn became recognised as a teacher when he became a founding headmaster at Worksop College in Nottinghamshire; however he resigned in 1899 amidst differences with a new superior who disagreed with Henn's philosophy of a school grounds with beautiful buildings <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> chapel.|$|E

Workers are distinguished by productivity and preferences; firms are distinguished by productivity {{and ability to}} distinguish workers.

Within the class of strongly monotonic economies, there exists at least one efficient equilibrium. Under slightly stronger conditions, <b>an</b> equilibrium is <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> incomplete mechanism only if it can be <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> another equilibrium, that is, equilibria are Pareto optimal.

5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Medina {{surrendered}} peacefully to Roger I of Sicily {{after a short}} siege in 1091, and Malta {{was subsequently}} incorporated into the County and later the Kingdom of Sicily, being <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> succession of feudal lords. The fortifications of Mdina were rebuilt and modified {{a number of times}} over the following centuries. A castle known as the Castellu di la Chitati or the castrum civitas was built on the southeast corner of the city near the main entrance, probably on the site of an earlier Byzantine fort. The city withstood a siege by Hafsid invaders in 1429.|$|E
5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself {{did not always}} follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited is <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean civilization {{originated}} and {{evolved from}} the society {{and culture of the}} Early and Middle Helladic period in mainland Greece under influences from Minoan Crete. Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) {{a significant increase in the}} population and the number of settlements occurred. A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> warrior elite society, while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of megaron buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|South {{of where}} the Chile Rise intersects the Peru-Chile Trench, the trench disappears as it is {{increasingly}} buried by sediments. However, subduction is still active {{as evidenced by the}} converging motion of the Antarctic Plate and the South America Plate and the volcanic activity. Only around 52° does the convergence change into strike-slip faulting at the Shackleton Fracture Zone. Subduction in that area commenced 17 million years ago, and the Antarctic slab has not sunk deep into the mantle. At shallow depth, magma generation is dominated by anatexis of the slab. The mantle ahead of the edge of the subducting slab may be <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large slab window.|$|E
