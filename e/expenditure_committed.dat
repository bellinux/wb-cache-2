The total <b>expenditure</b> <b>committed</b> to the scheme by the government between 2011/12 and 2019/20 is £1.5 billion. £600 million of this had been spent by April 2017, with £900 million of the expenditure remaining. Research carried out in the spring of 2017 indicated that affluent individuals are less likely to attend university if they take part in NCS, while poorer individuals are more likely to do so. At that time the cost per participant of NCS was £1,863.|$|E

40|$|Heightened {{interest}} in the aging process by the public and scientific community has occurred due {{to the increase in}} percentage of elderly in the population and the increase in health care <b>expenditures</b> <b>committed</b> to the elderly [1]. Due to this increased interest, current research into aging demonstrates it as a complex process that is the result of interplay between naturally occurring processes, such as changes in hormonal levels and gene transcription that occur during the biological timeline of human development, and the exposure of our body’s systems to environmental damage [2]. At a physiological level, aging is the functional decay overtime of cells, organs and tissues, specifically through chemical damage of the cellular components proteins, DNA and lipids. The problems of aging include issues such as declining muscle tone and mass, wrinkled skin and mutant mitochondria.

40|$|The {{structure}} of {{each level of}} government in the United States {{has changed over the}} last 200 years. Wallis (2000) has presented empirical evidence that relates the dominance of each level not to the functions government decides to undertake (the <b>expenditures</b> it <b>commits</b> to), but to {{the costs and benefits of}} the financial instruments each level has available (the way each level extracts revenues). In this paper we provide theoretical evidence for this hypothesis. We show why two different levels of government (e. g. state and federal) would not want to use a common instrument to finance the same good. ...|$|R

This study uses the recent information on the trends in fertility and reproductive preferences to make a realistic future assumption on fertility. Since the total fertility rate (TFR) is distorted by the changes in the timing of child bearing, the initial level of TFR was adjusted in the projection assumption. Among the three assumptions used (high, medium and low) the medium variant shows that the fall in school going age population will be around 3. 29 lakhs between 1991 and 2001.

The author identifies five basic fears in humans: fear of being rejected, abandoned, humiliated, betrayed and the victim of an injustice. The stock market investor is confronted with the following fears: the disposition effect, the hedonistic approach, the effect of the <b>committed</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the snake bite effect, the dismissal of any regret (or the no regret approach), the status quo prejudice and the endowment effect. The author shows that the stock investor’s seven fears are specific cases of the five basic fears. The first step in confronting these fears is to become aware of the mask worn...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sharp {{deterioration}} in state finance {{during the last}} decade has been a matter of serious concern to policy makers in India. The {{deterioration in}} State finance is largely an outcome of {{the fact that in the}} fact of a limited resource-base the states had to cope with a significant growth in their <b>committed</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Correcting the fiscal imbalances today is the single most important object of the new economic policy in India. The crucial issue therefore is to bring out improvement in State finance with a view to restructuring the expenditure in favour of development expenditure in order to enable a higher growth. The states took policy measures which helped them to avoid further worsening of their fiscal position to some extent. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has set a target of reducing fiscal deficit to 3 % of GDP for States latest by 2014 - 15. The present study attempts to bring out the emerging trends in state finances of India in recent years...|$|R

METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study was carried out with 1, 720 adults living in the urban area of Florianópolis, Southern Brazil, in 2009. Cluster sampling was adopted and census tracts were the primary sampling units. Use of medicines and the expenditures incurred in their purchase in the past 30 days were investigated through interviews. Use, expenditures and the income committed concerning medicines were analyzed according to per capita family income, self-reported skin color, age and sex, adjusting for the complex sample. RESULTS: The prevalence of medicine use was 76. 5 % (95 %CI: 73. 8; 79. 3), higher among women and in older individuals. The mean expenditure on medicine was R $ 46. 70, with higher values among women, whites, older individuals and among richer people. While 3. 1 % of the richest committed more than 15 % of their income to purchasing medicine, that fi gure reached 9. 6 % in the poorest group. The proportion of people that had to buy medicines after an unsuccessful attempt to obtain them in the public health system was higher among the poor (11. 0 %), women (10. 2 %) and the elderly (11. 1 %). ...|$|R

This study uses the recent information on the trends in fertility and reproductive preferences to make a realistic future assumption on fertility. Since the total fertility rate (TFR) is distorted by the changes in the timing of child bearing, the initial level of TFR was adjusted in the projection assumption. Among the three assumptions used (high, medium and low) the medium variant shows that the fall in school going age population will be around 3. 29 lakhs between 1991 and 2001. However, there will be an increase in the school age population of around 2. 37 lakhs between 2001 and 2006 and 1. 54 lakhs between 2001 and 2011. Therefore, the fruits of fertility decline will be realized fully after the year 2011 only. In that context, built up school space should not be diverted for use outside schooling purposes; but should be used within the same sector for qualitative upgradation. Decelerating birth rate and its expected impact upon primary school enrolment, by itself cannot be considered as cause enough to withdraw public investment. Such overall impact will hide within it, level-wise changes of demand for education, from lower to higher school classes, particularly within the relatively educationally 'backward' districts and communities. Therefore, the decelerating birth rate should be carefully monitored. Taking into account its trend and location, further public investment should be reoriented and rationalized. To close schools purely on the basis of decelerating demographic trends will be counterproductive to the nationally and internationally accepted objective of education for all.

40|$|The {{road network}} is {{extremely}} valuable. Road Administrationsare expected to invest maintenance funding {{in a way}} thatreturns maximum benefit to road users. Cost-benefit analysis isone method to ensure that an adequate return in terms ofbenefits results from <b>committing</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Today,cost-benefit calculations are frequently used as a base fordecision making of investments. The surges for such methods inthe maintenance management sector are increasing. Up to the present, one reason for not analysing costs andbenefits for various maintenance management measures has beenthe {{lack of knowledge about}} comfort benefits for road users inquantitative monetary terms. The aim with this thesis is toinvestigate motorists 9 ̆ 2 apprehension of pavementmaintenance management and winter maintenance operations. Thefinal goal is to find out their willingness to pay fordifferent levels of road maintenance management. Those valuescan later be used in cost-benefit calculations and also ineffect models of road maintenance management. Due to the pioneer status of this study, focus groups andin-depth interviews {{as well as a number}} of pilot studies havebeen carried out before a main survey with stated choiceexperiments could be designed. These exploratory studies showedthat the interviewees were familiar with the types of roadsurface damage that exist and in many cases mastered the sameterminology as the Road Administration and others. Showingpictures of well-known types of road damage lead to highermonetary valuations of getting better road standard incomparison with just text descriptions. One reason for thatcould be the requisite severness of the damage in order toillustrate a certain road maintenance shortage. The respondentswith the text descriptions could have stated their preferencesfor an, in their own minds, average shortcoming while the groupwith access to photograph of road damage all saw the samesevere damage. Illustrations of different road maintenancestandards make it possible to control the respondentsinterpretation of the maintenance management standard valuatedbut could lead to high monetary estimations. Driving comfort was very important to the interviewees inthe exploratory studies. That was manifested in the pilotstated choice surveys, which resulted in high willingness topay for better pavement management. The main study consisted of two surveys; the first one wasabout pavement maintenance management and was carried out inOctober to November 2000 and the second one took place inFebruary to March 2001 and was about winter maintenanceoperations. Both the pavement and the winter survey includedattitude questions and two stated choice experiments. Theresult showed that the maintenance management status of theroad network was important to car users. For example, the worstpavement damage was roughness; the motorists were willing topay 1. 7 SEK (Swedish Crowns) per kilometre to avoid roadsdamaged in their full length. The least harmful damage of thosestudied was cracks; the willingness to pay to avoid that was 0. 5 SEK per kilometre. For more rapid snow clearance, the carusers were willing to pay 60 to 80 SEK per year for getting theroads cleared from snow one hour earlier than the currentstandard implies. The willingness to pay for driving on bareroads in comparison with snow roads was 0. 4 SEK per kilometre. Statistical tests on the models showed that the parametervalueswere well estimated. In the pavement as well as in the winter survey, a clustergroup analysis was performed in order to test the heterogeneityof attitudes and behaviour to road maintenance management. Theanalysis resulted in two separate groups in each survey. Onegroup consisted of drivers who reported to be very influencedby the level of maintenance management regarding chosen speed,joy of driving and so on. The other group reported to be lessinfluenced and had lower acceptance of higher road tax for thepurpose to increase the maintenance management standard. Separate stated choice models revealed that the differences inattitudes could also reflect the respondents 9 ̆ 2 willingnessto pay for higher road maintenance standard. However, thedifferences were only small and the different groups 9 ̆ 2 monetary valuations were not found to be significantlydifferent from each other. The result of this study, better knowledge aboutmotorists 9 ̆ 2 apprehension of maintenance management, theirattitudes to driving comfort and road standard and theirmonetary valuations of different levels of pavement maintenanceand winter maintenance operations, opens up the possibility tomake cost-benefit analysis of various maintenance managementprojects. The impact of the monetary values found in this studyhas been studied in a limited cost-benefit analysis.
