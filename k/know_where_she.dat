5|$|In October 2012, Tanya and Max {{decide to}} remarry. Tanya wants Rainie {{to attend the}} wedding but doesn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> is and asks Cora to track her down. With help from Jack, Cora manages {{to get in touch}} with Rainie and {{arranges}} to meet her at a pub, but upon arriving, Rainie has sent her sponsor Olivia (Samantha Best), to the pub with a letter. Olivia explains that Rainie has been sober for 41 days and has a boyfriend. Rainie is pleased to have been invited to the wedding but declines to attend, stating that Cora is the reason for her alcohol and drug addictions, requesting that she will leave her alone from now on.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} {{of what happened}} subsequently, including the story that Clarence hid her in a London cookshop, disguised as a servant, so that his brother would not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was. Gloucester {{is said to have}} tracked her down and escorted her to sanctuary at the Church of St Martin le Grand. In order to win the final consent of his brother George to the marriage, Richard of Gloucester renounced most of Warwick’s land and property, including the earldoms of Warwick (which the earl had held in his wife’s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Carrisford and his Indian {{assistant}} Ram Dass {{have moved}} into {{the house next door}} to Miss Minchin's school. Carrisford had been Captain Crewe's friend and partner in the diamond mines. After the diamond mine venture failed, both Crewe and Carrisford became very ill, and Carrisford in his delirium abandoned his friend Crewe, who died of his 'jungle fever.' As it turned out, the diamond mines did not fail, but instead were a great success, making Carrisford extremely rich. Although Carrisford survived, he suffers from several ailments and is guilt-ridden over abandoning his friend. He is determined to find Crewe's daughter and heir, although he does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> is and thinks she is attending school in France or Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Derace Kingsley, {{a wealthy}} businessman, hires Marlowe {{to find his}} estranged wife, Crystal. Although {{separated}} from his wife, Kingsley fears that Crystal— rich, pretty, spoiled and reckless—may have become involved in a scandal that could jeopardise his position with the shareholders of the company {{of which he is}} an executive. The last definite place Crystal was known to have been was their vacation cabin on Little Fawn Lake. Kingsley had received a telegram from Crystal about two weeks before (dateline El Paso, Texas) stating that she was divorcing him and marrying her gigolo boyfriend, Chris Lavery. But when Kingsley ran into Lavery in L.A. and asked him where Crystal was, Lavery told him that he hadn't seen her, wasn't with her in El Paso, didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was, and never agreed, or wanted, to marry her.|$|E
25|$|Jobs then {{learned his}} family history. Six {{months after he}} was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, {{and they had a}} daughter, Mona. Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E
500|$|Some time later, Rose has a dream {{where she}} hears the Doctor's voice calling her. The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway called Bad Wolf Bay, where a {{holographic}} image of the Doctor appears. He tells Rose he is using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small breach between universes. Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him, and he responds, [...] "Quite right, too, and, I suppose, if {{this is my last}} chance to say it: Rose Tyler—"; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears. In the TARDIS, tears run down the Doctor's cheeks as he slowly regains his composure and sets a course. As he gets back to piloting the TARDIS, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room. With the Doctor shocked and confused, the mysterious bride angrily demands to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> is, leading to the events of [...] "The Runaway Bride".|$|E

500|$|The only named, {{speaking}} female {{character in}} the male-dominated film, Jasmine lacks both female companions and a motherly figure (the male characters account for 90% of the film's dialogue). The character has come to resent the patriarchal society in which she lives. Movies and the Mind: Theories of the Great Psychoanalysts Applied to Film author William Indick observed that Jasmine represents [...] "the rejection of the father-king's domination and control over his daughter's life", resembling [...] "a strong and assertive heroine who rebels against her father's tyranny rather than passively accepting his will." [...] Jasmine's life is almost entirely determined by men, by whom she refuses to be ordered, constantly voicing her disapproval by rejecting arrogant suitors and yelling at men who attempt to make decisions on her behalf, while challenging traditional gender roles and male authority figures. Jasmine's father, the Sultan, responds to his daughter's constant rejection of potential suitors with [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> gets it from. Her mother wasn't nearly so picky", indicating that Jasmine's mother [...] "belonged to a generation of docile pre-feminist... women." [...] At times Jasmine can seem judgmental; she originally has a thoroughly negative opinion of all princes until she meets a disguised Aladdin. In Ulrich Marzolph's book The Arabian Nights Reader, the author described the character as [...] "the mouthpiece of opposition to a vaguely defined Middle Eastern backwardness and authoritarianism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "State leaders question Palin's qualifications," [...] the Juneau Empire, one of Alaska's main papers, reported that as governor, Palin was so frequently absent from {{work at the}} state capitol that, [...] "someone at the Capitol even printed up buttons asking, ‘Where's Sarah?’"; the article quoted Rep.

2500|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} (ca. 2015), in Yedioth Ahronoth, Raichel was asked about this and said: [...] "If you have a daughter and someone kidnapped her, you investigate that someone and your child's life is at risk. If she is my daughter, I would do whatever necessary to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> is {{and to get the}} information that would save her life. Regardless if that someone is Muslim, Jewish or Christian. It is an example of unnecessary harsh criticism. The intention of the things was taking out of context".|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 2011, Salahi {{reported}} Michaele {{missing and}} perhaps kidnapped after Michaele had phoned {{him to say}} that {{she was on her way}} to her mother's house, but, according to her mother, had not arrived. She was located soon afterward when law enforcement authorities discovered she had run off with Neal Schon, founding member & guitarist for the rock band Journey, and had not wanted Salahi to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was. [...] Michaele had met Schon earlier and had remained in a very close friendship with him.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Minogue {{has often been}} {{compared}} with her more successful sister, Kylie. Referring to the comparison, Minogue said: [...] "t is hard to be compared {{all the time to}} Kylie. On the other hand, however, people will always try to compare you to somebody. Look at Britney and Christina." [...] In an interview with Elle in April 2009, Kylie criticised X Factor judge Louis Walsh for his jibes at her sister: [...] "I'm so proud of my sister and it annoys {{the hell out of me}} when comparisons between us are made. In England you lot don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> came from. She was on TV every week from 7 years old. It makes it harder for her when she gets Louis Walsh's rather pathetic jibes – one of which is she hasn't had a hit record and that's just not true." [...] She also denied rumours that she did not get on with Cheryl Cole or former judge Sharon Osbourne as [...] "so cheap".|$|E
