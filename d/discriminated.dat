5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons <b>discriminated</b> against are equally <b>discriminated</b> against, and all persons not <b>discriminated</b> against are equally not <b>discriminated</b> against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E

For the discrete-time dynamic game, we give an approximation of the viability kernel by the maximal reachable set.

For the differential game, we compute an underapproximation of the viability kernel by the backward reachable set from a closed target. Then, we put forward an algorithm of the <b>discriminating</b> kernel using the relationship of the <b>discriminating</b> and viability kernels. This means that the victory domain can be computed because it is computed by the <b>discriminating</b> kernel. The novelty is that we give two algorithms of the <b>discriminating</b> kernel for a dynamic game that contains two control variables, not one control variable as in differential inclusion.|$|R

40|$|Selective {{stopping}} paradigms address selectivity in controlled behavior, {{as subjects}} stop certain responses or responses to certain stimuli. The literature has discussed 2 strategies for selective stopping. First, selective stopping may prolong the stop process {{by adding a}} discrimination stage (Independent Discrim-inate then Stop). Second, selective stopping may involve stopping nonselectively and then restarting the response if the signal is an ignore signal (Stop then <b>Discriminate).</b> We discovered {{a variant of the}} first strategy that occurred often in our experiments and previously published experiments: The requirement to <b>discriminate</b> stop and ignore signals may interact with the go process, invalidating the independent race model (Dependent <b>Discriminate</b> then Stop). Our experiments focused on stimulus selective stopping, in which subjects stop to one signal and ignore another. When stop and ignore signals were equally likely, some subjects used the Stop then <b>Discriminate</b> strategy and others used the Dependent <b>Discriminate</b> then Stop strategy. When stop signals were more frequent than ignore signals, most subjects used the Stop then <b>Discriminate</b> strategy; when ignore signals were more frequent than stop signals, most subjects used the Dependent <b>Discriminate</b> then Stop strategy. The commonly accepted Independent <b>Discriminate</b> then Stop strategy was seldom implemented. Selective stopping was either not selective (Stop then Discrim-inate), or interacted with going (Dependent <b>Discriminate</b> then Stop). Implications for the cognitive science, lifespan development, clinical science, and neuroscience of selective stopping are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{rational}} nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group. To satisfy the second stage, {{there must be a}} discernible basis of classification. All persons being <b>discriminated</b> against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not <b>discriminated</b> against. Examples of such features include gender, age, race, religion, seniority of professional qualification and area of residence. Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship. Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself, but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects, does not constitute classification. If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently, the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid. If there is an intelligible differentia, the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{approach}} that looks for the most <b>discriminating</b> points in horizontal, vertical, velocity and pressure trajectories. Then based on these <b>discriminating</b> points, we have made two composite feature sets i. e. (horizontal, vertical) and (velocity, pressure). Out of these two composite feature sets, one will be declared as the most <b>discriminating</b> composite feature set during the training phase. Finally the verification based on the selected <b>discriminating</b> composite feature will be performed. We believe that every signer has some <b>discriminating</b> points that a forger cannot mimic with certain pressure and velocity whereas these points are maintained by the genuine signer. So the verification based on these <b>discriminating</b> points can lead us to a better performance of the verification system. For a reliable verification system, comparison between forgery and genuine signer should {{be made on the}} basis of <b>discriminating</b> points rather than using all the sample points of each trajectory in the verification which means that all the points are given equal weights and there is always a possibility that the non-discriminating points can overshadow the effect of <b>discriminating</b> points. Experimental results demonstrate superiority of our approach in On-line signature verification in comparison with other techniques. 1...|$|R
