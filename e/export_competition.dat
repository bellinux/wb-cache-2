40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} interconnecting two (network) markets that previously were totally separated. In each market different capacity-constrained firms operate. Firms collude whenever it is rational {{for them to do}} so. We identify the maximum sustainable price in each of the two separate markets, {{as a function of the}} number of firms in the market, and of the vector of capacities. Interconnecting the two markets may bring about greater competition, but greater ability to collude as well. We establish conditions on the number of firms and on capacity constraints such that interconnection fosters collusion and decreases total welfare. In this case, the interconnection of two markets exports collusion, rather than <b>exporting</b> <b>competition.</b> Market integration does not always reduce the need to increase productive capacity. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the export}} demand and supply of German {{manufacturing}} industry is estimated {{for the period}} 1993 to 2005. The Johansen procedure (1991, 1994) is applied to estimate the long-run relationship in a VECM. Special {{attention is paid to}} the development of the German export prices being exposed to the competitive environment of fast growing countries like Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland. Since they offer similar high-technology products on the international export markets and are gaining the market share, German export prices are under downward pressure. The results show that German export prices grow at a slower pace than that of the competitors and that they are negatively influenced by the growing market share of the CEECs. On the export demand side, the empirical picture corresponds to the theoretical one displaying a less unity income elasticity of demand indicating the decreasing market share for German manufactures in the long run.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the competitiveness of}} the EU aquaculture sector, as {{a contribution to the}} wider review of EU aquaculture policy being carried out by the European Community institutions. EU aquaculture competes with its international equivalents, with outputs from capture fisheries, and more fundamentally within global food markets. With small exceptions, the sector invests in production within the EU, and as little of its product is <b>exported,</b> <b>competition</b> is so far primarily defined within EU markets. Whilst EU aquatic food consumption has risen over the past 10 years, with stable or declining capture fisheries supply, most of this increase has come from imports rather than growth of EU aquaculture. To substantially increase aquaculture production at competitive prices for mainstream EU markets will require larger entities capable of scale economies, although small and micro-enterprises can also provide niche products and help sustain rural and coastal livelihoods. As spatial expansion is highly constrained by environmental regulation and conflicts with other resource users, productivity gains will be important in increasing output. Technological solutions are emerging, but are costly, so under current conditions, investments {{are more likely to be}} made in lower-cost production systems in third countries that export to the EU...|$|R

Negotiating parties are concerned that food aid {{has been used as}} a form of <b>export</b> <b>competition</b> policy, and they seek the use of coercive WTO legislation to prevent the disposal of surplus agricultural commodities as food aid. Current Uruguay Round food aid guidelines are contrasted with the most recent Doha Development Agenda proposals, and the prospective effectiveness of new rules is assessed. Food aid rules will be difficult to enforce within the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Understanding. Also, exogenous policy changes in donor countries are reducing the relevance of rules that target food aid as a means of surplus disposal. The future of international food aid governance in the event of a Doha Round collapse is also discussed. agricultural trade, development economics, <b>export</b> <b>competition,</b> food aid, WTO, Food Security and Poverty, International Relations/Trade, O 13, O 19, Q 17, F 13,...|$|E

Although in principle, <b>export</b> <b>competition</b> with China could nevertheless have placed pressure on other Asian exporters, we argue that the striking feature of the data is the common movement between export growth from China and from other developing Asian economies. To the extent there is evidence of <b>export</b> <b>competition,</b> it is the period from about 1989 to 1993 : China's exchange rate depreciated sharply, Chinese export growth exceeded export growth of other Asian economies, and the composition of Asian exports (measured by export shares of various goods to the United States and [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of developing countries, the recent agreement reached at the 10 th WTO Ministerial at Nairobi related to <b>export</b> <b>competition,</b> including exports subsidies, food aid, export credits and guarantees, and state trading enterprises (STEs). The legal and economic aspects of the agreement are examined, and the relevance of banning agricultural export subsidies are noted. This eliminates some of the worst-case scenarios, if agricultural world prices continue to soften and the important margin of export subsidies still allowed under the WTO framework was to be used. But given the relatively longer transition period for some relevant products before export subsidies are completely banned, the paper argues for continued monitoring of the potential use of this instrument. The paper also discusses the other components of <b>export</b> <b>competition,</b> looking into the legal and economic aspects.
