Methods. The pharmacokinetics of i. v. and <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> NN 1731 was evaluated in eight minipigs, {{and the effects of}} dose and administration route of NN 1731 (i. v. 180 mg kg 21, n 6; <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 540 mg kg 21, n 4, or 2000 mg kg 21, n 6) vs vehicle (n 16) were studied on a liver laceration injury in pigs. To simulate a pre-hospital setting, the administration of NN 1731 was delayed by 1 min for <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> administration and 7 min for i. v. administration, at which time fluid resuscitation also began. Results. In the minipigs, NN 1731 exposure was similar after i. v. 180 mg kg 21 and <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 540 mg kg 21, with a bioavailability of 35 %. The injury and blood loss at 7 min was comparable between the four groups of pigs; however, after 60 min, the blood loss was lower in the i. v. treated animals: 1. 3 (0. 3) (i. v.) vs 2. 2 (0. 8) litres (<b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 540, <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> 2000, and vehicle) (P, 0. 001).

The paper aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms by comparing the differences between <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes in glucose utilization, lipid metabolism, {{and the role of}} BMP signaling pathway. Methods: Experiments were performed in porcine primary <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes in culture. The mRNA and protein expression patterns were determined respectively by Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Cytosolic triglycerides were examined by triglyceride assay. Results: The <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> preadipocytes consumed more glucose by expression of GLUT 1 and s. c. preadipocytes mainly utilized exogenic fatty acids for lipid synthesis by expression of LPL and FAT. Meanwhile, the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and lipolysis in s. c. preadipocytes increased more quickly than those in <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> preadipocytes. The expression patterns of the genes involved in BMP-Smad signaling pathway were consistent with those of the genes participated in adipocytes differentiation in both <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> and s. c. preadipocytes. Exogenous BMP 2 significantly increased, whereas Noggin and Compound C, remarkablely decreased the triglycerides content in <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> preadipoytes, without affecting s. c. preadipocytes.

Despite the systematic approach of T. <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> E., the large number of wound dressings available can introduce a level of confusion when dressing choices need to be made. Any simplification in dressing choice, for example by choosing a dressing system comprising of a limited number of dressings that are able to address all aspects of T. <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> E., would be a valuable resource for delivering effective wound care. This article reviews briefly the principles of T. <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> E. and describes the evidence for the use of a two-dressing, moisture balance-oriented dressing-based wound management system for the treatment of wounds and that addresses principle requirements of delivering T. <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> E...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{operational}} proficiency of the antimotion sickness drugs scopolamine, promethazine and d-amphetamine are tested using a computerized pursuit meter. Proficiency is not significantly affected by oral doses of 0. 25 mg or 0. 50 mg scopolamine but is descreased by oral or <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> doses of 25 mg promethazine.

The combination of 25 mg <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> promethazine, 25 mg oral promethazine and 10 mg d-amphetamine produces less performance decrement than oral or <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> doses of promethazine alone, though more performance decrement than a placebo. <b>I.</b> <b>M.</b> promethazine is adsorbed slowly and consequently may provoke drowsiness...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intracellular}} application of various concentrations of adenine nucleoside phosphates and nucleotide analogs on the M-type K current (<b>I</b> <b>M)</b> of single neurons isolated from sympathetic ganglia were studied. With 1 mM MgATP intracellularly <b>I</b> <b>M</b> decreased to 25 % of its initial level 39 min {{after the start}} of whole-cell recording. In the absence of ATP the current decreased more rapidly. Addition of glucose and pyruvate extracellularly was equivalent to adding 1 mM MgATP intracellularly. AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, at a concentration of 1 or 3 mM was unable to maintain <b>I</b> <b>M</b> in the absence of ATP.

40|$|Ertapenem (INVANZ) {{is a new}} once-a-day parental β-lactam {{antimicrobial}} agent that {{has been shown to}} be highly effective as a single agent for treatment of various community-acquired and mixed infections. The plasma pharmacokinetics of a 1 -g intramuscular (<b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> dose was compared with those of a 1 -g intravenous (i. v.) dose infused over 30 min, the recommended rate of i. v. infusion for comparison, and over 120 min, which more closely mimicked the time course for absorption of the <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> form. In a three-period crossover study (Part A), 26 healthy subjects received single doses of ertapenem administered <b>i.</b> <b>m.,</b> <b>i.</b> v. infused over 30 min, and i. v. infused over 120 min. Blood for ertapenem analysis was collected over 24 h postdose for each treatment. In Part B, these fasted subjects received a 1 -g <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> dose of ertapenem once daily for 7 days. Following a 1 -g <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> dose and a 1 -g i. v. dose infused over 120 min, the geometric mean area under the concentration curve from hour 0 to infinity (AUC 0 -∞) was 541. 8 μg · hr/ml following <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> administration and 591. 4 μg · hr/ml following a 120 -min infusion; the geometric mean ratio was 0. 92 with a 90 % confidence interval of 0. 88 to 0. 95. The geometric mean AUC 0 -∞ was nearly identical when 1 -g doses were infused over 30 or 120 min. Although the maximum concentration of drug in serum was somewhat lower following <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> administration than following i. v. administration, the shape of the plasma concentration profiles was roughly comparable at later time points. Ertapenem did not accumulate after multiple 1 -g <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> daily doses over 7 days. The geometric mean ratio for AUC 0 - 24 (day 7 /day 1) was 0. 98 with a 90 % confidence interval of 0. 94 to 1. 02. Thus, the relative bioavailability of the 1 -g <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> dose was 92 %.

40|$|Immunogenicity and {{protective}} efficacy of a DNA vaccine encoding Ag 85 A from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were compared in BALB/c and C 57 BL (B 6 and B 10) mice immunized by intramuscular (<b>i.</b> <b>m.)</b> needle injection or epidermal gene gun (gg) bombardment. In BALB/c mice, gg immunization could induce elevated antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses with plasmid doses 50 -fold {{lower than those}} required for <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> immunization. Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) secretion, however, was much lower in gg-immunized than in <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> -immunized BALB/c mice. On the other hand, C 57 BL mice reacted only very weakly to gg immunization, whereas elevated Ag 85 A-specific antibody, IL- 2, and IFN-γ responses (significantly higher than in BALB/c mice) were detected following vaccination by the <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> route. Antibody isotypes were indicative of Th 2 activation following gg injection of BALB/c and of Th 1 activation following <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> injection of C 57 BL mice. Finally, C 57 BL but not BALB/c mice were protected by <b>i.</b> <b>m.</b> Ag 85 A DNA immunization against intravenous M. tuberculosis challenge, as measured by reduced numbers of CFU in spleen and lungs, compared to animals vaccinated with control DNA. Gene gun immunization was not effective in either BALB/c or C 57 BL mice.
