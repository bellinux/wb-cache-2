It assesses the {{economic}} {{consequences of the}} <b>failure</b> <b>effects</b> of autonomous adaptation in response to extreme flood events. The study found that Bangladeshi farmers are highly resilient to extreme flood events, but the economic consequences of <b>failure</b> <b>effects</b> of autonomous crop adaptation on marginal farmers are large. The <b>failure</b> <b>effects</b> are defined as total input costs plus the small profit (otherwise) made from selling the small surplus remaining from subsistence needs. The total input costs increase {{with the number of}} flood events in the studied area. Total agricultural cost includes cost of seedlings, fertilizer, pesticides, land preparation, human labour and watering. The paper concludes that the economic loss accelerates food insecurity and could ultimately lead to human insecurity in Bangladesh, which could be exacerbated by the effects of climate change.

Belief-Desire-Intention {{agents in}} {{realistic}} environments may face un-predictable exogenous changes threatening intended plans and debilitative <b>failure</b> <b>effects</b> that threaten reactive recovery. In this paper we present the CAMP-BDI (Capability Aware, Maintaining Plans) approach, where BDI agents utilize intro-spective reasoning to modify intended plans in avoidance of anticipated failure. We also describe {{an extension of}} this approach to the distributed case, using a de-centralized process driven by structured messaging. Our results show significant improvements in goal achievement over a reactive failure recovery mechanism in a stochastic environment with debilitative <b>failure</b> <b>effects,</b> and suggest CAMP-BDI offers a valuable complementary approach towards agent robustness. ...|$|R

50|$|Validity in prescription-driven {{research}} is approached {{in different ways}} than descriptive research. The first difference deals with what some researchers call ‘messy situations’ (Brown 1992; Collins, Joseph, and Bielaczuc 2004). A messy situation is a real-life, a highly multivariate one is where independent variables cannot be minimized nor completely accounted for. In explanatory science, experiments are in controlled laboratories, where variables can be minimalized. The complex nature of a real-life intervention means that the success or <b>failure</b> (<b>effect)</b> of the intervention {{may be difficult to}} conclusively link to the intervention itself (cause). This aspect of knowledge claims from science is seen as extremely problematic for positivist scientists looking for explanations. However, scientists using a pragmatic paradigm respond to this concept in two ways; first by questioning the value of research carried out in a controlled situation (Brown 1992; Hodkinson 2004; Kelly and Lesh 2000; Perrin 2000; Susman and Evered 1978; Walker and Evers 1999; Zaritsky et al. 2003) and secondly, by looking at causal effects through a different perspective.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{analysis}} {{is useful to}} determine how effective various test processes are at the detection of latent and dormant faults. The method used to accomplish this involves {{an examination of the}} applicable failure modes {{to determine whether or not}} their effects are detected, and to determine the percentage of failure rate applicable to the failure modes which are detected. The possibility that the detection means may itself fail latent should be accounted for in the coverage analysis as a limiting factor (i.e., coverage cannot be more reliable than the detection means availability). Inclusion of the detection coverage in the FMEA can lead to each individual failure that would have been one effect category now being a separate effect category due to the detection coverage possibilities. Another way to include detection coverage is for the FTA to conservatively assume that no holes in coverage due to latent failure in the detection method affect detection of all failures assigned to the <b>failure</b> <b>effect</b> category of concern. The FMEA can be revised ifnecessary for those cases where this conservative assumption does not allow the top event probability requirements to be met.|$|E

(2006), Yadav (2007), and Itabashi-Campbell and Yadav (2009), allocation weights are linked to failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) using risk priority numbers (RPN), where factors are multiplied by each other to compute RPN. In these papers, linear scaling is assumed and reliability is not allocated in accordance with criticality or potential for improvement. Kim et al. (2013) put forth an approach for computing weights, where exponential transformation function is used {{in place of the}} ordinal 10 -item rate to compute failure severity, and where the exponential relationship between failure severity and <b>failure</b> <b>effect</b> is taken into consideration. The method focuses more intensely on subsystems with higher failure severity.

In the paper by Zhuang et al.

40|$|<b>Failure</b> {{mode and}} <b>effect</b> {{analysis}} {{has been applied}} in manufacturing and service industries but can still be improved. <b>Failure</b> mode and <b>effect</b> analysis is a common tool used to evaluate risk priority number; however, numerous scholars have doubted the effectiveness of <b>failure</b> mode and <b>effect</b> analysis and have thus proposed methods for correcting <b>failure</b> mode and <b>effect</b> analysis from its conventional formula. Because implemented actions can determine or influence resource allocation and its effects, completing one corrective action can occasionally simultaneously improve various failure modes. In this study, <b>failure</b> mode and <b>effect</b> analysis and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory were integrated to correct failure modes and increase their effectiveness.

A computer model was developed and validated by data from full-scale tests performed at UNL. The computer model {{was used to evaluate}} the performance and feasibility of the proposed B/A concept under conditions considered to be representative of those that would be encountered in the field. The possibility of a 2 ̆ 2 domino 2 ̆ 2 <b>failure</b> <b>effect</b> occurring as the result of retrofitting utility poles along a service line was addressed and analyzed. In addition, a design for a hardware device {{that is part of the}} proposed B/A concept is presented. The device was designed to increase the longitudinal static bending strength of the pole without significantly affecting its dynamic response to vehicular impacts. ^ The results of the study indicate that the possibility of a 2 ̆ 2 domino 2 ̆ 2 <b>failure</b> <b>effect</b> occurring are minimal due to the support that the conductors give to the upper portion of the pole after breakaway without breaking. A hardware device has been designed in a practical and inexpensive manner and offers a feasible alternative to keeping the reduction in the static bending strength of the retrofit B/A pole at a minimum. The computer simulation model indicates that the proposed B/A concept is greatly influenced by the condition of the soil that is placed around the pole. The B/A concept was shown to be successful. ...|$|E
