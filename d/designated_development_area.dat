50|$|By the 1960s it was {{considered}} that the mine had never been fully developed and there were several ore bodies that could be commercially exploited. The sett was investigated by Camborne Tin Limited which submitted an application to re-open the mine. It was thought that as it might employ some 400 people in a <b>designated</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Area</b> which had an unemployment rate of 6% {{there was a good}} chance that permission would be granted, but planning permission was refused because the local water company obtained part of its water supply from an adit flowing out of the old mine. The water company was encouraged to locate an alternative source, and it identified Loe Pool as a potential source, but this was opposed {{on the grounds that it}} was polluted by sewage. The cost of treating this led to another public enquiry which caused delays.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, Lumbini Park was {{constructed}} {{at a cost}} of INR 2.35 crores on 5 acre of land adjacent to Hussain Sagar. In 2000, the Buddha Purnima Project Authority (BPPA) was established to maintain specially <b>designated</b> <b>development</b> <b>areas</b> in Hyderabad. Among tourist attractions such as Necklace Road and NTR Gardens, Lumbini Park is being maintained by BPPA. To enhance the inflow of visitors, it constructed additional facilities for laser auditorium, boating facilities among other visually appealing features such as gardens and musical fountains. In 2006, the park was named as T. Anjaiah Lumbini Park in honour of the late Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.|$|R

5000|$|Yitzhak Rager, {{running as}} the Likud party's candidate, {{was elected to}} the mayoralty in 1989. He was re-elected and served until a total of eight years until his death.

5000|$|The {{overcrowding}} and {{deterioration of}} the pre-regulation terraced houses caused increasing concern. Local authorities were empowered by the Slum Clearance Acts to purchase unfit properties compulsorily and demolish them. This was a worthy lengthy process, as they had to prove the property fell {{within the meaning of}} the Act, and then compensate the landlord for the value of the land. Hundreds of cottages were cleared before the program was stopped in 1939. It restarted in 1955 on a larger scale. <b>Areas</b> were <b>designated</b> Comprehensive <b>Development</b> <b>Area,</b> and all was demolished- houses, factories, workshops, warehouses and chapels ...|$|R
50|$|In the mid-20th century, {{many local}} {{industries}} {{were closed and}} West Lothian was <b>designated</b> a Special <b>Development</b> <b>Area.</b> In such areas, extra financial inducements were offered by the British government to assist companies wishing to relocate. As a result, in 1961, the BMC — which consisted of the merged Austin Motor Company and Morris Motors — located a new truck and tractor plant in Bathgate rather than expanding their Longbridge plant as originally planned. The plant closed in 1986.|$|R
50|$|Large {{sections}} of the campus are built on and around grounds which once contained the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital. Following the 1940s Bruce Report, Townhead was <b>designated</b> a Comprehensive <b>Development</b> <b>Area</b> (CDA), and much slum housing was demolished. Some of the reclaimed land was rezoned for educational purposes {{in anticipation of the}} Royal College's growth into a university. The first of the modern-era buildings to be constructed were the Student's Union, James Weir and Thomas Graham buildings {{at the turn of the}} 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2011 land {{within the}} parish {{southwest}} of the village and adjoining {{the northern edge of}} Aylesbury was <b>designated</b> a 'major <b>development</b> <b>area</b> called Weedon Hill. When completed the housing development will include 850 houses, a local centre and a secondary school. Additionally, an extension of the Chiltern Line was constructed which included a new station, opened in 2008, called Aylesbury Vale Parkway. In 2010 the district council decided that from May 2011 the Weedon Hill development would form part of the new civil parish of Buckingham Park.|$|R
50|$|The first {{area to be}} {{developed}} was that now occupied by Valley Road, Willow Close and Curson Road. Mr Shepherd of Cherry Tree House applied for planning permission, but this was turned down {{on the grounds that}} Tasburgh was not <b>designated</b> as a <b>development</b> <b>area,</b> that housing would be intrusive on the landscape and that the land would be better used for agriculture. Mr Oliver, a Hempnall builder, appealed against the refusal pointing out that the land was light, stony and infertile and that there was a real demand for housing in the area. The tide now began to turn for neither Depwade Rural District Council nor the parish council objected to the appeal, this despite a local resident complaining that only five of the nine parish councillors had attended the relevant meeting and that the matter was not on the published agenda. Nevertheless, the appeal was dismissed, one of the grounds being that the school was due to close.|$|R
5000|$|In {{line with}} post-war {{gentrification}} {{going on in}} Glasgow at the time, and in line with recommendations from the Bruce Report, the 1960s saw great change in Townhead. Like Anderston and the Gorbals, Townhead was <b>designated</b> a Comprehensive <b>Development</b> <b>Area</b> (CDA), which meant {{that much of the}} existing buildings would be cleared and its population rehomed. New multi-storey housing in tower blocks replaced the slum tenements, whilst others were moved to new estates on the outer fringes of the city. As a result, very few of the original tenements in Townhead have survived. The Glasgow Inner Ring Road would also cut a tranche through the area, although the controversial eastern flank (which would have literally wiped out a whole tranche of the present day Merchant City) was abandoned in the late 1970s. The plans also entailed the complete demolition and rebuilding of Glasgow Royal Infirmary, however the scheme was eventually scaled back and the original Victorian hospital was given an indefinite stay of execution. The artist Joan Eardley captured much of this redevelopment from her studio in Townhead. Review of Joan Eardley's Townhead ...|$|R
