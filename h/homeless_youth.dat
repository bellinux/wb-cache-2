The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label, songs that were not included on albums, {{as well as a}} few early versions and previously released B-sides. In the United States, the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic's 15th best-reviewed album of 2007. A portion of the proceeds from album sales were to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in Portland, Oregon.|$|E

25|$|<b>Homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in the United States who {{identify}} as LGBT {{are more likely}} to be victims of crime than heterosexual <b>homeless</b> <b>youth.</b> For example, a 2002 study using structured interviews of <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in the Seattle area found that male LGBT youth were more often sexually victimized while homeless than non-LGBT male youth. A 2004 study using interviews of <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in eight midwestern cities determined that lesbian adolescents experiencing homelessness were more likely to report physical victimization than their heterosexual female counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} shows that LGBT <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> {{may be more likely}} to abuse substances than their heterosexual counterparts. For example, a 2002 study using structured interviews of <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in the Seattle area found that in the past six months, sexual minority youth had used each tested substance (including marijuana, cocaine/crack, acid, ecstasy, and several others) more frequently than heterosexual youth. That being said, a 2008 study that used interviews of substance-abusing <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in the Southwestern United States found no significant difference in drug use between heterosexual and gay, lesbian and transgender youth within its sample.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{federal funds}} are {{allocated}} to organizations that provide shelter {{and services to}} <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in the United States through two major programs: The Runaway Youth Act, first implemented in 1974 and reauthorized in 2003 as the Runaway, Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act, and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. According to the Center for American Progress, there are currently no mandates that these funds be provided to shelters that do not discriminate against LGBT youth, meaning some federal funding is provided towards organizations with explicitly anti-gay or anti-transgender stances, {{which can lead to}} denial of care or the sending of youth to sexual orientation conversion therapy. The government spends $4.2 billion annually on homeless assistance programs, but less than 5% of this funding ($195 million) is allocated for homeless children and youth. Only part of this goes to serve unaccompanied <b>homeless</b> <b>youth,</b> and none is specifically allocated to target the needs of LGBT <b>homeless</b> <b>youth.</b> There are currently no federal programs or policies designed to specifically meet the needs of or protect LGBT <b>Homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in the United States.|$|E

RESULTS: Approximately 28 % of street youths and 10 % of shelter youths reported having participated in survival sex, which was associated with age, days away from home, victimization, criminal behaviors, substance use, suicide attempts, sexually transmitted disease, and pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive and ongoing services are needed to provide resources and residential assistance to enable runaway and <b>homeless</b> <b>youths</b> to avoid survival sex, which is associated with many problem behaviors...|$|R

25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{a disproportionate number of}} <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> in the United States {{identify}} as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or LGBT. Researchers suggest that this is primarily a result of hostility or abuse from the youth's families leading to eviction or running away. In addition, LGBT youth are often at greater risk for certain dangers while homeless, including being the victims of crime, risky sexual behavior, substance abuse, and mental health concerns. LGBT <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> experience limited access to emergency housing options that affirm their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and according to a Note for the Family Court Review recommending policies regarding such housing options, as many as fifty percent of LGBT youth in emergency housing programs may be physically assaulted, a proportion further exacerbated at large shelters that house two hundred or more youth. In addition, <b>homeless</b> <b>youth</b> emergency housing programs may lead to the denial of services to LGBT youth under the religious aspects of this orientation of the individuals.|$|E

Other efforts include the Child Abuse and Treatment Act of 1974, the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. There has also been a decline of arrest rates in street youth, dropping in 30,000 arrests from 1998 to 2007.
