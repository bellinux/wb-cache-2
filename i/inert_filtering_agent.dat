The proposed system architecture contains several components mainly: the interface <b>agent,</b> learning <b>agent,</b> <b>filtering</b> <b>agent,</b> searching agent, user profile, text information extractor, and others. The evolutionary mechanism of the proposed system {{is based on the}} concepts of genetic algorithms (GAs). New <b>filtering</b> <b>agents</b> are created by the genetic operators such as crossover and mutation. The <b>filter</b> <b>agent</b> <b>filters</b> the obtained results and lists to the user a reduced number of documents with high probability of being relevant to him/her. That filtering is based on a user profile such that the learning agent builds by analyzing the document examples presented by the user.

40|$|A fully {{differentiated}} epithelium {{having the}} features of epidermis was obtained in vitro by culturing second-passage normal human keratinocytes (NHK) in the chemically defined medium MCDB 153 on <b>inert</b> <b>filter</b> substrates at the air-liquid interface for 14 d. Vertical sections stained for histology and indirect immunofluorescence studies show a correct stratification and expression of differentiation markers. The presence of desmosomes, keratohyalin granules, and lamellar granules, {{and the formation of}} a more than ten-layers stratum corneum was evidenced by electron microscopy. Moreover, lipids typical for differentiated epidermis were present in these cultures, including ceramides, which are thought to be responsible for the relative impermeability of the stratum corneum. Under our culture conditions, i. e., in defined medium and at the air-liquid interface, the use of de-epidermized dermis as a substrate did not stimulate keratinocyte differentiation more than acetate cellulose or poly-carbonate filter membrane substrates. The obtaining of a well-differentiated epidermis grown in vitro on <b>inert</b> <b>filters</b> in a chemically defined medium should be useful as a standard system for studying epidermal differentiation, re-epidermization, cytotoxicity, epidermal permeation, and transepidermal drug delivery...|$|R

40|$|Learning and {{adaptation}} {{is a fundamental}} property of intelligent agents. In the context of adaptive information <b>filtering,</b> a <b>filtering</b> <b>agent’s</b> beliefs about a user’s information needs have to be revised regularly {{with reference to the}} user’s most current information preferences. This learning {{and adaptation}} process is essential for maintaining the <b>agent’s</b> <b>filtering</b> performance. The AGM belief revision paradigm provides a rigorous foundation for modelling rational and minimal changes to an agent’s beliefs. In particular, the maxiadjustment method, which follows the AGM rationale of belief change, offers a sound and robust computational mechanism to develop adaptive agents so that learning autonomy of these agents can be enhanced.

In contrast to conventional relevance feedback methods which require explicit user feedbacks, our approach learns user preferences implicitly from direct observations of browsing behaviors during interaction.

Feedback ratios in buck converters with pulse width modulation are conveniently adjustable using linear approximation for the neighborhood of the steady-state operating conditions. In the presence of an <b>inert</b> output <b>filter</b> or large input ripple, however, a pulse width modulator operates in saturation mode for a prolonged period of time (with a duty cycle of 0 or 1), which leads to losses in the estimated performance and to slowing down the transient processes.

There is thus a need for filters that can remove gaseous PAHs from the air that people breathe and that can inhibit bacterial growth on the filters.

The results showed that both the effects depended on functional groups and concentrations of M-Pc, and rayon types.
