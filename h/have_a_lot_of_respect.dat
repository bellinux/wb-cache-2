500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Kerrang! on {{a selection of}} the band's singles, Nicholas expressed his annoyance with comparisons between Coldplay and the album Pushing the Senses; he said that those comparisons were only made because he played a piano {{on many of the}} tracks that were on the album. In a 2011 {{interview with}} Cambridge-based webzine The Tab, he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, [...] "Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and we are a much heavier band, both live and on record. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for Coldplay and we have toured with them, but we are two totally different bands, both dynamically and musically. I just think it's lazy journalism." ...|$|E

2500|$|But after 1986, {{whenever}} the controversy involving Grammy Award for Best New Artist arose, Houston's ineligibility for that category was often mentioned.

Richard Marx, ruled ineligible for nomination as Best New Artist in 1988, stuck it to the NARAS about their inconsistency, on the feature article about him of Orange Coast magazine, stating as follows: [...] " [...] But so did Whitney Houston for the same reason. And frankly, I don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for N.A.R.A.S., the Grammy people's ruling system, because it's so inconsistent.

With no recognised front-runner in the race, Frankie Dettori had admitted that: [...] "There is a possibility we could make the running if no-one else wants to. Otherwise we will sit off it. Golden Horn is very versatile but what we don’t want is a messy race. He is a Derby winner not a sprinter". Gosden was not overly enthusiastic about the colt's chances saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> for The Grey Gatsby... these are top older horses we’re taking on... any horse can get beaten" [...] and described the horse's position as odds-on favourite as [...] "a bit unusual".
