2500|$|This type of flush {{might be}} {{regarded}} as standard in the United States. Each urinal {{is equipped with a}} button or short lever to activate the flush, with users expected to operate it as they leave. Such a directly controlled system is the most efficient, provided that patrons remember to use it. This is far from certain, however, often because of fear of touching the handle, which is located too high to kick. Urinals with foot-activated flushing systems are sometimes found in high-traffic areas; these systems have a button set into the floor or a pedal on the wall at ankle height. [...] The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that flush valves be mounted no higher than [...] AFF (above the <b>finished</b> <b>floor).</b> Additionally, the urinal is to be mounted no higher than [...] AFF, and to have a rim that is tapered and elongated and protrudes at least [...] from the wall. This enables users in wheelchairs to straddle the lip of the urinal and urinate without having to [...] "arc" [...] the flow of urine upwards.|$|E

40|$|The {{essence of}} a view window (VW) in an office {{building}} {{is not only to}} bring an optimal balance between daylight and electric light, but also for psychological and health purpose. VW does not only allow the admittance of light and views, but indirectly affects the productivity and psychological wellbeing of office occupants; it has a link to the sustainability in both conventional and green buildings. This paper defines the function of a view window as it relates to green office building. Through literature review and an experiment conducted in room 432 - 01 located at B 11 Faculty of Built Environment, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The function of VW in a green office building is highlighted; and the findings show that a VW would enhance sustainability in an office setting and has a dimension greater than 750 mm above a <b>finish</b> <b>floor</b> level and less or equal to 2300 mm above a <b>finish</b> <b>floor</b> level and with a wall to window ratio (WWR) of 25 % to 40 %...|$|R

50|$|Millbrook is a {{historic}} home and farm complex located near Crewe, Nottoway County, Virginia. The original section of the Federal-style main house was built about 1840, and expanded to its present size about 1855. It is a balanced two-story, five-bay, center-hall plan I-house with a Greek Revival-style centered front porch and English basement with three <b>finished</b> <b>floors</b> above. Also on the property are a contributing tobacco barn ruin, and four restored contributing buildings: kitchen, smokehouse, hay barn, and dairy.|$|R

50|$|The {{first model}} home, an {{expandable}} Cape Cod-style house, opened on Selma Drive in 1957. Like many Capes, this home had one <b>finished</b> <b>floor</b> with two bedrooms, the attic {{was capable of}} expansion with dormers, {{and there was an}} outside shower. The style was pure 1950s: wide-exposure asbestos siding, aluminum jalousie windows throughout, and dark wood paneling inside. The colors were all pastels, ranging from canary yellow, pistachio green, and bright pink, to name a few. Mass production methods were utilized to erect the homes efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Manufactured bamboo {{floors are}} {{typically}} made available in planks with either vertical- or horizontal-grain orientation. In vertical bamboo floors, the component pieces are stood vertically on their narrowest edge and then press laminated side to side. The {{effect is a}} lined, almost uniform look {{to the surface of}} the <b>finished</b> <b>floor</b> plank. In horizontal bamboo floors, the slats are arranged in a horizontal direction, on their widest edge, and then joined side by side with adjacent pieces using a high-pressure laminate system. The characteristic nodes of the bamboo are visible on the finished horizontal surface.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the construction of this building was {{the way in which the}} civil and steel erection work was phased. By completing the pile caps on units 1 and 2, the steel erection work was able to progress, while pile caps and flooring were completed on units 3 and 4. This enabled the steel work to be erected on units 3 and 4 from <b>finished</b> <b>floor</b> level while the flooring was being completed on units 1 and 2. This reduced the time taken to construct the main building.|$|E
50|$|Group Challenge - The Cabinets - Dez {{must lead}} the group into <b>finishing</b> the <b>floor</b> and mount the eight upper cabinets. After having each person {{assemble}} one box, Casey and Joe {{are assigned to}} <b>finishing</b> the <b>floor,</b> while Dez lets Tex and Charmaine {{take charge of the}} wall-mounting brackets. Joe and Dez run into Tex's outward-swinging door as they complete the floor(to which they address by tearing down Tex's door), while Tex and Charmaine manage to mount the eight cabinets, but without securing the cabinets to each other or mounting the cabinet doors. In the end, Dez concedes defeat.|$|R

50|$|In 1964 {{with plants}} in England, Canada, South Africa and Australia and sales {{in more than}} 70 {{different}} countries British Titan Products was able to advertise {{that it was the}} largest producer of titanium pigments in Europe with plants at Billingham and Grimsby and research laboratories at Stockton. Tioxide pigments were then used in all kinds of paints (in 14 different grades of Tioxide), industrial <b>finishes,</b> <b>floor</b> coverings, plastics and rubber; in addition in artificial textiles, delicate paper and cosmetics particularly soaps. They were also employed in vitreous enamels on whiteware and baths, printing inks and pale leathers and their polishes.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} cave temples {{are found in}} the temple complexes of Mihintale. A unique feature in these caves was the use of a drip ledge carved along the top edge of the rock ceiling which stopped rain water running into the cave. With time, doors, windows and walls of brick or stone were added. The roof and walls were plastered white and finished with decorative paintings, these are evident in the cave temples of Dambulla.

5000|$|The [...] "Island Building" [...] {{is named}} {{because it is}} {{surrounded}} by water, with the Arkansas River {{on one side and}} the reflecting pond on the other. The reflecting pond is between the buildings to create the illusion that looks like the river runs between the buildings. The reflecting pond is one to three feet deep. Even though the building is so close to the river it is not prone to flooding because it is above the 100-year flood level. During the flood in October 1998, the worst in recent history, the water level was still more than 8 ft below the <b>finished</b> <b>floor</b> level.|$|E
50|$|In the {{category}} of self-leveling concrete {{there are two main}} groups of materials: underlayments and toppings. Underlayments are installed over an existing subfloor to smooth it out and correct any surface irregularities prior to the installation of all types of floor coverings, including sheet vinyl, vinyl composition tile (VCT), wood, ceramic tile and carpet. Toppings perform a similar function but act as the actual <b>finished</b> <b>floor</b> without the need for a floor covering. Some typical applications for concrete toppings include warehouse floors, light industrial applications, retail stores and institutional facilities. Concrete toppings can also receive pigmented color dyes, stains, saw cuts or mechanical polishing to produce a decorative concrete finished wear surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building has relatively simple finishes that remain primarily in the courtrooms, judges' chambers, lobbies, stair halls, and corridors. The first-floor elevator and postal lobbies retain many original <b>finishes.</b> <b>Floors</b> are covered with pre-cast orange terrazzo set in pigmented grout with polished Travertine and Vermont marble inlay. The plaster walls have marble wainscot. Brass radiator grilles, bronze writing desks, and an iron grille above the original service entrance remain. The transom area above the opening to the staircase in the west entrance vestibule is adorned with a raised-relief plaster eagle, which conveys the federal presence.|$|R
25|$|Floors in wooden {{buildings}} are usually constructed upon relatively deep spans of wood, called joists, {{covered with a}} diagonal wood planking or plywood to form a subfloor upon which the <b>finish</b> <b>floor</b> surface is laid. In many structures these are all aligned in the same direction. To prevent the beams from tipping over onto their side, blocking is used at each end, and for additional stiffness, blocking or diagonal wood or metal bracing may be placed between beams at one or more points in their spans. At the outer edge it is typical to use a single depth of blocking and a perimeter beam overall.|$|R
2500|$|Materials {{were chosen}} {{for their ability to}} serve {{multiple}} functions. Castellated beams were integrated into the structure to reduce the weight of steel used and to encourage air movement. [...] The exposed concrete slab was polished and used as the <b>finish</b> <b>floor</b> surface. The castellated steel beam structure, chosen for strength, lower cost, and reduced material was left exposed and painted white, allowing light, air and services to circulate. The metal cable tray system corrals electrical and data cabling also serve as the support for the light fixtures. Ceiling mounted acoustical panels double as light reflectors. Acoustical wall panels provide additional noise damping and a place to pinup sketches.|$|R
