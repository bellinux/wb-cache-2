6000|$|Peter {{came out}} of the shop with the voucher for the box in his pocket, turned into Piccadilly, noted that the day was growing warm and <b>fine,</b> <b>felt</b> glad that this time he had no other strict {{business}} than to leave a card or two on official people, and asked himself where he should go if he didn't go after Miriam. Then it was that he found himself attaching a lively desire and imputing a high importance to the possible view of Nick Dormer's portrait of her. He wondered which would be the natural place at that hour of the day to look for the artist. The House of Commons was perhaps the nearest one, but Nick, inconsequent and incalculable though so many of his steps, probably didn't keep the picture there; and, moreover, it was not generally characteristic of him to be in the natural place. The end of Peter's debate was that he again entered a hansom and drove to Calcutta Gardens. The hour was early for calling, but cousins with whom one's intercourse was mainly a conversational scuffle would accept it as a practical illustration of that method. And if Julia wanted him to be nice to Biddy--which was exactly, even if with a different view, what he wanted himself--how could he better testify than by a visit to Lady Agnes--he would have in decency to go to see her some time--at a friendly, fraternising hour when they would all be likely to be at home? ...|$|E
60|$|The last {{preliminary}} to {{be noticed}} is the slowness with which the printer's ink hardens on the slab, and the rapidity with which it dries on paper. While serviceable for hours in the former case, in the latter it will be dry in a very few seconds. The drying or hardening of this oily ink has nothing whatever {{to do with the}} loss of moisture in the ordinary sense of the word, that is to say, of the loss of the contained water: it is wholly due to oxidisation of the oil. An extremely thin oxidised film soon forms {{on the surface of the}} layer on the slab, and this shields the lower-lying portions of the layer from the air, and retards further oxidisation. But paper is very unlike a polished slab; it is a <b>fine</b> <b>felt,</b> full of minute interstices. When a printed period (.) is placed under the microscope it looks like a drop of tar in the middle of a clean bird's-nest. The ink is minutely divided among the interstices of the paper, and a large surface being thereby exposed to the air, it oxidises at once, while a print from the finger upon glass will not dry for two or three days. One effect of oxidisation is to give a granulated appearance to the ink on rollers which have been allowed to get dirty. This granulation leaves clots on the slab which are fatal to good work: whenever they are seen, the roller must be cleaned at once.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the practical investigation {{and analysis of}} traditional materials and processes used {{in the production of}} hand made felt. Specifically, the research examines the potential of certain British wool types that are currently undervalued (and often overlooked in the production of fine craft felt). These wools are frequently referred to as ‘waste’ wools. The research further explores aspects of the UK’s wool economy and the problematic issue of waste wool. The aim being to locate and articulate the creative potential of a selection of these wools within the field of <b>fine</b> <b>felt</b> craft practice, and in so doing raise an awareness of their potential diversity and relevance. The investigation questions felt’s marginal status within the textile hierarchy, and problematizes notions of the familial and self-conscious attributed to felt craft by some of its makers. By examining distinctions between craft and industrial felt production, the research considers both the opportunities and limitations of these relationships within the context of designer maker practice. The purpose and focus of this material-led examination is to develop inventive, progressive methods in <b>fine</b> <b>felt</b> craft and couture application seeking material currency with appropriate use of waste wools for handwork production. The practical experimentation was conducted using a practice-led research approach through which materials and sampling methods emerged within a studio-based environment. The study focuses on the use of carding, wet and dry felting and post felting manipulation of surface design using hand-pleating applications. Whilst not specifically suggesting new techniques in felt-making, the modification of existing processes has formed a central part of the contribution to new knowledge created within the work. Therefore the qualitative nature of the research methodology establishes a new perspective on both the value and integrity of British waste wools for the production of fine craft felt-making. The portfolio of fabrics produced confirmed the suitability of materials for fine craft felt-making and further suggested their appropriateness for product development and use. The fabric prototypes and exposition collection evidence new design concepts, situating the practical investigations in a cultural and critical context and in so doing reposition the material in a more valuable and original light. The sampling process identified key areas for innovation and aesthetic appeal suggesting that further research could be developed using other wools and wool blends. From this thesis emerges a vibrant platform for fresh interpretation and potential for British waste wools in fine craft felt-making, further strengthening the creative interplay between material and technique.

40|$|The Virtual Pain Manager (VPM) is a {{simulation}} {{of a patient}} control analgesia (PCA) machine, and teaches both {{the use of the}} machine and the provision of associated nursing care in a hospital setting. Naturally, student nurses cannot be allowed free rein of real patients as the risks are too great. They cannot be allowed to make mistakes with the health of real people. However, in the virtual world they are free to make mistakes and—crucially—learn from them in an environment in which no harm can be done. There is great value in being able to learn from your mistakes, and often more may be learnt from understanding an error than through success. Scenario VPM allows student nurses to experience a clinical situation which in real life they {{would not be able to}} undertake: managing acute pain in a postoperative surgical setting. VPM is designed to follow lectures on the theory of pain management. In the simulation, students adopt the role of a nurse who has been assigned to a patient who is in pain, having returned from an operating theatre. It is the nurses’ responsibility to reduce the pain to an acceptable level and keep the pain level controlled, so that the PCA unit can be withdrawn and the patient given oral analgesia instead. Complications such as chest infections, DVT, pneumonia and respiratory arrest can occur as result of poor patient care, sometimes with fatal results. The occurrence of complications represents failure for the user, with feedback given regarding the nature of the complication and the consequences for both patient and nurse. Success is judged on achieving the conditions for withdrawal of the PCA unit: pain is at a comfortable level; pain is stabilised; and the patient is not requesting doses of analgesia from the PCA unit. Ideally, the nurse should establish these conditions within 48 (simulated) hours to succeed. If this situation has not been reached within 72 (simulated) hours, the simulation terminates and the student is judged to have failed in the care of the patient. The virtual world Behind the scenes of VPM is a robust model of interactions between human organs, pain, pharmaceuticals and psychology. The model has been developed with great care and accuracy to replicate the processes at work in the human body. Where real-world calculations and data exist for these interactions they have been employed within the model. VPM has even prompted questions for further research, such as an investigation into the psychology of the use of the PCA unit. Delivering such complex learning in an engaging manner would be unachievable without a high fidelity, interactive simulation such as VPM. As there was no empirical model as a basis for the simulation, the academic on this project, Gareth Parsons, used his considerable knowledge and experience to develop an appropriate model. The learning experience In using a computer-based learning package, student nurses can replay the VPM simulation time after time, varying their strategy, analysing the strengths and weakness of different approaches and developing best practice. As they do so, the student nurses become increasingly engaged in the simulation and the care of their patient: “The first time my patient died and the second he was <b>fine</b> <b>felt</b> bad the first time, like I had failed I would have carried on reapeating[sic] it until I had a surviver[sic] lol” The comments we have received from student nurses (and qualified nurses who have tested VPM) has been very positive: “…enables us to assess our abilities within an environment which is safe to do so, is good for our confidence and may identify areas in which we need to develop better skills. ” “I think it is great… it helps us put the theory we learn into practice in a safe way. ” “I think its a great way to practice without pressure. ” “I think that this is an excellent way of learning. Espically[sic] when getting to grips with controlled drugs, such as morphine. ” These responses indicate that student nurses have been able to take their theoretical knowledge and put it into practice. VPM can therefore be said to provide an effective arena in which students can learn about the PCA unit and pain management. The learning benefits VPM has been designed from the beginning to have a highly reusable pedagogical approach. While the logic of the model in VPM is contained with the application, most of the variables are stored outside in an XML file. This file can contain multiple patient scenarios, which can be configured for differing levels of difficulty. Where multiple patient scenarios exist, VPM randomly selects a patient at the start of the simulation. Within each scenario the model itself applies variance to certain variables. By introducing this random element, student nurses are prevented from learning how to ‘play’ the simulation and are encouraged to apply their learning and knowledge as they would in real life. The random nature of VPM’s scenarios also provides a more realistic situation, as patients—even those presenting with the same symptoms—will respond to treatment differently depending on their physiology and psychology. VPM provides student nurses with an experience that would otherwise be unavailable to them, and challenges them to put their theoretical knowledge into practice in a safe environment where they can learn from their mistakes and develop their professional skills. ...|$|E
