5|$|Some researchers, {{as well as}} some timber {{companies}} and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems. Fire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the <b>environmental</b> <b>balance</b> in parks. The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems. Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to denoting a cannibalistic monster from their traditional folklore, Native Americans also understand the wendigo conceptually. As a concept, the wendigo {{can apply to}} any person, idea, or movement infected by a corrosive drive toward self-aggrandizing greed and excessive consumption, traits that sow disharmony and destruction if left unchecked. Ojibwe scholar Brady DeSanti asserts that the wendigo “can {{be understood as a}} marker indicating [...] [...] [...] a person [...] [...] [...] imbalanced both internally and toward the larger community of human and spiritual beings around them." [...] Out of equilibrium and estranged by their communities, individuals afflicted by the wendigo spirit unravel and destroy the <b>environmental</b> <b>balance</b> around them. Chippewa author Louise Erdrich’s novel The Round House (novel), winner of the National Book Award, depicts a situation where an individual person becomes a wendigo. The novel describes its primary antagonist, a rapist whose violent crimes desecrates a sacred site, as a wendigo who must be killed because he threatens the reservation’s safety.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is to develop methodological {{approaches}} for a cross-media analysis and an integrated concept of environmental data with the aim of deriving <b>environmental</b> <b>balances.</b> Based on data from more than 100 sectoral monitoring programs of Federal Länder, institutes and agencies for the substance group of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), the data of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are used for an cross-media evaluation procedure and ultimately necessary for the assessment of the environmental state and PCB-footprints in the environment. It has been developed a model that allows the balancing methodology for cross-media environmental monitoring. The requirements for a technical integration include the quality assurance of environmental monitoring data and the parameterization for the balances to design a comprehensive approach to <b>environmental</b> <b>balancing.</b> This study asks which criteria for a cross-media assessment and an integrative approach are necessary and relevant to the target system and how the integrated concept can control the knowledge-based methods. The criteria have technical and spatial / temporal information combined with a functional level. A reference system for POPs is to be considered for the optimization of existing and future environmental programs and can be applied to other groups of substances. A cardinal question is how the harmonization and standardization of heterogeneous data is possible because these data were collected for different tasks and objectives. The first requirements are to define the quality assurance procedures. The conventions and constraints of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are discussed which can be used for studies of material flows between the various environmental compartments and for balancing. An assessment of national and international standards takes place to examine the technical potential for integration of data, and highlights the information technology level critically. Current data models and technical solutions are evaluated on the basis of the POP-Dioxin-Informationsystem. They are compared with the structures of the existing reference system for POPs to submit a proposal for data collection and documentation. This study also explores the limits of the balance sheets of material cycles linked to environmental monitoring data of heterogeneous programs. It is proposed to implement an optimized design method of data collection in order to use data for balancing substance cycles optimally. Opportunities and risks for future data storage methods and data models for continuous and future use of data for balancing are presented and recommendations for the multiple use of environmental data in the context of specific <b>environmental</b> <b>balances...</b>|$|R
