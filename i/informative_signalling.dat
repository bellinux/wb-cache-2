40|$|A {{low-cost}} incumbent {{may limit}} price to informatively signal her cost to an uncertain potential entrant, and therefore deter entry. We enrich this model by investigating the strategic pricing {{behavior of the}} incumbent when she operates in multiple markets. We demonstrate that the low-cost incumbent's ability to separate from a ghost high-cost type is enhanced when she combines her signalling effort across markets, instead of independent signalling in each market. We show that, in the combined least-cost signalling, the low-cost incumbent limit prices in each market. In an attempt to minimize dissipative but <b>informative</b> <b>signalling</b> costs, the low-cost incumbent may enter unprofitable markets, but exit after credible separation. product line, marketing, multimarket, game theory, asymmetric information models...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a firm's choice of prices and qualities {{of a product}} line to signal competitive advantage to potential entrants and to discourage entry. The market consists of customer segments with different valuations for product quality. We demonstrate that a higher quality and a higher price of each product in the line convey the firm's advantage to potential competition and prevents entry. We discuss implications for optimal product line selection when customers 'self-select' a product from the line. When product quality change is costly, the superior incumbent continues to select a higher quality and price for each product in the line to credibly substantiate its competitive advantage, though the distortions necessary from the optimal values are lower than before. After <b>informative</b> <b>signalling</b> and deterring entry, the firm retains the higher quality product line. signalling, adverse selection, product line, quality, pricing, separating equilibrium, pooling equilibrium, entry deterrence, marketing strategy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects superiorly {{informed}} market makers {{have on the}} price formation process. Two models are developed in which the market maker receives some <b>informative</b> <b>signal.</b> In one version, the market maker receives an <b>informative</b> <b>signal</b> {{at the start of}} the day with which he assigns a probability to its correctness. In the other version, the market maker receives a fully <b>informative</b> <b>signal</b> at some random time throughout the day. By comparing the models to the Glosten and Milgrom (1985) model, it is shown that informed market makers are able to improve certain dimensions of market quality. Prices become more reflective of their true value, price discovery is enhanced, and trading costs for uninformed traders are decreased. These benefits to the market are further demonstrated through the development of simulations of the theoretical models...|$|R

A more popular challenger can reduce the probability to enhance transparency, while voters can be better off due to a more <b>informative</b> <b>signaling.</b> It is also shown that a higher level of public interest in fiscal issues can increase the probability of enhancing transparency, while voters can be worse off by a less <b>informative</b> <b>signaling...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we discuss {{the results of our}} quality processing system used to extract heart rate from ballistocardiogram signals obtained from a micro-bending fiber optic sensor pressure mat. Visual inspection is used to label data into informative and non-informative classes based on their heart rate information. Five classifiers are employed for the classification process, i. e., random forest, support vector machine, multilayer, feedforward neural network, linear discriminant analysis, and decision tree. To compute the overall effectiveness of quality processing, the <b>informative</b> <b>signals</b> are processed to estimate interbeat intervals. The system was used to process, data collected from 50 human subjects sitting in a massage chair while performing different activities. Opportunistically collected data was obtained from the fiber optic sensor mat placed on the headrest of the massage chair. Using our classification approach, 57. 37 % of the dataset was able to provide <b>informative</b> <b>signals.</b> On the <b>informative</b> <b>signals,</b> random forest classifier achieves the best classification accuracy with a mean accuracy of 98. 99 %. The average of the mean absolute error between the estimated heart rate and the reference ECG is reduced from 13. 2 to 8. 47. Therefore, the proposed system shows a good robustness for opportunistic ambient sensing...|$|R

Banks decide about their investment strategy ex-ante based on a private belief {{about the state of}} the world and a social belief formed from observing the actions of peers. When the social belief is strong and the financial network is fragmented, banks follow their peers and their investment strategies synchronize. This effect is stronger for less <b>informative</b> private <b>signals.</b> For endogenously formed interbank networks, however, less <b>informative</b> <b>signals</b> lead to higher network density and less synchronization.

40|$|We study social {{learning}} {{in a large}} population of agents who only observe the actions taken by their neighbours. Agents have to choose one, out of two, reversible actions, each optimal in one, out of two, unknown states of the world. Each agent chooses rationally, {{on the basis of}} private information and of the observation of his neighbours' actions. Agents can repeatedly update their choices at revision opportunities that they receive in a random sequential order. We show that if agents receive equally <b>informative</b> <b>signals</b> and observe both neighbours, then actions converge exponentially fast to a configuration where some agents are permanently wrong. In contrast, if agents are unequally informed (in that some agents receive a perfectly <b>informative</b> <b>signal</b> and others are uninformed) and observe one neighbour only, then everyone will eventually choose the correct action. Convergence, however, obtains very slowly, at rate 2 ̆ 21 at...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of an {{experiment}} to investigate the value of increased cost report accuracy in competitive pricing decisions. Prior work has shown that in more competitive environments, cost system choice matters less since there is opportunity to learn from <b>informative</b> market <b>signals.</b> Our study argues that in a dynamic duopoly, learning from such <b>informative</b> market <b>signals</b> is distorted when decision makers act as market leaders deciding first on prices. Compared to second movers (followers), a leader with a biased cost report continues to prefer his own distorted cost figures over the <b>informative</b> <b>signals</b> emanating from better informed market players. Consequently he realizes lower performance and can be taken advantage of by opponents with access to superior cost data. We conclude that in order to achieve profit leadership, current reputational market leaders have a great interest in improving the accuracy of their own cost report system.

These results bring additional evidence linking membrane poten-tial and calmodulin mRNA accumulation. Key words: Bidens pilosa — Calcium — Calmodulin — Signal transmission — Wounding. Plants can perceive local injurious stimuli, such as wounding, naming or crushing, that are transduced into an <b>informative</b> <b>signal</b> propagated throughout the whole plant, thereby evoking a systemic response.

In the composite Bidens pilosa, an injurious stimulus (wound, heat) given to the cotyledons results in rapid meta-bolic changes in the hypocotyl (Desbiez et al. 1983, Henry-Vian et al. 1995 a, b).
