5|$|Trent Richardson ran for 111 {{yards and}} two touchdowns while Eddie Lacy ran for 85. AJ McCarron threw for 163 yards and a touchdown. For his seven tackles, {{interception}} and fumble recovery, Mark Barron was named SEC Defensive Player of the Week. The 107,846 fans in attendance were the most to <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> an Alabama squad compete on the gridiron, and the victory improved their all-time record against the Nittany Lions to 10–5. The outcome was also noted as the final career loss for Joe Paterno as the Nittany Lions' head coach.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 2016, a 2016 International Champions Cup {{match between}} Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain {{was held at}} Ohio Stadium. The match, won by Paris Saint-Germain 3–1, drew 86,641 fans, the largest crowd to <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> a soccer game {{in the state of}} Ohio.|$|E

25|$|Lauzun {{was freed}} on 22 April 1681 and obliged to live quietly at Bourbon before {{returning}} to Paris, but not the court, rather at the Hôtel de Lauzun, in March 1682.

40|$|How is it {{possible}} to justify a lengthy review of the physics of the magnetic monopole when nobody has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> one? In spite of the unfortunate lack of favorable experimental evidence, there are sound theoretical reasons for believing that the magnetic monopole must exist. The case for its existence is surely as strong as the case for any other undiscovered particle. Moreover, as of this writing (early 1984), it is not certain that nobody has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> one. What seems certain is that nobody has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> two...|$|R

25|$|Besides the Bucs, Tampa Stadium {{was home}} to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the {{original}} North American Soccer League, the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League, the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer, and the college football programs of the University of Tampa and the University of South Florida.

25|$|Charles Straub had {{a seat in}} {{the family}} circle close to the stairway; he was in the company of his friend Joseph Kreamer. He remembered, “we could hardly run down the stairs; we were crowded down.” Though at first he saw no smoke, {{by the time he had}} been carried down to the last flight, it had grown thicker. There he tripped and people fell on top of him. By then the last flight of stairs was dark and full of smoke. Straub {{struggled}} up and stumbled forward. He estimated that about twenty-five people had gotten out ahead of him. Wondrously, though he had been pushed down three flights of stairs and thought that hundreds had fallen on top of him, only about ten or twelve people came out onto the street after him. He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> him again.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall <b>ever</b> <b>see,</b> and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E

In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure.|$|E

25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the child does not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E
