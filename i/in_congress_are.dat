The focus of Scheurer's campaign was fiscal issues: balancing the federal budget, fixing the United States health care system, and reducing the national debt.|$|E

2500|$|However, in {{his last}} act before leaving office, Madison vetoed the Bonus Bill of 1817, which would have financed more {{internal}} improvements of roads, bridges, and canals: [...] "Having considered the bill this day presented to me... I am constrained by the insuperable difficulty I feel in reconciling this bill with the Constitution of the United States.... The legislative powers vested <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> specified and enumerated in... the Constitution, {{and it does not}} appear that the power proposed to be exercised by the bill is among the enumerated powers." [...] Madison rejected the view of Congress that the General Welfare provision of the Taxing and Spending Clause justified the bill: [...] "Such a view of the Constitution would have the effect of giving to Congress a general power of legislation instead of the defined and limited one hitherto understood to belong to them, the terms 'common defense and general welfare' embracing every object and act within the purview of a legislative trust." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the words}} of the New York Times, Paul is [...] "not a fan" [...] of the Federal Reserve. In his own words, Paul advocates that we should [...] "End the Fed". Paul's {{opposition}} to the Fed is supported by the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, which holds that instead of containing inflation, the Federal Reserve, in theory and in practice, is responsible for causing inflation. In addition to eroding the value of individual savings, this creation of inflation leads to booms and busts in the economy. Thus Paul argues that government, via a central bank (the Federal Reserve), is the primary cause of economic recessions and depressions. He believes that economic volatility is decreased when the free market determines interest rates and money supply. [...] He has stated in numerous speeches that most of his colleagues <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> unwilling to abolish the central bank because it funds many government activities. He says that to compensate for eliminating the [...] "hidden tax" [...] of monetary inflation, Congress and the president would instead have to raise taxes or cut government services, either of which could be politically damaging to their reputations. He states that the [...] "inflation tax" [...] is a tax on the poor, because the Federal Reserve prints more money which subsidizes select industries, while poor people pay higher prices for goods as more money is placed in circulation.|$|E
60|$|But supposing Re-establishment so far {{advanced}} {{that the}} Southern seats <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> occupied, and by men qualified {{in accordance with}} those cardinal principles of representative government which hitherto have prevailed in the land--what then? Why the Congressman elected {{by the people of}} the South will--represent the people of the South. This may seem a flat conclusion; but in view of the last five years, may there not be latent significance in it? What will be the temper of those Southern members? and, confronted by them, what will be the mood of our own representatives? In private life true reconciliation seldom follows a violent quarrel; but if subsequent intercourse be unavoidable, nice observances and mutual are indispensable to the prevention of a new rupture. Amity itelf can only be maintained by reciprocal respect, and true friends are punctilious equals. On the floor of Congress North and South are to come together after a passionate duel, in which the South though proving her valor, has been made to bite the dust. Upon differences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be exchanged? shall censorious superiority assumed by one section provoke defiant self-assertion on the other? shall Manassas and Chickamauga be retorted for Chattanooga and Richmond? Under the supposition that the full Congress will be composed of gentlemen, all this is impossible. Yet if otherwise, it needs no prophet of Israel to foretell the end. The maintenance of Congressional decency in the future will rest mainly with the North. Rightly will more forbearance be required from the North than the South, for the North is victor.|$|E
