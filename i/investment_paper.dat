30|$|David et al. (2000) {{investigated}} {{the role of}} government subsidies in the private R&D investments by scrutinizing a total of 33 previous studies from 1966 to 2000. The majority of the papers examined argued for a net complementary effect in which a government subsidy facilitated private R&D <b>investment</b> (17 <b>papers).</b> The remainder described a net expulsive effect in which the government subsidy only replaced the private R&D <b>investment</b> (11 <b>papers).</b> Up to date, a clear agreement has not been reached yet on the relationship between government subsidy and the amount of private R&D investment (Jaffe 1996; Hall 2002).|$|R

One of the indicators of FDI’s “quality” is accepted as its “mode of entry”, greenfield or brownfield <b>investments.</b> The <b>paper</b> argues that greenfield investment is more useful for development in order to have its direct positive impact through <b>investment.</b> The <b>paper</b> empirically investigates this by a cross-section data analysis. The main findings support this argument. Findings also back the argument that brownfield can be beneficial for development in the long-run in relation with human capital development...|$|R

40|$|In 1996 Ward et al {{reported}} {{the results of their}} UK study into the state of practice in evaluating and realizing benefits from IS/IT <b>investments.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents new empirical evidence from a survey performed in the Benelux and the UK on the state of practice in managing benefits from IS/IT <b>investments.</b> The <b>paper</b> revisits the background and concepts of the benefits management process model introduced by Ward et al, assesses the current state of practice, and compares it to ten years ago. The results show some positive evolutions in the adoption of formal methodologies and certain structured practices. Nevertheless, the results point towards ample room for improvement for most organizations. The findings also support the claims of the benefits management process model that organizations which are more successful at delivering benefits from their IS/IT investment projects {{are more likely to have}} a comprehensive approach to managing benefits from them. ...|$|R

40|$|The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) narrow {{reading of}} the Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) should be {{expanded}} to prohibit specific and targeted tax incentives aimed at attracting foreign investment. These tax incentives restrict investment and trade liberalization. This paper proposes that trade and investment are intrinsically linked, and as such, the WTO is the proper forum to regulate <b>investment</b> measures. This <b>paper</b> argues the case against specific foreign investment attracting tax incentives. These incentives do little to actually attract investment, and are harmful to development. Individual tax incentives also limit the collective global benefits of <b>investment.</b> This <b>paper</b> concludes by arguing that the WTO should use the existing TRIMs Agreement to prohibit the specific tax incentives used to attract foreign investment...|$|R

It shows that several features linked to zonal market design, in particular the possibility to favour market participants in the own country compared {{to those in the}} neighbouring countries, distort the investment signals for interconnectors. Uncertainties on investments in both transmission and generation have a big influence in interconnector <b>investment</b> decisions. The <b>paper</b> proposes that flaws in market design, capacity calculation and capacity allocation need to be addressed to provide efficient signals for interconnector investments. It proposes to reduce price zone flaws by forming more natural price zones for Europe.

40|$|Public {{capital has}} a {{positive}} impact on productivity. An adequate stock of public capital not only serves as input to numerous industries but also attracts or crowds-in private capital. Simply put, sufficient and updated public capital raises the rate of return of private capital stock, thus, generating a crowd-in effect on additional private <b>investment.</b> This <b>paper</b> reviews the relationship between public and private investment in Puerto Rico as an initial attempt to determine whether public investment is effectively crowding-in private <b>investment.</b> This <b>paper</b> analyzes the historical trends of public and private investment and examines the evolution of the public-to-private investment ratio as a basic indicator of crowd-in effect. Trend and benchmark analyses show that public investment in Puerto Rico is not effectively crowding-in private investment. Local fiscal constraints and investments in non-basic infrastructure areas appear to have weakened the crowding-in effect of public investment, which has resulted in a timid crow-in of private investment in Puerto Rico...|$|R

Still, these benefits are not accounted for in traditional financial investment evaluation methods like Return On Investment (ROI) and Net Present Value (NPV). The strict quantitative financial methods for evaluating ICT investments leave {{out most of the}} strategic long-term performance benefits that ICT provide. There is a need for a multidimensional evaluation method that includes the long-term performance perspective, generation of system usefulness and future business value of ICT <b>investments.</b> This <b>paper</b> starts from a general perspective of ICT investment evaluation.

The third section examines the impact of EU enlargement on FDI in Turkey and explores whether the IMF agreement is sufficient for reducing obstacles to <b>investment.</b> The <b>paper</b> concludes that Turkey has under-performed in attracting FDI due to the slow pace of privatisation and political-institutional obstacles, of which chronic inflation is a manifestation. Structured interviews with global companies also highlighted lack of investment promotion as a major obstacle. While the IMF agreement will increase privatisation and reduce inflation, EU membership is vital if Turkey is to successfully compete for foreign investment...|$|R
