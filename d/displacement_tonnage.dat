25|$|One {{explanation}} for the alleged size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely for a display of imperial power by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats on the Yangtze River when on court business, including when reviewing Zheng He's actual expedition fleet. The Yangtze River, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable for such large but unseaworthy ships. Zheng He {{would not have had}} the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships. The largest ships of Zheng He's fleet were the 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of about 800 tons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{displacement}} or <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> {{of a ship}} is its weight, {{expressed in}} long tons of water its hull displaces. It is measured indirectly using Archimedes' principle by first calculating the volume of water displaced by the ship then converting that value into tons.|$|E
50|$|Based on <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage,</b> Mistral and Tonnerre are {{the largest}} ships in the French Navy after the nuclear-powered {{aircraft}} carrier , for roughly the same height above water.|$|E
5000|$|In 1678 Thames shipbuilders used {{a method}} {{assuming}} that a ship's burden would be 3/5 of its <b>displacement.</b> Since <b>tonnage</b> is calculated by multiplying length &times; beam &times; draft &times; block coefficient, all divided by 35 ft³ per ton of seawater, the resulting formula would be: ...|$|R
5000|$|The TI {{class of}} supertankers are {{currently}} the four largest {{ships in the}} world (by <b>displacement,</b> deadweight <b>tonnage</b> ≈ cargo mass, and gross tonnage, a formula value based on internal volume, not mass). The class comprises the ships TI Africa, TI Asia, TI Europe and TI Oceania, where the [...] "TI" [...] refers to the VLCC Tanker Pool operator Tankers International L.L.C. The class were the first ULCCs (ultra-large crude carriers) {{to be built in}} 25 years.|$|R
50|$|Displacement - A {{measurement}} {{of the weight of}} the vessel, usually used for warships. (Merchant ships are usually measured based on the volume of cargo space; see <b>tonnage).</b> <b>Displacement</b> is expressed either in long tons of 2,240 pounds or metric tonnes of 1,000 kg. Since the two units are very close in size (2,240 pounds = 1,016 kg and 1,000 kg = 2,205 pounds), it is common not to distinguish between them. To preserve secrecy, nations sometimes misstate a warship's displacement.|$|R
5000|$|Island Home {{was built}} to a plan by the Elliott Bay Design Group, and has a {{capacity}} of 1,200 people and 76 vehicles, with a loaded <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of about 1950 t. [...] She is powered by two Electro-Motive diesel engines, and has {{a top speed of}} 16 kn.|$|E
50|$|The {{displacement}} or <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> {{of a ship}} is the ship's weight. The name {{reflects the}} fact that it is measured indirectly, by first calculating the volume of water displaced by the ship, and then calculating the weight of that water. By Archimedes' principle, this is also the weight of the ship.|$|E
50|$|The {{detailed}} specifications for every ship are not {{released by the}} PLAN. They {{are thought to have}} a <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of around 21,000 tons when fully loaded, with a crew of about 470 and a length of about 190 m. Their propulsion is from one Sulzer Ltd. diesel engine, with a top speed of 20 knots (37 km/h).|$|E
5000|$|The Washington Conference {{was called}} by President Warren G. Harding and run by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Harding demanded action {{in order to gain}} {{domestic}} political credit. Hughes—helped by the cryptographers who were reading the Japanese diplomatic secrets—brilliantly engineered a deal that everyone thought best for themselves. [...] To resolve technical disputes about the quality of warships, the conferees adopted a quantitative standard, based on <b>tonnage</b> <b>displacement</b> (a simple measure of the size of a ship.) A ten-year agreement fixed the ratio of battleships at 5:5:3—that is 525,000 tons for the USA, 525,000 tons for Britain, and 315,000 tons for Japan. Smaller limits with a ratio of 1.67 applied to France and Italy. [...] Battleships, the dominant weapons systems of the era, could be no larger than 35,000 tons. The major powers allowed themselves 135,000:135,000:81,000 tons for the newfangled aircraft carriers. The Washington Conference exactly captured the worldwide popular demand for peace and disarmament; without it, the US, Britain and Japan would have engaged in an expensive buildup, with each worried the other two might be getting too powerful. The agreements forced the US to scrap 15 old battleships and 2 new ones, along with 13 ships under construction.|$|R
40|$|The {{considered}} {{method is}} based on the representation of main dimensions of the vessel, their ratios, as well as basic items of mass load as a function of one independent variable - the basic length on the specified interval. The choice of the interval and definition of the functions are realized by means of the analysis of databases containing more than six hundred projects of high-speed vessels made of composite materials. The family of functions is received by means of approximation of the values of the databases. It is possible to get the family of the main dimensions and other characteristics of the vessels made from composite materials, balanced by the ratios of the main dimensions and elements of the mass load, with the help of variations along the basic length. Formulas, reflecting the rational ratios of the vessels from the composites with dominant subsystems, and providing increased characteristics of speed, and with the overall length from 9 up to 26 m, and for different purposes, are obtained. Balance checking of the obtained values is realized by means of design equations of buoyancy, mass and power loads, propulsion. The calculation of the total mass of different vessels, empty <b>displacement</b> and deadweight <b>tonnage</b> is made by different methods for various databases. The errors in the calculation of the increment of displacement are checked. The values error calculated by different ways is about 3 – 5 %, and decreases with the length of the vessel increasing...|$|R
5000|$|The world's popular {{mood was}} peace and {{disarmament}} throughout the 1920s. At {{the end of}} the Great War, Britain still had the largest navy afloat but its big ships were becoming obsolete, and the Americans and Japanese were rapidly building expensive new warships. London and Tokyo were allies in a treaty that was due to expire in 1922. Although there were no immediate dangers, observers increasingly pointed to the American-Japanese rivalry for control of the Pacific Ocean as a long-term threat to world peace. By this time, London realized it had best cast its lot with Washington rather than Tokyo. To stop a needless, expensive and possibly dangerous arms race, the major countries signed a series of naval disarmament agreements. The most important was the Washington Conference of 1922, sponsored by President Warren Harding and run by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Harding demanded action in order to gain domestic political credit. Hughes, helped by the cryptographers who were reading the Japanese diplomatic secrets, brilliantly engineered a deal that everyone though best for themselves.

50|$|More {{than one}} million tons of steel is {{salvaged}} per year, {{and much of it}} is sold domestically. In the 2009-2010 fiscal year, a record 107 ships, with a combined light <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> (LDT) of 852,022 tons, were broken at Gadani whereas in the previous 2008-2009 fiscal year, 86 ships, with a combined LDT of 778,598 tons, were turned into scrap.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common combat format across the {{different}} model warship clubs, team free-for-all involves the division of players present into two teams that are equal based upon a combat strength rubric (i.e. units in Fast Gun or a combination of <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> and cannon count in Big Gun), which then sortie against each other in accordance with the club's rules and scoring system.|$|E
50|$|Bolger and Altenberger {{expressed}} concern that existing governmental fishing permits issued based on length of the fishing boat, created an incentive to use inefficient wide and deep fishing boat hulls. If the fishing permits were issued based instead on <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of the hull, then the incentive {{would be for the}} fishing industry to use long, narrow and shallow hulls which would be more economical to purchase and to operate per ton of fish caught.|$|E

50|$|Underwood and Kable were {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} smaller vessels and sloops, but the 188-tonne fully rigged King George would be their most ambitious construction. The keel was laid down in 1804, and she was completed with an overall length of 87 feet, a beam of 22 feet 7 inches and a 14 feet hold. Her tonnage was computed at upwards of 200 tons. This was probably her burthen as she is mentioned by other sources as having a tonnage of 180 or 185 tons, which would seem to be her <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage.</b> Launched in April 1805, she completed fit-out and was registered in May 1805.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} of MTA Oruç Reis was contracted by the MTA to Istanbul Maritime Shipyard in Tuzla, Istanbul on April 24, 2012. She was launched on March 28, 2015, {{and was named}} for Oruç Reis (c. 1474-1518), the Ottoman Beylerbeyi of the West Mediterranean. The vessel is 87 m long, has a beam of 23 m, a depth of 8 m and a draft of 6 m. Assessed at [...] and a <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 4,867 t, the vessel has a max. speed of 17 kn. She is propelled by 4 x 2,520 kW 12V diesel generators of Anglo Belgian Corporation (ABC). The number of the crew is 27 and the scientific staff aboard is 28.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gameplay}} is centred upon building squadrons {{composed of}} individual characters represented as cards with different attributes, and then sending said squadrons out on missions. Each {{of the characters}} are moe anthropomorphisms of World War II naval warships which are depicted as cute girls, known as [...] "Fleet girls" [...] (kanmusu). These personified warships are based on real-life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities {{of each of the}} girls correlate in some way to the real-life vessel (for example, ships with a larger <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> are usually depicted as girls on their late teens to early twenties, while smaller ships look and behave like pubescent girls, with a few exceptions). The player takes on the role of an admiral (teitoku) and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing. The player can organise up to four different fleets.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Britain had been caused severe {{difficulty}} by the U-boat campaign in the First World War, the Admiralty completely ignored {{the threat of the}} submarine until the late 1930s. The Royal Navy had founded its traditional defensive strength on the battleship, which was used to defend its waters and merchant fleets. This weapon had proved incapable of countering U-boats during the war. The Admiralty also ignored the damage caused by submarines and regarded them as ineffective defensive weapons. Given the disarmament of Germany there seemed little offensive threat. Even after the rise of Adolf Hitler and the birth of the Third Reich, there seemed little inclination or will toward rearming Britain's ASW air forces. To the contrary, the Anglo-German Naval agreement signed in June 1935, allowed the Germans to build German U-boat strength to one-third the <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of the entire Royal Navy. In fact, the Germans had been developing submarines as early as 1922, despite the Treaty of Versailles and the banning of German military submarines.|$|E
50|$|As of 1905, {{ships of}} the United States Navy were by law divided into classes called rates. Vessels {{of the first}} rate had a <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> in excess of 8000 tons; second rate, from 4000 to 8000 tons; third rate, from 1000 to 4000 tons; and fourth rate, of less than 1000 tons. Converted {{merchant}} vessels that were armed and equipped as cruisers were of the second rate if over 6000 tons, and of the third rate if over 1000 and less than 6000 tons. Auxiliary vessels such as colliers, supply vessels, repair ships, etc., if over 4000 tons, were of the third rate. Auxiliary vessels of less than 4000 tons—except tugs, sailing ships, and receiving ships which were not rated—were of the fourth rate. Torpedo-boat destroyers, torpedo boats, and similar vessels were not rated. Captains commanded ships of the first rate; captains or commanders commanded ships of the second rate; commanders or lieutenant-commanders commanded ships of the third rate; lieutenant-commanders or lieutenants commanded ships of the fourth rate. Lieutenant-commanders, lieutenants, ensigns, or warrant officers might command unrated vessels, {{depending on the size}} of the vessel.|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{wide range}} {{maneuverability}} {{is required for}} fishing vessels, research vessels or like, since, the vessels along with normal navigations, are steered at slow speeds or large rudder angle for many hours very often. Detailed measurements of maneuverabilities through Zig-zag tests are herein reported and reviewed on Kagoshima-maru (G. T. 1, 038. 14 ton), Keiten-maru (G. T. 854. 55 ton) and Nansei-maru (G. T. 75. 14 ton). As to the testing conditions of Kagoshima-maru and Keiten-maru, <b>displacement</b> <b>tonnage</b> of each was nearly 1, 400 ton; block co-efficient (C_b) and rudder area ratio (A_R/L･d) which greatly influence the maneuverability were also almost the same fore both vessels. However, Keiten-maru showed considerably different performances from the other, such as larger maneuverability indices K′ and T'; more excessive sensitiveness to changing rudder angle, for example. Above differences are concidered to be greatly effected by the different hull form factors like L/B. As for Nansei-maru, the smallest among the three vessels, values of L/B or B/d were accordingly small, still we could obtain rather good results of turning ability, quick responsibility and stability in steering by making rudder area and dead-wood greater. Since performance data of smaller vessels obtained through usual Zig-Zag tests at 10 °Z shows big dispersion, 15 °Z or 20 °Z shall be recommended for the tests on those smaller vessels...|$|E
