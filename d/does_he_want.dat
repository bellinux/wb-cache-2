Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't want any of that B.B. King stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want?</b> We messed around with the song. I played {{the way that he}} dug, and he said it was groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, {{the project}} {{was taken over by}} Franchise Pictures, a {{recently}} established company whose head, Elie Samaha, a former dry cleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were [...] "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads". As Samaha put it, [...] "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to get paid?' … Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'" [...] He learned of Battlefield Earth from Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta. A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20million, lowering the film's cost from the $100million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.|$|E
500|$|Peng made regular {{inspection}} {{tours of}} the Chinese provinces after becoming Defense Minister in 1953. In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying [...] "The Chairman talks {{all the time about}} more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> with chanting these liturgies all the time?" [...] On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: [...] "unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm." [...] On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for [...] "steel", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reviewer}} in Publishers Weekly also {{questions the}} use of Biblical chapter titles: [...] "...Berg’s likening of Wilson’s life to biblical stages is overkill." [...] Walter Stahr also questions these appellations. For example, the chapter [...] "Passion," [...] covering {{the debate in the}} Senate over the Treaty of Versailles, begins with “And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.” Stahr asks [...] "Berg apparently wants us to view Wilson as Jesus, reviled and beaten by the Roman soldiers. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> us to think that Wilson was the divine Christ?" [...] Jeff Shesol asks a similar question: [...] "Berg’s decision to endow each chapter with a biblical title and a passage of scripture {{raises the question of whether}} he sees Wilson as a Christ figure or merely as a man with a Christ complex..." ...|$|E

At some point, grindcore band Extreme Noise Terror were employed, and the two bands were still recording in February 1992 when The KLF scrapped the sessions. [...] "What actually happened," [...] said ENT singer Dean, [...] "was that Bill heard us on [...] Peel {{when he was in the}} bath and got in touch. They had wanted to do rock versions of their songs with Motörhead but something fell through, so he rang us... The message said it's Bill from The KLF, but I thought they said 'the ALF' so I didn't take much notice... Later, we got another message saying it was definitely Bill from The KLF and I said 'f--- off! What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> with us?' But it all got explained eventually."

2500|$|Developed by Parroty Interactive, the self-professed National Lampoon of the {{interactive}} media industry, Microshaft Winblows 98 became the company's fourth interactive comedy video game, after Pyst, Star Warped, and The X-Fools, which parodied adventure video game Myst, science fiction film series Star Wars, and supernatural television series The X Files, respectively. Ed Bernstein, founder and CEO of Palladium Interactive had long-wanted to create works that emulated the parody found in Mad Magazine, and felt this game {{could be his}} [...] "piece de resistance", further commenting that his company {{would have been able}} to [...] "sell the empty boxes" [...] due to the game cover humour alone. Elizabeth Wasserman of Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News cited various examples of this including the tagline [...] "Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to own today?", a parody of Microsoft's own [...] "Where do you want to go to today?", and the version, listed as [...] "98 or 99 or 00 or 01". The game was written by Tony Camin, Ian Deitchman, J. P. Manoux and Kristin Rusk. In addition to containing a series of minigames for the player to explore, the software also offered enhancements to Windows 95, while additional content was available via the game's official website. Microshaft Winblows 98s animation and programming were outsourced to WayForward Technologies while Chronic Music handled the music and sound effects. The product was also released in the French language.|$|E
