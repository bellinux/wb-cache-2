5|$|During the growth, {{the chamber}} {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or {{moved away from the}} substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{struggled in}} devising gameplay features {{that would be}} enjoyed by the fans of the series. One of the hardest tasks chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki was assigned {{to do was to}} attract people who had no prior experience with the series; he decided to make the gameplay as simple as possible. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto presented the staff with a variety of opinions which they in turn would have to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the game the best way possible. Miyamoto let the team decide which graphics they wanted to use without restrictions.|$|E
5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E

5|$|Although many {{stones and}} {{materials}} were salvaged {{and used to}} rebuild the Hawkins priory in Virginia, the reconstructed house incorporated other designs and influences. Following the acquisition of the Warwickshire property, the Weddells hired chief architect Henry Grant Morse and scouted the English countryside, surveying properties and considering various designs they could <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the rebuilding process. As a result, the reconstruction is not {{a replica of the}} original building. The west wing of the house is actually a replica of Sulgrave Manor, a small manor house in Northamptonshire, England, which once belonged to Lawrence Washington, an ancestor of America's first president, George Washington. However, the center of the house is a reproduction of the original Warwickshire priory and uses the curvilinear gables, strapwork design, and balustrades that the English commonly adapted from the Low Countries in the early seventeenth century. The east wing of the house, however, is based on Wormleighton Manor, a Spencer-Churchill family estate in England.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{requested}} that Jean Dupont, {{the editor of}} L'Écho illustré– the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland– send him documentation on Swiss railways which he could draw from. He also {{requested that}} his Swiss friend Charly Fornora send him a bottle of Valais wine which he could again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva which he could then <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the story; these included at Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, {{as well as the}} road through Cervens and Topolino's house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of Geneva.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM, and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the tank-style controls to a point and click-style interface. Schafer noted they created the game with tank-style control as it was popular with other games like Resident Evil at the time, but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the point-and-click modification to obtain access to his code to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the remastered version.|$|E
50|$|April 1, 1956 - Part of Hashishita Village was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Kitagata Town. The {{remaining}} {{part was}} <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Shiroishi Town.|$|R
50|$|In January 1971, Treasure was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> World of Wonder, which a {{few years}} later was itself <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Look and Learn.|$|R
50|$|In eastern Europe also, old pagan traditions were <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Christmas celebrations, {{an example}} being the Koleda, which was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the Christmas carol.|$|R
25|$|Honda is {{attempting}} to develop a system to enable an operator to control its Asimo robot using EEG, a technology it eventually hopes to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> its automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} {{defining}} postulates of both Einstein's theory {{of general relativity}} and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence, and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically (at least {{with regard to their}} primary claims), they have proven extremely difficult to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> one consistent, cohesive model.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, Wardell was not uniquely {{responsible}} for the design. Bishop Goold instructed him to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the design as much as could be saved of the previous church. Thus he was forced retain the existing floor level, rather than raising it five metres which would have kept it on a level with the nearby street rather than below it.|$|E
50|$|Teams had 30 {{minutes to}} create a 6-minute {{presentation}} about a chore at a tournament. Two random obstacles related to the chore had to be <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the presentation. An improvisational technique had to be <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the presentation. A previously researched, randomly selected famous person also had to be <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the presentation.|$|R
50|$|December 31, 1957 - The {{neighborhoods of}} Sosorogawachi, Yunoo, Fujihira, Tashiro {{from the village}} of Kirigo are <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Genkai. Kirigo's {{remaining}} neighborhoods are <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Karatsu.|$|R

25|$|Johnny Depp's {{shooting}} {{on the film}} was the hardest to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> any of the new actors' schedules, due to his contractual obligation on Michael Mann's Public Enemies at the time; in the end, Gilliam had access to Depp for one day and three hours. All of the shots involving him had {{to be completed in}} one take, to fit into Depp's compressed time schedule.|$|E
25|$|Hess' sculptures {{are in the}} American modernist tradition. They {{ranged from}} uniquely stylized drummers and other figures to {{abstract}} works with intertwining forms and interesting surface textures. Hess was always seeking new shapes and unique structural designs to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> his sculptures. His creations are fanciful and exuberant. He often used bronze or steel for his sculptures. Some of his metal works are welded while other works are cast.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists {{only insofar as}} social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata {{that are necessary to}} constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> their habitus the proper know-how {{that will allow them to}} constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.|$|E
50|$|April 1, 1906: Part of Tōbui Village in {{the former}} Tōbui District <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Ōtsu Village. Part of Tabikorai Village, Nakagawa District was also <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Ōtsu Village.|$|R
50|$|It {{functions}} {{in a similar}} manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> DNA strands while azacitidine can be <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> both DNA and RNA chains.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 the {{community}} Ringingen was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Erbach. In {{the course of}} community reforms in 1974 the communities Bach, Dellmensingen, Donaurieden and Ersingen were also <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Erbach.|$|R
25|$|Ocean {{chemistry}} {{may also}} control which mineral shells are constructed of. Calcium carbonate has two forms, the stable calcite, and the metastable aragonite, which is stable {{within a reasonable}} range of chemical environments but rapidly becomes unstable outside this range. When the oceans contain a relatively high proportion of magnesium compared to calcium, aragonite is more stable, but as the magnesium concentration drops, it becomes less stable, hence harder to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> an exoskeleton, as it will tend to dissolve.|$|E
25|$|While {{it still}} might be valid that an {{obscured}} Seyfert 1 can {{appear as a}} Seyfert 2, not all Seyfert 2s must host an obscured Seyfert 1. Understanding {{whether it is the}} same engine driving all Seyfert 2s, the connection to radio-loud AGN, the mechanisms of the variability of some AGN that vary between the two types at very short time scales, and the connection of the AGN type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> any unified model of active galactic nuclei.|$|E
25|$|By 2010, {{production}} of the original A1 Katana model {{had come to an}} end, while the newer DA20-C1 model was still being manufactured. In November 2008, the company announced that it would be offering an Aspen Avionics glass cockpit primary flight display as an option on the DA20. Diamond indicated the Aspen PFD would be easy to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the existing instrument panel design because it mounts in a standard round instrument hole. In October 2009, the company introduced the Garmin G500 glass cockpit as an option.|$|E
50|$|The nearby {{cities of}} Hochstetten (1970), Gündlingen (1972), Niederrimsingen (1973), and Oberrimsingen (1975) along with Grezhausen, {{which had been}} <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Oberrimsingen in 1936, were all <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Breisach.|$|R
50|$|The Rittergut (manor) of Dorfthum was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Thum in 1879. With {{the zoning}} {{reforms in the}} 1990s, the {{neighbouring}} Reihendorf villages of Jahnsbach and Herold were <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Thum.|$|R
50|$|On January 1 and February 1, 1972 the Rotensol and Neusatz were {{respectively}} <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Bad Herrenalb. And finally, on January 1, 1975 Bernbach was likewise <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the municipality.|$|R
25|$|What is {{especially}} significant about the Revolution is that, {{for the first}} time in Republican history, the State attempted to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> national life the Aymara and Quechua peasants that together constituted no less than 65 percent of the total population. Although the policies pursued by the MNR were largely corporatist and assimilationist, it marked a significant turning point in Bolivia's contested history of indigenous-state relations. Following the 1952 revolution, the Bolivian state sought to strengthen its role in rural areas, implementing an extensive public health campaign that specifically included indigenous Bolivians.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, Lieut-Cdr (Ordnance) Jun Okamura was {{assigned}} as chief designer {{to assist in}} the design of a new Japanese aircraft using the Southampton as a starting point. After performance testing at Yokosuka, the Southampton was ferried to the Hiro Naval Arsenal for further study. Testing and evaluation revealed several construction innovations when compared to the German flying boats that were also undergoing evaluation. Those features included an all-metal hull and simplified construction, both of which the Japanese Navy hoped to <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the replacement for the outdated Type 15 Flying-boat.|$|E
25|$|The enzymes are encoded {{and used}} by reverse transcribing viruses, which use the enzyme {{during the process of}} replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then {{integrated}} into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome {{would not be able to}} <b>incorporate</b> <b>into</b> the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1964 the {{district}} of Rudsgrendi with 21 inhabitants was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Notodden municipality to the east. The rest of Hovin, with 461 inhabitants, was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Tinn.|$|R
50|$|Although Laudium was {{initially}} part of Pretoria, it was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Centurion following {{the end of}} apartheid. Centurion, including Laudium, was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in 2000.|$|R
25|$|Large exclaves {{affected}} by the 1844 Act included the County Durham exclaves of Islandshire, Bedlingtonshire and Norhamshire, which were <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Northumberland; and the Halesowen exclave of Shropshire, which was <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Worcestershire.|$|R
