50|$|When {{naming the}} nearly 200 species of {{butterflies}} known {{to him at}} the time, Linnaeus used names from classical mythology as specific names.

The fifth <b>group,</b> <b>the</b> Plebeji, <b>were</b> divided into Plebeji Rurales and Plebeji Urbicolae.

5|$|The Lorentz {{group is}} a Lie group and has as such a Lie algebra, The Lie algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is more social than most mustelids.

Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which {{can be made up}} of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles.|$|E
5|$|The soils in {{the lower}} part of the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are highly acidic, deep, and well-drained. A total of 22 percent of the surface rock in this area is interbedded sedimentary rock, while sandstone makes up 78 percent. The Lower Kittanning coal seam is found in the Kettle Creek watershed. Rock formations in the Kettle Creek watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group, and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from the Devonian period and the Mississippian epoch. The Burgoon Sandstone is from the Mississippian epoch and the Allegheny and Pottsville Groups are from the Pennsylvanian epoch. The Allegheny <b>Group</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only rock formation in the watershed to contain coal that is economically worth mining.|$|E
5|$|The tournament sees players {{competing}} {{for their country}} in four singles and one doubles matches, known as rubbers, {{over the course of}} three days, with the team that wins three rubbers progressing. The countries are divided into groups based upon their location or performance in previous years. The Davis Cup World <b>Group</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> top level of the competition and features matches between players from the top 16 countries {{at the start of the}} year. Countries that lose their first round match face a relegation play-off against winning countries from the continental zones. World Group winning countries progress to the quarter-finals. Nations have to win a further three ties in order to claim the position of Davis Cup Champions.|$|E

5|$|The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae {{frequently}} {{shift in}} content based on new analysis, but typically consist {{of the following}} groups. A number of dromaeosaurids have not been assigned to any particular subfamily, often because they are too poorly preserved to be placed confidently in phylogenetic analysis (see section Phylogeny below), or because they are basal relative to the primary subdivisions of Dromaeosauridae (Mahakala, for example, is the most primitive known dromaeosaurid and falls outside any named sub-group). The most basal subfamily of dromaeosaurids is often {{found to be the}} Unenlagiinae. This enigmatic <b>group</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most poorly supported subfamily of dromaeosaurids and it is possible that some or all of its members belong outside of Dromaeosauridae. The larger, ground-dwelling members like Buitreraptor and Unenlagia show strong flight adaptations, although they were probably too large to 'take off'. One member of this group, Rahonavis, is very small, with well-developed wings that show evidence of quill knobs (the attachment points for flight feathers) and it is very likely that it could fly. The next most primitive clade of dromaeosaurids is the Microraptoria. This group includes many of the smallest dromaeosaurids, which show adaptations for living in trees. All known dromaeosaurid skin impressions hail from this group and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well-developed wings. Like the unenlagiines, some species may have been capable of active flight. The subfamily Velociraptorinae has traditionally included Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, and while the discovery of Tsaagan lent support to this grouping, the inclusion of Saurornitholestes is still uncertain. The Dromaeosaurinae is usually found to consist of medium to giant-sized species, with generally box-shaped skulls (the other subfamilies generally have narrower snouts).|$|E
