5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power.

5|$|On 30 March, Nasser proclaimed a {{manifesto}} stipulating {{the restoration of}} civil liberties, greater parliamentary independence from the executive, major structural changes to the ASU, and a campaign to rid the government of corrupt elements. A public referendum approved the proposed measures in May, and held subsequent elections for the Supreme Executive Committee, the ASU's highest <b>decision-making</b> <b>body.</b> Observers noted that the declaration signaled an important shift from political repression to liberalization, although its promises would largely go unfulfilled.|$|E

5|$|The DLM {{operates}} under a decentralized {{framework in}} which internal movements are encouraged and represented in a national body. The party's constituency elects a National Assembly, the principal <b>decision-making</b> <b>body,</b> through proportional representation, where every internal movement forms a list. Composed of 51 to 101 members, determined proportionately {{by the size of}} the constituency, it maintains political priorities, alliances, and rhetoric, and elects an Executive Committee of 9 to 15 members for daily organizational activities. Other organizational bodies include the Legal Committee and Financial Committee, and internal elections occur every three years.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1976 the {{military}} command structure was simple and direct. Major General Samantar {{was not only}} commander of the National Army – and therefore commander of the organizationally subordinated navy and air force- but also {{secretary of state for}} defence and a vice president of SRC and thus a member of the major <b>decision-making</b> <b>body</b> of the government. Holding the two highest.. posts, he stood alone in the command structure between the army and President Siad, the head of state. When in July 1976 the SRC relinquished its power to the newly appointed SSRP, Samantar retained the portfolio of the Ministry of Defense. The country's real power appeared to be in the SSRP's Politburo, of which Samantar became a vice president. Before {{the military}} coup, command channels ran directly from the commander of the National Army to army sector commanders who exercised authority over military forces.. in the field, and by 1986 combat units had been reorganized along Soviet lines. There is no indication that either the chain of command to lower echelons or the organisation of combat units has changed significantly since the coup.|$|E
5|$|Loyal to {{the concept}} of the British Empire, Bruce envisaged {{strengthening}} it through mutual economic development, greater political cooperation, and common policies on defence, trade and foreign affairs. His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between Great Britain and her dominions {{in a wide range of}} areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a common foreign policy. He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective <b>decision-making</b> <b>body</b> for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant ramifications for Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the Chanak Crisis, British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to redefine its border with Greece had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey. This threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention, though no dominion government had been informed of the developments in Turkey. Although a diplomatic end to the crisis was eventually found, dominion leaders were angered at having almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Ubon Air Base in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of eastern Thailand on 1June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later. Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan, and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents. Construction of permanent accommodation began {{under the supervision}} of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron in September 1962, however, and facilities were later further improved. Despite Malaysia's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia, No.79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force (No.78 Wing) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand. Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon, and most pilots' nominally six-month-long tours of duty in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases. In March 1963 the Defence Committee, which was the highest <b>decision-making</b> <b>body</b> of the Department of Defence, recommended to Cabinet that No.79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand {{on the grounds that the}} British and New Zealand contingents had left the country. The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped maintain good relationships with Thailand and the United States. The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it would prefer a different form of assistance, however.|$|E
