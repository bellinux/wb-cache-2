40|$|Chloramphenicol has {{recently}} been criticised as antibacterial drug for cholera because of probable inactivation {{in the body and}} appearance of resistant strains of Vibrio cholerae. In the present study, chloramphenicol was compared with dihydroxymethyl <b>furalazine</b> in regard to amount of diarrhea, reduction of vibrios in stool and the drug concentration in stool and blood. 1. With oral administration of chloramphenicol, neither reduction of vibrios nor elevation of drug level in stool were seen. 2. Two cases with intravenous administration of chloramphenicol revealed high concentration of the drug and marked reduce of vibrios in stool. 3. In all cases with oral administration of <b>furalazine,</b> effective concentration of the drug in stool was regularly found and at the same time, remarkable decrease of the number of vibrios was recognized. Moreover, it was observed that vibrios disappeared in stool in almost all cases, as the level of the drug showed further elevation. 4. An untoward reaction of <b>furalazine,</b> vomiting, was seen in one case. <b>Furalazine</b> can be recommended as a substitutional drug for treatment of cholera...|$|E
