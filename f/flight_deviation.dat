A quantitative model to predict pilot deviations around convective weather in enroute airspace was developed. The model is based on the analysis of planned and actual flight trajectories and the weather encountered along them in two different Air Traffic Control “super-sectors ” (geographical regions that include several adjacent ATC enroute sectors) on five different days in the summer of 2003. One super-sector encompassed southern Indiana, southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky (ZID); the other was located in northern Ohio, along the southern shore of Lake Erie (ZOB). A deviation distance threshold for each super-sector was determined by analyzing the differences between planned and actual trajectories during a 24 -hour period in which no significant weather was present in either super-sector. A method was developed to detect automatically planned and actual flight trajectories that encountered significant weather and to determine which of these encounters were weather-related flight path deviations. The results of the automatic detection algorithm were verified by an analyst, and the verified detection results (weather-related deviations and penetrations) and associate...|$|E

Background: Accident and incident analyses have revealed that go-around procedures are often imperfectly performed because of their complexity, their high time stress, and their rarity of occurrence that avails little time for practice. We wished to examine this experimentally and establish the frequency and nature of errors in both flight-performance and visual scanning. Method: We collected flight-performance (e. g., errors in procedures, excessive <b>flight</b> <b>deviations)</b> and eye-tracking data of 12 flight crews who performed final approach and go-around flight phases in realistic full-flight transport-category simulators. Results: The pilot performance results showed that {{two thirds of the}} crews committed errors including critical trajectory deviations during go-arounds, a precursor of accidents. Eye-tracking analyses revealed that the cross-checking process was not always efficient in detecting flight-path deviations when they occurred. Ocular data also highlighted different visual strategies between the 2 crew members during the 2 flight phases. Conclusion: This study reveals that the go-around is a challenging maneuver. It demonstrates the advantages of eye tracking and suggests that it is a valuable tool for the explicit training of attention allocation during go-arounds to enhance flight safety...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{relation}} between planned and realized flight trajectories and the determinants of <b>flight</b> <b>deviations</b> is of great importance in air traffic management. In this paper we perform an in-depth investigation of the statistical properties of planned and realized air traffic on the German airspace during a 28 day periods, corresponding to an AIRAC cycle. We find that realized trajectories are on average shorter than planned ones and this effect is stronger during night-time than day-time. Flights are more frequently deviated close to the departure airport and at a relatively large angle-to-destination. Moreover, {{the probability of a}} deviation is higher in low traffic phases. All these evidences indicate that deviations are mostly used by controllers to give directs to flights when traffic conditions allow it. Finally we introduce a new metric, termed di-fork, which is able to characterize navigation points ac- cording to the likelihood that a deviation occurs there. Di-fork allows to identify in a statistically rigorous way navigation point pairs where deviations are more (less) frequent than expected under a null hy- pothesis of randomness that takes into account the heterogeneity of the navigation points. Such pairs can therefore be seen as sources of flexibility (stability) of controllers traffic management while conjugating safety and efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Radiotelephony between {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} and pilots utilises standard phraseology as the medium of communications. Standard phraseology employs specific structure, terminology and pronunciation to ensure effectiveness and accuracy. On occasions when standard phraseology is found insufficient, plain language is used to efficiently relay vital information. By default, English is the designated language of communication between controllers and pilots of international <b>flights.</b> <b>Deviations</b> from the usage of standard phraseology and lack of language proficiency had been identified {{as one of the}} causal factors in safety occurrences. Language deficiencies, specifically of the non-native speakers of the English language, had raised much concern but there is limited information in the area. This research attempted to fill a small segment of this knowledge gap. It was focussed on the usage of standard phraseology and English language in an air traffic control environment involving English Second Language users. Audio data was sourced from routine radiotelephony recordings of ‘live’ air traffic control facilities in Malaysia to capture realistic communications between controllers and pilots in the Terminal Approach Radar, Area Radar and Aerodrome Control environments. A detailed cross sectional investigation of the radiotelephony characteristics, deficiencies and errors of transmitted messages revealed the radiotelephony performances of controllers and pilots in the environments. The recurrence of deviations from standards and occurrence of errors implied the likelihood of such deficiencies taking place. Demographic groups’ descriptions complemented the radiotelephony analyses as background information on language related training. The results were comparative to other similar studies and offered new information on English Second Language speakers in the Air Traffic Control environment.

A minimum-travel-time, wind-optimal dynamic programming algorithm was developed and utilized as a surrogate for the actual userprovided routing requests. After first describing the characteristics of the flights utilizing the Central East Pacific routes for a five-day period, the results of both nominal and windoptimal routing simulations are presented. The average potential time and distance savings for the wind-optimal routes was 9. 9 min and 36 nmi per flight, respectively. When the windoptimal routing <b>flight</b> plan <b>deviations</b> were confined within the oceanic center boundary, the average potential time and distance savings were 4. 8 min and 4. 0 nmi per flight, respectively. These results are likely an upper bound on the potential savings due to the location of the polar jet stream during this five-day period. Although the sector loading did not significantly change under the wind-optimal routing simulations, the number of simulated first-loss-of-separation events did, which could contribute to increased controller workload. ...|$|R

This asymmetry reversal is likely the same effect seen in parabolic flight and could be a direct response to the change in otolithic output.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 Applications for small unmanned aerial vehicles have exploded {{over the past}} decade. Small size, maneuverability, low cost, and versatility enable utilization for applications not readily accessible by traditional manned aircraft, such as bridge inspections. However, the challenges associated with conducting inspections in a safe, cost efficient manner currently exceed the benefits of using an unmanned aircraft for inspection. The development of a multirotor-based inspection aircraft capable of maintaining flight for over eight hours is presented. Flight results from a bridge inspection conducted {{in collaboration with the}} Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and Shafer, Kline, & Warren (SKW) bridge inspection crews are also discussed. Feedback and recommendations for inspection platform improvement from MoDOT and SKW inspectors was collected. Inspectors and flight crew identified challenges with camera exposure, dual pilotinspector remote control, and aircraft stability. As a result, a new inspection platform was developed allowing for wireless dual remote control and manual control of camera exposure. Finally, and most importantly, a new metric for quantifying UAS handling and pilot workload in GPS denied environments is introduced through rigorous flight testing and the use of a modified Cooper-Harper rating scale. Inspection of the bridge substructure prevented GPS lock and increased pilot workload. To mimic the effects of flying around a bridge flight testing is conducted at the UMKC parking garage where GPS lock is denied. The aircraft and inspection solutions discussed herein have demonstrated success for acquiring meaningful inspection data while conducting safe flight operations.
