5|$|Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took {{revenge on}} the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, {{declared}} a traitor and sentenced to be disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November 1326. Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in Fleet Prison; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Edward's position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, {{but most of the}} new administration <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.|$|E
25|$|After {{a disappointing}} season in 1991–92, Galis {{was forced to}} leave Aris. The new {{management}} of the team, {{and the fact that the}} club was in decay, were the main causes for his departure. Galis, who adored Thessaloniki, had insisted on remaining in the club and playing for the team, as he believed that he still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> offer.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe {{suffered}} {{their third}} {{loss of the}} series, and although the margin of defeat was smaller, {{the way in which}} it was achieved suggested that Zimbabwean coach Kevin Curran still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> work on. Admittedly, it started very well, as Streak got Vincent out with the third delivery of the match. Ireland continued his happy knack of getting wickets, getting the opposing skipper Stephen Fleming for 23 and Hamish Marshall for 7, as New Zealand struggled to 67 for 4.|$|E

25|$|Although Khan {{had helped}} Lancashire reach t20 finals days, {{international}} selection meant that Khan would be unavailable {{to take part}} and would miss {{the end of the}} season with the club. On 1 September 2011, Khan made his Test debut against Zimbabwe; Pakistan's fast bowlers in the match were inexperienced, with just one Test cap between them. The coach, Waqar Younis, commented that though Khan had a successful spell with Lancashire he still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> learn as a Test bowler. Khan's sole wicket in the match, which Pakistan won, was that of batsman Craig Ervine caught and bowled.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Maeser {{had to be}} {{replaced}} as president by the Board of Trustees. He had been called to oversee the entire LDS education program, {{and was unable to}} do both jobs. The Board's initial choice was the twenty-seven-year-old James E. Talmage, but before they could extend the invitation, he was hired by LDS College in Salt Lake City. They instead chose a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, Benjamin Cluff, Jr.. Cluff's methods as president have been described as nearly opposite those of Maeser. Maeser was insular and conservative in his teaching methods. He kept his teachings well within the LDS world, and adhered to classical education standards. Cluff was more open to new ideas and methods. He also believed that the world outside Mormonism <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> offer the school.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Liverpool won the FA Cup {{again but}} Barnes missed the final with an Achilles tendon injury, which he later cited in his {{autobiography}} as dulling his acceleration, affecting his ability to push off from a still position, while not affecting his pace at full. He played just 12 league games in the 1991–92, scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league – their lowest finish in two decades {{and the first time}} since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Barnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly, and many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training. Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match. Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said {{in his autobiography}} that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler's (and others') opinion he still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> offer and was {{still one of the most}} talented players at the club.|$|E

500|$|The band swiftly became regulars at the club, playing there seventy-four {{times by}} the end of the year. After garnering {{considerable}} attention for their performances—which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end—the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by Seymour Stein of Sire Records. After they were seen by Sire A man Craig Leon he brought the band to the attention of the label. Stein's wife, Linda Stein, saw the band play at Mothers; she would later co-manage them along with Danny Fields. By this time, the Ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was increasingly being referred to as [...] "punk".

500|$|The mixtape {{received}} general acclaim among music critics, despite {{not being}} an official release.

[...] Rollie Pemberton from Stylus Magazine called Piracy Funds Terrorism [...] "a genre-bending adventure in shattered preconceptions and club killing beats" [...] and said that, based on the strength of the mixtape, M.I.A.'s first official album <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> live up to.

500|$|Bill Veeck hired Lemon {{to succeed}} Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16, 1976. Lemon {{took over a}} Chicago team that {{finished}} in last place in the AL West in 1976. [...] "Bob {{is the type of}} manager we need {{at this stage of the}} game", Veeck said. During spring training of 1977, Lemon said, [...] "I think we'll surprise a few people." [...] White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards to Lemon, Bannister said, [...] "He'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game, and only then we'd find out who was playing and where. Lemon's made it a serious operation." [...] As late as August 14, the White Sox were in first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award. [...] "The fans got behind us after about three weeks.

500|$|Jordan {{had been}} courting the French socialite Françoise Dior, {{but while he}} had been imprisoned, she entered a {{relationship}} with Tyndall and they were engaged to be married. On Jordan's release, Dior left Tyndall and instead married Jordan in October 1963. This contributed to a growing personal feud between the two men, with Jordan accusing Tyndall and Webster of making obscene phone calls to Dior. Tyndall was also angry at what he perceived as Jordan's deviation from orthodox Nazi thought, and {{by the fact that}} Jordan's relationship with Dior had been attracting negative sensationalist press attention for the NSM. In the spring of 1964 Tyndall and Webster tried to oust Jordan {{as the head of the}} NSM but failed. In later years Tyndall expressed the view that his involvement in the NSM had been a [...] "profound mistake", arguing that then he [...] "still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> learn" [...] and that [...] "when one sees one's nation and people in danger there is less dishonour in acting and acting wrongly than in not acting at all." ...|$|E

500|$|Winslet did {{not view}} Titanic as a [...] "springboard for bigger films or bigger pay cheques". She eschewed parts in {{blockbuster}} films {{in favour of}} independent productions that were not widely seen, believing that she [...] "still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> learn" [...] and was unprepared to be a star. She later admitted that the decision had prevented her from [...] "burn out {{by the age of}} 25". Hideous Kinky, a low-budget drama shot before the release of Titanic, was Winslet's sole film release of 1998. She turned down offers to star in Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) to do the film. Based on Esther Freud's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, Hideous Kinky {{tells the story of a}} single British mother yearning for a new life in 1970s Morocco. Writing for The New York Times, the critic Janet Maslin commended Winslet's decision to follow-up Titanic with such an offbeat project, and took note of how well she had captured her character's [...] "obliviousness and optimism".|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> do with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E
500|$|On 24 August 1992, Mexican {{newspaper}} El Siglo de Torreón {{reported that}} Miguel had begun collaborating with David Foster and Juan Carlos Calderón on some compositions, along with English-speaking composers, and selecting cover versions for the album.

Miguel had difficulty finding a suitable producer for the record; he initially worked with American audio engineer Bruce Swedien, {{but decided to}} re-record the whole album after disagreements with Swedien's direction. Unable to find a producer, he decided to co-produce the album with his long-time associate Kiko Cibrian. Recording the album took almost a year and was affected by several complications, including its high budget of over US$1.5 million, his father's death, and an appendectomy. Miguel announced that {{the name of the}} album would be Aries during a presentation at the 1993 Festival Acapulco. About the naming of the album he said, [...] "This album expresses my personal self. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> do.
