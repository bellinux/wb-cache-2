30|$|In this study, four <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> (3 HB, 3 HIB, 3 HMB, and 2 HB) were {{converted}} to 2 PM esters and measured by LC-P-ESI–MS/MS.

The four targeted <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> are intermediates in amino acid and fatty acid catabolic pathways that produce acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA in liver and skeletal muscles. Therefore, these four <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> are possible biomarkers for metabolic profiling of amino acids and lipids.

30|$|We {{established}} a sensitive and specific new LC-P-ESI–MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of four <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> (3 HB, 3 HIB, 3 HMB, and 2 HB) in human saliva, serum, and cell culture medium. Several methods for quantification of some <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> using LC-N-ESI–MS/MS {{have been developed}} (Deshpande et al. 2013; Sorensen et al. 2013). However, these methods have detection limits for 3 HMB and 3 HB of 0.3  µM (Deshpande et al. 2013) and 3  µM (Sorensen et al. 2013), respectively, and a > 100 -µL blood sample is required for quantification. The concentrations of the four examined <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> in saliva are 0.7 – 6.5  µM (Fig.  5) and quantification of these compounds in a small volume of saliva is difficult. Indeed, our preliminary study showed that only trace amounts of the four <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> in saliva were detected by LC-N-ESI–MS/MS without derivatization.|$|R
30|$|Conversion of {{the four}} <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> into 2 PM ester {{derivatives}} gave excellent peak shapes, [M + H]+ ions as base peaks in P-ESI–MS, and detection limits by SRM that were approximately 50 times lower than those for underivatized <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> in N-ESI mode (data not shown). Using this method, the four <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> in saliva were easily quantified. Recently, Tsutsui et al. determined 3 HB in human saliva by LC-P-ESI–MS/MS after derivatizing with (S)(+)- 1 -(2 -pyrrolidinylmethyl)-pyrrolidine (Tsutsui et al. 2012). This method is also sensitive and enantiomeric separation of d- and l- 3 HB was achieved. However, 3 HIB, 3 HMB, and 2 HB that are derived from amino acids were not quantified and 100  µL of saliva was used. Our method requires only 5  µL of saliva and {{can be applied to}} determination {{of the four}} <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> in lachrymal fluid collected with filter paper. Saliva and lachrymal fluid can be obtained non-invasively from humans and the concentrations of our four targeted <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> were significantly correlated among serum, saliva, and lachrymal fluid (data not shown). We chose saliva to monitor amino acids and lipid catabolic pathways because this can be more easily collected compared to lachrymal fluid. In addition, this high sensitive method can be applied to quantify the four <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> in other biological samples including serum, plasma, and urine that contain higher levels of them. Indeed, serum levels of 3 HB, 3 HIB, 3 HMB, and 2 HB were quantified in the present study (Fig.  8). In saliva, 3 HB, 3 HIB, and 3 HMB concentrations were stabile at RT for at least 24  h (Fig.  7). However, 2 HB concentration in saliva was decreased soon in several hours by standing at RT. The reason is unclear why salivary 2 HB is unstable at RT, but saliva sample needs to freeze immediately after collection until analysis.|$|R

The aggregation observed {{in this study is}} also linked to the higher EPS production by the aggregated cells. However, the aggregation seems to be a time-dependent mechanism that occurs in cells having a low metabolic activity which is also accompanied by higher hydrophobicity (Bahat-Samet et al. 2004; Joe et al. 2013) which was significantly higher in this study also.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the optimal conditions for polyhyroxyalkanoates (PHA) production using saponified sunflower oil (SO).

The main purpose of using saponified SO was {{to improve the quality of}} PHA constituents (e. g. copolymer of hydroxyl-unit) such as <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> (HBs), hydroxyvalerates (HVs) and hydroxyhexanoates (HHs). Typically, SO mainly contains long-chain-fatty-acid (LCFA) with unsaturated fatty acid (C 14 : 1 â€“ C 18 : 3) and therefore, the selected PHA-producer would be developed during unbalanced growth (feast-famine condition).

It was also shown that sludge subjected to aerobic condition in mixed cultures could accumulate high amount of PHA by manipulating the cycle length (HRT study). The high specific PHA storage rate (qpfeast = 0. 5 C-mol/C-mol. h) as well as the high sludge PHA contents achieved by mixed cultures make this saponified SO competitive with those based on the other vegetable oil (e. g. corn oil, soy oil, etc. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{assessed}} the optimal conditions for PHA production using saponified fatty acid, derived from sunflower oil (SO). A fed-batch reactor {{was used to}} produce PHA. A mixture of sewage and semi-treated oil palm effluent from a facultative pond was cultured for six months to obtain a steady-state condition. The culture was then transferred to the fed-batch system. SO mainly contains long-chain-fatty-acid (LCFA) with unsaturated fatty acid fractions of C 14 : 1 – C 18 : 3, therefore the PHA production was assessed under feast-famine condition.

30|$|Our {{cell culture}} {{experiments}} {{confirmed that the}} four targeted <b>hydroxybutyrates</b> are metabolites of lipid and amino acids; i.e. 3 HB was synthesized by hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation, 3 HIB and 3 HMB by skeletal muscular BCAA catabolism, and 2 HB in the MET/THR/αKB pathways. In low nutritional states such as fasting, metabolic disorders and endurance exercise, 3 HB serves as an excellent fuel for non-hepatic tissues and the serum level of 3 HB is increased by stimulated hepatic β-oxidation as well as ketogenic amino acids catabolism (Laffel 1999). Elevation of serum 3 HIB has also been found in fasted and diabetic subjects because BCAAs are utilized as another energy fuel in a low nutritional state (Avogaro and Bier 1989). The early steps in catabolism of the three BCAAs {{are thought to be}} concurrent reactions because the first two steps share the same enzymes: branched-chain aminotransferase and rate-limiting branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex (Shimomura et al. 2006). Therefore, the VAL metabolite 3 HIB is thought to be a common biomarker for BCAA catabolism in skeletal muscle. Indeed, our data show that salivary levels of 3 HB, 3 HIB and 3 HMB increased in parallel in patients with liver cirrhosis compared with those in healthy controls. Liver cirrhosis causes an imbalance of whole body energy metabolism, including impaired glucose tolerance, ketoacidosis and insulin resistance (Moriwaki et al. 2004). In skeletal muscles, BCAAs are used for compensatory energy production, and consequently protein breakdown and muscle atrophy develop in patients with liver cirrhosis (Shimomura et al. 2006; Platell et al. 2000; Moriwaki et al. 2004).|$|R
