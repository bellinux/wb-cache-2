The department claims this activity is responsible for a small number of cases of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in infants. This article reviews the department’s claims, as well as the claims of its challengers, and applies five secular public health ethical constructs to the department’s actions. After the analysis, the article concludes that the department has not made an ethical case to impose regulations on this religious practice...|$|E

5000|$|Beyond simply {{asking for}} a patient’s name like paper sign-in sheets {{traditionally}} did, the self-service kiosks can gather much more info to facilitate registration. Savance Health’s solution offers integration with license, ID, credit card, and insurance card scanning devices, allowing the patient to identify themselves quickly and accurately with little to no keyboard input. By using a duplex ID/insurance card scanner with a magnetic strip reader, healthcare organizations can acquire a digitally scanned image of {{the front and back}} of the patient’s license and insurance card to automatically <b>keep</b> it <b>on</b> <b>file</b> (in PDF format for example). In addition, a magnetic card swipe (MSR) credit card reader can be connected so co-pays or open balances can be collected and processed before services are offered. Eligibility checking can also be offered automatically through services like eligibilityapi.com for small transactional fees. Another common function during check-in is for patient’s to verify their insurance and address info that is <b>on</b> <b>file.</b> Changes can be made and verified by the patient rather than staff eliminating common mistakes from typos that ultimately lead to inaccurate data. [...] In addition to verifying data, focusing on patient safety and infection control can also be managed by asking simple questions like, “Are you a fall risk?” and “Do you have or have you recently had a cough, temperature, or flu-like symptoms?”. Based on their answers, staff can properly handle the patient or the kiosk can instruct the patient to wear a mask. Another common question is, “Do you require an interpreter?” allowing the appropriate staff from interpreter services or similar to automatically be dispatched. Virtually any question or data that organizations may collect now can be collected in a self-service check-in kiosk. By coupling this with pagers, text alerting, and waiting room displays, patient satisfaction and Hcap scores can have a big impact.|$|R

Most importantly, they argue this law prevents the more hesitant workers from making the decision to join the strike the day before, once they've been convinced {{to do so by}} their colleagues and more particularly the union militants, who maximize their efforts in building the strike (by handing out leaflets, organising meetings, discussing the demands with their colleagues) {{in the last few days}} preceding the strike. This law makes it also more difficult for the strike to spread rapidly to other workers, as they are required to wait at least 48 hours before joining the strike.|$|R

On Snowden, Alexander told Joye: [...] "I suspect Russian intelligence are driving what he does. Understand as well that they’re only {{going to let him}} do those things that benefit Russia, or stand to help improve Snowden’s credibility". Wired Magazine said the AFR interview with Alexander showed he was defending the stock-piling of zero-days while the Wall Street Journal and other media focussed on Alexander's claims about Snowden working for Russian intelligence.In July 2012, {{in response to a question}} from DEF CON founder Jeff Moss asking “does the NSA really <b>keep</b> a <b>file</b> <b>on</b> everyone?,” Alexander replied, “No, we don’t.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{demonstrates}} that characteristics of rejection letters combine {{in a complex}} manner to affect impressions of the organization, and like-lihood of re-applying to and of patronizing the organization. Specifically, the most negative reactions to rejection letters were found when a contact person existed, along with a long time interval before receiving a letter that failed to include an explicit statement of rejection. Some support was found for the failure to receive a rejection letter as a psychological contract violation. The way in which an applicant is rejected may impact company im-age, applicant self-concept, and the applicant’s likelihood of re-applying to or patronizing an organization (Aamodt & Peggans, 1988; Fielden & Dulek, 1982; Feinberg, Meoli-Stanton, & Gable, 1996). Despite the po-tential impact of rejection letters on applicant impressions and behav-iors, only two published studies (Aamodt & Peggans, 1988; Feinberg et al., 1996) have examined empirically reactions to rejection letter charac-teristics. Aamodt and Peggans (1988) found more positive reactions from job applicants when “friendly ” statements, information about {{the person who was}} offered the job, and a promise to <b>keep</b> the resume <b>on</b> <b>file</b> were included in the rejection letter. Feinberg et al. (1996) demonstrated that rejection letters with a more positive tone resulted in a better image of the company, and a greater likelihood of recommending the company to a friend and of recontracting the company for future employment com-pared to letters with a negative tone...|$|R
