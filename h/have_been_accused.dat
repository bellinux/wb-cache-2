50|$|Kō <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> {{of being}} a revisionist and a nationalist, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of playing down Japanese war crimes against China and Korea. His works often assert that Taiwan and Korea owe their present-day successes, and much of their culture, to Japan.|$|R
5|$|North Korea was disqualified for {{cheating}} at the 32nd IMO in 1991 {{and again}} at the 51st IMO in 2010. It {{is the only country}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of cheating. There is some debate as to whether North Korea was actually cheating, especially in the 51st IMO.|$|E
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|However, {{independent}} reviews {{have called}} into question the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies. The event's supposed drawing power outside {{of a handful of}} rugby strongholds was also downplayed significantly, with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million average audience produced by the 2007 final coming from Australasia, South Africa, the British Isles and France. Other sports <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of exaggerating their television reach over the years; such claims are not exclusive to the Rugby World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may {{only have one}} child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children. Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.|$|E
5|$|Despite its stated {{commitment}} to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its {{shows such as}} Washington Journal, Booknotes, Q & A, and After Words <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias. In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that year, and that people of color are underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E
5|$|Gillard {{worked in}} the {{industrial}} department of the law firm Slater & Gordon from 1988 through to 1995. In the early 1990s, {{she was in a}} relationship with Bruce Wilson, an official of the Australian Workers' Union (AWU). Gillard provided pro-bono legal assistance to help establish the AWU Workplace Reform Association for Wilson and his associate Ralph Blewitt. She was also involved in providing legal services in relation to the purchase of a Fitzroy property by Wilson and Blewitt. Wilson and Blewitt <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of creating the association in order to use a slush fund for personal benefit, including diverting funds for the purchase of the house in Fitzroy.|$|E

5|$|Human {{rights groups}} such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, {{as well as the}} United States Department of State and the European Union, have {{expressed}} concern about the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, and both the government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of human rights violations. Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks {{between the government and the}} LTTE, by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of fear in the north and east of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the agencies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies {{have a tendency to}} act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E
5|$|The {{market for}} replica shirts has grown enormously, with the revenue {{generated}} for leading clubs {{and the frequency}} with which they change designs coming under increased scrutiny, especially in the United Kingdom, where the market for replicas is worth in excess of £200m. Several clubs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>accused</b> of price fixing, and in 2003 Manchester United were fined £1.65m by the Office of Fair Trading. The high prices charged for replicas have also led to many fans buying fake shirts which are imported from countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Nonetheless, the chance for fans to purchase a shirt bearing the name and number of a star player can lead to significant revenue for a club. In the first six months after David Beckham's transfer to Real Madrid the club sold more than one million shirts bearing his name. A market has also developed for shirts worn by players during significant matches, which are sold as collector's items. The shirt worn by Pelé in the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final sold at auction for over £150,000 in 2002.|$|E
