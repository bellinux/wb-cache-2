However, in 2006, he altered his political stance, stating [...] "I was a Republican until they lost their minds." [...] At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence {{to the idea of}} running for Governor of Alabama, stating: I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and <b>Democrats</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration... When I run— if I run— we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{began in}} August by announcing {{its plans to}} participate in a demonstration against illegal immigration in Denver during the Democratic National Convention. Baldwin was joined by Bob Barr, Alan Keyes and Tom Tancredo at the [...] "Rally Against Illegal Immigration" [...] during {{the first day of the}} convention. Later in August, Baldwin campaigned in Spartanburg, South Carolina where he criticized both parties' presidential nominees as [...] "globalists". He declared his opposition to the Federal Reserve, which he stated has [...] "subjugated" [...] the nation to [...] "foreign dependence". He railed against the use of the National Guard in the Iraq War remarking that the forces should be used to [...] "repel" [...] the [...] "invasion" [...] of illegal aliens from the southern border, and described the United Nations as [...] "a sinister organization run by Marxists, socialists and communists." [...] Baldwin criticized both major parties for not cutting spending stating that [...] "the only difference between Democrats and Republicans is <b>Democrats</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tax and spend and Republicans want to borrow and spend." [...] He promised that slashing spending would be a priority in his administration.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Taft ran a more {{effective}} campaign for re-election to the Senate. Wooing factory workers, he visited 334 industrial plants and gave 873 speeches. He won a third term by 431,184 votes, the second largest victory margin in Ohio Senate election history until then. He benefited from a weak Democratic opponent– one observer reportedly said of [...] "Jumping Joe" [...] Ferguson, the State Auditor, [...] "If the <b>Democrats</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> win, they should send Ferguson on a mission abroad," [...] but more importantly, Ohio's unions failed to use the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which they denounced as a [...] "slave labor law," [...] against him. Additionally, Democratic Governor Frank Lausche did not endorse Ferguson and, according to journalist Sidney Lubell, almost openly supported Taft. In a post-election survey of voters, Lubell found that the overly aggressive, labor-backed anti-Taft campaign angered some Democrats.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 the Alliance {{was called}} the Center-Right Parties. After the {{election}} was lost in 1994 the Center-Right Parties was dissolved. In 2004, the four parties Moderate Party, Centre Party, Liberal People's Party and the Christian <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> collaborate again. So they started the Alliance.

2500|$|The {{day after}} the 2010 {{midterms}} elections in which the Democrats {{lost control of the}} House, Hoyer had a private conversation with Pelosi and stated that he would not challenge her bid for Minority Leader (for Pelosi to remain Democratic House Leader). He ran for minority whip, but was challenged by outgoing Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (the top House <b>Democrats</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> remain in the leadership, but the minority party in the House has one less position). Hoyer is moderate while Pelosi and Clyburn are more liberal, and a significant number of Hoyer's would-be supporters in the House who were moderate and conservative Democrats had been defeated for re-election. The Congressional Black Caucus backed Clyburn, while 30 House Democrats have supported Hoyer, and Hoyer has also raised money and campaigned for many candidates. Hoyer received further support from outgoing Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard L. Berman, Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, and outgoing Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman Pelosi intervened in the contest by supporting Hoyer as Minority Whip, while creating an [...] "Assistant Leader" [...] position for Clyburn which would keep him as the third-ranking Democrat in the House behind Pelosi and Hoyer (the existing [...] "Assistant to the Leader" [...] post formerly held by Chris Van Hollen is not officially part of the House leadership and was directly appointed by the Minority Leader).|$|E

50|$|The Mississippi Plan of 1875 was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the white insurgency during the Reconstruction Era in the Southern United States. It was devised by the Democratic Party in that state to overthrow the Republican Party in Mississippi by means of organized threats of violence and suppression or purchase of the black vote. <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> regain political control of the legislature and governor's office. Their success led to similar plans being adopted by white Democrats in South Carolina and other majority-black states.|$|R
50|$|The {{version of}} the bill that passed the House only extends the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988; it does not modify its provisions. Some <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make some modifications, however, by {{requiring}} metal components to be a permanent part of a plastic gun, rather than removable. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York was one of those Democrats. He announced that he would try to pass a rival bill in the Senate that would include additional restrictions on plastic guns and expand the law.|$|R
5000|$|The {{race was}} {{especially}} competitive, with <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> expand their majority {{as much as}} possible due to that year's presidential election. While both CQ Politics and The Rothenberg Political Report estimated Udall would win, and The Cook Political Report considered it a 'Toss Up,' Udall maintained a steady lead in the polls, but with neither candidate usually topping 50%. Udall described the race as [...] "the toughest climb I've ever taken." [...] On November 4, Udall won the election with 52% of the vote.|$|R

By nearly two to one, 55% to 29%, Republicans also thought the U.S. is making progress rather than losing ground in defeating the Taliban militarily. Among Democrats and independents 46% and 49%, respectively, said the U.S. is losing ground in defeating the Taliban militarily.|$|E
5000|$|The Liberal Democrats (UK) {{describe}} their ideology as giving [...] "power to the people"; they {{are against the}} concentration of power in unaccountable bodies. They propose decentralisation of power out of Westminster, and electoral and parliamentary reform, to create a system of tiered government structures to make decisions at {{what they see as}} the right level, including regional assemblies, the European Union, and international organisations. The Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> protect civil liberties, and oppose state intervention in personal affairs.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} this policy {{cooperation}} was the budget proposal that the Alliance parties put forward on 2 October 2005. The core proposal was a tax cut of 49 billion Swedish kronor, which is 1.9% of GDP and 3.3% of the total income {{of the public sector}} in 2005. Each individual party also proposed its own policies in addition. For example, the Liberals want to spend 1bn kronor extra on tertiary education and the Christian <b>Democrats</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have more benefits and tax deductions for families.|$|E

5000|$|In {{defending}} {{a proposal to}} cut access to the SNAP program (food stamps), Arrington cited the biblical passage Thessalonians 3-10. “He says {{even when we were}} with you we give you this rule, ‘If a man will not work he shall not eat.’ And {{he goes on to say}} ‘We heard that some of you are idle.’ I think that every American, Republican or <b>Democrat</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> help the needy among us. And I think it’s a reasonable expectation that we have work requirements. I think that gives more credibility, frankly, to SNAP." ...|$|R
50|$|After New Mexico {{territory}} {{passed to}} American rule following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, {{the issue of}} slavery in the new territory became a major issue, with the Whigs <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> keep Mexico's ban on slavery and the <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> introduce it. In the Compromise of 1850, {{it was decided that}} New Mexico Territory would be able to choose its own stance on slavery by popular sovereignty. In 1859, New Mexico passed the Act for the Protection of Slave Property. This was partially because Territorial Governor William Carr Lane and Chief Justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court Grafton Baker owned black slaves.|$|R
50|$|The USA Today - Gallup poll {{conducted}} September 22-23, 2009 {{found that the}} majority 62% of Democrats oppose sending any more U.S. troop, while the majority 63% of Republicans favor sending more U.S. troops.

Do the <b>Democrats</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that?On the other hand, it would be a tragedy if after all the blood and treasure Americans have sacrificed, Al Qaeda has not been badly damaged.America should be united in fighting these savages, but we're not. Ideology has poisoned a reasoned, disciplined approach to defeating the jihadists. America's great strength, diversity of thought, can also be a weakness.

He also went on record against cutting the county budget, and was in favor of raising the sales tax by 1.25% or more.|$|R
500|$|There {{were two}} main {{divisive}} issues in 1868. The {{first was the}} continued Reconstruction of the South. The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices, and the Republicans endorsed the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote. The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks. The <b>Democrats</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> redeem the bonds with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. The greenbacks were known as [...] "cheap money" [...] and would be inflationary. The Republicans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold, a position attractive to investors and bankers.|$|R

Republicans believe in an America run by the right people, their people, in a world in which we act unilaterally when we can, and cooperate when we have to. They think the role of government is to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of those who embrace their political, economic, and social views, leaving ordinary citizens to fend for themselves on matters like health care and retirement security. Since most Americans are not that far to the right, they have to portray us Democrats as unacceptable, lacking in strength and values. In other words, they need a divided America—but we don't."
