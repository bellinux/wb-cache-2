40|$|Présentation de l'éditeur : This book {{contributes}} to the literature on Geographical Indications (GIs) by providing key theoretical reflections from a five-year review process on the potential of GIs for agri-food products in Southern Africa. The contributors reflect on diverse GI processes and dynamics which operate at the local, national and international levels, thus enriching the understanding of GI dynamics and of the variety of policy options available for GI protection in Southern countries. Following a discussion of the legal <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> of national GI schemes in Southern countries, the book emphasizes the main dimensions underlying the development of GIs and their potential for enhancing sustainable rural development and market access in particular. This provides the structure for the chapters that build on the different experiences of Southern African industries that have embarked on GI strategies. The book includes chapters on designing an appropriate legal <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> system for the development of GIs in Southern countries. Also included are analyses of local industry and collective action dynamics in the development of GIs, the public nature of GIs {{and the role of the}} State based on contrasted case studies on origin-labeled products, including Rooibos, Karoo lamb, Karakul pelts and Camdeboo mohair. Developing Geographical Indications in the South: The Southern African Experience presents lessons of value to policymakers, industry representatives and academics in Southern countries in general.

30|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} evidence that financial system development {{has a positive}} impact on economic growth in panel 1 and 2, alternative points of views still exist. There are a number of studies that provide evidence in support of the fact that financial development has a negative impact on economic growth. Al-malkawi et al. (2012), De Gregorio and Guidotti (1995), Bernard and Austin (2011) amongst others found a negative impact of financial development on economic growth in certain countries. A close view of the major results shows developing countries are more likely to report a negative impact of financial development on economic growth.

Differences between these contexts of significance could be the economic environment, tax structure and regulatory environment which, in Hong Kong, are different from those in the US and Europe. For example, hostile acquisitions rarely take place in Hong Kong. Capital gains in Hong Kong are not subject to tax as well.

40|$|The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta {{consists}} of some 737, 000 acres of low-lying lands and channels at {{the confluence of}} the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers (Figure S 1). This region lies {{at the very heart of}} California’s water policy debates, transporting vast flows of water from northern and eastern California to farming and population centers in the western and southern parts of the state. This critical water supply system is threatened by the likelihood that a large earthquake or other natural disaster could inflict catastrophic damage on its fragile levees, sending salt water toward the pumps at its southern edge. In another area of concern, water exports are currently under restriction while regulators and the courts seek to improve conditions for imperiled native fish. Leading policy proposals to address these issues include improvements in land and water management to benefit native species, and the development of a “dual conveyance ” system for water exports, in which a new seismically resistant canal or tunnel would convey a portion of water supplies under or around the Delta instead of through the Delta’s channels.

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To report a study protocol and the theoretical framework normalisation process theory that informs this protocol for {{a case study}} investigation of private sector nurse practitioners. Background Most research evaluating nurse practitioner service is focused on public, mainly acute care environments where nurse practitioner service is well established with strong structures for governance and sustainability. Conversely, there is lack of clarity in governance for emerging models in the private sector. In a climate of healthcare reform, nurse practitioner service is extending beyond the familiar public health sector. Further research is required to inform knowledge of the practice, operational <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> of new nurse practitioner models. Design The proposed research will use a multiple exploratory case study design to examine private sector nurse practitioner service. Methods Data collection includes interviews, surveys and audits. A sequential mixed method approach to analysis of each case will be conducted. Findings from within-case analysis {{will lead to a}} meta-synthesis across all four cases to gain a holistic understanding of the cases under study, private sector nurse practitioner service. Normalisation process theory will be used to guide the research process, specifically coding and analysis of data using theory constructs and the relevant components associated with those constructs. Conclusions This article provides a blueprint for the research and describes a theoretical framework, normalisation process theory in terms of its flexibility as an analytical framework. Relevance to clinical practice Consistent with the goals of best research practice, this study protocol will inform the research community in the field of primary health care about emerging research in this field.

40|$|In 2010 the Greek economy {{entered a}} deep {{economic}} crisis. This {{was the result}} of an accumulation of structural problems in the economy, including overspending and loss of competitiveness during the previous decades, translating into persistently large budget and trade deficits. In 2015, under its third EU and IMF bailout, Greece has entered a spiral of depression that has led to its economy shrinking by one-third and unemployment skyrocketing to more than 25 percent, both a result of the austerity measures introduced as required to receive bailout funding. As a consequence, the health and education sectors have each experienced a reduction in public spending of more than one-third. We look at these two sectors before the crisis in the early 2000 s, finding that a combination of delays, lack of enforcement, and reversals of urgently needed reforms resulted in obvious weaknesses not being corrected. This has prevented these two systems from delivering the social principles of equity in provision, equal opportunities for all, universal coverage, accessibility, and affordability. Healthcare and education both lack oversight and evaluation mechanisms to ensure quality of service for its users. Additionally, there are no cost containment/efficiency mechanisms on the procurement side to avoid wasting taxpayers' money and valuable resources. This means that Greece has high cost/low outcome education and health systems. When the economic crisis struck, the ability of these two systems to deliver the above mentioned social objectives further deteriorated, as lower per capita spending on education, health and social protection lowered entitlements, benefits, and outcomes while increasing the burden of out of pocket expenses, user charges etc. We conclude by arguing {{that there is a need}} for a radical change in the institutional <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> of these two systems, by establishing truly independent regulators or agencies, answerable only to parliament) that can effectively exercise oversight over both the quality and the cost in the provision of health and education...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Public Management and Administration)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Capital-intensive {{military}} {{test and}} evaluation facilities that are governed {{within the public}} entity domain need to deliver effective and efficient services in meeting or exceeding the Department of Defence's requirements and in retaining strategic defence capabilities and technologies. Various business and operational processes currently exist in these facilities, without any common quality assurance, control and performance management systems. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to develop an integrated service excellence model in order to obtain and continuously improve service excellence in the services provided by these strategic military test and evaluation facilities, ensuring that all activities necessary to design, develop and implement a test and evaluation service are effective and efficient. In order to develop an integrated service excellence model, various management tools and approaches to improve quality in the search for service excellence were identified and described. Total Quality Management (TQM), Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), the South African Excellence Model (SAEM) and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), amongst other productivity and quality models, were researched and evaluated and tested through an empirical study conducted at the various test and evaluation facilities. Financial, human resources and environmental challenges facing the facilities in obtaining service excellence within the boundaries of public governance were explored in order to build the solutions to these challenges into the integrated service excellence model. Effective and efficient deployment of the facilities' resources, as well as the development and incorporation of safety, health and environmental policies and management standards were discussed and measured against national legislation. Applicable military, industrial and commercial quality standards and specifications, such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) quality management standards and the Republic of South Africa (RSA) military standards, were explored as the burden is on the facilities not only to obtain official accreditation to render specific test and evaluation services, but also to maintain accreditation and to execute the services against these standards. As corporate governance is a multi-faceted subject impacting on economic efficiency and shareholder's welfare, much emphasis was placed on governance principles through the identification of a <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> <b>governance</b> objectives in which the test and evaluation facilities operate. Good governance characteristics, such as discipline, transparency, independence, accountability, responsibility, fairness and social responsibility, were identified through the King 2 Report. This study was conducted amongst senior and top management of the test and evaluation facilities and amongst members of the Department of Defence through an interviewer-administered questionnaire comparing information and data on theory on service excellence, quality management, performance management, governance principles with the interviewer-questionnaire responses to performance indicators at these facilities. Management perceptions and management recommendations contributed to the development of the integrated service excellence model as well as to the future implementation of the model. It was evident through the study that no such integrated model exists to address the test and evaluation needs of the Department of Defence. Doctora...|$|E
