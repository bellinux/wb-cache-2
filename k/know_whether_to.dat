25|$|To {{know whether}} it is ethical {{to turn off the}} {{respirator}} for a quadriplegic patient requires conceptions of personal identity, a worthy human life, murder and suicide; to know how much information a doctor must provide a cancer patient to obtain proper informed consent for an experimental therapy requires conceptions of autonomy, coercion and the public good and how to balance these values; to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> break the AIDS patient’s confidentiality and inform his wife requires a framework for weighing the relative importance of competing individual rights as well as the public good.|$|E
25|$|In modern cricket, the {{two lines}} usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the {{so-called}} corridor of uncertainty, the area just outside the batsman's off stump, or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or not such a ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as off theory (contrast leg theory), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.|$|E

500|$|The band rescheduled European tour {{dates in}} the {{aftermath}} of the September 11 attacks. [...] "After the attacks the world kind of went into freeze mode and we didn't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> carry on with things or not... so we decided we'd rather everyone was safe and play the shows a little later instead," [...] said Hoppus shortly thereafter. The European dates were canceled a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was", and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to feel betrayed. The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.|$|E
500|$|Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost {{literally}} {{walked into}} his role. He was doing play-by-play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear's partner, Jerry Perenchio. [...] "Lear casually asked if I'd {{be interested in the}} part. I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> take that as a compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production. Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable. Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert Kenwith.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{said that}} the songs on I'm Breathless had a [...] "coquettish" [...] and [...] "pandering nature", and was the polar {{opposite}} to Madonna's previous release, Like a Prayer, which had an introspective composition. I'm Breathless opens {{with the sound of}} an intercom and a shuffle, and power ballad [...] "He's a Man" [...] starts, a song which Madonna sings as if she was a [...] "hooker stalking the boulevard". Also, Madonna's [...] "haunting" [...] vocals continue after the music has faded. One of the Sondheim songs, [...] "Sooner or Later", is a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub, the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. [...] "Hanky Panky", the third song and second single, deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> hit me or kiss me".|$|E

500|$|... "Hanky Panky" [...] was {{recorded}} within the three weeks time taken {{for the whole}} project. Personnel working on the song included Leonard on keyboards, Jeff Porcaro on drums, Guy Pratt on bass and Donna De Lory, Niki Haris and N'Dea Davenport on background vocals. Lyrically, the song deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from {{a line in the}} film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> hit me or kiss me". The track has a false introduction and starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz and swing song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a moderately slow groove tempo of 170 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm–C–Bm–A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm–A–B9–A7–Dm–C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained: ...|$|E

It was like {{watching}} two friends fight – fascinating and incredibly uncomfortable at the same time." [...] Christine Fenno, of Entertainment Weekly, stated The Deposition' was a simmering slow cooker of corporate intrigue, flavored by Michael Scott's ridiculousness, with spicy smack talk on the side." [...] Fenno, like Porter, also praised the acting of Jenna Fischer, saying that she [...] "stole the low-key opening scenes". [...] Travis Fickett, of IGN, stated that [...] "this happens to be the best episode of the season {{and one of the best}} episodes of the series. It's almost as if the writers planned it this way – to emphasize their importance and remind us how much we'll miss them when they're gone." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting between Steve Carell (Michael) and Paul Lieberstein (Toby). [...] BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl stated that the episode was an oddity among the series, saying [...] "The Deposition" [...] was an atypical episode of The Office, one that basically put the character of Michael Scott on trial and humiliated him over and over again." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1935 season Yorkshire {{regained the}} County Championship, and Verity passed 200wickets {{for the first}} time in his career, taking 211 at an average of 14.36 to finish third in the {{national}} averages. He took five wickets in an innings 22times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1–0. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: [...] "Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> hit you for four or six!" [...] South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches. In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: [...] "Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball.|$|E

500|$|Talk {{of doing}} a {{crossover}} with Millennium {{had been going on}} even when both shows were still on the air. After Millennium was cancelled, however, The X-Files staff realized that a crossover made sense. Despite this, writing the story proved difficult. The writers of the episode did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> write an episode that dealt solely with wrapping-up Millennium or if they should feature elements of Millennium intermixed within an X-Files investigation. The writers eventually went with the latter. Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, explained that from the planning stages of the episode, the staff's intentions were not to focus solely on a wrap-up for Millennium, but rather to answer the question of [...] "what would happen if Frank Black came into Mulder and Scully's world?" [...] Gilligan also maintains that the episode was not solely written to bring closure to the Millennium arc, but also as a way to finally write an episode of The X-Files about zombies. He explained: [...] "It wasn't about the plot as much as getting [...] down in the basement of this creepy old house with these zombies climbing up out of the ground, and having to [...] in the head." [...] According to Gilligan, another part of the inspiration for the episode was the fear surrounding the perceived Year 2000 problem. This was an issue for both digital and non-digital documentation and data storage situations which resulted from the practice of abbreviating a four-digit year to two digits. However, many people believed that it would signal a disaster or potentially the end of the world. Gilligan later joked that he was [...] "proud to say I never bought into any of that Y2K BS for a minute!" ...|$|E

I'm glad I've experienced it all – I {{had a lot of fun}} with it – but I like things the way they are." [...] However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, and Danny Cummings has frequently contributed, notably to three of Knopfler's most recent solo album releases All the Roadrunning (with Emmylou Harris), Kill to Get Crimson and Get Lucky.|$|E

2500|$|The {{need for}} {{instrumentation}} grew with {{the rapidly growing}} central electric power stations after the First World War. [...] Instrumentation was also important for heat treating ovens, chemical plants and refineries. [...] Common instrumentation was for measuring temperature, pressure or flow. [...] Readings were typically recorded on circle charts or strip charts. [...] Until the 1930s control was typically [...] "open loop", meaning {{that it did not}} use feedback. [...] Operators made various adjustments by such means as turning handles on valves. [...] If done from a control room a message could be sent to an operator in the plant by color coded light, letting him <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> increase or decrease whatever was being controlled. [...] The signal lights were operated by a switchboard, which soon became automated. [...] Automatic control became possible with the feedback controller, which sensed the measured variable, measured the deviation from the setpoint and perhaps the rate of change and time weighted amount of deviation, compared that with the setpoint and automatically applied a calculated adjustment. [...] A stand-alone controller may use a combination of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electronic analogs to manipulate the controlled device. [...] The tendency was to use electronic controls after these were developed, but today the tendency is to use a computer to replace individual controllers.|$|E
