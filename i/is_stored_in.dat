5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E
5|$|After mating sperm <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the spermathecae, {{organs of}} the female {{reproductive}} tract, {{and can be used}} up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in including New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Japan and in greenhouses in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> airtight containers {{and in an}} inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Skene found and {{transcribed}} a 15th-century Gaelic manuscript {{which gave the}} genealogies of many Highland clans. He first published his transcriptions and translations {{of it in the}} early 19th century Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis, and later with revisions in the late 19th centuryin his chief work Celtic Scotland. Today the manuscript, which Skene named MS 1450 and later MS 1467, <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the National Library of Scotland. The manuscript was written by Dubhghall Albanach mac mhic Cathail, in 1467 at Ballybothy, Co Tipperary. The following is Skene's versions of the genealogy attributed to the chiefs of Clan Macfie in the manuscript; first as in Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis secondly as in Celtic Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount of lead (1%) <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> bones; the rest is excreted in urine and feces {{within a few weeks}} of exposure. Only about a third of lead is excreted by a child. Continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation of lead.|$|E

It should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a container composed of non-reactive materials such as stainless steel or glass (other materials including some plastics and aluminium alloys may also be suitable). Because it breaks down quickly when exposed to light, it should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> an opaque container, and pharmaceutical formulations typically come in brown bottles that block light.|$|R

5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E
5|$|The ants {{were also}} {{observed}} {{to use their}} jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat. Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. Energy <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organs resembling hairs {{on the inside of}} the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks. Trap-jaws also are seen in the following genera: Anochetus, Orectognathus, and Strumigenys, plus some members of the Dacetini tribe, which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{reconnection}} {{events are}} analogues to the magnetic substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere. The difference {{seems to be}} their respective energy sources: terrestrial substorms involve storage of the solar wind's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail's neutral current sheet. The latter also creates a plasmoid which moves down the tail. Conversely, in Jupiter's magnetosphere the rotational energy <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the magnetodisk and released when a plasmoid separates from it.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
