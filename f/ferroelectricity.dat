25|$|<b>Ferroelectricity</b> is a {{characteristic}} of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. The term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. Ferromagnetism was already known when <b>ferroelectricity</b> was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by Valasek. Thus, the prefix ferro, meaning iron, was {{used to describe the}} property despite the fact that most ferroelectric materials do not contain iron.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{materials}} demonstrate <b>ferroelectricity</b> only below {{a certain}} phase transition temperature, called the Curie temperature (TC) and are paraelectric above this temperature: the spontaneous polarization vanishes, and the ferroelectric crystal transforms into the paraelectric state. Many ferroelectrics lose their piezoelectric properties above Tc completely, because their paraelectric phase has a centrosymmetric crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 R.B.

2500|$|Ferroelectric phase {{transitions}} {{are often}} characterized as either displacive (such as BaTiO3) or order-disorder (such as NaNO2), though often phase transitions will demonstrate {{elements of both}} behaviors. In barium titanate, a typical ferroelectric of the displacive type, the transition can {{be understood in terms}} of a polarization catastrophe, in which, if an ion is displaced from equilibrium slightly, the force from the local electric fields due to the ions in the crystal increases faster than the elastic-restoring forces. This leads to an asymmetrical shift in the equilibrium ion positions and hence to a permanent dipole moment. The ionic displacement in barium titanate concerns the relative position of the titanium ion within the oxygen octahedral cage. [...] In lead titanate, another key ferroelectric material, although the structure is rather similar to barium titanate the driving force for <b>ferroelectricity</b> is more complex with interactions between the lead and oxygen ions also playing an important role. In an order-disorder ferroelectric, there is a dipole moment in each unit cell, but at high temperatures they are pointing in random directions. Upon lowering the temperature and going through the phase transition, the dipoles order, all pointing in the same direction within a domain.|$|E

50|$|Quantum paraelectricity {{is a type}} of {{incipient}} <b>ferroelectricity</b> {{where the}} onset of ferroelectric order is suppressed by quantum fluctuations. From the soft mode theory of <b>ferroelectricity,</b> this occurs when a ferroelectric instability is stabilized by quantum fluctuations. In this case the soft-mode frequency never becomes unstable (Fig. 1a) as opposed to a regular ferroelectric.|$|E
5000|$|A {{possible}} origin for a multiferroic {{state is}} charge ordering. Such an order {{can occur in}} a compound containing ions of mixed valence and with geometrical or magnetic frustration. These ions form a polar arrangement, causing improper <b>ferroelectricity</b> (i.e. no ionic displacement). If magnetic ions are present, a coexisting magnetic order can be established and may be coupled to <b>ferroelectricity</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} of practical routes to creating multiferroic materials from 2000 stimulated intense activity. Particularly key early works were {{the discovery of}} large ferroelectric polarization in epitaxially grown thin films of magnetic BiFeO3, the observation that the non-collinear magnetic ordering in orthorhombic TbMnO3 and TbMn2O5 causes <b>ferroelectricity,</b> and the identification of unusual improper <b>ferroelectricity</b> that {{is compatible with the}} coexistence of magnetism in hexagonal manganite YMnO3.|$|E

50|$|Multiferroicity and magnetic-ferroelectric crossover. The PJTE {{theory of}} <b>ferroelectricity</b> in ABO3 {{crystals}} was expanded to show that, dependent {{of the number}} of electrons in the dn shell of the transition metal ion B4+ and their low spin or high spin arrangement (which controls the symmetry and spin multiplicity of the ground and PJTE active excited states of the BO6 center), their <b>ferroelectricity</b> may coexist with a magnetic moment (multiferroicity). Moreover, in combination with the temperature dependent spin crossover phenomenon (which changes the spin multiplicity), this kind of multiferroicity may lead to a novel effect of magnetic-ferroelectric crossover.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} the {{coexistence}} of magnetism and <b>ferroelectricity</b> (multiferroic), one possible mechanism is lone-pair driven where the A-site drives the displacement and partially filled “d” shell on the B-site contributes to the magnetism. Examples include BiFeO3, BiMnO3, PbVO3. In the above materials, the A-site cation (Bi3+, Pb2+) has a stereochemically active 6s2 lone-pair which causes the Bi 6p (empty) orbital to come closer in energy to the O 2p orbitals. This leads to hybridization between the Bi 6p and O 2p orbitals and drives the off-centering of the cation towards the neighboring anion resulting in <b>ferroelectricity.</b> In BiFeO3, for example, off-centering of ions gives rise to an electric polarization, while at a lower temperature additional magnetic ordering breaks time-reversal symmetry.|$|E
50|$|One {{prominent}} {{example for}} a charge ordered multiferroic is LuFe2O4, which shows improper <b>ferroelectricity</b> below 330 K. The arrangements of the electrons {{arise from the}} charge frustration on a triangular lattice with the mixed valence state of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. Ferrimagnetic behavior occurs below 240 K.|$|E
50|$|Barium {{titanate}} (often {{mixed with}} strontium titanate) displays <b>ferroelectricity,</b> meaning that its mechanical, electrical, and thermal responses are coupled {{to one another}} and also history-dependent. It is widely used in electromechanical transducers, ceramic capacitors, and data storage elements. Grain boundary conditions can create PTC effects in heating elements.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{improper}} FE, the primary order parameter is not the ferroelectric distortion but another type of phase change, like magnetic ordering or a structural change. The FE distortion is a secondary order parameter {{in the sense that}} it is driven by the presence of other order parameters. One example of improper FE is when the inversion symmetry of a crystal is broken by magnetic structure like spiral magnetic ordering. This is the spin-driven ferroelectric. The microscopic mechanism of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in spiral multiferroics involves spin-orbit coupling. The polarization is smaller than the one of proper FE.ME coupling is very strong because <b>ferroelectricity</b> is driven by magnetic order and do not exist without the latter. That means that any change in the magnetic order will affect the <b>ferroelectricity.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{analogy to}} {{ferromagnetic}} and paramagnetic materials, the Curie temperature {{can also be}} used to describe the phase transition between <b>ferroelectricity</b> and paraelectricity. In this context, the order parameter is the electric polarisation that goes from a finite value to zero when the temperature is increased above the Curie temperature.|$|E

50|$|In turn, pyroelectricity is seen most {{strongly}} in materials which also display the ferroelectric effect, {{in which a}} stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field. Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of <b>ferroelectricity.</b> This {{can be used to}} store information in ferroelectric capacitors, elements of ferroelectric RAM.|$|E
50|$|Type-II multiferroics include rare-earth manganites such as TbMnO3, HoMn2O5. Here, {{magnetism}} causes <b>ferroelectricity</b> {{and ordering}} temperatures are usually identical, which are, however, {{at very low}} temperatures (e.g. 28 K in case of TbMnO3). Moreover, they exhibit low net magnetization due to antiferromagnetic spin-spiral structures and low polarization {{of the order of}} 10−2 μC/cm2.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{materials}} demonstrate <b>ferroelectricity</b> only below {{a certain}} phase transition temperature, called the Curie temperature (TC) and are paraelectric above this temperature: the spontaneous polarization vanishes, and the ferroelectric crystal transforms into the paraelectric state.

50|$|Lithium niobate is a colorless solid {{insoluble}} in water. It has a trigonal crystal system, which lacks inversion symmetry {{and displays}} <b>ferroelectricity,</b> Pockels effect, piezoelectric effect, photoelasticity and nonlinear optical polarizability. Lithium niobate has negative uniaxial birefringence which depends slightly on the stoichiometry {{of the crystal}} and on temperature. It is transparent for wavelengths between 350 and 5200 nanometers.|$|E
50|$|A complex oxide is a {{chemical}} compound that contains oxygen {{and at least}} two other elements (or oxygen and just one other element that's in at least two oxidation states). Complex oxide materials are notable for their wide range of magnetic and electronic properties, such as ferromagnetism, <b>ferroelectricity,</b> and high-temperature superconductivity. These properties often come from their strongly correlated electrons in d or f orbitals.|$|E

50|$|At high temperatures, lead {{titanate}} adopts a cubic perovskite structure. At 760 K, the material undergoes a second order phase {{transition to a}} tetragonal perovskite structure which exhibits <b>ferroelectricity.</b> Lead titanate {{is one of the}} end members of the lead zirconate titanate (Pb 0≤x≤1, PZT) system, which is technologically {{one of the most important}} ferroelectric and piezoelectric ceramics; PbTiO3 has a high ratio of k33 to kp with a high kt.|$|E
5000|$|Perovskite {{materials}} exhibit many {{interesting and}} intriguing properties {{from both the}} theoretical and the application point of view. Colossal magnetoresistance, <b>ferroelectricity,</b> superconductivity, charge ordering, spin dependent transport, high thermopower and the interplay of structural, magnetic and transport properties are commonly observed features in this family. These compounds are used as sensors and catalyst electrodes in certain types of fuel cells [...] and are candidates for memory devices and spintronics applications.|$|E
50|$|Magnetically driven <b>ferroelectricity</b> is {{also caused}} by inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interaction. This effect appears {{due to the}} {{coupling}} between inhomogeneous order parameters. It was also called as flexomagnetoelectric effect. Usually it is describing using the Lifshitz invariant (i.e. single-constant coupling term). It was shown that in general case of cubic hexoctahedral crystal the four phenomenological constants approach is correct. The flexomagnetoelectric effect appears in spiral multiferroics or micromagnetic structures like domain walls and magnetic vortexes. <b>Ferroelectricity</b> developed from micromagnetic structure can appear in any magnetic material even in centrosymmetric one. Building of symmetry classification of domain walls leads to determination {{of the type of}} electric polarization rotation in volume of any magnetic domain wall. Existing symmetry classification of magnetic domain walls was applied for predictions of electric polarization spatial distribution in their volumes. The predictions for almost all symmetry groups conform with phenomenological theory in which inhomogeneous magnetization couples with homogeneous polarization. The total synergy between symmetry and phenomenological theory appears if energy terms with electrical polarization spatial derivatives are taking into account.|$|E
50|$|Ferroelasticity is a {{phenomenon}} in which a material may exhibit a spontaneous strain. In ferroics, ferroelasticity is the mechanical equivalent of <b>ferroelectricity</b> and ferromagnetism. When stress is applied to a ferroelastic material, a phase change will occur in the material from one phase to an equally stable phase, either of different crystal structure (e.g. cubic to tetragonal), or of different orientation (a 'twin' phase). This stress-induced phase change results in a spontaneous strain in the material.|$|E
50|$|Pyroelectric {{charge in}} {{minerals}} develops {{on the opposite}} faces of asymmetric crystals. The direction in which the propagation of the charge tends toward is usually constant throughout a pyroelectric material, but, in some materials, this direction can be changed by a nearby electric field. These materials are said to exhibit <b>ferroelectricity.</b> All pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric, the two properties being closely related. However, note that some piezoelectric materials have a crystal symmetry that does not allow pyroelectricity.|$|E
5000|$|Experimentally this is {{associated}} with an anomalous behaviour of the dielectric susceptibility, for example in SrTiO3. [...] In a normal ferroelectric, close to {{the onset of the}} phase transition the dielectric susceptibility diverges as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature. However, {{in the case of a}} quantum paraelectric the dielectric susceptibility diverges until it reaches a temperature low enough for quantum effects to cancel out the <b>ferroelectricity</b> (Fig. 1b). In the case of SrTiO3 this is around 4K.|$|E
