5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E

30|$|The {{first game}} state configures the wrist sensor {{of the current}} player to {{determine}} whether the player reaches down to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a dice. This event is broadcasted to the smart dice. The smart dice periodically sample their acceleration sensors using an acceleration service to detect whether they are moved by a variance and threshold service. The decision tree service shown in Figure 6 runs on the smart dice and reports to the mobile phone when the pickup and moving events coincide. Correlation between the pickup movement and the movement of the dice indicates which player <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dice. The indication of who <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dice is sent to the Farkle game service. This information is used to monitor that the game rules are appropriately followed. If <b>the</b> wrong player <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dice, a message is displayed on the screen and the application asks the players to restart the turn by throwing the dice anew. If <b>the</b> right player <b>has</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dice, the Farkle game service reconfigures the Titan nodes with the service graphs to recognize the next activities.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese raiding force {{encountered}} only {{a single}} Allied ship during its operation. On the morning of 9 March Tone shelled and sank the British steamer Behar in the central Indian Ocean. This ship was bound from Fremantle to Colombo, {{as part of a}} voyage to the United Kingdom. Behars crew broadcast a distress signal after being attacked to warn other Allied ships, causing the commander of the raiding force to abandon the operation. The heavy cruisers were escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the Netherlands East Indies on 16 March. Shortly afterwards, 89 of the 104 Behar survivors who had been rescued by Tones crew were murdered on board the cruiser. The commanders of the raiding force and Tone were convicted of this crime after the war and imprisoned. The Allies were unaware of the attack on Behar until a ship which <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steamer's distress signal arrived in Fremantle on 17 March. The orders diverting Allied shipping from the central Indian Ocean were cancelled on 18 March.|$|E

Luck returned to the lineup on October 18 in a 34–27 loss to the New England Patriots.

On November 10, it was announced that Luck would miss 2–6 weeks with a lacerated kidney and a partially torn abdominal muscle, suffered during the fourth quarter of the Colts 27–24 win over the previously undefeated Denver Broncos two days prior.
