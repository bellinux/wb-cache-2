40|$|Abstract: Numerical and {{experimental}} investigations {{were conducted in}} a transonic centrifugal compressor stage composed of a backswept splittered unshrouded impeller and a vaned diffuser. Unsteady three-dimensional simulations were performed with the code elsA that solves the turbulent-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, at three operating points: choked flow, peak effi-ciency, and near surge. Numerical results were validated with experimental data coming from laser Doppler anemometry and unsteady pressure measurements. This article focuses on the change in flow structures when the operating point moves from choke to surge. The main changes in the impeller consist in an enlargement of the wake (of the jet-wake flow structure) {{and an increase in}} the exit time-averaged flow angle. Consequently, in the diffuser passage, the main flow trajectory moves towards the vane pressure side, and the boundary layer separation transfers from pressure side to suction side. The interaction between the vane bow shock wave and the impeller blade leads to pressure waves þ, which propagate in the diffuser passage. These pressure waves generate alternately opposite and favourable pressure gradients, which drive the boundary layers to periodic separa-tion. From choke to surge, the intensity of the pressure waves þ increases. The interaction also leads to subsonic pockets D, which are torn out from the vane-leading <b>edge</b> <b>bow</b> shock and swept along the vane suction side. The induced change in the shock shape and location combined with the severe hub/suction side corner separation are thought to be at the origin of the surge inception...|$|E

In high-level feature extraction, our main focus {{is to explore}} the upper limit of bag-of-visualwords (BoW) approach based upon local appearance features. We study and evaluate several factors which could impact the performance of BoW. By considering these important factors, we show that a local feature only system already yields top performance (MAP = 0. 0935). This conclusion is similar to our recent experiment of VIREO- 374 on TRECVID- 2006 dataset [1], except that the improvement, when incorporating with other features, is marginal.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{scenario}} resulting in time-dependent behaviour {{of the bow}} shock and transient, local ion reflection under unchanging solar wind conditions. Dayside magnetopause reconnection produces flux transfer events driving fast-mode wave fronts in the magnetosheath. These fronts push out the bow shock surface due to their increased downstream pressure. The resulting bow shock deformations lead to a configuration favourable to localized ion reflection and thus the formation of transient, travelling foreshock-like field-aligned ion beams. This is identified in two-dimensional global magnetospheric hybrid-Vlasov simulations of the Earth's magnetosphere performed using the Vlasiator model ([URL] We also present observational data showing the occurrence of dayside reconnection and flux transfer events {{at the same time}} as Geotail observations of transient foreshock-like field-aligned ion beams.

40|$|In {{the solar}} wind and in middle {{latitude}} regions of the magnetosphere, spacecraft sheath fields obscure the ambient field under low plasma flux conditions such that valid measurements are confined to periods of moderately intense flux.

Spike-like, non-oscillatory, fields lasting less than 0. 2 seconds are occasionally seen at the bow shock and at the magnetopause and also intermittently appear in magnetosheath and plasma sheet regions under highly variable field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Roll forming of ultra-high {{strength}} steels (UHSS) {{and other}} high strength alloys is an advanced manufacturing methodology {{with the ability}} of cold forming those materials to complex three-dimensional shapes for lightweight structural applications. Due to their high strength, most of these materials have a reduced ductility which excludes conventional sheet forming methods under cold forming conditions. Roll forming is possible due to its low strains and incremental forming characteristic. Recent research investigates the development of high strength nano-structured aluminum sheet and titanium alloys, {{as well as their}} behaviour in roll forming with regard to formability, material behaviour and shape defects. The development of new materials is often limited to small scale samples due to the high preparation costs. In contrast, industrial application needs larger scale tests for validation, especially in roll forming where a minimum sheet length is required to feed the sample trough the roll forming machine. This work describes a novel technique for studying roll forming of a short length of experimental material. DP 780 steel strips (500 mm – 1300 mm length) were welded between two mild steel carrier sheets of similar width and thickness giving an overall strip length of 2 m. Roll forming trials were performed and longitudinal <b>edge</b> strain, <b>bow</b> and springback determined on the welded samples and samples formed of full length DP 780 strip before and after cut off. The experimental results of this work show that this method gives a reasonable approach for predicting material behavior in roll forming transverse to the rolling direction. In contrast to that significant differences in longitudinal bow were observed between the welded sections and the sections formed of full length DP 780 strip; this indicates that the applicability of this method is limited with regard to predicting longitudinal material behavior in roll forming. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the experimentally determined critical distance of the screw dislocation annihilation in persistent slip bands is still an open question. We attempt to analyze this problem using the discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. Dislocations are represented by parametrically described curves. The model {{is based on the}} numerical solution of the dislocation motion law belonging to the class of curvature driven curve dynamics. We focus on the simulation of the cross-slip of one <b>edge</b> dislocation curve <b>bowing</b> out of the wall of a persistent slip band channel and one screw dislocation gliding through the channel. The dislocations move under their mutual interaction, the line tension and the applied stress. A cross-slip leads to annihilation of the dipolar parts. In the changed topology each dislocation evolves in two slip planes and the plane where cross-slip occurred. The goal of our work is to develop and test suitable mathematical and physical model of the situation. The results are subject to comparison with symmetric configuration of two screw dislocations studied in papers by Pau et al. The simulation of the dislocation evolution and merging is performed by the improved parametric approach. Numerical stability is enhanced by the tangential redistribution of the discretization points...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of motion-induced illusory figure {{determined}} by local kinematic information is investigated. The new figure is induced by radial line patterns subjected to either figure motion (the lines change {{as if they were}} stationary and a triangle was rotating in front of them) or background motion (the lines change as if they were being rotated behind a stationary triangle). Although the two kinds of motion are equivalent from the viewpoint of relative displacements, perceptually they yield very different results. With background motion, observers tend to perceive rigid figures that have a triangular shape. With figure motion, observers report seeing deforming figures with shapes that vary depending on the number of lines in the display. We consider two alternative accounts for this asymmetry which we term the background superiority effect (BSE). The first account proposes that the effect is due to retinal persistence and to figure stability. Against this line of explanation, we demonstrate that observers also see rigid triangular shapes in displays where both the figure and the radial lines rotate (double motion displays). The second account proposes that the effect depends on the availability of local kinematic information constraining contour orientation. This second line of explanation is consistent with observers' reports of <b>bowed</b> <b>edges</b> in double motion displays rotating in phase or in counterphase. Candidate mechanisms for extracting local kinematic information are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation into the behavior of weakly advected jets in a cross-flow. Concentration profiles are measured using a laser-induced-fluorescence system. The data show that weakly advected jets can be modeled effectively assuming the profiles are Gaussian and self-similar. A simple advection model is developed {{based on the assumption that}} weakly advected jets behave in essentially the same way as jets in a still environment but that they are in addition advected by the ambient current. Concentration profiles of still and weakly-advected jets are shown to be similar. However, in the weakly advected jet experiments there are profile distortions near the <b>edges</b> of the <b>Bow</b> and some detachment of tracer from the main body of the jet. Comparisons of spread, dilution, and trajectory data with predictions from the simple advection model show that the behavior of the discharge resembles a still jet and that it is the average velocity that locates the weakly advected jets (not the previously suggested centerline velocity). This indicates the significant role that large-scale turbulent structures play in determining the mean flow behavior of weakly advected jets. A comparison of fluctuation statistics shows that the strength and intermittency of the concentration fluctuations in still and weakly advected jets are similar in the central regions of these flows...|$|R
