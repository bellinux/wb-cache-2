To address this problem, mathematical models have been produced and an experimental validation has been carried out. The models were developed with 7 -DOF, for a full car system, using MATLAB programs. In the simulation study, the suspension faults have been considered by running the models {{with a range of}} inflation pressures at four conditions i. e. at standard pressure (2. 3 bar) and 1. 5 bar on the passenger wheel, <b>driver</b> <b>wheel</b> and front wheels. In each case, an analysis was carried out on the performances of the suspension in terms of ride comfort, road handling and stability of the vehicle followed by the presentation of the results obtained. In addition, the influence of parameter variations on transfer functions as a fault detection of suspension has been introduced. This approach has been used when detecting faults of vehicle tyres being under-inflated 35 % and also to detect other suspension faults in the future. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This project {{proposes to}} develop a driver simulator, which takes into account {{information}} about the user state of mind (level of attention, fatigue state, stress state). The user’s state of mind analysis is based on video data and physiological signals. Facial movements such as eyes blinking, yawning, head rotations … are detected on video data: they are used in order to evaluate the fatigue and attention level of the driver. The user’s electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response are recorded and analyzed in order to evaluate the stress level of the driver. A driver simulator software is modified {{in order to be}} able to appropriately react to these critical situations of fatigue and stress: some visual messages are sent to the <b>driver,</b> <b>wheel</b> vibrations are generated and the driver is supposed to react to the alertness messages. A flexible and efficient multi threaded server architecture is proposed to support multi messages sent by different modalities. Strategies for data fusion and fission are also provided. Some of these components are integrated within the first prototype of OpenInterface (the Multimodal Similar platform).

40|$|Maintaining correct {{inflation}} pressure in tires helps to keep vehicle handling, passenger comfort and braking at its best, {{as well as}} improving fuel efficiency and tire life. Therefore {{it is very important}} that the tires are correctly inflated. To address this problem, in the present study experimental investigations have been carried out to identify the effect of under-inflated tires on suspension system performance by measuring vertical acceleration (vibration) of the suspension system. The experimental work has been conducted by driving a car on the road with range of {{inflation pressure}} at four conditions (e. g. at standard pressure (2. 3 bar) and at 1. 5 bar of passenger wheel, <b>driver</b> <b>wheel</b> and front wheels). During the experiment the signals of tire pressure, the suspension vibration and the car speed were measured. To analyze the signals, the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) method was used to detect the effects of tire inflation on the performance of suspension. The STFT technique has provided time-frequency information and the frequency components of the signal with relative maximum energy transmitted to the car body. The results show that, when the tires were under-inflated by approximately 35 percent, it was significantly increased the vibration of the car body by up to 30 percent. The analysis has also shown that STFT analysis is more accurate than the spectrum analysis for distinguishing of the tire fault. These effective measurements potentially will use to develop an online condition monitoring system in future...|$|E

The considered questions can be used for wheel drivers’ optimal loading with tangential traction and consecutive efficiency improving.

50|$|The fireman's role on a steam {{locomotive}} {{is to ensure}} the driver has an adequate supply of steam at his disposal at all times. This is achieved by maintaining a supply of fuel to the fire, and by maintaining the boiler water level so that it covers the firebox crown sheet at all times - otherwise, the latter will overheat and weaken, and a boiler explosion may result. At the terminal after the day's work is done, the fireman will fill the boiler with water and either bank or dump the fire (i.e. extinguish the fire), according to company policy, and chock the <b>driver</b> <b>wheels</b> to prevent the locomotive from moving while it is unattended.|$|R
