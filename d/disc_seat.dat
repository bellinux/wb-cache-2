50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the <b>disc</b> <b>seat</b> and body seal (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve the <b>disc</b> <b>seat</b> contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between disc and seat. In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal {{so that it can}} be machined such as to achieve a bubble tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.|$|E

The rear end appearance of the sedan was adopted from the first generation Legend coupe, as the first generation sedans appearance was {{very similar to the}} first generation Subaru Legacy, and Honda also wanted to visually align the appearance of both the Legend coupe and sedan to the Acura NSX. The segment the Legend originally filled was now being served by the Acura Vigor which allowed the Legend to position itself more towards the rear drive Lexus LS and the Infiniti Q45 sedans. Honda decided not to upgrade the size of the engine to a V8 because it would have upstaged the Acura NSX which has a V6 that introduced Honda's VTEC technology.|$|R
50|$|A ceramic valve is a valve with ceramic trim, ball, <b>seat,</b> <b>disc</b> or lining. A carbon or {{stainless}} steel body is used to protect the ceramic trim from being damaged by sudden thermal or mechanical shock. Advanced ceramics {{are used in the}} manufacture including alumina, zirconia and silicon nitride. Significant benefits of the use of ceramic in valves (when compared to steel or other traditional materials) include resistance to wear and their lower mass. Thanks to the excellent corrosion resistance, abrasive resistance and wear resistance, ceramic valves are often used in severe corrosive and abrasive applications, such as FGD, and pneumatic refuse conveying systems.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{four sets}} of tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and conducted by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The tests support research addressing {{the need to provide}} assurance that motor-operated valves are able to perform their intended safety function, usually to open or close against specified (design basis) flow and pressure loads. One of the parameters that affects a gate valve's operability is the friction between the <b>disc</b> <b>seats</b> and the valve body seats. In most gate valves, these surfaces are hardfaced with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The tests described in this report investigate the changes that occur in the friction as the Stellite 6 surfaces develop an oxide film as they age. Stellite 6 specimens were aged in a corrosion autoclave, the oxide films were examined and characterized, and the specimens were subjected to friction testing in a friction autoclave. A very thin oxide film formed after only a fe w days of natural aging. Even a very thin oxide film caused an increase in friction. The surface structure of the oxide film was dominated by a hard crystalline structure, such that the friction response was analogous to rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. In the limited data provided by naturally aged specimens (78 days maximum exposure, very thin oxide films), the friction increased with greater aging time, approaching an as-yet-undetermined plateau. Although the thickness of the oxide film increased with greater aging time, the mechanical properties of the oxide film (larger granules with greater aging time) appeared to play a greater role in the friction response. Friction testing of specimens subjected to simulated in-service testing strokes at intervals during the aging process showed only a slight decrease in friction, compared to other specimens. Results from specimens subjected to accelerated aging were inconclusive, because of differences in the structure and comp osition of the oxide films, compared to naturally aged specimens. For the naturally aged specimens, the highest friction occurred on the first stroke. The first stroke smeared the oxide film and dislodged some of the granules, so that subsequent strokes saw lower friction values and less variation in the friction. This result underscores the importance of planning in-plant tests so that data are collected from the first stroke following a period of inactivity...|$|R
50|$|When first {{shown on}} Sardinia {{and at the}} Paris Auto Show in 1967, the 1100 was {{advanced}} in design, featuring a hatchback with folding rear <b>seats,</b> <b>disc</b> brakes, rack and pinion steering, an independent front (double wishbone) and rear (trailing arm) suspension using torsion bars. Numerous permutations were available, with a manual, automatic and semi-automatic transmission. The engine was slanted {{to allow for a}} lower bonnet; and the engine, gearbox, and suspension were carried on a subframe to allow the unibody to be relatively unstressed. The body was welded to the frame, not bolted. The 1100 was reportedly studied closely by Volkswagen when the latter company was designing its Volkswagen Golf, after making rear-engined, rear-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Operating {{positions}} for 2-port valves {{can be either}} shut (closed) so that no flow at all goes through, fully open for maximum flow, or sometimes partially open to any degree in between. Many valves are not designed to precisely control intermediate degree of flow; such valves {{are considered to be}} either open or shut. Some valves are specially designed to regulate varying amounts of flow. Such valves have been called by various names such as regulating, throttling, metering, or needle valves. For example, needle valves have elongated conically-tapered <b>discs</b> and matching <b>seats</b> for fine flow control. For some valves, there may be a mechanism to indicate by how much the valve is open, but in many cases other indications of flow rate are used, such as separate flow meters.|$|R

50|$|To {{back its}} {{image as a}} {{technically}} advanced car for the 1980s, the Mark VII was equipped with {{a long list of}} standard equipment. A fully digital dashboard featured an onboard trip computer and message center; automatic climate control was also standard. Other standard features included four-wheel air suspension, four-wheel <b>disc</b> brakes, power <b>seats,</b> an AM/FM stereo, and power windows, locks, and mirrors. All Mark VIIs featured a power deck-lid release (through an interior mounted button) and electric pull-down, in which the trunk lid was partially lowered by hand, and then automatically pulled down about an inch by a motor mounted inside the trunk latch. All models were now installed with Ford's Keyless Entry System, and an automatic dimming high-beam module. This worked via a sensor located adjacent to the rear-view mirror, and sensitivity could be adjusted by a dial located on the dashboard.|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} several years, {{researchers}} at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, under the sponsorship of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, have been investigating the ability of motor-operated valves to close or open when subjected to design basis flow and pressure loads. Part of this research addresses the friction that occurs at the interface between the valve disc and the valve body seats during operation of a gate valve. In most gate valves, these surfaces are hardfaced with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The nuclear industry has developed methods to analytically predict the thrust needed to operate these valves at specific pressure conditions. To produce accurate valve thrust predictions; the analyst must have a reasonably accurate, though conservative, estimate of the coefficient of friction at the disc-to-seat interface. One {{of the questions that}} remains to be answered is whether, and to what extent, aging of the <b>disc</b> and <b>seat</b> surfaces affects the disc-to-seat coefficient of friction. Specifically, does the accumulation of a surface film due to aging of these surfaces increase the coefficient of friction and if so, how much? This paper presents results of specimen tests addressing this issue with emphasis on the following: • The change in the friction coefficient of Stellite 6 as it ages and whether the friction reaches a plateau. • The effect periodic gate valve cycling due to in-service testing has on the friction coefficient. • The results of an independent review of the test methods, processes, and the results of the research to date. • The status of ongoing aging and friction testing...|$|R
50|$|Honda {{began selling}} the 1169 cc (70 in³) {{transversely}} mounted inline-four engine Civic for about US$2,200. The Civic was largely {{developed as a}} new platform, and {{was the result of}} taking the previous Honda N600 and increasing the length, width, height, and wheelbase. The engine displacement was almost double the previous N600 (599 cc) at 1,170 cc, with two more cylinders added. The car produced roughly 50 hp (37 kW) and included power front <b>disc</b> brakes, vinyl <b>seating,</b> reclining bucket seats, and a woodgrain-accented dashboard which has many similarities to the later Rover SD1. The hatchback version added a fold-down rear seat, an AM radio, and cloth upholstery. The car had front and rear independent suspension. A four-speed manual transmission was standard. Options for the Civic were kept to a minimum, consisting of air conditioning, a two-speed semi-automatic transmission called the Hondamatic, radial tires, and a rear wiper for the hatchback. The car could achieve 40 mpg on the highway, and with a small 86.6 in wheelbase and 139.8 in overall length, the vehicle weighed 1,500 pounds (680 kg).|$|R
40|$|The {{previous}} research on the pump valve is mostly focused on theory and simulation, but how much precision of these results can be obtained is rarely of concern. A new experimental approach for accurately measuring the reciprocating pump valve motion parameters has been presented. An FEA model to describe the pump valve's collision contact statealso been established. Combining the measured valve's velocity and displacement data, the collision contact characteristics in valve assembly during pump operation have been systematically analyzed by ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The von Mises stress in valve <b>disc</b> and its <b>seat</b> changed by the variables such as valve closing speed, mass, diameter, and taper angle in the collision contact process are quantitatively determined, {{as well as the}} relationship between valve's collision contact condition and pump service life.

40|$|AbstractMany {{industrial}} engineering problems require fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis and dynamics analysis to improve functionality or operational performance. One such {{problem is the}} popping off of pressure safety valve (PSV) widely used in pressure vessels and pipes. Popping off of a spring-loaded pressure safety valve (PSV) is crucial to prevent the pressure vessel or pipe from overpressure. It's difficult to observe {{the dynamics of the}} valve disc as well as the flow characteristics through the small chamber between the valve <b>disc</b> and valve <b>seat</b> over such a remarkable short period in the past. To address this issue, a transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with moving grid technique has been presented in this work. Fine structure grid has been generated over the whole flow domain to ensure that the valve disc can move freely and continuously without negative volume problem. Two types of time-dependent overpressure are given to simulate the popping of the PSV under different overpressure conditions. Response parameters such as the displacement of the disc, fluid force on the disc and the blowdown value are monitored to see their influence on the popping of the valve. The results are helpful to improve the popping action of the valve in design stage, and demonstrate the availability and efficiency of using transient CFD simulation in the popping analysis of spring-loaded PSV...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{is funding}} the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) in {{performing}} research to provide technical input {{for their use}} in evaluating responses to Generic Letter 95 - 07, {open_quotes}Pressure Locking and Thermal Binding of Safety-Related Power-Operated Gate Valves. {close_quotes} Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed gate valve difficult to open. This paper discusses only the pressure locking phenomenon in a flexible-wedge gate valve; we will publish {{the results of our}} thermal binding research at a later date. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause the pressure of the fluid in the bonnet (and, in most valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. This high fluid pressure presses the <b>discs</b> against both <b>seats,</b> making the <b>disc</b> assembly harder to unseat than anticipated by the typical design calculations, which generally consider friction at only one of the two disc/seat interfaces. The high pressure of the bonnet fluid also changes the pressure distribution around the disc in a way that can further contribute to the unseating load. If the combined loads associated with pressure locking are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The results of the NRC/INEL research discussed in this paper show that the relationship between bonnet pressure and pressure locking stem loads appears linear. The results also show that for this valve, seat leakage affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} lapping has been long {{considered}} an art {{due to the}} tremendous amount of variability and subjectivity involved. The quality of lapping differs from operator to operator {{and the results are}} highly inconsistent. The material removal rate, surface finish, and flatness all depend on the proper control of lapping parameters such as lapping pressure, lapping speed of rotation, lap ring material, weight and size, abrasive size and type, workpiece material and hardness. To attain the desired outcomes, it is imperative to select proper values for the lapping control parameters. Moving the art of lapping into a science and quantifying the results can solve many of the above problems. In this research, a portable mechanical lapping tool was designed and tested along with manual lapping. Lapping processes were studied by conducting designed experiments, literature search, and consulting experts. The results from the experiments were explored in detail using various statistical techniques to explain the relationships among potential parameters and to see the possibility of lapping model development. A preliminary intelligent computerized lapping system (advisory system) was also developed as a framework for future work. Representative qualitative models and rules for lapping were proposed based on lapping literature and lapping experts' knowledge. However, {{it was found that the}} domain knowledge obtained from different sources was often clouded by imprecision and uncertainty, and the available data of manufacturing problems were frequently imprecise and incomplete.
