50|$|The {{observation}} {{light is}} focused via {{a series of}} lenses through a doughnut shaped aperture, which then passes through a central aperture to form an annulus, before passing through the camera objective lens and through the cornea onto the retina. The light reflected from the retina passes through the un-illuminated hole in the doughnut formed by the illumination system. As the light paths of the two systems are independent, there are minimal reflections of the light source captured in the formed image. The image forming rays continue towards the low powered telescopic eyepiece. When the button is pressed to take a picture, a mirror interrupts {{the path of the}} illumination system allow the light from the <b>flash</b> bulb <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> into the eye. Simultaneously, a mirror falls in front of the observation telescope, which redirects the light onto the capturing medium, whether it is film or a digital CCD. Because of the eyeâ€™s tendency to accommodate while looking though a telescope, it is imperative that the exiting vergence is parallel in order for an in focus image to be formed on the capturing medium.|$|R
500|$|To better {{integrate}} the LRTA and MRTC networks, a unified ticketing system utilizing contactless smart cards, {{similar to the}} Octopus card in Hong Kong and the EZ-Link card in Singapore, was made a goal of the SRTS. [...] In a transitional move towards such a unified ticketing system, the Flash Pass was implemented on April 19, 2004, as a stopgap measure. [...] However, plans for a unified ticketing system using smart cards have languished, leaving the <b>Flash</b> <b>Pass</b> <b>to</b> fill the role for the foreseeable future. Originally sold by both the LRTA and the Metro Rail Transit Corporation, the Blue Line operator, the pass was discontinued {{with the election of}} Benigno Aquino III as President of the Philippines in 2010.|$|R
60|$|Like a <b>flash</b> {{he seemed}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> from his own, almost the hermit's {{way of looking}} out upon life from the old-fashioned {{standpoint}} of his inherent puritanism, into a closer sympathy with those others, {{the men and women}} of the world into which he had so lately entered, the men and women who had welcomed him so warm-heartedly, human beings all of them, who lived and loved with glad hearts and much kindliness. The contrast was absurd, the story itself suddenly so reasonable. No other woman on tour would have kept Sylvanus Power waiting for three years. Only Elizabeth could have done that. It was such a human little problem. People didn't live in the clouds. He wasn't fit for the clouds himself. Nevertheless, when he tried to speak his throat was hard and dry, and at the second attempt he began instead to laugh. She gripped his arm.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, a pelican crossing, as {{distinct}} from a puffin crossing, has the special feature that while the green man <b>flashes</b> <b>to</b> indicate that pedestrians may continue crossing but may not start to cross, the red light changes <b>to</b> an amber <b>flashing</b> light permitting cars <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> {{if there are no}} further pedestrians. This reduces the delay to traffic.|$|R

5000|$|The offense starts when a guard <b>passes</b> <b>to</b> {{the wing}} and {{cuts to the}} strong-side corner. The {{triangle}} is created from a post player on the strong-side block, the strong-side corner, and the extended strong-side wing, who gains possession on the first pass. The desired initial option in the offense is <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the strong-side post player on the block who is in good scoring position. From there the player has the options of looking <b>to</b> score or <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> one of the perimeter players who are exchanging from strong-side corner and wing, a dive cut down the lane, or the opposite wing <b>flashing</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of the}} key which initiates another common option known as the [...] "pinch post".|$|R

40|$|Digital {{photography}} {{has made}} it possible to quickly and easily take a pair of images of low-light environments: one with <b>flash</b> <b>to</b> capture detail and one without <b>flash</b> <b>to</b> capture ambient illumination. We present a variety of applications that analyze and combine the strengths of such flash/no-flash image pairs. Our applications include denoising and detail transfer (to merge the ambient qualities of the no-flash image with the high-frequency <b>flash</b> detail), white-balancing (<b>to</b> change the color tone of the ambient image), continuous <b>flash</b> (<b>to</b> interactively adjust <b>flash</b> intensity), and red-eye removal (to repair artifacts in the flash image). We demonstrate how these applications can synthesize new images that are of higher quality than either of the originals...|$|R

5000|$|If a <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> {{the block}} is not possible, the second option is either <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the weak-side guard who flashes {{top of the}} key from the weak-side wing {{position}} or <b>passing</b> <b>to</b> the strong-side corner. If the ball is <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> the corner the options are either shoot, <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the strong-side block, or pick and pop with the wing. If it is <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> the weak-side guard it initiates the [...] "pinch post" [...] option. There are two options. The first and most common is <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the weak-side forward who <b>flashes</b> <b>to</b> the elbow (corner of the key at the free throw line) <b>to</b> receive the <b>pass.</b> When he does the options are a rub handoff, back door cut by guard without the ball, post up of the guard on a smaller player, or face up and attack. The second option is a pick and roll with the forward. The advantage to the first option is {{there are so many}} weapons to attack the defense it opens up a lot of freedom and ability to score effectively. The advantage on the second option is that the player who has the ball and uses the screen now has the entire side of the floor to work with to go one on one. Meanwhile, on the other side, the wing sets a screen for the corner guard on the triangle split. If the hand-off is not available, the forward or the guard can <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the corner guard coming off the screen. If the defense overplays or expects the split, both the wing and the corner guard can back cut to the basket. During all of this time the original strong-side block player is able to establish position for an easy shot while the defender is lured by all of the movement and cutting by the other players.|$|R
