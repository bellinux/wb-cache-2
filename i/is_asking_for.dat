25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer <b>is</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for.</b> The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] is a disco revival {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, pop and R styles. It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds. Several critics highlighted the track as {{following in the}} recent disco revivalism footsteps of Daft Punk, Justin Timberlake and posthumous Michael Jackson material. The song begins with Carey singing about how {{she is in a}} dilemma {{as to whether or not}} she wishes to stay in a relationship with her lover, as he is no longer capable of romancing her. In response, Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and <b>is</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a second chance. Carey then decides that it has been too long that Wale has not loved her for, and feels liberated for letting him go. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard likened the string arrangement to Chic's 1979 single [...] "Good Times". Pitchfork Media writer Jordan Sargent compared [...] "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] to Carey's previous singles [...] "Fantasy" [...] (1995) and [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] (1999), but noted that it felt like a [...] "logical extension of post-Pharrell disco revivalism".

60|$|Dr. C. J. Romanes {{tells of}} a female {{chimpanzee}} who was taught to count straws up to five. She held the straws in her hand, exposing the ends to the number requested. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> three, she held up three. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> four, she held up four. All this is a mere matter of training. But consider now, Mr. Burroughs, what follows. When she <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> five straws and she had only four, she doubled one straw, exposing both its ends and thus making up the required number. She did not do this only once, and by accident. She did it whenever more straws <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> than she possessed. Did she perform a distinctly reasoning act? or was her action the result of blind, mechanical instinct? If Mr. Burroughs cannot answer to his own satisfaction, he may call Dr. Romanes a nature-faker and dismiss the incident from his mind.|$|R

2500|$|The {{interpretation}} of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and {{the economy as a}} whole. [...] While 640 has been a divider between [...] "prime" [...] and [...] "subprime", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated. [...] In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile. [...] In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. [...] Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. [...] Therefore, [...] "prime" [...] {{is a product of the}} lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower <b>is</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> the loan.|$|E

2500|$|New {{political}} developments did {{not bode well}} for Lays. Charles X, who had come to the throne in 1824, named the ultra-royalist [...] as Director General of the Fine Arts. La Rochefoucauld had an aversion to Lays both as an inveterate supporter of the Revolution, and, in particular, for the ironic remarks the singer had made about his morality campaign, which included lengthening ballerinas' skirts and providing ancient statues with fig leaves. In 1826, La Rochefoucauld had the opportunity to demonstrate his dislike when Lays, realising that life in Paris was beyond his financial means, decided to leave his post as professor and retire to the provinces to be near his married eldest daughter. According to Quéruel. Lays, probably wanting to end his career of more than 40 years on a high note, sent the minister a petition signed by almost all the stars of the Opéra and backed by Cherubini, asking for another benefit concert, in addition to the one three years earlier, this time in aid of his son who was working as a saute-ruisseau at a notary’s and whose legal studies Lays could not afford to maintain. Inevitably the request fell on deaf ears. Lays also asked for his pension to be recalculated, bearing in mind his years teaching at the conservatory. But this led to disputes to which the correspondence between Cherubini and La Rochefoucauld bears explicit testimony. In October, the former wrote:I have the honour to inform you that Monsieur Lays has retired and <b>is</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> his pension. There is no doubt that he has a right to such recompense. There is no need to tell you of the talent of this famous artist, whose career has been long and fruitful. His reputation, which has endured for half a century, makes all such talk superfluous. In the interests of the professor, I must add that it is the meagreness of his fortune more than his age which has forced him to ask for his pension. No longer able to live in the capital in the manner to which he is accustomed, his intention is to retire to somewhere in the provinces where he and his family will be able to live more comfortably.|$|E
