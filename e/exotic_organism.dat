The species Cryptostegia madagascariensis introduced in Brazil with landscaping purposes {{has proved to be}} a very aggressive invasive species in Caatinga, forming self-regenerating masses, especially in degraded areas and on the banks of watercourses and temporary ponds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reproductive aspects (through biometric characterization) and the potential emergence of Cryptostegia madagascariensis seedlings. To characterize biometric fruits (green colored) and seeds (white colored) had their dimensions measured by assessing whether even the number of seeds per fruit, and fresh weight of fruits and seeds. To evaluate the influence of the position and depth of sowing on seedling emergence, seeds were placed in sterile sand substrate with the hilum down, up and sideways at depths of 0. 5; 1. 0; 1. 5; 2. 0; 2. 5 and 3. 0 cm. The high production of very light seeds per fruit, and therefore, the seeds per individual, associated with the absence of natural enemies potentiates the intruder character of Cryptostegia madagascariensis.

40|$|Agaricus brasiliensis is a Brazilian {{basidiomycete}} {{which has}} been cultivated and consumed {{around the world as}} a therapeutic food. Casing layer {{is one of the most}} important steps on A. brasiliensis cultivation and European peat is the most used casing layer on Agaricus bisporus cultivation.

Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate Brazilian peat with and without pasteurization as casing layer on A. brasiliensis cultivation. The fungus was previously grown on wheat grains and transferred to a substratum prepared by composted traditional method. After mycelium colonization of the substratum a pasteurized or non pasteurized Brazilian peat (casing layer) was added. It was concluded that pasteurization of the casing layer increases in 30 % yield after 65 days of cultivation. There is no difference of yield for pasteurized and non pasteurized casing layer until 30 days of cultivation. An increase of flies is observed in non pasteurized casing layer.

40|$|Introduction Invasive {{species such}} as plants, {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates can produce devastating effects on the ecology and economy of the affected arcas (Mack et al., 2000; Teulon and Stufkens 2002; Aukema et al., 2011; Liebhold 2012). The increase in invasive species can be mainly attributed to the greater intemational trade and movement of people, which results in the accidental spread of insect herbivores outside their native ranges (Holmes et al., 2009). However, the establishment of invasive species {{is limited by the}} different stages of arrival (the process by which individuals are transported to new arcas outside of their native range), establishment (the process by which populations grow to sufficient levels such that extinction is highly unlikely) and spread (the expansion of an invading species range into new arcas) of an invasive population, sin ce there is low risk for an <b>exotic</b> <b>organism</b> to advance to the next stage (Liebhold et al, 1995). The sequen ce of the transition probability rule has been called "dozen", {{based on the idea that}} approximately one in ten exotic organisms entering a new country or arca makes the transition from one stage to the next (Williamson and Fitter 1996; Van Driesche et al, 2007; Liebhold and Tobin 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{applications}} that trigger massive information streams, like earthquakes and human disease epidemics, the data input for agricultural and environmental biosecurity events (ie. {{the introduction of}} unwanted exotic pests and pathogens), {{is expected to be}} sparse and less frequent. To investigate if Twitter data can be useful for the detection and monitoring of biosecurity events, we adopted a three-step process. First, we confirmed that sightings of two migratory species, the Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa) and the Common Koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) are reported on Twitter. Second, we developed search queries to extract the relevant tweets for these species. The queries were based on either the taxonomic name, common name or keywords that are frequently used to describe the species (symptomatic or syndromic). Third, we validated the results using ground truth data. Our results indicate that the common name queries provided a reasonable number of tweets that were related to the ground truth data. The taxonomic query resulted in too small datasets, while the symptomatic queries resulted in large datasets, but with highly variable signal-to-noise ratios. No clear relationship was observed between the tweets from the symptomatic queries and the ground truth data. Comparing the results for the two species showed that the level of familiarity with the species plays a major role. The more familiar the species, the more stable and reliable the Twitter data. This clearly presents a problem for using social media to detect the arrival of an <b>exotic</b> <b>organism</b> of biosecurity concern for which public is unfamiliar...|$|E
50|$|Fumigation is {{a method}} of pest control that {{completely}} fills an area with gaseous pesticides - or fumigants - to suffocate or poison the pests within. It is used to control pests in buildings (structural fumigation), soil, grain, and produce, and is also used during processing of goods to be imported or exported to prevent transfer of <b>exotic</b> <b>organisms.</b> This method also affects the structure itself, affecting pests that inhabit the physical structure, such as woodborers and drywood termites.|$|R

40|$|Globalization {{has seen}} an {{unprecedented}} dispersal of exotic and alien species worldwide resulting in worldwide homogenization and sometimes extinction of indigenous or endemic taxa. When an exotic species becomes established {{in a new}} habitat the invasive organisms are capable of {{having an impact on}} indigenous community dynamics and the overall structure and function of ecosystems. Furthermore, the impact of invasion is determined by the geographical range, abundance and the per-capita or per-biomass effect of the invader. However, the success of the introduced organisms is reliant on their ability to acclimate to the physiochemical conditions of the newly invaded environment. Freshwater ecosystems are especially vulnerable to invasions because there are numerous potential routes of introduction including intentional pathways such as stocking, and unintentional pathways such as the release of ballast water and aquarium releases. Efforts to limit the introduction of invasive species or to manage established exotic populations are often hindered by insufficient understanding of the natural history of problematic species. Relatively little is known regarding the physiological tolerances of many taxa. Knowledge about specific species ecophysiological constraints allows for the prediction of future patterns of invasion more accurately, including where an introduced organism would probably survive, thrive and disperse. Furthermore, data on the physiological tolerances of an introduced <b>exotic</b> <b>organism</b> may provide data necessary for effective management and control. This studyinvestigated three invasive species in the Nseleni River system in a protected area in KwaZulu-Natal. The species studied were, Tarebia granifera (Quilted melania – Lamarck, 1822), Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus (Suckermouth armoured catfish - Weber, 1991) and Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth – (Martius) Solms-Laubach,). The Nseleni River flows into Lake Nsezi which is responsible for providing potable water to the surrounding towns and industry, as well as the surrounding rural communities. The Enseleni Nature reserve has become the centre for biodiversity dispersal in the immediate area, due to the change in landscape surrounding the protected area. An important step in developing alien invasive species management strategies in protected areas is determining their extent and invasive traits. Tarebia granifera is a prosobranch gastropod originally from South-East Asia that has become invasive in several countries around the world including South Africa. Snail populations were sampled at nine sites throughout the Nseleni/Mposa river system every six weeks over a twelve month period. The snail was abundant throughout the system, especially in shallow waters of less than 1 m in depth. The first positive identification the loricariid catfish Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus for the Nseleni River was in 2006. The original introduction {{is believed to have been}} via the aquarium trade. The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of the unified framework with regard to management of fish invasions by assessing the invasion stage of the loricariid population and identifying appropriate management actions using the Blackburn et al. (2011) framework. The fish were sampled at nine different sites and three different depths over a period of twelve months, as well as when two ichthyological surveys were carried out on the Nseleni River system. This invasive fish has been located throughout the system and both male and female fish were collected. The smallest fish sampled was a fingerling of a day or two old and the smallest pregnant female was a mere 270 mm TL. This is a clear indication that this fish is breeding in the river system. Although T. granifera and P. disjunctivus were abundant in the Nseleni/Mposa river system, it was not clear what their role in the system was, and in particular if they were competing with any of the indigenous species. Therefore, isotope samples were collected from numerous taxa over a two week period, with the exception of Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus samples, which were collected over 12 months. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N signatures of all samples were determined. The niche overlap between the invasive and indigenous snails was effectively zero (1. 02 E- 13 %), indicating no shared food resources. The medium ranges of dNRb (7. 14) and dCRb (9. 07) for the invasive fish indicate that it utilizes a wider range of food resources and trophic levels than the majority of indigenous fish. A medium CDb value (2. 34) for the invasive fish species, P. disjunctivus, describes medium trophic diversity, with three indigenous species possessing higher diversity and three possessing lower diversity. Furtherresults indicated that there was no direct dietary competition between P. disjunctivus and indigenous species. Eichhornia crassipes was first recorded on the Nseleni River in 1978, and has been shown to have a significant negative impact on the biodiversity of the Nseleni/Mposa River system and therefore required a control intervention. Although biological control using the two weevil species Neochetina eichhornia (Warner) and N. bruchi (Hustache) has been credited with affecting a good level of control, the lack of a manipulated post-release evaluation experiments has undermined this statement. Five experimental plots of water hyacinth of 20 m 2 were sprayed with an insecticide to control weevils. After ten months the plants in the sprayed plots were significantly bigger and heavier than those in the control plots that had natural populations of the biological control agents. This study has shown unequivocally that biological control has contributed significantly to the control of water hyacinth on the Nseleni/Mposa River system. The management plan for the Enseleni Nature Reserve identifies the need to control invasive and/or exotic organisms within the boundary of the protected area. In addition, set guidelines have been implemented on how to control these organisms, so that indigenous organisms are least affected. Lack of control of exotic organisms can have serious consequences for indigenous species. It is therefore of utmost importance that the population dynamics of the invading organism be understood, what the potential impact could be and how to control them. Furthermore, it has also acknowledged the threat of possible exotic species invasions from outside of the protected area that might result in threats to the protected area and that these must be investigated, researched and managed. This thesis has identified Tarebia granifera, Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus and Eichhornia crassipes as being a threat to indigenous biodiversity within the protected area, as well as in adjacent areas to the protected area. The thesis will therefore investigate the hypothesis that both Tarebia granifera and Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus are having a direct negative effect on available food resources for indigenous species of organisms. In addition, this thesis will investigate if theNeochetina species that have previously been introduced onto E. crassipes are having any negative effect on this invasive alien aquatic plant...|$|E

We use reaction-diffusion equations to model the invasion of a species with two dispersal phenotypes into a previously unoccupied landscape. These phenotypes differ in both their dispersal rate and population growth rate.

For biologically realistic parameters, the invasion can occur up to twice as fast as a result of this polymorphism. This has implications for predicting the speed of biological invasions, suggesting that speeds cannot just be predicted from looking at a single phenotype and that the full community of phenotypes needs to be taken into consideration...|$|R

By providing high speed, busy transport links between spatially distant, but climatically similar regions of the world, the worldwide airline network (WAN) increases the risks of deliberate or accidental movements and establishment of climatically sensitive <b>exotic</b> <b>organisms.</b> With traffic levels continuing to rise and climates changing regionally, these risks will vary, both seasonally and year-by-year. Here, detailed estimates of air traffic trends and climate changes for the period 2007 - 2010 are used to examine the likely directions and magnitudes of changes in climatically sensitive organism invasion risk across the WAN. Analysis of over 144 million flights from 2007 - 2010 shows that by 2010, the WAN is likely to change little overall in terms of connecting regions with similar climates, but anticipated increases in traffic and local variations in climatic changes should increase the risks of exotic species movement on the WAN and establishment in new areas. These overall shifts mask spatially and temporally heterogenous changes across the WAN, where, for example, traffic increases and climatic convergence by July 2010 between parts of China and northern Europe and North America raise the likelihood of exotic species invasions, whereas anticipated climatic shifts may actually reduce invasion risks into much of eastern Europe...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic archipelagos often hold very {{specialized}} floras {{with high}} degrees of endemism. These floras are frequently highly vulnerable to disturbance by natural causes and human intervention. The Juan Fernandez Islands (Chile) in the Pacific Ocean {{are a small}} archipelago of only three islands. Since discovery in 1574 by Juan Fernandez, human activities have altered floristic composition and survival circumstances of the endemic species. In this paper we document past and present means of disturbance, both anthropogenic and natural, which have influenced the native vegetation. The most destructive past activities have been logging and. introduction of animals and plants, both deliberately and inadvertently. At the present time, <b>exotic</b> <b>organisms</b> are still introduced as pets, ornaments, or for soil conservation. All pose serious threats to the natural vegetation as shown by altered floristic composition, populational decline of endemic taxa, and even extinction. Weeds that form impenetrable thickets are Aristotelia chilensis, Rubus ulmifolius, and Ugni molinae. Recent introductions include the aggressive Lantana camara and Lonicera japonica. Examples of endemic taxa in need of conservation are Dendroseris, Lactoris, and Robinsonia. Previous studies reveal that island taxa frequently have low levels of genetic variation, a pattern also seen in many endemic taxa of the Juan Fernandez Islands. Conservation programs are urgently needed that emphasize physical and biological measures for controlling alien weeds and animals...|$|R
40|$|Antarctica's severe {{climate and}} its {{geographical}} isolation are {{the factors that}} hinder the arrival of non-native species by natural means. However, the movement of people and cargo associated with national scientific programs and tourism render Antarctica much more accessible to <b>exotic</b> <b>organisms.</b> Both the transport routes and carriers are varied. The wide range of uses to which timber is put means that it is readily freighted to Antarctic stations. However, it can harbor numerous alien organisms. All the timber materials transported to the "Arctowski" station for the 32 nd Polish Antarctic Expedition in the 2007 / 2008 season were scanned as a potential vector for alien species. This study focuses on the non-lichenized fungi and insects which {{were found on the}} timber. Four species of perithecia-forming Ascomycota, five species of corticioid and polyporoid Basidiomycota, four unidentified basidiomycetes taxa in form of sterile mycelia, and two insects belonging to Cerambycidae, were detected. Most of these "hitch-hikers" were connected with the untreated parts of the timber. Their enduring survival in harsh Antarctic conditions is regarded as highly improbable. Nevertheless, some ascocarps frequently contained vital spores, and live insect larvae and imago were found in hibernation. The results also emphasize that such organisms can be accidentally transported to Antarctica and that the elementary rules for the eventual safe transport of non-infected goods should be obeyed and respected...|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal vents on Earth's {{seafloor}} host entire ecosystems {{that live}} off energy from chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis. This energy process uses chemical reactions between metals and hot gases from inside Earth's mantle to fuel thriving communities of <b>exotic</b> <b>organisms.</b> Some researchers think life originated at these vents and if they're right, that means there's a chance life could have also originated near similar hydrothermal vents on other planets or moons. One {{of the most}} promising places to search is the suspected sub-ice ocean on Jupiter's moon, Europa. This is the story of humankind's efforts to understand the origins of life by looking for it in extreme environments where life thrives without relying on the sun as an energy source. It follows an oceanographic expedition to the Mid-Cayman Rise, led by Chris German of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and NASA's efforts to plan a future mission to Europa. By understanding how life can live without the sun, we may discover how life began on our planet and whether or not Earth is {{the only place in the}} universe capable of supporting a biosphere. by Garret R.

40|$|The Stirling Range National Park {{lies within}} the south west Botanical Province of Western Australia, {{which is an}} {{acknowledged}} center of biodiversity and endemism of international significance. It is an important conservation reserve, genetic resource and nature based tourism destination. The mountain scenery and diverse array of wildflowers attract up to 100, 000 visitors a year. Biologically the park contains a diverse flora, with 500 plant species, which includes 82 endemics and constitutes 20 % of the flora of Western Australia. The health of the Stirling Range ecosystem is being compromised by the spread of an exotic fungus (Phytophthora cinnamomi) accidentally introduced when the road network was expanded through the national park. The fungus has since been spread along roads and fire-control corridors by infected soil being carried on the wheels of vehicles. More recently it has become apparent that walkers, by carrying infected soil on their boots, have spread the disease along mountain pathways. In south Western Australia up to 2000 of the indigenous plants are susceptible to the pathogen. Ecosystem response to the infection has resulted in reduced biodiversity and altered structural composition of the plant communities. Widespread loss of dominant or keystone plant species is likely to impact on dependent faunal populations. This study highlights the role of <b>exotic</b> <b>organisms</b> in degrading ecosystem health {{and the need for}} active management in tourism centered protected areas...|$|R
40|$|Two {{issues of}} current {{importance}} in ecology are the range expansion of species and invasion of <b>exotic</b> <b>organisms.</b> Climate change is affecting the environments that species are currently adapted to, and to survive species will either need {{to adapt to}} the new conditions or shift with their current environment. Empirical observations and simulation models have shown that higher dispersal ability may lead to increased rates of spread but {{little is known about the}} effect of having a community of dispersal phenotypes on the rate of range expansion. We use a spatially explicit analytical model based on partial-differential equations to investigate the invasion of a species with two dispersal phenotypes into a previously unoccupied landscape. These phenotypes differ in both their dispersal and population growth rate. Using analytical techniques and carrying out numerical simulations in R (R Development Core Team, 2010) using the deSolve package (Soetaert et al., 2010), we find that the presence of both phenotypes can result in faster range expansions than if only a single phenotype were present in the landscape, and that typically the invasion can occur up to twice as fast as a result of this polymorphism. This has implications for predicting species invasion speeds, suggesting that speeds cannot just be predicted from looking at a single phenotype and that the presence of a community of phenotypes needs to be taken into consideration...|$|R
