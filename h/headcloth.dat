The obverse of the coins would always feature an image of the king (almost always in profile) wearing either a crown or helmet/regnal <b>headcloth.</b> The <b>headcloth</b> had some image perhaps representing pleats, rays, or sunburst in the front, as well as the tied end of a cloth or fillet to hold the helmet or <b>headcloth</b> in place. Most coins also included an inscription (usually in Greek) meaning [...] "King of Aksum" [...] or King of the Aksumites" [...] (Basileus AXWMITW). However, many coins were also minted anonymously (or even posthumously), especially during the 5th century. Inscriptions on the coins could include a bisi name ("man of," [...] Ge'ez: bə'əsyä ብእስየ) or an epithet (beginning with Əllä, Ge'ez: እለ [...] "he who") in addition to the king's personal name. Bisi names were used more often in conjuncture with personal names on earlier coins, while the epithets were more common in later years, being the only inscribed name in a few sources. Greek text was used in conjunction with Ge'ez script inscriptions, but was the only language used on the gold coins, {{with the exception of the}} Ge'ez language coins of Wazeba and MHDYS. Over time, the Greek used on the coins (gold, silver and bronze) deteriorated, indicative of Aksum's decline. Moreover, beginning with MHDYS for bronze coins and Wazeba for silver coins, Ge'ez gradually replaced Greek on the legends.|$|E

500|$|Endubis, {{the first}} known Aksumite king to mint coins, focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse. The images were {{of his head and}} upper half of his chest in profile, wearing a regnal <b>headcloth</b> or helmet and {{abundant}} jewelry. [...] In addition to inscribing his regnal name, Endybis also noted his [...] "bisi name, a practice continued by his early successors, but often missing in later coins. The bisi name was a sort of tribal affiliation or [...] "ethnikon" [...] (i.e. a reference to the king's lineage) that was different for every king. Endybis also emphasized his religion through the pre-Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method (a purpose which the coins already served). A second motif used by Enybis and continued by following coins was that of two (though sometimes one in later years) ears of barley or wheat around the image of his head in profile. Though no inscriptional evidence exists, given its prominent position around the image of the king, the two ears of barley (or wheat) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state. Though later coins would be smaller, Endybis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against, with gold issues at half-aureus around 2.70grams (more precisely, the theoretical weight may have been 2.725g).|$|E

40|$|In her meticulous {{classification}} of fabric structures, Irene Emery wrote that needlework 2 ̆ 2 is basically {{one of the}} simplest crafts, a homely activity that can be practiced by almost anyone on almost any material. But, with fine and carefully chosen materials plus {{a high degree of}} skill and imagination in handling them, needlework can be raised almost to the rank of a fine art 2 ̆ 2 (1966 : 246). I suspect that Emery would not object to my deletion of the word 2 ̆ 2 almost 2 ̆ 2 when discussing the examples of fine art embroidered by certain pre-Conquest Andeans. Within the ancient Andean world, needlework is not exclusively identified with Paracas Necropolis-style and Nasca-style textiles. There are, for example, exquisite cotton Chancay <b>headcloths</b> worked in monochromatic embroidery on square mesh openwork or on gauze (Stone-Miller 1992 :pl. 49, Young-Sanchez 1992 :fig. IV. 10, and d 2 ̆ 7 Harcourt 1962 :figs. 35, 36 B, 38, 40 - 44), Chimu textiles with embroidered details (Rowe 1984 :fig. 56 and possibly pi. 11 and fig. 133), and Inca tapestry tunics with needleworked edgings (Kajitani 1982 :pls. 117 - 119). But it was only on Peru 2 ̆ 7 s south coast that artisans brilliantly exploited the particular advantages of embroidery (Figure 1). In this paper I will focus on the fabrics unwrapped from conical-shaped funerary bundles buried in a cemetery on the arid Paracas Peninsula, south of Lima. This burial zone, called the Necropolis de Wari Kayan, was used by members of Paracas/Topara communities from at least Early Horizon epoch 10 through Early Intermediate Period epoch 2 (approximately 100 B. C. to 200 A. D.). Though they produced a variety of fabric structures using different decorative techniques, the artisans who participated in the Paracas/Topara cultural tradition overwhelmingly preferred 4 / 2 stem-stitch embroidery on plain weave. In a sample of over 1200 Paracas Necropolis-style fabrics housed in collections around the world, 990 employ embroidery to create designs. Furthermore, there are nearly 100 additional finely-woven solid-color plain weaves that are undecorated; some of these may have been destined for embroidery work but were buried before it was applied. Why did Paracas/Topara artisans choose embroidery 8 1 / 2 times out often when making a decorated fabric? Why did they choose such a simple structure when technical virtuosity was not only highly prized within the Andean world but also within their reach...|$|R
40|$|A {{small but}} {{fascinating}} Chancay gauze fragment {{in the collection}} of the Michael C. Carlos Museum stands out as an exemplary object that embodies the symbolic associations and aesthetic principles of the Peruvian coastline during the Late Intermediate Period (Fig. 1). Its weave structure, production process, iconography, and polychromy unite in reinforcing the protective and regenerative purposes of the original headdress. Consisting of variably spun threads knotted together, its unique discontinuous warp relates to its function in funerary and ceremonial contexts. Significantly, its weaver pushed beyond technical limitations to bring together the laborious techniques of gauze weaving and discontinuous warping in a single textile. The result of this ingenious yet unpublished technical combination was a “jumping” serpentine figure on an indigo background. The allusion to serpent movement, enabled by the use of a discontinuous warp made whole through the tying of tiny knots, recalls both the corporeal process of the cloth’s creation as well as the physical exertion of snakes. Moreover, the cloth’s overall polychrome patterning evokes the vivid dorsal patterning of snakes that have just shed their skin and emerged headfirst into the environment as regenerated beings. Although no other published gauze headdresses have been recognized as having discontinuous warps, and very few are polychromatic, the Carlos Museum gauze nevertheless shares many features with other Chancay gauzes. Commonalities include the organic abstract patterning created by complex gauze weaves, serpentine iconography, elasticity due to slightly over-spun threads, and the wearing of gauzes on the head in transformative ritual contexts. Moreover, the forceful repetitive motions exerted by the weaver during production may also be considered as contributing to the reception of the textile, as process and product are interconnected in Andean worldview. These combined attributes support the interpretation that many other gauze <b>headcloths</b> were meant to evoke the powerful properties of serpents. Gauze weaving requires a special technique, in which the weaver forces some warp threads to cross over or under other warp threads. These gauze crosses are held in place by the insertion of weft threads. This method of warp-crossing, contrasts with standard back-strap weaving, where the warp threads do not interact with each other but remain in a fixed position. Different types of gauze weave are classified by the various interactions of the warp threads. The simplest structure is that of plain gauze weave, in which the same warp threads pass over or under each other. More complex gauze weaves are created when variation is introduced into the interworking of warps and interlacing of wefts. In Textiles of Ancient Peru and Their Techniques, Raoul d’Harcourt illustrates how several complex openwork gauzes may be created through the omission of the crossing of certain warp threads. These types of gauzes are effective in conveying a sense of movement through their undulating serpentine patterns. The organic shapes created in gauze openwork, often simply labeled “ovular” or “gourd-shaped,” appear to mimic the scale patterning on snakes, a subject to which I will later return...|$|R

40|$|Although Moche {{textiles}} {{form part}} of the legacy {{of one of the}} best known cultures of pre-Hispanic Peru, today they remain relatively unknown. Moche culture evolved in the northern valleys of the Peruvian coast (Fig. 1) during the first 800 years after Christ (Fig. 2). They were contemporary with other cultures such us Nazca or Lima and their textiles exhibited special features that are reflected in their textile production. Previous studies of Moche textiles have been carried out by authors such as Lila O 2 ̆ 7 Neale (1946, 1947), O 2 ̆ 7 Neale y Kroeber (1930), William Conklin (1978) or Heiko Pruemers (1995). However, in spite of their scholarly interest, these works deal with Moche textile production in a very general way and do not attempt to place the textiles into a chronological scheme. In August 1999 I had the opportunity to study {{one of the most interesting}} and most complete group of excavated Moche textiles, from the site of Dos Cabezas, in the Jequetepeque Valley (Fig. 1). This was the starting point of my research, which is to establish the main features and evolution of the Moche Textile Style. For this purpose, I have assembled a corpus of more than 400 specimens. In this paper, I will present a synthesis of their analysis and some observations about them. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MOCHE TEXTILE STYLE The majority of these (Fig. 3) have a known origin and come from archaeological excavations on the north coast, while others in the sample come from outside the Moche core, but still exhibit Moche style. After reviewing the data I can say that the Moche Textile Style are characterized by certain particular features that distinguish them from other contemporary textile styles. The following basic elements stand out: 1) Cotton (Gossyphtm Barbadense) is the fundamental raw material and it appears generally in simple ply 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 spun yarns. With cotton, cameld fiber yarns were also used, although in a much more restricted way. 2) This sample of Moche textiles shows almost every textile technique used in the Prehispanic Andes. What differentiates Moche fabrics from their contemporaries are the remarkable preferences, all through its evolution, toward several textile techniques, such us twill or tapestry. 3) The Moche used the backstrap loom (Fig. 4) to create garments, some of which, like the male <b>headcloth,</b> were particular to Moche and not documented in any other area of the Central Andes. 4) Textiles were used as an iconographic medium within Moche culture and their designs clearly reflect the evolution of this Textile Style. The textile iconography shows the same designs and stylistic features as the rest of Moche material culture...|$|E
