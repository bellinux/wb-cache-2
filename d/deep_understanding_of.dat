Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded {{over the course of}} 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the big bang {{can be traced back to}} the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.|$|E

As one of the few American physicists with a <b>deep</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the new field of quantum mechanics, he was hired by the University of California in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} <b>deep</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a <b>deep</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E
5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a <b>deep</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctorate in Business Administration (DBA) Achieving a {{sustainable}} competitive advantage {{has been identified}} as a central tenet of success in a competitive business environment. However, the Chinese traditions of familial networking and building links through guanxi have seldom been reviewed within this paradigm. The goal is to provide both research and business with insights into how guanxi impacts on competitive advantage and how to successfully manage guanxi relationships. Before embarking on investigation of such an interrelationship, the study seeks to explore guanxi itself in a relatively under researched domain: Malaysia. Guanxi is seen as an act of reciprocity and is often associated with corruption and bribery by Westerners. Notwithstanding, guanxi appears to be an important constituent of the Asian culture and {{can be seen as a}} form of relationship investment. It is suggested that if guanxi is cultivated it can lead to business success. This thesis suggests that businesses do not have to rely only on low-cost, differentiated or focused strategies to achieve competitive advantage. There is a complementary force – guanxi. The study looks empirically at guanxi within a newly defined ethical context -guanxi(+). More importantly, the study concludes by identifying that guanxi(+) and trust plus selected key success factors contribute to a Malaysian firm’s sustainable competitive advantage. The research adds to business knowledge through a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the role of guanxi(+) in Malaysian business practice and identifies five key contributions: A <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> guanxi in Malaysia; a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> guanxi(+) in Malaysia; a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> guanxi(+) and trust in Malaysia; a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> guanxi(+) as sustainable competitive advantage; and a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> sustainable competitive advantage within the context of its inter-relationship with guanxi(+) ...|$|R

For the propagation reaction, Gilbert led an international team that produced a methodology that overcame the long-standing problem of obtaining reliable rate coefficients for this process. He showed that the Arrhenius parameters for different types of monomer take different classes of values, and developed qualitative and quantitative understanding of these classes from fundamental transition-state theory and quantum mechanics. These new methods were based on those that he had developed in his work on unimolecular gas-phase processes. For the termination reaction, his data and models led to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of this process as diffusion-controlled.|$|E
