40|$|Solar Energy is an {{important}} renewable and unlimited source of energy. Solar photovoltaic power forecasting, is an estimation of the expected power production, that help the grid operators to better manage the electric balance between power demand and supply. Neural network is a computational model that can predict new outcomes from past trends. The artificial neural network is used for photovoltaic plant energy forecasting. The output power for solar photovoltaic cell is predicted on hourly basis. In historical <b>dataset</b> <b>collection</b> <b>process,</b> two <b>dataset</b> was collected and used for analysis. The dataset was provided with three independent attributes and one dependent attributes. The implementation of Artificial Neural Network structure is done by Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and training procedure for neural network is done by error Back Propagation (BP). In order to train and test the neural network, the datasets are divided in the ratio 70 : 30. The accuracy of prediction {{can be done by}} using various error measurement criteria and the performance of neural network is to be noted...|$|R
40|$|Objective Datasets are {{increasingly}} {{emerging as a}} ‘new currency’ in collection development. While purchasing models may in some ways mirror more traditional forms of electronic information, there are many unique considerations in the collection and acquisition of datasets. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the extent to which academic libraries have formalized <b>dataset</b> <b>collection</b> development policies and to highlight some of the key considerations in the development of such policies. The focus here is on commercially available datasets, rather than datasets produced at home institutions. Methods Currently existing <b>dataset</b> <b>collection</b> development policies and guidelines will be gathered from web searches of academic library websites, calls to listservs and personal communications. Based on these existing practices, as well as a brief literature review, key considerations will be identified. Ongoing discussions at our own institution will also inform this work. Results Some existing policies have already been identified highlighting several important considerations in the development of <b>dataset</b> <b>collection</b> development policies. Those considerations include cost, individual vs. institutional access, long-term value of the data, storage and preservation, access and discoverability, licensing restrictions, among others. Conclusions While several institutions have formalized collection development policies in regards to datasets, this remains a relatively underdeveloped area of collection development. Given the growing importance of datasets as a currency of research, libraries should strive to identify their roles in <b>dataset</b> <b>collection</b> and consider guidelines for selectors, liaisons, and other librarians involved in supporting academic research...|$|R

40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) systems {{comprise}} massive {{volumes of}} smart devices. Through exchanges of information, smart objects {{are capable of}} reasoning and generate higher level of intelligence. The effectiveness of data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> is a key factor {{to the success of}} IoT systems as it can seriously affect the freshness of the captured data. Efficient data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> have been well studied on sensory systems with static topologies and single data extraction point. Smart devices in IoT systems are often shared by different parties; therefore, concurrent data <b>collection</b> <b>processes</b> are always expected. Such a unique characteristic of IoT systems has imposed new challenges to the designs of efficient data <b>collection</b> <b>processes.</b> In this paper, concurrent data collection trees specifically designed for IoT applications are proposed. It is shown that, comparing with an existing single-user data collection structure, systems with the proposed tree structures can significantly shorten their concurrent data <b>collection</b> <b>processes.</b> Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R
