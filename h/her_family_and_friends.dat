5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve.

5|$|The Romanovs {{isolated}} in the Crimea knew little of {{the fate of the}} Tsar and his family. Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace, but the Provisional government under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk, Siberia. In February 1918, most of the imperial family at Ay-Todor was moved to another estate at Djulber, where Grand Dukes Nicholas and Peter were already under house arrest. Olga and her husband were left at Ay-Todor. The entire Romanov family in the Crimea was condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council, but the executions were delayed by political rivalry between the Yalta and Sevastopol Soviets. By March 1918, the Central Power of Germany had advanced on the Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones. In November 1918, the German forces were informed that their nation had lost the war, and they evacuated homewards. Allied forces took over the Crimean ports, in support of the loyalist White Army, which temporarily allowed the surviving members of the Romanov family time to escape abroad. The Dowager Empress and, at her insistence, most of <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> were evacuated by the British warship HMS Marlborough. Nicholas II, however, had already been shot dead and the family assumed, correctly, that his wife and children had also been killed. Unknown to her, Olga's childhood confidant and brother Michael, Nicholas II's supposed successor, had been assassinated near Perm on 13 June 1918.|$|E
