5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the <b>initial</b> <b>state</b> predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

Its routing has been largely unchanged since designation. The original bridge over the Brule River was built in 1922. In a joint project with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), MDOT funded a replacement in 2003. WisDOT supervised construction of the new span in a project that ran between July 14 and November 4, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang as {{the origin}} of the {{universe}}: One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was {{the origin of}} the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature <b>initial</b> <b>state</b> of the universe.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, {{we study}} the {{relationship}} between convergence time and <b>initial</b> <b>states.</b> In the consensus problem, rather than {{the size of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>states,</b> the disagreement between states is more concerned.

5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given <b>initial</b> <b>state</b> to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E
5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an <b>initial</b> <b>state</b> of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
5|$|The first {{transportation}} routes along {{what is now}} US23 in {{the state}} were sections of two Indian trails. The route {{of what is now}} US23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different auto trail names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as part of two state highways in the <b>initial</b> <b>state</b> highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created to replace a path that ran further inland through the northern portion of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the LP were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed {{by the end of the}} 1960s. Since then a new crossing of the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built to replace a drawbridge that carried the I-75/US23 freeway over a shipping channel.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{estimating the}} parameter {{associated with the}} qubit depolarizing channel when the available <b>initial</b> <b>states</b> that might be employed are mixed. We use quantum Fisher information {{as a measure of}} the accuracy of estimation to compare protocols which use collections of qubits in product states to one in which the qubits are in a correlated state. We show that, for certain parameter values and <b>initial</b> <b>states,</b> the correlated state protocol can yield a greater accuracy per channel invocation than the product state protocols. We show that, for some parameters and <b>initial</b> <b>states,</b> using more than two qubits and channel invocations is advantageous. These results stand in contrast to the known optimal case that uses pure <b>initial</b> <b>states</b> and a single channel invocation on a pair of entangled qubits...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the decay of}} the global entanglement, due to decoherence, of multiqubit systems interacting with a reservoir in a non Markovian regime. We assume that during the decoherence process each qubit of the system interacts with its own, independent environment. Most previous works on this problem focused on particular <b>initial</b> <b>states</b> or families of <b>initial</b> <b>states</b> amenable of analytical treatment. Here we determine numerically the typical, average behaviour of the system corresponding to random <b>initial</b> pure <b>states</b> uniformly distributed (in the whole Hilbert space of $n$-qubit pure states) according to the Haar measure. We study systems consisting of 3, 4, 5, and 6 qubits. In each case we consider also the entanglement dynamics corresponding to important particular <b>initial</b> <b>states,</b> such as the GHZ states or multiqubit states maximizing the global entanglement, and determine in which cases any of these states {{is representative of the}} average behaviour associated with general <b>initial</b> <b>states.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

5|$|When the Department of Engineering {{laid out}} the <b>initial</b> <b>state</b> highway system after the state's voters {{approved}} a bond issue {{to pay for it}} in 1910, they included Route5, connecting Santa Cruz and Oakland with Stockton via Altamont Pass. San Joaquin County paved the portion near Tracy with asphalt with their own bond issue, passed in 1909, and the state later resurfaced it with concrete. In addition, the new concrete road bypassed Banta, which the old county road had passed through via Banta Road, F Street, and Grant Line Road. Otherwise, the road was relatively direct, coming down from Altamont Pass onto Grant Line Road, following Byron Highway into Tracy, and leaving east and northeasterly on 11th Street to the San Joaquin River at the Mossdale Crossing. The Lincoln Highway Association chose this route in 1913 for their transcontinental highway, where it remained until the Carquinez Bridge opened in 1927, creating a shorter route via Vallejo. In 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials designated the Stockton-Bay Area route as US48, which was absorbed by an extension of US50 by the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|As part of Oregon's <b>initial</b> <b>state</b> highway system, {{the road}} from Grants Pass {{southwest}} to Wilderville and then along the Crescent City Plank Road to the state line was named the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway No. 25 in November 1917. At the time, the Grants Pass-Crescent City route, via the Gasquet Toll Road, was a narrow, winding unpaved mountain road with long grades and some remaining plank road in California. California added its portion to the state highway system in 1919, for the state's third highway bond issue, {{as an extension of}} Legislative Route 1. By 1924, the road was part of the Redwood Highway, which continued south to Sausalito, but was still completely unimproved between Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon. (Oregon changed the Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway name to Redwood Highway in May 1924.) A new highway between Gasquet and Kerby was completed by the two states in September 1926, and in June 1929 the new Hiouchi Bridge over the Smith River was dedicated, bypassing the remainder of the old road over Howland Hill. In 1948, US 199 became part of the Winnemucca to the Sea Highway, organized to promote the route that has largely become Nevada State Route 140 and Oregon Route 140 from I-80 at Winnemucca, Nevada to Crescent City. One major improvement to the highway's alignment was made after 1929: the Collier Tunnel replaced the winding route over Hazel View Summit in California on July 20, 1963.|$|E

40|$|State {{selective}} protocols, like entanglement purification, lead to {{an essentially}} non-linear quantum evolution, unusual in naturally occurring quantum processes. Sensitivity to <b>initial</b> <b>states</b> in quantum systems, stemming from such non-linear dynamics, is a promising perspective for applications. Here we demonstrate that chaotic behaviour is a rather generic feature in state selective protocols: exponential sensitivity can exist for all <b>initial</b> <b>states</b> in an experimentally realisable optical scheme. Moreover, any complex rational polynomial map, including {{the example of the}} Mandelbrot set, can be directly realised. In state selective protocols, one needs an ensemble of <b>initial</b> <b>states,</b> the size of which decreases with each iteration. We prove that exponential sensitivity to <b>initial</b> <b>states</b> in any quantum system have to be related to downsizing the initial ensemble also exponentially.
