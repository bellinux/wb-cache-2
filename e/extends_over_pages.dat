While there he wrote the article 'Army,' <b>extending</b> <b>over</b> sixty <b>pages,</b> for the ninth edition of the 'Encyclopædia Britannica.' He was engaged on this work from June to November 1873. The last portion of the manuscript was sent in {{a few days before the}} author, now a lieutenant-colonel, started for the at the Gold Coast to join the Ashanti expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley. Arriving at a time when the failure of the transport was causing serious apprehension, Colley infused new life into that service; and the administrative skill and energy which he displayed contributed largely to the success of the expedition.

40|$|ABSTRACT ”The {{study of}} {{literature}} casts {{light on the}} meanings in the film {{and the study of}} the film can illuminate the full value of the literature”-Ronald Perrier, “From Fiction to Film” Fiction is a print of words <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> the <b>pages</b> of the text. Words or signifiers indicate signified or meanings refer to things in their absence. So is the case with the cinema that projects shadows on the silver screen through the visual aids. This paper aims at exploring the similarities and differences between the Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “The Scarlet Letter ” and the cin-ematic version of “The Scarlet Letter ” by Ronald Joffe”. The novel is versioned into a cinema bearing the same title. “The Scarlett Letter ” is a novel of Romance written by Hawthorne that unfolds the plot of the Puritan, in human and cruel, moral code of conduct imposed on the innocent lovers. Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “The Scarlett Letter ” is famous for presenting some of the greatest interpretive difficulties in all of American Literature. The novel is his greatest accomplished work in American literary history...|$|R
5000|$|The {{hardware}} was {{radically different}} from most [...] "dumb" [...] terminals in that the characters were not stored in a simple data array. To save memory, which could <b>extend</b> <b>over</b> several <b>pages,</b> characters were allocated as linked lists of blocks which were dynamically allocated. Display enhancements were encoded as embedded bytes in the stream. Software enhancements which {{did not affect the}} appearance such as dim or underline, but protected and unprotected fields were also coded with embedded bytes. The display hardware was capable of reading this unusual data structure. When the cost of memory came down by the 262X series, this was changed to a [...] "parallel" [...] structure with one bit for each enhancement code, but the logic required to emulate previous behaviors was complex. Inserting a code for underline would [...] "propagate" [...] to the next display enhancement, while deleting such a code would also have to be propagated to the next display byte or a cursor jump sequence was issued to jump several bytes. You could also completely turn off enhancements as well as provide protected only field enhancements. This data structure would inspire the sparse matrix data structure for the Twin spreadsheet.|$|R
5000|$|Photography {{was given}} central {{place in the}} {{magazine}} under art director Albert Gilou. In 1949, photographs replaced the hand-drawn illustration which had hitherto appeared on each cover of Réalités. Covers were devoted to photos which would generate surprise, intrigue or mystery, but not shock or horror. All sorts of images were employed but the dominant genre, {{at least through the}} early years, was humanist photography, in particular that of staffers Édouard Boubat and Jean-Philippe Charbonnier, espousing the optimistic values of the contemporary exhibition The Family of Man in which both exhibited. An emphasis on photography helped promote the reputation of the publication. Among the photographers (of whom, from 1950, Édouard Boubat, Jean-Philippe Charbonnier, Gilles Ehrmann and Jean-Louis Swiners became salaried employees) were contributors Émile Savitry, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau, René Burri, Edward Steichen, Robert Capa, William Klein, Richard Avedon, Irving Penn. At first each issue carried sixty pictures in black and white, though the magazine printed colour photographs from 1950. [...] Then, from the mid sixties, most images were in colour, almost exclusively so from the late sixties. Photo essays often <b>extended</b> <b>over</b> twenty <b>pages.</b> Edouard Boubat described the experience of working for Réalités: ...|$|R
5000|$|After university, Cornforth {{worked as}} a {{volunteer}} in the British Museum in London, and started to write articles for Country Life, joining {{the staff at the}} magazine in 1961. Its architectural editor Christopher Hussey, encouraged Cornforth to write a book with architect Oliver Hill on 17th-century country houses, published in 1966 as English Country Houses: Caroline, 1625-1685 [...] Cornforth followed Hussey's successor Mark Girouard as architectural editor at Country Life in 1967. He stepped down in 1977 to concentrate on his book writing, and was succeeded by Marcus Binney. He retired from Country Life in 1993 but continued to write books and articles. He wrote for Country Life for over 40 years, with a bibliography <b>extending</b> to <b>over</b> 50 <b>pages.</b>|$|R
60|$|This being so, I {{could not}} have {{observed}} Mr. Razumov or guessed at his reality {{by the force of}} insight, much less have imagined him as he was. Even to invent the mere bald facts of his life would have been utterly beyond my powers. But I think that without this declaration the readers of these pages will be able to detect in the story the marks of documentary evidence. And that is perfectly correct. It is based on a document; all I have brought to it is my knowledge of the Russian language, which is sufficient for what is attempted here. The document, of course, is something in the nature of a journal, a diary, yet not exactly that in its actual form. For instance, most of it was not written up from day to day, though all the entries are dated. Some of these entries cover months of time and <b>extend</b> <b>over</b> dozens of <b>pages.</b> All the earlier part is a retrospect, in a narrative form, relating to an event which took place about a year before.|$|R
500|$|Although {{avoiding}} {{stress on}} 12th century Scottish [...] "barbarity", the Lowland Scottish historians {{of the later}} Middle Ages tend to repeat the accounts of earlier chronicle tradition. Much that was written was either directly transcribed from the earlier medieval chronicles themselves or was modelled closely upon them, even in the significant works of John of Fordun, Andrew Wyntoun and Walter Bower. For example, Bower includes in his text the eulogy written for David by Ailred of Rievaulx. This quotation <b>extends</b> to <b>over</b> twenty <b>pages</b> in the modern edition, and exerted {{a great deal of}} influence over what became the traditional view of David in later works about Scottish history. Historical treatment of David developed in the writings of later Scottish historians, and the writings of men like John Mair, George Buchanan, Hector Boece, and Bishop John Leslie ensured that by the 18th century a picture of David as a pious, justice-loving state-builder and vigorous maintainer of Scottish independence had emerged.|$|R
60|$|I {{continued}} reading, but {{the above}} passage was succeeded by minute instructions, <b>extending</b> <b>over</b> several <b>pages,</b> concerning the dress, both for ordinary and extraordinary occasions, {{to be worn}} by the chosen daughter during her year of preparation: the conduct to be observed by her towards {{other members of the}} family, also towards pilgrims visiting the house in the interval, with many other matters of secondary importance. Impatient to reach the end, I tried to turn the leaves rapidly, but now found that my arm had grown strangely stiff and cold, and seemed like an arm of iron when I raised it, so that the turning over of each leaf was an immense labor. Then I read yet another page, but with the utmost difficulty; for, notwithstanding the eagerness of my mind, my eyes began to remain more and more rigidly fixed on the center of the leaf, so that I could scarcely force them to follow the lines. Here I read that the bride-elect, her year of preparation being over, rises before daylight, and goes out alone to an appointed place at a great distance from the house, there to pass several hours in solitude and silence, communing with her own heart. Meanwhile, in the house all the others array themselves in purple garments, and go out singing at sunrise to gather flowers to adorn their heads; then, proceeding to the appointed spot, they seek for their new mother, and, finding her, lead her home with music and rejoicing.|$|R
