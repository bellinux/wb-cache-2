50|$|After Linvill and Bliss {{decided to}} join forces to work on Linvill’s vision of a reading machine, it became {{apparent}} that they needed to obtain funding for this objective, rather than the objectives of Department of Defense and NASA which had provided the funding up until that time. As a start, Bliss suggested that they visit Dr. Murphy at the VA, since he was the only then currently active government source of reading machine funding. However, Bliss knew that the research on “Optophone-like” reading machines had created negativity toward this “direct translation” approach because of the slow reading rates obtained. To counter this negativity, Bliss programmed an SRI computer to present text in a moving belt display, similar to that in Times Square New York City, on both his air jet stimulator array and on the Stanford bimorph array. Linvill’s blind daughter, Candy, was then the subject who attempted to learn to read the text presented in this fashion. After several hours of training and practice, Candy was reading in excess of 30 words per minute. Bliss and Linvill felt this computer <b>driven</b> <b>test</b> was a valid simulation of the reading machine they proposed to develop. They felt the 30 words per minute reading rate achieved in a short time by Candy proved that if such a reading machine were developed, it would be useful. They didn’t know what the upper limit of reading speed would be, but had hopes that 100 words per minute could be achieved, since this was typical Braille reading rate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{existence}} of coverage holes in cellular networks {{is a common}} problem for mobile operators. Traditionally, the cellular coverage is computed using sophisticated planning tools, and then optimized through <b>drive</b> <b>tests.</b> With the <b>drive</b> <b>tests</b> information, the operators detect the poorly covered areas and take actions to eliminate them. The introduction of self-organized or “cognitive ” techniques, would allow the operators to maxi-mize the network’s information obtained through <b>drive</b> <b>tests</b> or reported by the mobile users. In this paper we propose the use of spatial Bayesian geo-statistics to build a Radio Environment Map (REM) for real coverage hole detection purposes. Results show {{that the number of}} pixels forming the coverage holes, as well as the probability of detecting them, can be significantly increased with the use of REMs, compared to the case where only network measurements are used.

Many companies plan to start test automation projects in order to implement efficient, less expensive software testing. However, there are challenges for the testing team who lack experience performing GUI tests automation. Many GUI test automation projects have ended in failure due to mistakes made {{during the early stages}} of the project. The major work of this thesis is to find a solution to the challenges of establishing new test automation projects and determine an appropriate method to build GUI tests automation. Due to the particularity of GUI tests automation, keyword <b>driven</b> <b>test</b> approach is introduced in this thesis. The advantages and disadvantages are shown by undertaking comparison with the Record and replay testing method and the data driven testing method. The research also includes a feasibility study of GUI tests automation. The analysis report points out which kinds of test projects should be automated and which kinds should not be automated. Test automation tool selection is a critical step for an test automation project. This thesis shows the correct procedure for selecting a testing tool and explains the strategies of testing tool selection. It also summaries the mistakes made during the tool selection process. Several classical types of testing tools which support Qt software testing are compared and evaluated. Based on the in-depth analysis and comparison of testing tools, the thesis explains how the different tools fit with the different test projects. The implementation procedure of a test automation is demonstrated in this thesis. The procedure includes test case design and testing framework implementation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{data driven}} Neyman {{statistic}} {{consists of two}} elements: a score statistic in a finite dimensional submodel and a selection rule {{to determine the best}} fitted submodel. For instance, Schwarz BIC and Akaike AIC rules are often applied in such constructions. For moderate sample sizes AIC is sensitive in detecting complex models, while BIC works well for relatively simple structures. When the sample size is moderate, the choice of selection rule for determining a best fitted model from a number of models has a substantial influence on the power of the related data driven Neyman test. This paper proposes a new solution, in which the type of penalty (AIC or BIC) is chosen {{on the basis of the}} data.
