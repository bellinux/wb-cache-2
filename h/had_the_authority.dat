5|$|Galen Clark was {{appointed}} by the commission as the Grant's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to evict homesteaders (which included Hutchings). The issue was not settled until 1872 when the homesteader land holdings were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880, this dispute also reaching the Supreme Court in 1880. The two Supreme Court decisions affecting management of the Yosemite Grant are considered important precedents in land management law. Hutchings became the new park guardian.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E
5|$|The case {{became known}} as Pierce v. Society of Sisters, a seminal United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that significantly expanded coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to educate children as they thought best. It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.|$|E

5000|$|A medical {{psychologist}} who holds prescriptive authority for specific psychiatric medications and other pharmaceutical drugs must first obtain specific qualifications in Psychopharmacology. A trained medical {{psychologist who}} has prescriptive authority is equated with a mid-level provider who <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to prescribe psychotropic medication such as antidepressants for neurotic disorders.

5|$|The {{commission}} appointed Galen Clark as the grant's first guardian, {{but neither}} Clark nor the commissioners <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to evict homesteaders. Josiah Whitney, the first {{director of the}} California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley would meet the same fate as Niagara Falls, which {{at that time was}} a tourist trap with tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The most {{powerful}} ordinary magistrate was the consul, {{of which there}} were two, who served {{for the period of}} one year. These consuls <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to call assemblies of the people. In the early Republic, they held judicial duties until these responsibilities were moved to the praetors and later to permanent courts; similarly, they held financial responsibilities until these duties were transferred to the quaestors. The consuls also held vague religious duties inherited from the kings, along with their more important military functions, serving as the commander-in-chief of Rome's armies.|$|E
5|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's feeding tube was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed that Michael Schiavo should have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.|$|E

5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E
5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{examiners}} <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> {{to register}} voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The {{goal of the}} federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities {{the right to vote}} by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E

5|$|In the 11th century, {{the efforts}} of Hildebrand of Sovana led to the {{creation}} of the College of Cardinals to elect new popes, starting with Pope Alexander II in the papal election of 1061. When Alexander II died, Hildebrand was elected to succeed him, as Pope Gregory VII. The basic election system of the College of Cardinals which Gregory VII helped establish has continued to function into the 21st century. Pope Gregory VII further initiated the Gregorian Reforms regarding the independence of the clergy from secular authority. This led to the Investiture Controversy between the church and the Holy Roman Emperors, over which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to appoint bishops and popes.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|Stretford {{was part}} of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, {{as a result of the}} Local Government Act 1894.|$|E

5|$|This brought Kenney into {{conflict}} with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify {{the administration of the}} RAAF. Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command, and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were. However, Kenney deviated from the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) under Whitehead. The new headquarters <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area, where fast-changing weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia. Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and {{the definition of a}} crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
5|$|Barley evidently {{decided that}} it was futile to {{continue}} resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife.|$|E

5|$|Cook County {{homeowners are}} {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector General <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector General {{has the power to}} investigate the Cook County Assessor, affirming two lower court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though as}} many as {{fourteen}} claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus. The Scottish magnates made a request to Edward to conduct the proceedings and administer the outcome, but not to arbitrate in the dispute. The actual decision would be made by 104 auditors - 40 appointed by Balliol, 40 by Bruce and the remaining 24 selected by Edward I from {{senior members of the}} Scottish political community. At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward. Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord. The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to make this decision. This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found. After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17November 1292.|$|E
5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with Go Man Go's registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. Go Man Go certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go Man Go needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of Go Man Go's first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|E
