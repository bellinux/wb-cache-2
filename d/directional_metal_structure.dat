40|$|Coating {{compositions}} {{and methods}} of their use are described herein for the reduction of corrosion in imbedded <b>metal</b> <b>structures.</b> The coatings are applied as liquids to an external surface of a substrate in which the <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> are imbedded. The coatings are subsequently allowed to dry. The liquid applied coatings provide galvanic protection to the imbedded <b>metal</b> <b>structures.</b> Continued protection can be maintained with periodic reapplication of the coating compositions, as necessary, to maintain electrical continuity. Because the coatings may be applied using methods similar to standard paints, and because the coatings are applied to external surfaces of the substrates in which the <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> are imbedded, the corresponding corrosion protection may be easily maintained. The coating compositions are particularly useful in the protection of metal-reinforced concrete...|$|R

The simulated samples of the random variable and {{the stress of the}} dangerous point were successfully obtained through the orthogonal design. Then, we utilized BP neural network nonlinear mapping function trains to get the explicit expression of stress in response to the random variable. Combined with random perturbation theory and first-order second-moment (FOSM) method, the study analyzed the reliability and its sensitivity of <b>metal</b> <b>structure.</b> In conclusion, we established a novel method for accurately quantitative analysis and design of bridge crane <b>metal</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

In the project was developed the technique of determining the acoustic-elastic coefficients for the material profile, using sections of shelves and the neutral line, that corresponding to the stressed and unstressed conditions of the metal. It is proposed the scheme of construction of system of stress-strain condition diagnostics of sections of <b>metal</b> <b>structures,</b> the analysis and justification of the choice of technical means for its implementation. Here was developed software for processing and analysis of diagnostics results of stress-strain condition of sections of <b>metal</b> <b>structures.</b> It was held the analysis of time passage intervals of the ultrasonic wave on the neutral line of the shaped profiles. It was determined acoustic-elastic relationship coefficients for shaped profiles of <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> for stresses in tension and compression. It was proved the possibility of using enhanced acoustic method for diagnostics of sections of <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> in industrial environments. It is proposed production complex method of diagnostics of stress-strain condition profile, using the proposed methodology implemented acoustical diagnostics of stress-strain condition of sections of <b>metal</b> <b>structures</b> of industrial buildings. ??????????? ????????? ????????????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????-???????? ?????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????? ??????? ? ????????????? ???????????????? ????? ???. ???????? ?????? ?????????, ??????????? ???????, ???????????, ?????????? ????????????, ?????????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ??? ??????????? ????????????? ????? ??????? ?? ??? ??? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????????, ?? ???? ??????? ?????? ???????? ?? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????? ???? ??? ????????????? ?????????-???????? ?????? ??? ???????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???? ?????????????. ????????????? ?????????-???????? ?????? ?????????, ? ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????, ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???? ????????????? ? ??????? ????????. ? ?????? ? ??????? ????????????? ????????????? ????????, ??? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ?????????????? ?? ??????? ????, ?? ???? ?? ???????? ??????? ?????, ? ??????????? ????? ????????? ??????? ???? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????, ??? ??????????????? ? ??????? ?????? ??????? ??????. ?????? ??????? ????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ??????????, ??????????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ????????? ????????????? ? ????????. ??? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????? ??????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????????, ?????????????? ?????????-???????? ?????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ????????, ? ????????????? ???????????????? ????? ??? ?????, ?? ???? ????? ??????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ??????????. ??????????? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ??????????, ??? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????. ??? ????? ??????? ???????????????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ?? ????? ????????? ??????? ? ?????, ??? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????, ? ?? ??????????? ????? ???????, ??? ?????????? ???????????. ? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????????? ????? ??? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ????? ? ??????????? ?????, ??? ????????????? ???????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????. ?????????? ????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????, ???????? ?????? ? ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ??? ?? ??????????. ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ? ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????. ???????? ?????? ??????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???? ?? ?????????? ?? ???? ?????????? ????? ?????????????????? ???????????????? ? ????????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ?????????? ?????. ???????? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????? ?? ??????????? ????? ???????? ????????. ????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ????? ??? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ? ??????. ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ???????????????????? ????????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ????????. ?????????? ???????????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????, ? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????????...|$|R
