5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers, <b>food-processing</b> equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, lubricating greases, and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.|$|E
5|$|Occupations in Tirunelveli include service-sector {{activities}} such as administration, agricultural trading, tourism, banking, agro-machinery, information technology and educational services. In 1991, the Tirunelveli region ranked second {{in the number of}} women workers. Service sectors such as tourism have developed, due to a growth in religious tourism. Tirunelveli has beedi and cement factories, tobacco companies, workshops for steel-based products and mills for cotton textiles, spinning and weaving; there are also small-scale industries, such as tanneries and brick kilns. The agricultural areas, hand-woven clothes and household industries contribute to the economic growth of the city. <b>Food-processing</b> industries have developed since the late 1990s; at the district level, it is the foremost industrial segment. Industries involving rice-making, blue-jelly metal manufacturing and jem power generating are located {{on the outskirts of the}} city.

25|$|The {{traditional}} sugar industry, {{upon which}} the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere {{on the island and}} controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other <b>food-processing</b> industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous Habanos cigars. Although the harbours of Cienfuegos and Matanzas, in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{destruction}} {{was caused}} to commercial enterprises and to public infrastructure. According to Palestinian industrialists, 219 factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation. Of the three per cent of industrial capacity {{that was still}} operating after the 18-month Israeli blockade, much has now been destroyed. The biggest Palestinian <b>food-processing</b> plant, Alweyda was devastated, as were both Abu Eida, the largest ready-mixed concrete producer, with four factories demolished, and the Al Badr flour mills, with the biggest storage facilities in the Strip. All three had close and long-standing contact with Israeli partner firms and suppliers. The owners stated that they see this {{as part of an}} economic war to make Gaza dependent on Israel.|$|E
25|$|Maryland has {{large areas}} of fertile {{agricultural}} land in its coastal and Piedmont zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, tomatoes, muskmelons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms. Maryland's <b>food-processing</b> plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.|$|E

25|$|In many dairy industries, salt {{is added}} to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The <b>food-processing</b> category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, cat and dog food.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} these {{promising}} advantages, nisin is the only bacteriocin {{generally recognized as safe}} by the Food and Drug Administration and is currently used as a food preservative in several countries.This limitation in bacteriocins availability in the market as preservatives and antimicrobials can be attributed to multiple factors, including: (i) the high cost of their commercial production; (ii) the loss of their activity by proteolytic enzymes; (iii) their unfavorable interactions with other food constituents, which decreases the availability and necessitates a huge amount of the peptide to be added; (iv) the alterations of the chemical and physical properties of these compounds during the various <b>food-processing</b> stages; (v) the low yield of these compounds due to ineffective recovery by traditional purification methods; and (vi) the narrow spectrum of activity observed for most of the tested bacteriocins against pathogenic bacteria. In the last years, several studies on bacteriocins have demonstrated that the optimization of their production conditions, their purification methods, their combinations with other antimicrobial agents, the hurdle technology approach, and nanotechnology formulations, could all represent solutions to some of the previously mentioned problems.|$|E
25|$|Although textile trading has {{declined}} in significance, the industrial {{relationship between the}} regions, especially in the manufacturing sector, is a major one. As of 2008 trade {{between the two nations}} accounted for US$ 1 billion. Ukraine is a notable exporter to Belgium of precious metals and minerals, oil products and chemicals whilst Belgium is a major supplier to Ukraine of machines, industrial and electrotechnical equipment, chemicals, rubber, and also certain metals. The nations are also connected in the beer industry, with the Belgian brewing company Interbrew having a share of 34.3% in the Ukrainian beer market, thanks to its cooperation with the Ukrainian brewers of Chernigiv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. General Belgian investments in the economy of Ukraine had grown rapidly and as of July 2008, some US$ 44 million was put in the Ukrainian economy by Belgian investors, with 31.5% into wholesale trade, 16% into transport and communications, 15% into the <b>food-processing</b> industry (15%) and 13% into mechanical engineering respectively. A number of Ukrainian companies are primarily financed by Belgian investment.|$|E
2500|$|Propylene glycol is {{considerably}} less toxic than ethylene glycol {{and may be}} labeled as [...] "non-toxic antifreeze". It is used as antifreeze where ethylene glycol would be inappropriate, such as in <b>food-processing</b> systems or in water pipes in homes where incidental ingestion may be possible. For example, the FDA allows propylene glycol {{to be added to}} a large number of processed foods, including ice cream, frozen custard, salad dressings, and baked goods, and it is commonly used as the main ingredient in the [...] "e-liquid" [...] used in electronic cigarettes.|$|E

2500|$|A shortwave UV lamp can be {{made using}} a {{fluorescent}} lamp tube with no phosphor coating. These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UVC band at 253.7nm and 185nm due to the mercury within the lamp, {{as well as some}} visible light. From 85% to 90% of the UV produced by these lamps is at 253.7nm, whereas only 5–10% is at 185nm. The fused quartz glass tube passes the 253nm radiation but blocks the 185nm wavelength. Such tubes have two or three times the UVC power of a regular fluorescent lamp tube. These low-pressure lamps have a typical efficiency of approximately 30–40%, meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp, they will produce approximately 30–40 watts of total UV output. These [...] "germicidal" [...] lamps are used extensively for disinfection of surfaces in laboratories and <b>food-processing</b> industries, and for disinfecting water supplies.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst {{the various}} {{contemporary}} agricultural practices {{mentioned in the}} Nong Shu, Wang listed and described the use of ploughing, sowing, irrigation, cultivation of mulberries, etc. It listed and described many of the various foodstuffs and products of the many regions of China. The book outlined the use of not only agricultural tools, but <b>food-processing,</b> irrigation equipment, different types of fields, ceremonial vessels, various types of grain storage, carts, boats, mechanical devices, and textile machinery used in many applications. [...] For example, {{one of the many}} devices described and illustrated in drawing is a large mechanical milling plant operated by the motive power of oxen, with an enormous rotating geared wheel engaging the toothed gears of eight different mills surrounding it. Of great interest to sinologist historians, Wang also outlined the difference between the agricultural technology of Northern China and that of Southern China. The main characteristic of agricultural technology of the north was technical applications fit for predominantly dryland cultivation, while intensified irrigation cultivation was more suitable for southern China. Furthermore, Wang used his treatise as a means to spread knowledge in support of certain agricultural practices or technologies found exclusively in either South or North that could benefit the other, if only they were more widely known, such as the southern hand-harrow used for weeding in the south, yet virtually unknown in the north.|$|E
