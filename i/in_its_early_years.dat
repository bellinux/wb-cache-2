5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> {{through to}} roughly the year 2000, the private equity and venture capital asset classes were {{primarily}} {{active in the}} United States. With the second private equity boom in the mid-1990s and liberalization of regulation for institutional investors in Europe, a mature European private equity market emerged.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> {{the lake}} was used for boating, canoeing, curling, and ice skating. By 1899, {{the lake was}} used by up to 3,000 skaters on weekdays and 10,000 on weekends. The ice-skating house, shared with the golf course, was added in 1902. By 1935, the lake was used by {{approximately}} 20,000 skaters daily.|$|E

The four {{children}} inherited most of their father's estate, which was worth several million dollars. Although Marshall became financially independent, he continued to work throughout his life. He used his wealth to support causes, such as The Wilderness Society, which he essentially supported <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> and to pursue his interests.|$|E

5|$|F. The Charity Shield {{was first}} played for in 1908. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> the match {{took place at}} the end of the season, but was {{subsequently}} moved to September or October of the following season. From 1959 onwards it has been played in August, prior to the beginning of the league programme. It was renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the United States {{established}} military {{ties with}} Liberia by sending some five black American officers to help reorganize the force. The LFF <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> was frequently recruited by inducing {{men from the}} interior forcibly. When dispatched to the interior to quell tribal unrest, units often lived off the areas that they were pacifying, {{as a form of}} communal punishment. The Force's officers were drawn from either the coastal aristocracy or tribal elites.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> {{the league}} {{was little more}} than a formal {{agreement}} between teams to play each other and to declare a champion at season's end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out and fail to play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> Caversham {{was heavily}} industrialised, but also {{contained}} {{a large number}} of residential properties. The population included {{a large number of}} skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and both large and small industries abounded. Local industries {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> the LPO {{recorded}} {{exclusively for}} Columbia, {{a division of}} EMI. The orchestra's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from Messiah and The Creation at Kingsway Hall in September 1932. The first Abbey Road recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood. Beecham's first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite The Origin of Design, arranged from music by Handel. From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine 78-rpm sets with the orchestra. Other conductors {{who worked in the}} EMI studios with the orchestra <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> included Elgar, Felix Weingartner, John Barbirolli, and Serge Koussevitzky. Soloists in concerto recordings included the pianists Artur Schnabel and Alfred Cortot and the violinists Fritz Kreisler and Jascha Heifetz.|$|E
5|$|Like most European {{restaurant}}s, La Caravelle had a {{menu that}} changed daily. This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also {{brought them back}} regularly. Salvador Dalí, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years.</b> The journalist and broadcaster Walter Cronkite was a regular visitor to La Caravelle and enjoyed eating pike quenelles in lobster cream sauce. Other frequent visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich.|$|E

5|$|The Peabody Orchestra, {{formed in}} 1866, {{was the first}} {{professional}} orchestra in Baltimore. The Orchestra premiered many works <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> including some by Asger Hamerik, a prominent Danish composer who became director of the Orchestra. Ross Jungnickel founded the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra before 1890, when the Orchestra first performed, and the Peabody Orchestra ceased to exist. Jungnickel's orchestra, however, lasted only until 1899.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving.|$|E
5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the California gold rush, and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers and Buffalo Braves (now Los Angeles Clippers), the Trail Blazers entered the NBA in 1970 as an {{expansion}} team, under coach Rolland Todd. Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks {{led the team}} <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> and the team failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in its first six seasons of existence. During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach. The team won the first pick in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick, and in 1974 the team selected Bill Walton from UCLA.|$|E
5|$|Hightail {{was founded}} as YouSendIt Inc. in 2004 by three cofounders: Ranjith Kumaram, Amir Shaikh and Khalid Shaikh. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> Amir pursued {{advertising}} revenues, Jimmy Vienneau managed business development, Francis Wu created the graphic design including the logo, while Kumaran {{focused on the}} user experience and Khalid did technical work. By May 2004, the company had 300,000 users and was growing 30 percent each month. That September, Cambrian Ventures invested $250,000. At first, YouSendIt was mainly used to send large files, such as photos or audio files, which were too large for the file-size limits set by email providers at the time.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> the congregation's {{financial}} situation was precarious. The building was located ten blocks from {{where most of}} the congregants and potential congregants lived (on Grand Street, near the ferry docks), and attendance was low. Even on the High Holy Days, the sanctuary was rarely more than half full. The synagogue employed a rabbi, gabbai, and cantor, and annual expenses often exceeded the congregation's income (which came primarily from the sale of seats). To remain solvent, the congregation borrowed money against the equity in the building: $2,000 (today $) in 1888, and another $2,000 in 1894.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> {{the library}} {{received}} book donations {{from the village}} Sunday school and the Club. In July 1928, the library moved from the Community Center building to the tower room of the former Briarcliff Farms office building, currently {{a branch of the}} International Union of Operating Engineers. The Community Center building was sold in October 1929 for $16,000; these funds were required to be used for recreational purposes. Thus, the organization gave $11,000 to the village for the construction of the Law Memorial Park pool, and $5,000 to the library. Upon the building's sale and the Club's dissolution, the library was reconstituted as an association library with a 15-member board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|Like most of {{the smaller}} Cistercian houses, {{comparatively}} {{little is known about}} the internal history of the abbey. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> Cleeve received grants of land and property from local lords and the Crown to supplement its initial endowment and in the prosperous years of the thirteenth century grew steadily, reaching 26monks in 1297. The abbey held various local churches, including those at Cleeve, Queen Camel, Woolavington while also holding the rectory of Lundy. The abbey was also responsible for the chapel of Our Lady between Old Cleeve and what is now Blue Anchor; however although this has since disappeared, the inn for pilgrims attending the chapel has been expanded into the present Chapel Cleeve Manor.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{continued}} {{throughout his}} tenure to hold tightly to his father's assurance {{that he would}} be able to maintain and act on his political convictions while running the business. He supported the United Nations <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E
