Take off and landing are thought to be the most responsible stages of helicopters flight. The electro-optical system giving some visual information to the pilot about correctness of helicopter position concerning a glide path is called the <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> <b>indicator.</b> To prevent the influence onboard and carrier pitching motion on visual axis position of the device in space stabilization systems are used. The <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> <b>indicator</b> forms three horizontal color bands glowing constantly and, adjoining to each other in space. The visual axis of the central band coincides with a glide path, the band over it is called - ?above a glide path?, under the central band is called - ?below a glide path?. Observing certain color of radiation, the pilot defines the aircraft position and changes its altitude for glide slope interception. It?s required to adhere to the central zone for correct helicopter landing. The main functions of the indicator of a glide path is to project radiation with the necessary light intensity, with the necessary geometry of bands and to prevent onboard and ship pitching motion. Glide path indicators are absolutely necessary on the aviabearing ships. In due course these systems have been improved and now represent reliable complex solutions. ????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????????? ??? ?????????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ??????????? ???? ? ?????. ???????? ???????????? ???? ?????????, ????? ?????? ????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????? ??? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????. ??? ??????????? ?????? ?? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????...|$|E

New Primary 25 / 08 WaveOne files were used for canal preparation in each subgroup. The outcome was measured by recording how many simulated canals could be shaped with one WaveOne reciprocating file in each subgroup before instrument breakage occurred. The average time it took to prepare each of the simulated canals was calculated and recorded. The data were collected and statistically analysed using the ANOVA / Bonferroni test.

Preparation times for different <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> methods and total time for root canal preparation, with or without <b>glide</b> <b>path,</b> was also calculated. Materials and Methods: Simulator Endo-Training-Blocks (n = 300) were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 100). The 3 groups were then sub-divided into 5 smaller groups (n = 20). Root canal preparation was done with new primary 25 / 08 WaveOne instruments allocated to each group (5 in total for each group, 1 for each sub-group) following different methods for <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation. Group 1 : no <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> (control); Group 2 : <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation with stainless-steel hand files (size 10 K-File followed by size 15 K-File and finally size 20 K-File until loose fitting); and Group 3 : <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation with rotary PathFiles (size 10 K-File until loose fitting followed by PathFile no. 1 (ISO 13 tip), PathFile no. 2 (ISO 16 tip) and finally PathFile no. 3 (ISO 19 tip)). The Primary 25 / 08 WaveOne reciprocating instrument was used with the WaveOne endodontic motor in “WaveOne All “mode with a brushing motion on the outstroke. Simulated root canals were irrigated with sterile water and Glyde was used as lubricating agent. The outcome was measured by recording how many simulators could be prepared with one instrument before instrument breakage occurred. The preparation protocol was repeated 5 times. The time it took to prepare the <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> and the total preparation time was also calculated. The data of the different parts of the project were collected and statistically analysed using the ANOVA / Bonferroni test. Results: <b>Glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation with PathFiles was significantly faster (13. 3 s ± 2. 60 s) than with hand files (25. 1 s ± 1. 70 s) (P < 0. 001). The highest number of simulators could be prepared after <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation was performed with PathFiles (19. 2 ± 0. 84) (P < 0. 001). Pairwise comparisons at the Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0. 017 demonstrated that there were statistical significant differences (P < 0. 001) when PathFiles (19. 2 ± 0. 84) and hand files (17. 6 ± 1. 14) were compared to the no <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> group (7. 4 ± 0. 89). There was no statistical significant difference between PathFiles and hand files groups. Total Preparation time was significantly shorter (P < 0. 001) when an initial <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> was prepared with PathFiles (12. 7 ± 0. 22 s). The longest preparation time (P < 0. 001) was calculated in group 1 where no <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> (21. 2 ± 0. 20 s) was present and the Endo-Training-Blocks were left undisturbed.

The working times for the different <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> enlargement methods were also recorded. Ninety untreated curved root canals from extracted molars were randomly divided into three groups (n = 30). Group 1 : manual <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation with size 0. 10 Kfile and enlargement with size 0. 15 and 0. 20 hand K-files; Group 2 : manual <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation with size 0. 10 K-file and enlargement with NiTi rotary G-Files; and Group 3 : manual <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> preparation with size 0. 10 K-file and enlargement with the NiTi rotary ProGlider file (ISO tip size 16). Micro-computed tomography was used to scan the teeth before and after <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> enlargement. Three-dimensional images were reconstructed from the pre- and post-instrumentation scans to enable a comparison of the centring ability at three selected levels: 1 mm from the apical foramen (D 1), at the point of maximum root curvature (Dmc) and 7 mm from the apical foramen (D 7). Canal transportation was assessed at 1 mm from the apical foramen in eight directions (MB, B, DB, D, DL, L, ML, M). The time it took to enlarge the <b>glide</b> <b>paths</b> for each group was also calculated. One-way Analysis of Variance was performed to assess if significant differences existed between the three groups for the variables being compared (p< 0. 05). A Bonferroni adjusted p value of 0. 016 was used for pairwise comparisons of centring ability. K-files displayed statistically significantly higher centering ratios than G-Files at D 1. At all levels the ProGlider file exhibited statistically significantly lower centering ratios than K-files. At Dmc, the ProGlider file demonstrated statistically significantly lower centering ratios than G-Files. Ratios were significantly similar between K-files and GFiles at D 7 as well as between G-Files and the ProGlider file at D 7 (p< 0. 016). Apical canal transportation for K-files was significantly more than G-Files in five directions and the ProGlider file in six directions (p< 0. 05). <b>Glide</b> <b>path</b> enlargement time for Kfiles was significantly slower (74. 92 s ± 2. 60 s) than G-Files (41. 87 s ± 20. 19 s) and the ProGlider file (27. 95 s ± 8. 55 s) (p< 0. 05). There was no statistically significant difference between <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> enlargement times of G-Files and the ProGlider file. Findings suggest that NiTi rotary <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> files are suitable for safe <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> enlargement because they cause less apical canal transportation than stainless steel hand K-files. Of the two NiTi rotary <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> file groups, the ProGlider file showed an overall significantly better centering ability around the entirety of the original canals, particularly at the point of maximum curvature. <b>Glide</b> <b>path</b> enlargement with the NiTi rotary <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> file groups was significantly faster than Kfiles (p< 0. 05).

Twenty were prepared with a mechanical <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> using PathFiles 1 and 2 (the PathFile group), and 20 were prepared with a mechanical <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> using a ProGlider single file (the ProGlider group). All samples were shaped with ProTaper Next X 1 driven by an endodontic motor connected to a digital wattmeter. The required torque for root canal instrumentation was analyzed by evaluating the electrical power consumption of the endodontic engine.

50|$|Signals {{from the}} {{transmitter}} are {{received by the}} pilot of the aircraft, over the AN/ARN-5 receiving equipment. which provides visual indication of the proper course of descent in the vertical plane during instrument landing operation. At an altitude of 3,000 feet it provides a straight-line <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> course with good definition from a minimum distance of 15 miles {{from the point of}} landing contact with the ground. The angle indicated between the horizontal and the <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> is readily adjustable between 2 and 5 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the plane}} was a little higher than the normal <b>glide</b> <b>path,</b> Captain Fernandez asked for a higher descent rate of 1000 ft / min, instead of the normal rate of 700 ft / min. This faster descent {{increased}} the aircraft speed to 275 km / hr — higher than the recommended speed of 240 km / hr — but it helped the aircraft regain the normal <b>glide</b> <b>path.</b> The aircraft was also now in the vertical speed mode — the correct mode for landing.|$|R
40|$|Aim: This article {{introduces}} the Reciproc® blue system and describes the clinical technique {{with and without}} creating a <b>glide</b> <b>path.</b> Methodology: The concept of canal preparation with only one mechanical instrument used in reciprocation was introduced several years ago. Studies and clinical research have shown the efficiency {{and the safety of}} the Reciproc® instrument in the preparation of the majority of canals without creating a <b>glide</b> <b>path,</b> and in the retreatment procedure. Results: Reciproc® blue, a thermally treated instrument is an improved version of the original Reciproc® instrument; it has an increased resistance to cyclic fatigue and a greater flexibility enabling a safer and smoother canal preparation procedure, and a wider range of clinical applications. Conclusions: This article introduces and describes the clinical technique with which the Reciproc® blue instrument is used, even without the need to create a <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> with manual files before using the mechanical instrument...|$|R
50|$|Early {{electronic}} guidance systems use similar methods, {{only with}} electronic signals and processors replacing {{the birds in}} detecting the target and preventing deviation from the <b>glide</b> <b>path.</b>|$|R
