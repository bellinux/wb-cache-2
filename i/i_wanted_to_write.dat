5|$|I {{should say}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

I think {{it takes a long time}} before a crisis—like AIDS—enters the culture to a point where responses exist in a character, where personal gestures are both individual and resonant in a larger way.It was adapted as the 1999 film Anywhere But Here, starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman.

500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this.

500|$|The {{songs are}} highly {{influenced}} by traditional world music, particularly African and Brazilian music, with Gabriel using the distinctive drum beat from these styles. In a 2011 interview for Uncut, Gabriel said, [...] "I'd had my fill of instrumental experimenting for a while, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> proper pop songs, albeit {{on my own}} terms." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes that Gabriel [...] "doesn't just add on African drums or Indian violin to ordinary songs; {{they are part of}} the foundation."

In January 2015, Christophe Beck, who worked with Reed on Bring It On, was hired to replace Price. Describing the film's score, Beck said, [...] "For Ant-Man, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a score in the grand symphonic tradition of my favorite superhero movies, with a sweeping scope and a big, catchy main theme. What makes this score stand out among other Marvel movies, though, is a sneaky sense of fun since it is, after all, not only a superhero movie, but also a heist comedy."

She also stated that the main idea behind the song was sex and gambling. In an interview with UK's Daily Star, Gaga noted of the song, [...] "It's about a lot of different things. I gamble but I've also dated a lot of guys who are really into sex and booze and gambling, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a record my boyfriends would like too."

500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> games." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Cobain {{was writing}} {{a number of new}} songs. At the time Cobain was {{listening}} to bands like The Melvins, R.E.M., The Smithereens, and the Pixies. Feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene upon which Sub Pop had built its image, Cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic. A key development was the single [...] "Sliver", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain said [...] "was like a statement in a way. I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> more songs like that." [...] Grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to children's music, in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible.|$|E
500|$|... "Early Winter" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Rice-Oxley, pianist of English {{alternative}} rock band Keane, and Gwen Stefani for the latter's second solo studio album The Sweet Escape (2006). The production of the song was handled by Nellee Hooper. Before working with Oxley in the studio, Stefani called him to discuss some of her ideas behind a potential song, saying [...] "I wanted a ballad. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> 'Eyes Without a Face' or 'Killing Me Softly' or 'Time After Time,' and he was like, 'OK, Cyndi Lauper, got it,' like he was taking my order." [...] In the studio, Oxley played [...] "Early Winter" [...] on a piano, and after hearing the song, Stefani approved of it and commented that [...] "It was so beautiful and addictive. I didn't really attack {{it because it was}} kind of done, lyrics and everything." [...] After letting the song [...] "sit with her for a bit", she rewrote some of the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Weezer's self-titled debut album, {{also known}} as the Blue album, was {{released}} in May 1994 and became a commercial success; it was certified gold on December 1 and platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million. Songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote that success had [...] "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me – 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not sure this is the life I want to lead.'" [...] He had also developed a [...] "huge inferiority complex" [...] about rock music, saying: [...] "I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> complex, intense, beautiful music." [...] Touring with Weezer, he listened to the operas Aida (1871) and Madama Butterfly (1904), the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), and the musical Les Misérables (1980). Inspired by how these works married music and narrative, he decided to write a rock opera to explore his feelings about relationships, fame, and his life as a touring musician.|$|E

500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write,</b> and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|Weisman's science journalism style uses {{interviews}} with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, {{while maintaining the}} [...] "cool and dispassionate ...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for {{whatever it is you}} believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E
5000|$|Following Gerry Conway's {{elevation}} to editor-in-chief in March 1976, Englehart had a falling-out with Marvel. He {{recalled in}} 2010 that Conway ...was {{a young guy}} in those days.

I can do whatever <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> The Avengers and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> The Defenders.' So he just took them. He took The Avengers {{away from me and}} he took The Defenders away from Steve Gerber. We said, 'This is not the collegial atmosphere that we've all been working under.' I quit. I got into Marvel because of the whole Bullpen, the whole ambience that you could see form the readers' side. When I came in the door, it was exactly like that inside. Marvel was a wonderful place to work. This was a big change, this kind of 'I have power' mentality.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Virginian-Pilot, Walker stated that Once in a Lifetime Love {{was one of his}} favorite songs and said, [...] "It's probably the best vocal performance I've ever given.

However, it made her become [...] "smarter and stronger". To release herself, Aguilera started to write songs {{at the age of}} 15, both music and lyrics; and it was the way how she found her voice. The writing process of [...] "Fighter" [...] began during her promotion for her debut album in 1999, when she was [...] "a part of the big craze pop phenomenon". According to Aguilera, her debut album helped her a lot to develop the process. She wanted to make an [...] "emotionally rich and positive empowering" [...] song, especially for women, {{in order for them to}} speak for themselves be strong. About the idea of the track, she revealed, [...] "I was coming up with titles and ideas and deciding what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about.

500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I knew she {{did a lot of}} characters and voices, so I wanted to incorporate that ... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> something for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You have to believe that he believes his own rap. When he speaks, he's just explaining that 'this is the way it is' – and that's when it gets very scary." [...] The name [...] "Vernon" [...] comes from cult leader David Koresh's real name, and [...] "Ephesian" [...] is taken from one of the books of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|According to Lucy O'Brien, {{author of}} , the main concept of American Life was about [...] "nothing". This {{was evident in}} the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the {{negative}} tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] began as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife. He asked singer Jem Archer to collaborate with him and during their first collaborative session, they wrote a song called [...] "Silly Thing", inspired by Sigsworth's wife. He said: [...] "I never write love songs, but I was moved to write one for her. I've never had a problematic relationship with her, there's not been a lot of drama. But <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> something naive and honest." [...] The demo, which sounded like an offbeat folk song, was later played for Madonna, who loved it and added to and changed parts and the title of the song. In September 2012, Sigsworth leaked the original version of [...] "Nothing Fails", describing it as a [...] "work-in-progress demo of a song I originally wrote with Jem, and which later became 'Nothing Fails', co-written and recorded by Madonna.
