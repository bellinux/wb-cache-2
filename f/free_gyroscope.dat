40|$|A large-area Bragg {{spectrometer}} used {{to search}} for the Fe XXV X-ray emission lines of Sco X- 1 is described. The device has 3400 sq cm of LiF on nine crystal panels aligned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rocket. X rays satisfying the Bragg condition reflect into an array of nine companion proportional counters. A pointing system incorporating a <b>free</b> <b>gyroscope</b> with 2 degrees of freedom assures that target X rays are reflected at the required angle and produces repeated spectral scans of the X-ray continuum, which are later superimposed to correct temporal effects. The instrument is capable of detecting a narrow line flux from Sco X- 1 of about. 01 photons/sq cm/sec...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part {{explains}} development and history of the first Czechoslovak satellites Magion. Satellites Magion were developed for the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere research. The thesis describes the beginning of the project, Magion's technical data, its construction problems and interesting details from the background of the project. The second part of this thesis explains the Magion stabilization by its rotation, where properties of a <b>free</b> <b>gyroscope</b> are used. The text is written for students at secondary schools and also for their teachers. Because of it, everything is explained without using differential or integral calculus. The whole explanation is structured continuously, it supposes only basic knowledge, begins from the movement on the circle, continues through moments of inertia and angular momentum and ends by explanation of a free movement of the gyroscope. The whole theory is illustrated by stabilization of the satellite Magion 4 and by the experiments made during the project...|$|E
40|$|The target {{tracking}} system of an IR (InfraRed) guided missile is constantly subjected to disturbances {{due to the}} linear and angular motion of the missile. To diminish these LOS (Line Of Sight) disturbances the seeker of the missile can be built from a <b>free</b> <b>gyroscope</b> mounted in a very low friction suspension. The ability of the spinning gyroscope to maintain its direction relative to an inertial frame is used to stabilize the seeker LOS while tracking a target. The tracking velocity of the seeker, i. e. its angular velocity, is controlled by a feedback control unit where the signal from the IR detector is used as input. The electrical driven actuator consists {{of a set of}} coils and a magnet on the gyroscope. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a real-time model of the seeker gyroscope in an existing IR MANPAD (MAN Portable Air Defense) missile. The aim is a model that is able to simulate the real system with consideration to the tracking velocity. The model should also be integrated into a hybrid simulator environment. With relatively good knowledge of the system and its subsystems an initial physical modelling approach was used where elementary equations and accepted relations were assembled to describe the mechanism of the subsystems. This formed the framework of the model and gave a good foundation for further modelling. By using experimentation and more detailed system knowledge the initial approach could be developed and modified. Necessary approximations were made and unknown parameters were determined through system identification methods. The model was implemented in MATLAB Simulink. To make it suitable for real-time operation Real-Time Workshop was used. The model design was evaluated in simulations where the tracking performance could be tested for different positions of the gyroscope. The results where satisfying and showed that the model was able to reproduce the output of the system well considering the speed of the model and the approximations made. One important reason that good results can be achieved with a relatively simple model is that the seeker is limited to small rotations. The model can be tuned to operate in a smaller range and the complexity can be kept low. A weakness of the model is that the output error increases for wide angles...|$|E
25|$|The V-2 was {{guided by}} four {{external}} rudders on the tail fins, and four internal graphite vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. The LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two <b>free</b> <b>gyroscopes</b> (a horizontal and a vertical) for lateral stabilization, and a PIGA accelerometer to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and azimuth to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.|$|R

The {{mechanism}} of piezoelectric transformers for producing high voltage is {{incorporated into a}} ceramic beam bimorph piezoelectric gyroscope for generating high voltage sensing signal. For {{the analysis of the}} gyroscope, one-dimensional equations of beam piezoelectric bimorphs are derived from the three-dimensional equations of linear piezoelectricity. The equations are employed in the analysis of the bimorph <b>gyroscope.</b> <b>Free</b> and forced vibration solutions are obtained showing high voltage sensitivity. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Simplify the {{gyro rotor}} {{into a hollow}} disk, each {{particle}} in the disk circular motion around the z axis with High speed. At same time, it around y axis rotation follows the disc. That is, the disk does not rotation, but each particle in the rotor circular motion relative to the disk, at the same time, it rotate with the angular velocity Ï‰ follows the disc. On {{the basis of the}} simplified model, apply the knowledge on the synthetic movement of theoretical mechanics; research each particle acceleration in the gyro rotor. Then according to the Newton's law to analysis the force situation of each particle in the rotor, to reveal the mechanical essence of nutation and precession characteristics of the Gyro rotor. Then, according to the situation of the applied forces on each particle in the rotor, reveal mechanics essence of nutation and precession characteristics of the gyro. Characteristics of the Gyro After a high-speed <b>free</b> rotating <b>gyroscope</b> transient is disturbed, its axis deviation. But after the deviation from the axis of rotation for a period of time, the rotation shaft gradually returned to the pre disturbance location. If applying a couple in a free rotating gyro rotor, not as people imagine, the rotor will produce rotation around perpendicular vectors applied couple axis. Above two phenomena known as the nutation and precession are strange. However, how it happened? What i...|$|R
