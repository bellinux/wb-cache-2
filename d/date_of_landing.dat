In the study I develop and test approaches for semi-automatically identifying the type and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> cover and land use change from multi-temporal series of Landsat ETM+ imagery from 2000 to 2014. Clouds, cloud shadows, and scan line corrector-off creates missing or null data in the ETM+ images.

The general approach is to conduct a per-pixel supervised classification on each <b>date</b> <b>of</b> image after masking null data based on stable training sites. Spatial, temporal, and logical filters are applied to correct for misclassification and missing data. Each image is classified into three general classes: Built, Natural Vegetation, and Agricultural, with expansion of Built being our main focus. Reference data for Change-to-Built were independently selected from all available high spatial resolution satellite images, and the beginning time of change was recorded. The change product was used to characterize the urban expansion around Accra.

40|$|Land cover changes {{significantly}} influence vegetation greenness {{in different}} regions. Dense Landsat time series stacks provide {{unique opportunity to}} analyze land cover change and vegetation greenness trends at finer spatial scale. In the past three decades, large reclamation activities have greatly changed land cover and vegetation growth of coastal areas. However, rarely has research investigated these frequently changed coastal areas. In this study, Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series (1984 – 2016) data and the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend algorithm were used to detect the intensity and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> abrupt changes in a typical coastal area—Hangzhou Bay, China. The prior and posterior <b>land</b> cover categories <b>of</b> each change were classified using phenology information through a Random Forest model. The impacts <b>of</b> <b>land</b> cover change on vegetation greenness trends of the inland and reclaimed areas were analyzed through distinguishing gradual and abrupt changes. The {{results showed that the}} intensity and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> cover change were detected successfully with overall accuracies of 88. 7 % and 86. 1 %, respectively. The continuous land cover dynamics were retrieved accurately with an overall accuracy of 91. 0 % for ten land cover classifications. Coastal reclamation did not alleviate local cropland occupation, but prompted the vegetation greenness of the reclaimed area. Most of the inland area showed a browning trend. The main contributors to the greenness and browning trends were also quantified. These findings will help the natural resource management community generate better understanding of coastal reclamation and make better management decisions...|$|R

40|$|The family Lumbricidae {{is arguably}} the most {{well-known}} and well-studied earthworm group due to its dominance in the European earthworm fauna and its invasion in temperate regions worldwide. However, its North American members, especially the genus Bimastos Moore, 1893, are poorly understood. We revised the systematics of the genus Bimastos and tested the hypothesis of the monophyly of North American lumbricids using morphological characters and eight molecular markers. Phylogenetic analyses based on our extensive sampling of Bimastos and inclusion of Dendrodrilus and Allolobophoridella indicated a well-supported clade containing Bimastos and Eisenoides Gates, 1969, and provided the first evidence supporting that North American lumbricids are monophyletic. Assuming the available divergence time estimations and <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> bridges are correct, it would suggest that the ancestor of this clade arrived North America through Beringia or the De Geer route during Late Cretaceous, and since then the clade has diverged from its Eurasian sister group, Eisenia. The peregrine genera Dendrodrilus and Allolobophoridella are nested within the Bimastos clade; we propose to treat them as junior synonyms of the genus Bimastos, and, contradictory to the commonly held belief of being European, they are indeed part of the indigenous North American earthworm fauna. Morphological characters, such as red-violet pigmentation, proclinate U-shaped nephridial bladders and calciferous diverticula in segment 10 further support this placement. The East Mediterranean-Levantine Spermophorodrilus Bouché, 1975 and Healyella Omodeo & Rota, 1989 are nested within the Dendrobaena sensu lato clade; therefore their close relationship with the North American Bimastos is refuted. Species fit the revised diagnosis of Bimastos are reviewed and keyed, and a new species, Bimastos schwerti sp. nov., is described...|$|R

50|$|Land {{known as}} the Hill of Ardgith was sold by Isobel Moffat to Thomas Kennedy in 1413.

40|$|Lord Howe Island is a small, mid-ocean {{volcanic}} and carbonate {{island in}} the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Skeletal carbonate eolianite and beach calcarenite on the island are divisible into two formations based on lithostratigraphy. The Searles Point Formation comprises eolianite units bounded by clay-rich paleosols. Pore-filling sparite and microsparite are the dominant cements in these eolianite units, and recrystallised grains are common. Outcrops exhibit karst features such as dolines, caves and subaerially exposed relict speleothems. The Neds Beach Formation overlies the Searles Point Formation and consists of dune and beach units bounded by weakly developed fossil soil horizons. These younger deposits are characterised by grain-contact and meniscus cements, with patchy pore-filling micrite and mirosparite. The calcarenite comprises several disparate successions that contain a record of up to 7 discrete phases of deposition. A chronology is constructed based on U/Th ages of speleothems and corals, TL ages of dune and paleosols, AMS 14 C and amino acid racemization (AAR) <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> snails and AAR whole-rock <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> eolianite. These data indicate dune units and paleosols of the Searles Point Formation were emplaced during oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 7 and earlier in the Middle Pleistocene. Beach units of the Neds Beach Formation were deposited during OIS 5 e while dune units were deposited during two major phases, the first coeval with or shortly after the beach units, the second later during OIS 5 (e. g. OIS 5 a) when the older dune and beach units were buried. Large-scale exposures and morphostratigraphical features indicate much of the carbonate was emplaced as transverse and climbing dunes, with the sediment source located seaward of and several metres below the present shoreline. The lateral extent and thickness of the eolianite deposits contrast markedly with the relatively small modern dunes. These features indicate that a slight fall (2 - 10 m) in sea level {{may be required to}} mobilise relatively large volumes of sediment onto the island. The stratigraphy of the calcarenite, combined with the shallow depth of the platform surrounding the island (30 - 50 m present water depth) and the geochronological data, suggest that cycles of carbonate deposition on the island are linked to interglacial and interstadial periods of high or falling sea level...|$|R
40|$|The 1950 s {{excavations}} by Charles McBurney in the Haua Fteah, a large karstic cave on {{the coast}} of northeast Libya, revealed a deep sequence of human occupation. Most subsequent research on North African prehistory refers to his discoveries and interpretations, but the chronology of its archaeological and geological sequences has been based on very early age determinations. This paper reports on the initial results of a comprehensive multi-method dating program undertaken as part of new work at the site, involving radiocarbon <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> charcoal, <b>land</b> snails and marine shell, cryptotephra investigations, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> sediments, and electron spin resonance (ESR) <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> tooth enamel.

Despite problems of sediment transport and reworking, using a Bayesian statistical model the new dating program establishes a robust framework for the five major lithostratigraphic units identified in the stratigraphic succession, and for the major cultural units.
