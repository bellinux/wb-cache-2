5|$|Whether it be a {{depression}} in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, {{the lack of a}} surface <b>focus</b> <b>will</b> prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10m/s (20kn, 33ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the SEC is {{adopting}} amendments {{designed to}} make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Additionally, stress testing will be required and a key <b>focus</b> <b>will</b> {{be placed on the}} funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least 10%. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{youth of}} this field {{means there is}} still much progress to be made in characterizing all modifications to the transcriptome and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Once these questions are answered and biologists have a better sense of the amount of variation in RNA modification, the <b>focus</b> <b>will</b> turn to each modification’s biological function. This has already been investigated in a select few proteins such as adenosine deaminase, which acts on RNA (ADAR). ADAR has been shown to affect antibody production and the innate immune system as well as transcripts encoding important receptors for the central nervous system. This plurality in function has caused some scientists to speculate that the epitransciptome may be even more expansive than the better defined epigenome.|$|E
