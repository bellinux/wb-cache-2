2500|$|Estimates {{state that}} 85% of {{tetrachloroethylene}} produced is {{released into the}} atmosphere; while models from OECD assumed that 90% is released {{into the air and}} 10% to water. Based on these models, its distribution in the environment is estimated to be in the air (76.39% - 99.69%), water (0.23% - 23.2%), soil (0.06-7%), with the remainder in the sediment and biota. Estimates of lifetime in the atmosphere vary, but a 1987 survey estimated the lifetime in the air to be about 2 months in the Southern Hemisphere and 5–6 months in the Northern Hemisphere.

50|$|A sample <b>dechlorination</b> of {{chlorinated}} {{aliphatic hydrocarbons}} (CAHs) such as tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene or PCE) by Dehalococcoides ethenogenes has been illustrated above. PCE {{is one of}} the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of aerobic degradation. The high electronegative character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H2 is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids. Moreover, due to competition from methanogens for H2, low H2 concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass. While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the <b>dechlorination</b> reactions-PCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE-RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE-RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal ion cluster like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle. Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces PCE into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to vinyl chloride (VC) and ethene are performed by TCE-RDase. The <b>dechlorination</b> of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than <b>dechlorination</b> of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction. The rate of reductive <b>dechlorination</b> is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms. In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as Desulfomonile, Dehalobacter, Desulfuromonas...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the Dehalococcoides group can perform the complete reductive <b>dechlorination</b> from PCE to ethene.|$|E

50|$|The {{three main}} paths of {{exposure}} to toxaphene are ingestion, inhalation, and absorption. For humans, {{the main source of}} toxaphene exposure is through ingested seafood. When toxaphene enters the body, it usually accumulates in fatty tissues.

50|$|In many instances, {{microbiological}} reductive <b>dechlorination</b> of chlorinated {{organic molecules}} {{is important for}} bioremediation of polluted groundwater. One particularly important example for public health is the organochloride respiration of the dry-cleaning solvent, tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and the engine degreasing solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) by naturally occurring anaerobic bacteria, often members of the candidate genera Dehalococcoides. Bioremediation of these chloroethenes can occur when other microorganisms at the contaminated site provide H2 as a natural byproduct of various fermentation reactions. The dechlorinating bacteria use this H2 as their electron donor, ultimately replacing chlorine atoms in the chloroethenes with hydrogen atoms via hydrogenolytic reductive <b>dechlorination.</b> If the soil and groundwater contain enough organic electron donor and the appropriate strains of Dehalococcoides, this process can proceed until all of the chlorine atoms are removed, and TCE is dechlorinated completely via dichloroethene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) to ethene, a harmless end-product.|$|E
50|$|Pathway A {{represents}} direct {{electron transfer}} (ET) for Fe0 to the adsorbed halocarbon (RX) at the metal/water point of contact, resulting in <b>dechlorination</b> {{and production of}} Fe2+.

Pathway C shows that H2 from the anaerobic corrosion of Fe2+ might react with RX if a catalyst is present.|$|E
50|$|The {{possible}} interference between ATES and chlorinated ethenes has been also {{seen as an}} opportunity of integration of sustainable energy technology and sustainable groundwater management. The combination of ATES and enhanced bioremediation first introduced in the “More with SubSurface Energy” (Meer met Bodemenergie, MMB) project in the Netherlands in 2009. Several scientific and practical rationales are the basics for seeing such combination as a promising possibility. Increased temperature around the warm well can enhance reductive <b>dechlorination</b> of chlorinated ethenes. Although low temperature in cold well can hamper the biodegradation, the seasonal operation of ATES can transfer contaminant from cold well to hot well for faster biodegradation. Such seasonal groundwater transportation can also homogenize the environmental condition. ATES {{can be used as}} a biostimulation too, for example to inject electron donor or microorganism needed for reductive <b>dechlorination.</b> Finally, the life time of ATES (30 years) fits the long duration of in situ bioremediation.|$|E

50|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction of chlorinated chemicals such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{can be carried}} out by electrolysis in appropriate solvents, such as mixtures of water and alcohol.

For instance, the reductive <b>dechlorination</b> of CFCs is complete and produces several HFCs plus chloride.|$|E
50|$|Chlorendic acid is {{slightly}} {{soluble in water}} and nonpolar organic solvents (e.g. benzene, hexane, carbon tetrachloride). It is easily soluble in slightly polar organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, acetone). When heated, it loses water at 200 °C, forming an anhydride with melting point of 230-235 °C. When subject to pyrolysis, it decomposes to hydrochloric acid and various chlorinated compounds. It is resistant to hydrolytic <b>dechlorination.</b> It readily forms salts with metals, and esters.|$|E
50|$|Using low {{temperature}} heating coupled with bioremediation, chemical oxidation, or <b>dechlorination</b> {{will result in}} increased reaction rates.
