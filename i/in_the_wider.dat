5|$|Although {{it could}} not be {{considered}} a large air arm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge {{at one time or another}} some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The book {{presents}} an in-depth analysis and refutation {{of climate change}} denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change.

They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E

5|$|The legendary herb {{has entered}} the modern Bulgarian {{vocabulary}} {{as a metaphor for}} a magic key or a panacea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ „da namerish razkovnicheto“) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or difficult one. Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Quiriguá was occupied {{as early as the}} Late Preclassic (400BC AD200). Although no structures have been securely dated to this period, a number of Late Preclassic artifacts have been recovered, including 63figurines and a chert blade. Early Classic ceramics from Quiriguá are similar to finds at both Copán and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, while jade hunchback figurines from the same period resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands. These early finds demonstrate the participation of Quiriguá <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> southeastern Maya region from the Late Preclassic onwards.|$|E

5|$|During the 7th century AD, Motul de San José is {{recorded}} in hieroglyphic inscriptions {{as being a}} vassal of Calakmul. By the early 8th century the city had switched its allegiance to Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, king of Tikal, then falling under the power of Petexbatún, itself a vassal of Calakmul, {{in the middle of}} the 8th century, before once again switching its allegiance to Tikal. In 711, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, Lord of Tikal, was recorded as overlord of Motul, perhaps reflecting Tikal's traditional overlordship of the city. In spite of these shifting alliances, Motul de San José acted with a degree of independence and was a powerful kingdom in the 8th century AD, with its ruler using the kaloomte title given to high kings. The city's rulers became very successful on the political scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> Maya region, with the use of politically motivated feasting, war, economics and political marriages.|$|E
5|$|Gaza {{experienced}} destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces {{captured the}} city. Gaza grew {{significantly in the}} first half of the 20th century under Mandatory rule. The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Gaza became a center of political resistance during the First Intifada, and under the Oslo Accords of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established Palestinian Authority. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008–2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks.|$|E

Importantly for the coming battle, the 4th Krajina Division of the 5th Corps was deployed between Bihać and Bosanski Petrovac. Two brigades of the 4th Krajina Division and one brigade from the 39th Krajina Division formed a defensive arc north of Drvar, running from Bihać through Krupa to Sanski Most. The 9th Dalmatian Division of the 8th Corps was deployed to the south between Livno and Bosansko Grahovo.|$|E

When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States.
