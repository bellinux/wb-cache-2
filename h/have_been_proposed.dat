Additive embedding strategy by combining histogram shifting technique [24] and bilinear interpolation prediction <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed</b> by Chen et al. in [25, 26].|$|R

5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proposed.</b> Sometimes, repeated testing may be helpful.|$|E
