5|$|In the <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> {{highways}} {{that is the}} Genesee County seat, NY33 crosses {{and briefly}} overlaps with not only NY5, the other east–west route in town, but both north–south routes, NY63 and NY98. While concurrent with NY98 on Oak Street Extension, NY33 passes over Tonawanda Creek, which travels through Batavia on a roughly northwest–southeast alignment. The brief overlap with NY98 ends at Main Street, which carries NY5 and NY63 through the western portion of the city. NY33 turns east here, overlapping with NY5 and NY63 for five blocks along the four-lane, mostly commercial Main Street. NY63 leaves in downtown Batavia at Ellicott Street; however, NY5 and NY33 continue to follow Main Street {{through much of the}} city's eastern half.|$|E
5|$|M36 (NGC 1960) {{is a young}} galactic {{open cluster}} with {{approximately}} 60 stars, {{most of which are}} relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments. It is at a distance of 3,900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide. Its apparent diameter is 12.0 arcminutes. Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its brightest stars are approximately 9th magnitude. It was discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, the first of Auriga's major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> bright stars in its center, anchored by Struve 737, a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are B type stars with rapid rates of rotation. M36's Trumpler class is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster's other stars appear in smaller knots and groups.|$|E

25|$|This process, {{also known}} as the {{measured}} drop, was introduced to Britain in 1872 by William Marwood as a scientific advance on the standard drop. Instead of everyone falling the same standard distance, the person's height and weight were used to determine how much slack would be provided in the rope so that the distance dropped would be enough to ensure that the neck was broken, but not so much that the person was decapitated. The careful placement of the eye or <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> the noose (so that the head was jerked back as the rope tightened) contributed to breaking the neck.|$|E
25|$|On {{the initial}} autopsy report in 1950, doctors {{concluded}} that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows {{in the skin}} beneath his chin and {{at the sides of}} his neck. There was no mark, however, {{at the back of the}} neck where the <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.|$|E
