50|$|To start {{placement}}, the tremie pipe {{is first}} lowered into position. Air and water {{must be kept}} out of the tremie during placement by keeping the pipe full of concrete at all times. This is facilitated if the hopper capacity is at least equal to the volume of the pipe. When initially charging the tremie a wad of empty cement bags or a foam rubber pug known as a pig may be stuffed into the pipe to keep the flow under control while the first concrete forces the plug down the pipe and displaces the water. The pig will float out and rise to the surface. The <b>discharge</b> <b>opening</b> must be kept well immersed in the placed concrete, allowing flow from within the placement. 1.5 m of embedment should be maintained as a minimum if pssible. This can be measured by finding the level of the concrete surface below th top of the pipe with a weighted tape and subtracting from the known length of the tremie. It is critically important to concrete quality that the tremie discharge remains well embedded in the concrete. As the pour progresses if flow slows or stops, the <b>discharge</b> <b>opening</b> is raised so that the head in the pipe can maintain flow. Continuous flow is desirable if possible.|$|E

Furthermore, the effect of the discharging methods at the broiler farm on the physical quality of pellets using MEP as a method of analysis was evaluated. The first phase of the experiment was a randomized block with six treatments: A - pellets at the end of the pelletizer machine; B - pellets inside the truck; C - truck's discharging at the feed silo; D - place inside the warehouse after the feed silo; E - the middle of the feed plate line and F - the end of the feed plate line.

40|$|Royal Boskalis Westminster nv is an {{international}} group with a leading {{position in the world}} market for dredging services. In most practical cases a jet installation or a big discharge aperture is used for the fast unloading of a load of sand. When a relative small <b>discharge</b> <b>opening,</b> without the use of a jet installation, is used to unload a hopper, the unloading time will increase. Uncertain is how much longer this type of unloading will take and what kind of mechanisms {{play a crucial role in}} this unloading procedure. The goal of this study is to analyse and describe this unloading process. An attempt is made to model the processes in such a way that an estimation can be made for the unloading time. During this research two sets of experiments were executed, the preliminary and the main experiments, each with a different experiment set-up, to obtain more insight in the unloading process. The goal of both sets of experiments was to get a two dimensional view on the sand-water-processes above the <b>discharge</b> <b>opening.</b> The most important parameters which are varied during the experiments are the width of the <b>discharge</b> <b>opening</b> (wdo) and the height of the sand at the start of the unloading process. Out of the preliminary and main experiment comes the qualitative description of the unloading process in time: 1. Coming into existence of a dome. 2. The failure of the dome. 3. Fluidization of sand mass. 4. Break through of water through the sand-water mixture 5. Breaching of sand from the walls at both sides of the <b>discharge</b> <b>opening.</b> For two components out of the unloading process a first set-up for a quantitative model is made with as final goal a good prediction of the total unloading time of a barge.

Knowledge of mechani-cal properties of food powders is essential for design of industrial equipment, efficient and reliable material processing {{as well as for}} estimation of quality of raw material (MOLENDA, STASIAK 2002). The knowledge of physical properties of food powders is also important for quality assessment of final product on-line as well as during later storage, handling and transport. Flow properties of powders influence handling and processing operations, such as flow from silos and hoppers, transportation, mixing, compaction and packaging (KNOWLTON et al. 1994). Two basic patterns of the flow in silos can be distinguished: mass flow and funnel flow (KNOWLTON et al. 1994; FITZPATRICK et al. 2003; JENIKE 1964; SCHWEDES 1996). During mass flow all the powder is in motion and moving downward towards the <b>discharge</b> <b>opening</b> while for funnel flow powder discharge through a flow channel formed within the grain bulk and no sliding along the wall is present.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that ac {{discharges}} propagating at an air / dielectric interface, though of planar structure, behave, till a critical voltage Vcrit, as corona discharges {{in an air}} gap, with similar propagation fields for the filamentary discharge components and similar glow components. This leads to consider the surface discharges as gas discharges propagating above the dielectric surface. Beyond Vcrit, the retention of charges by the dielectric surface becomes ineffective, due to the gas heating in the filamentary channels and to the heat subsequently transferred from these channels to the surface. In return, the surface gives its energy excess back to the <b>discharge,</b> so <b>opening</b> the way, on the surface, to leader-like discharges of higher conductivity, needing about 10 times lower fields to propagate. Key words: surface discharge, gas/surface interface, discharge propagation, surface modification. 1. INTRODUCTIVE BACKGROUND Lichtenberg {{was the first in}} 1778 [1] to report observations on surface discharges. His approach consisted in sprinkling a mixture of two powders on dielectric surfaces after exposure to the discharge: red lead oxide positively charged (thus attracted by the negative charges of the surface), and yellow sulphur powder negatively charge...|$|R
40|$|Downstream {{migration}} and plasma thyroxine (T 4) levels in hatchery reared chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, fry were investigated {{late in the}} migration season. Groups of 1. 7. 6. 7 million fry were <b>discharged</b> by <b>opening</b> gates of the raceways at 09 : 30 h for a daytime release and at 18 : 30 h for a nighttime release experiments. A peak {{in the number of}} migrating fry and T 4 surge were detected simultaneously, 1. 1. 5 h after the release in the daytime release. In nighttime release, the peak of T 4 surge occurred 3 h after the release, and the number of the migrating fry peaked 8 h and 11 h after the release. In dark treatment, although the control group showed peaks within 2 h of the gate opening, the downstream migration of the dark-treated fish was repressed in daytime and small number of migrating fish was observed 3 h and 10 h after the gate opening, These results suggest that darkness represses the onset of downstream migration in chum fry late in the migration season, and the T 4 surge is not related to the onset of downstream migration during the night...|$|R
