5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation <b>has</b> <b>problems</b> for elements {{with more}} than 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements {{with more than}} 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron; however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E

5000|$|When EQ-5D {{was first}} developed, the scale {{used in the}} health state {{description}} part was three-level; <b>having</b> no <b>problems,</b> <b>having</b> some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as [...] "I <b>have</b> no <b>problems</b> in walking about", [...] "I <b>have</b> some <b>problems</b> in walking about", and [...] "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates <b>having</b> no <b>problems</b> for 1, <b>having</b> some <b>problems</b> for 2, and <b>having</b> extreme <b>problems</b> for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (<b>having</b> no <b>problems</b> in all dimensions) to 33333 (<b>having</b> extreme <b>problems</b> in all dimensions). 12321 indicates <b>having</b> no <b>problems</b> in mobility and anxiety/depression, <b>having</b> slight <b>problems</b> in self-care and pain/discomfort, and <b>having</b> extreme <b>problems</b> in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states.|$|R

25|$|Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or {{receptive}} aphasia {{in which the}} patient's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact syntax and grammar, but the patient <b>has</b> <b>problems</b> with the selection of nouns.

As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate {{if they try to}} replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).|$|E
