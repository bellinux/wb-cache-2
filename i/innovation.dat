Design management can help to improve <b>innovation</b> management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking <b>innovation,</b> by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide The Power Inquiry - an {{independent}} inquiry into Britain's democracy - with details and assessments of democratic <b>innovations</b> that might increase and deepen citizen participation in the political decision-making process. The study analyses fifty-seven different <b>innovations</b> – eleven of these are considered in more depth in case studies. The <b>innovations</b> are assessed according to the following criteria: selection mechanism, form of involvement, role in decision-making, scale and transferability, and resource implications.

25|$|Measuring <b>innovation</b> is {{inherently}} {{difficult as it}} implies commensurability so that comparisons {{can be made in}} quantitative terms. <b>Innovation,</b> however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service. Nevertheless, Edison et al. in their review of literature on <b>innovation</b> management found 232 <b>innovation</b> metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the <b>innovation</b> process, output from the <b>innovation</b> process, effect of the <b>innovation</b> output, measures to access the activities in an <b>innovation</b> process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{dimensions}} of <b>innovation</b> were degree of novelty (patent) (i.e. whether an <b>innovation</b> {{is new to}} the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and type of <b>innovation</b> (i.e. whether it is process or product-service system <b>innovation).</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} <b>innovation,</b> only now {{becoming}} widely recognized, is end-user <b>innovation.</b> This is where an agent (person or company) develops an <b>innovation</b> {{for their own}} (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. MIT economist Eric von Hippel has identified end-user <b>innovation</b> as, by far, {{the most important and}} critical in his classic book on the subject, The Sources of <b>Innovation.</b>|$|E
30|$|Environmental <b>innovations</b> tend {{to provide}} {{decreased}} {{costs more than}} social <b>innovations.</b> Social <b>innovations</b> tend to provide public recognition or awards more than environmental <b>innovations.</b> They also provide more education for employees though the difference is not as pronounced. These findings show that, {{in addition to an}} increase in revenue/sales for both types of <b>innovations,</b> environmental <b>innovations</b> provide more tangible benefits to SME’s than social <b>innovations</b> while social <b>innovations</b> provide less tangible but perhaps more visible and direct internal benefits than environmental ones. This suggests that SME’s looking to produce cost effective outcomes may want to explore environmental <b>innovations</b> but those looking to increase their public image may want to explore social <b>innovations.</b> This conclusion may change with a further refinement of the “increased revenue/sales” theme.|$|R
30|$|Already, Teece (1980) {{raised the}} {{question}} of whether the diffusion of organizational <b>innovations</b> is characterized by the same considerations as the diffusion of technical <b>innovations,</b> and if so, it might be possible to re-use lessons from the area of the diffusion of technical <b>innovations.</b> However, organizational <b>innovations</b> have some intrinsic features that are quite different from those of technical <b>innovations</b> (Alänge et al. 1998). Organizational <b>innovations</b> are more tacit in nature than technical innovations; there is no traditional market for organizational <b>innovations,</b> and no traditional calculation model for calculating return on investment for organizational <b>innovations.</b> Further, although organizational <b>innovations</b> commonly affect the daily work situation of many people in an organization, companies rarely have a formal position or formal strategies in place for organizational <b>innovations</b> as they would an R&D manager and R&D strategies for technical <b>innovations.</b> As a result, the market mechanisms function poorly, the search and learning processes may be less conscious and systematic, standardization of the <b>innovations</b> is based on subjective interpretations of early adopters, and top management commitment and the process of intra-firm diffusion of organizational <b>innovations</b> become more important than in the case of technical <b>innovations.</b>|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{diffusion}} of organizational <b>innovations,</b> Alänge et al. (1998) have found that theories about diffusing technical <b>innovations</b> can also be applied to ideas about diffusing organizational <b>innovations.</b> However, the same study also {{identified a number of}} features intrinsic to organizational <b>innovations</b> that are quite different from those of technical <b>innovations.</b> These features are listed along two dimensions: their effects on the market for organizational <b>innovations</b> and their effects on the search and implementation processes. Regarding the market, organizational <b>innovations</b> are more tacit in nature than are technical <b>innovations.</b> There is no traditional market for organizational <b>innovations,</b> and there is no traditional model for calculating return on an investment in them. Further, regarding search and implementation processes, organizational <b>innovations</b> commonly affect the daily work situations of many people in a business. Nevertheless, companies rarely have a formal position or formal strategies in place for these <b>innovations</b> as they would for, say, the research and development of technical <b>innovations</b> (e.g., an R&D manager and R&D strategies for technical <b>innovations).</b> As a result, the market mechanisms function poorly, the search and learning processes may be less conscious and systematic, standardization of the <b>innovations</b> is based on the subjective interpretations of early adopters, and top management’s commitment and the process of the intrafirm diffusion of organizational <b>innovations</b> become more important than they are in the case of technical <b>innovations.</b>|$|R

25|$|For the {{political}} level, measures of <b>innovation</b> are {{more focused on}} {{a country or region}} competitive advantage through <b>innovation.</b> In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The OECD Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process <b>innovation.</b> Some people consider the Oslo Manual complementary to the Frascati Manual from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to <b>innovation,</b> and includes marketing and organizational <b>innovation.</b> These standards are used for example in the European Community <b>Innovation</b> Surveys.|$|E
30|$|An {{increase}} in revenue/sales {{was also the}} most frequently found internal benefit theme for social <b>innovations</b> (n[*]=[*] 54) but to a larger degree than for environmental <b>innovations</b> but this {{can be attributed to}} the greater number of overall internal benefits associated with social <b>innovations.</b> Social <b>innovations</b> constituted 55.7 % of all instances of increased revenue and/or sales. “Recognition” comprised almost a third (29 %) of the internal benefits for social <b>innovations</b> (n[*]=[*] 27), which made up 73 % of the instances of recognition resulting from social <b>innovations.</b> Further, for “Education”, all instances of this theme showed up among social <b>innovations</b> even though this theme only represented 9 % of all the internal benefits for social <b>innovations.</b> No environmental <b>innovations</b> were associated with the “Education” theme.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the dynamical framework which combines product and process <b>innovations.</b> The model {{contributes to the}} theoretical literature on <b>innovations</b> in two ways. First, it permits for the simultaneous dynamics of both types of <b>innovations</b> which is rarely considered in the literature. Second, the products being generated by the <b>innovations</b> are heterogeneous in their investment characteristics. This allows {{for the formation of}} the dynamic interdependency between both types of <b>innovations.</b> As a result the steady state levels of process <b>innovations</b> for each product are different and influence the dynamics of product <b>innovations</b> in turn. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} employment reactions of firms when environmental <b>innovations</b> have been carried out. It differentiates hereby between employment increases and decreases. The data stem from a telephone survey covering more than 1500 firms in five European countries that have introduced environmental <b>innovations</b> recently. Environmentally beneficial product and service <b>innovations</b> create jobs in contrast to process <b>innovations.</b> Employment changes occur {{in the wake of}} major <b>innovations</b> only and especially in small firms and firms with positive sales expectations. While <b>innovations</b> purely motivated by environmental goals tend not to have employment effects, cost reductions envisaged by environmental <b>innovations</b> reduce employment. We detect skill biased technological change of environmental <b>innovations.</b> Environmental <b>innovations</b> have a small but positive effect on employment on the firm level. Thus, environmental support programmes do not counteract labour market policy. A further shift from end-of-pipe technologies to cleaner production, especially towards product and service <b>innovations,</b> would be beneficial for the environment and creates jobs.

30|$|The {{correlation}} between family <b>innovations</b> to math and family <b>innovations</b> to reading is 0.73, {{indicating that the}} time-varying family environment has a similar effect on a student’s cognitive development across subjects. I also find positive relationships between family <b>innovations</b> to achievement and family <b>innovations</b> to educational time use. In other words, time-varying family factors that lead to increases in homework time and free reading also lead to increases in test scores. By the same token, family <b>innovations</b> that lead to decreases in educational time use tend to lead to decreases in test scores. The relationship between family <b>innovations</b> to free reading and family <b>innovations</b> to reading scores (ρ= 0.27) is stronger than the relationship between family <b>innovations</b> to free reading and family <b>innovations</b> to math scores (ρ= 0.19). Conversely, family <b>innovations</b> to homework time are more strongly associated with family <b>innovations</b> to math scores (ρ= 0.24) compared to reading scores (ρ= 0.21).
