50|$|The {{outlet tower}} {{consists}} of a granite faced <b>dry</b> <b>shaft</b> that houses a 54 in diameter vertical pipe, with draw-off pipes at four different levels. The {{lower end of the}} standpipe is connected to a 50 in diameter steel outlet conduit.|$|E
50|$|Shafts can be sunk either dry or for {{methods such as}} the caisson method {{they can}} be sunk wet. Sinking a <b>dry</b> <b>shaft</b> means that any water that flows into the {{excavation}} is pumped out to leave no significant standing or flowing water {{in the base of}} the shaft. When wet sinking a shaft the shaft is allowed to flood and the muck is excavated out of the base of the shaft underwater using a grab {{on the end of a}} crane or similar excavation method. Because the shaft is flooded, the lining can not be constructed at the excavation level of the shaft so this method only suits methods where the lining is installed before shaft sinking (such as the use of sheet piles) or where the lining is sunk down with the shaft such as the caisson method.|$|E
5000|$|Long Drop Cave {{was known}} by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club by 1922, when S.W. Cutriss {{described}} it as: [...] "Long Drop Sink with the cave at the far end, a 10 foot passage leading to Long Drop itself, a perfect round <b>dry</b> <b>shaft,</b> 25 feet deep. There is no exit." [...] The {{bottom of the shaft}} was dug by Bob Leakey and Gordon Batty in the 1950s, but without breaking through. The challenge was then picked up by members of the Gritstone Club in 1965, who succeeded in digging down a little further to expose a tight crawl which proved to be the breakthrough point into the main cave. Humble Inlet was discovered by members of the Burnley Caving Club in 1981, when they climbed a 22 m high aven in High Stream Chamber. The end of the cave was connected to Death's Head Hole in 1981 by the Gritstone Club.|$|E
40|$|In CDQ (Coke <b>Dry</b> Quenching) <b>shaft,</b> the vent-cap {{with complex}} {{structure}} is {{installed in the}} cone-shaped funnel under the cooling chamber. Besides supporting the descending coke in the chamber, it acts to introduce cooling gas uniformly to reduce the temperature fluctuation of cokes at outlet and realize stable operation of CDQ apparatus and. In this paper, the turbulent flow in vent-cap of CDQ experimental shaft of 1 : 7 real scale is numerically simulated by using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software, CFX. The velocity field, the outlet flux distribution and the pressure drop factor of each outlet under three kinds of vent-cap (called high vent-cap, low vent-cap and elliptic vent-cap) are analysed and compared. The results turn out that the pressure drop factor of elliptic vent-cap is lager {{than the other two}} vent-caps, and that the pressure drop factors of high vent-cap and low vent-cap almost have the same value. While for a specified vent-cap, the pressure drop factor with pressing brick is lager than that without pressing brick. The work in this paper is some valuable for the designing of vent-cap for large-scale CDQ shaft...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the shallow}} {{workings}} were exhausted in the 1820s and 1830s.Steam-powered pumps {{were used to}} keep the mines <b>dry</b> as the <b>shafts</b> were sunk deeper.By the 1850s the mines employed several thousand men, women and children.The setts that became the Basset Mines were most profitable in the 1850s and 1860s, extracting copper.Production was cut {{back in the late}} 1860s when the price of copper declined, and some mines went below the copper lodes for tin.The tin deposits were deeper and the ores harder to dress than copper, and profits were lower.The Great Flat Lode was reached around 1872-74.This is a large tin deposit to the south of Carn Brea that is tilted at an average angle of about 32 degrees.Most lodes tilt at 60 degrees or more so the lode is relatively flat, hence the name.|$|R
5|$|Maiden Castle {{expanded}} westwards, and {{the ditch}} {{was extended to}} enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a <b>dry</b> valley. A <b>shaft</b> dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On {{the south of the}} fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} is below a small cliff in a shakehole. From the wide overhanging entrance, a short crawl leads onto an 8 m <b>dry</b> <b>shaft.</b> At the bottom, an excavated route leads {{into a narrow}} stream passage, with a narrow 5 m pitch a few metres downstream. Below this, about 20 m of narrow passage leads {{to the top of}} the third pitch, where the system enlarges dramatically. A 29 m pitch passes a ledge, and lands in Fault Chamber, where a vertical geological fault can be seen to have a 150 cm throw. A further 8 m pitch leads to a final chamber and a stream passage. Upstream, the water emerges from an impenetrable fissure, downstream passes through a low crawl before the going eases, passing under some avens. After 60 m the passage becomes a waterlogged tube which is normally sumped. This can be baled from the downstream end, to allow a through trip to Dolphin Passage in Death's Head Hole.|$|E
