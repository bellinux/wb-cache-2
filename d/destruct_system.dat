[...] estimates for SRB failure rates have ranged from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100,000. SRB assemblies have failed suddenly and catastrophically. Nozzle blocking or deformation can lead to overpressure or a reduction in thrust, while defects in the boosters casing or stage couplings can cause the assembly to break apart by increasing aerodynamic stresses. Additional failure modes include bore choking and combustion instability. Failure of an O-ring seal on the Space Shuttle Challengers right solid rocket booster led to its disintegration shortly after liftoff.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft {{designed}} for low-level use sometimes have ejection seats which fire through the canopy, as {{waiting for the}} canopy to be ejected is too slow. Many aircraft types (e.g., the BAE Hawk and the Harrier line of aircraft) use Canopy <b>Destruct</b> <b>systems,</b> which have an explosive cord (MDC - Miniature Detonation Cord or FLSC - Flexible Linear Shaped Charge) embedded within the acrylic plastic of the canopy. The MDC is initiated when the eject handle is pulled, and shatters the canopy over the seat a few milliseconds before the seat is launched. This system was developed for the Hawker Siddeley Harrier family of VTOL aircraft as ejection may be necessary while the aircraft was in the hover, and jettisoning the canopy might result in the pilot and seat striking it. This system is also used in the T-6 Texan II and F-35 Lightning II.|$|R

The RRS Program's mobile range instrumentation includes telemetry, radar, command and power systems. These mobile assets are used as needed to supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range ensuring safety and collection of data in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of mobile systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. Just 100 miles up the coast from where the Wright brothers first flew their airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orbital Sciences Corporation is planning to launch its new Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) system from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS), located at NASA GSFC's WFF. Orbital's COTS system design {{is based on the}} new Taurus II rocket with a liquid oxygen (LOX) /kerosene (RP- 1) first stage powered by two Aerojet AJ- 26 engines. The Taurus II second stage is ATK's Castor 30 solid propellant motor derived from their flight proven Castor 120. The spacecraft, known as Cygnus, is derived from Orbital's heritage DAWN and STAR spacecraft projects and International Space Station cargo carriers. The Program is driven by the retirement of the space shuttle, and the United States lacking domestic capability to send crew and cargo to the International Space Station. As a consequence, NASA faces a cargo resupply shortfall of 40 metric tons (approximately 88, 000 pounds) between 2011 and 2015 that cannot be met by international partners' space vehicles. Bermuda has {{played an important role in}} the United States space program since the 1960 s. The former NASA Tracking Station on Bermuda's Coopers Island had range safety systems for command and control, and Missile Instrumentation Precision Radars (MIPRs) providing exact vehicle position and slaving for command <b>destruct</b> <b>systems.</b> Telemetry systems supported scientific spacecraft and manned space flight (i. e., Apollo, Space Transportation System [STS], and Spacelab) with high gain antenna systems.

NASA instrumentation was removed in early 2000, and the property returned to the Government of Bermuda (GoB). This paper defines the process undertaken to secure an agreement with the GoB to establish a temporary tracking site and describes the technical approach and analysis conducted that justifies bringing Bermuda back as a critical NASA tracking site as it was during the Apollo era and the early years of the Space Shuttle.

50|$|Investigation quickly {{provided}} an {{anatomy of the}} failure.

Debris rained onto SLC-4E, badly damaging the launch complex in the process and starting numerous small fires, some of which burned for up to two days. Extracting launch personnel from the blockhouse proved difficult due to the area around the pad being filled with toxic fumes and burning debris. The right SRB had come down largely intact onto a concrete structure near the pad which fortunately had nobody inside it at the time of launch (the casing rupture had damaged the Inadvertent Separation <b>Destruct</b> <b>System</b> ISDS lanyards and prevented proper destruction of the SRB).|$|E

40|$|The {{sign and}} {{strength}} of magnetic interactions not only between nearest neighbors, but also for longer-range neighbors in the Cr 1 / 3 NbS 2 intercalation compound have been calculated {{on the basis of}} structural data. It has been found that left-handed spin helices in Cr 1 / 3 NbS 2 are formed from strength-dominant at low temperatures AFM interactions between triangular planes of Cr 3 + ions through the plane of just one of two crystallographically equivalent diagonals of side faces of embedded into each other trigonal prisms building up the crystal lattice of magnetic Cr 3 + ions. These helices are oriented along the c axis and packed into two-dimensional triangular lattices in planes perpendicular to these helices directions and lay one upon each other with a displacement. The competition of the above AFM helices with weaker inter-helix AFM interactions could promote the emergence of a long-period helical spin structure. One can assume that in this case the role of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction cosists in final ordering and stabilization of chiral spin helices into a chiral magnetic soliton lattice. The possibility of emergence of solitons in M 1 / 3 NbX 2 and M 1 / 3 TaX 2 (M = d-elements; X = S and Se) intercalate compounds has been examined. Two important factors caused by the crystal structure (predominantnchiral magnetic helices and their competition with weaker inter-helix interactions not <b>destructing</b> the <b>system</b> quasi-one-dimensional character) can be used for the crystal chemistry search of solitons.
