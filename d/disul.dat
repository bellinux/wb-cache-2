40|$|The {{amino acid}} Cysteine, which plays a signi amp; 64257;cant {{role as a}} charge {{transfer}} bridge, e. g. in redox proteins like Ferredoxin or Mo Nitrogenase and in arti amp; 64257;cial systems like Self Assembled Monolayers SAM s on gold, was adsorbed on both, natural and synthetic molybdenum <b>disul</b> amp; 64257;de and the changes were studied with combined photoelectrochemical and microwave conductivity techniques. In contrast to pyrite FeS 2, where modi amp; 64257;cation with cysteine enhances the electrochemical corrosion, with molybdenum <b>disul</b> amp; 64257;de {{this is not the}} case. It was found that cysteine chemically interacts with both dangling bonds of molybdenum on edge sites as well as with dz 2 orbitals of molybdenum that protrude through the van der Waals surface. The interaction with the edge sites leads to a decrease in dark current and hydrogen evolution activity. In inert electrolyte the interaction with the van der Waals surface leads to a decrease in decomposition photocurrents due to the action of cysteine as a recombination centre for charge carriers. If, however, a reducing agent such as hydroquinone quinone or hexacyanoferrate is added, photocurrents increase because the adsorbed cysteine now acts as charge transfer bridge and no longer as a recombination centre. This is supported by a signi amp; 64257;cantly increased microwave conductivity indicating increased charge carrier lifetim...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Oxidative stress {{involves}} {{the generation of}} a number of reactive species, among them ‘reactive oxygen species ’ and ‘reactive nitrogen species’. Recent reports have indicated that disulde-S-monoxides (thiosulnates) and disulde-S-dioxides (thiosulfonates) are formed under conditions of oxidative stress. We have now been able to demonstrate that these species are highly reactive and rapidly oxidise thi-ols. Glutathione and cysteine were oxidised to mixed disuldes by the action of <b>disul</b> de-S-oxides. Oxidative attack on the zinc/sulfur protein metallothionein with concomitant zinc release was readily accomplished by these ‘reactive sulfur species’ whereas hydrogen peroxide showed minimal zinc release...|$|E
40|$|The binuclear copper(II) complex [Cu_ 2 (RSSR) _ 2] (1), where RSSR is a dianionic Schiff base {{derived from}} 2 -(thioethyl) salicylaldimine having a {{disulfide}} bond is prepared, structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and its photo-induced DNA cleavage activity studied. The Schiff base ligand H_ 2 RSSR is also structurally characterized. The crystal structure of 1 shows the discrete dimeric {{nature of the}} complex with each metal showing square-planar geometry with a CuN 2 O 2 coordination (Cu Ċu, 5. 011 (1) A). The tetradentate Schiff base RSSR acts as a linker of two copper centers. The sulfur atoms in the <b>disul.</b> de unit do not show any apparent interaction with the metal ion. Complex 1, which is cleavage inactive in the dark {{in the presence of}} reducing agents, shows signi. cant cleavage of supercoiled pUC 19 DNA on exposure to UV light of 312 nm or visible light of different wavelengths under aerobic conditions, {{in the absence of any}} additives. DNA cleavage data from control experiments reveal involvement of the <b>disul.</b> de unit as a photosensitizer undergoing photo-induced S-S bond cleavage on exposure to UV light and the resulting species activates molecular oxygen to form singlet oxygen (^ 1 O_ 2) that causes DNA cleavage following a type-II process. Photo-induced DNA cleavage by 1 on red-light exposure using a Cwlaser of 632. 8 nm or a pulsed ruby laser of 694 nm is proposed to involve sul. de radicals in a type-I process and hydroxyl radicals as the reactive species...|$|E

The aim of the present work was to develop an analytical method for rapid diagnosis of EG poisoning and for monitoring EG removal by hemodlalysls. EG was measured by gas chromatography upon direct Injection of serum or urine samples (50 ILL diluted In 200 ptL of <b>disUlled</b> water containing 2, 3 -butanediol as Internal standard). A 2 -m x 2 -mm glass column with Chromosorb 101 (801100 mesh) separates these glycols within four minutes at 200 ~ using nitrogen as the carrier gas. The glycols 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -propanediol were separated from EG and the internal standard. Acetone, methanol, and isopropanol did {{not interfere with the}} analysis.

Plotting 1 /Vm(apparent) versus 1 /[NADPH] and 1 /[GSSG] yielded two lines with dierent slopes but intersecting at the same point on the y axis. A value of 26. 3 U/ml was calculated for Vm, and Km values of 25 and 71 M were determined for NADPH and GSSG, respectively.

40|$|Calcitriol, {{the active}} form of vitamin D 3, can {{regulate}} the gene expression through the binding {{to the nuclear}} receptor VDR, {{but it can also}} display nongenomic actions, acting through a membrane- associated receptor, which has been discovered as the <b>disul</b> de isomerase ERp 57. The aim of our research is to identify the binding sites for calcitriol in ERp 57 and to analyze their interaction. We rst studied the interaction through bioinformatics and uorimetric analyses. Subsequently, we focused on two protein mutants containing the predicted interaction domains with calcitriol: abb’- ERp 57, containing the rst three domains, and a’-ERp 57, the fourth domain only. To consolidate the achievements we used the calorimetric approach to the whole protein and its mutants. Our results allow us to hypothesize that the interaction with the a’ domain contributes {{to a greater extent than}} the other potential binding sites to the dissociation constant, calculated as a Kd of about 10 − 9 M...|$|E
40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} (CR) enhances {{longevity and}} mitigates aging phenotypes in numerous species. Physiological responses to CR are cell-type specific and variable throughout the lifespan. However, the mosaic of molecular changes responsible for CR benefits remains unclear, particularly in brain regions susceptible to deterioration during aging. We examined {{the influence of}} long-term CR on the CA 1 hippocampal region, a key learning and memory brain area that is vulnerable to age-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Through mRNA sequencing and NanoString nCounter analysis, we demonstrate that one year of CR feeding suppresses age-dependent signatures of 882 genes functionally associ-ated with synaptic transmission-related pathways, including calcium signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and Creb signaling in wild-type mice. By comparing the influence of CR on hippocampal CA 1 region transcriptional profiles at younger-adult (5 months, 2. 5 months of feeding) and older-adult (15 months, 12. 5 months of feeding) timepoints, we identify con-served upregulation of proteome quality control and calcium buffering genes, including heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 b (Hspa 1 b) and heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 (Hspa 5), protein <b>disul...</b>|$|E
40|$|The iodine-azide {{test was}} {{performed}} on the urine of workers exposed to carbon disulphide in a viscose factory. The exposure coefficient was determined before, during, and after the working time, and showed a good correlation with the exposure. Workers exposed to a high concentration of carbon disulphide could be divided in two groups. The first group showed normal values of the exposure coefficient before work but low values at the end. (The coefficient is inversely related to the exposure.) In the second group, the workers started work with slightly decreased values and ended with greatly decreased ones. We are pursuing this study to establish why recovery in the second group was not complete. Poisoning by carbon disulphide was first described {{in the middle of the}} last century and has remained an important problem ever since. Many papers have been published on the subject, dealing mostly with clinical aspects and often contradictory and con-fusing in the data they present.

40|$|The complex anion [Fe(CN) 5 (NO) ] 2 (nitroprusside) {{has been}} de fi ned intact using {{electrospray}} ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS), with minor daughter ions predictable {{fragments of the}} parent [Fe(CN) 5 NO] 2. Direct evidence for ion pairing of [Fe(CN) 5 NO] 2 with monovalent alkali metal and some alkylammonium cations was found independently using ESIMS and 13 C NMR techniques. The results {{are relevant to the}} signi fi cant in fl uence of the concentration and nature of cations on the solution equilibrium between nitroprusside with thiolates and their nitrosothiol adducts that presumably arises through charge reduction in tight ion pairs facilitating adduct formation. Ion-paired species M [Fe(CN) 5 NO] 2, M 3 [Fe(CN) 5 NO] and more complex clusters of the type M x [Fe(CN) 5 - NO] y z / z (up to x = 8 and y = 5) were observed by ESIMS. The trend in the ion pair formation seen by ESIMS follows the series Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs and Me 4 N > Et 4 N > Pr 4 N > Bu 4 N and is consistent with purely electrostatic expectations for unsolvated ions. Whereas the poorly solvated alkylammonium series bulk solution behaviour resembles that found by the ESI technique, the activity of alkali metal cations proceeds conversely, i. e. Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs, veri fi ed by a 13 C NMR study, because the hydrated cation radii {{play a crucial role in}} the bulk solution in those cases. Di ff erences in changes of the chemical shift upon addition of various cations points to the axial CN position as especially important for binding to these cations. Further, short-lived adducts with thiolates of the type M 3 [Fe(CN) 5 NO(C 4 H 4 O 4 S) ] 4 have been de fi ned by their observation in ESIMS directly and through their decomposition products, providing further support for reversible nitrosothiol complex formation. Mercapto- succinate ion pairing with cations, which would make formation of the proposed nitrosothiol complex easier, is also observed by ESIMS. The dithiolato complex K [Fe(CN) 5 NO(C 4 H 6 O 4 S) 2] 2, as well as the <b>disul</b> fi de anion radical were detected; both species are suggested intermediates in the spontaneous and autocatalyzed redox decomposition of the [Fe(CN) 5 N(O) SR] (n 2) complexes. The ESIMS study has thus provided information relevant to both thermodynamic and kinetic processes in a reaction where species of limited stability are involved...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 54 - 60). Last two decades {{have seen a}} phenomenal shift of the dimensionality paradigm in materials processing, from zero-dimensional nanoparticles and quantum dots to one-dimensional nanowires and nanotubes, to two-dimensional materials. Each above-mentioned category of the nanomaterial can be manipulated exclusively, and mentored to drive special properties. However, for each of them, it may take time to discover their true potential and proper application in contemporary technology. The emergence of graphene in 2004 triggered the scienti c community to turn their vision toward investigation of two-dimensional materials. The impact {{of the discovery of}} graphene with its rare characteristics was such huge that no subject had been studied in the past as much as two-dimensional materials have. Nowadays, there are brand new two-dimensional materials with more intriguing properties which no one could imagine. However, our current technology had developed based on bulk material, and it is not ready yet to accept the use of nanomaterials. Recent advances in nanoscale characterization opened up new opportunities for nanomaterials to be investigated so delicately. The other face of the discovery of nanomaterial is the need for ingenious fabrication method. Integration of electronic and optoelectronic circuits in con ned space {{is one of the top}} paid objectives in research and development. The goal is providing a faster computational speed, lower energy consumption, and reducing the size of these systems. Although this is a long-term plan, it is not farfetched once we connect the dots and think outside the box. Herein, we address synthesis, characterization, and manipulation of various two-dimensional materials. A thorough report on chemical vapor deposition of molybdenum <b>disul</b> de and tungsten diselenide is provided in this study. Besides this two material we encountered some anomalies in the behavior of an unknown two-dimensional material which we synthesized it in our lab. The next step is to establish novel methods in order to fabricate electronic devices supporting atomically-thin structures. We could formulate a straightforward method to assemble atomically thin ake of material on transmission electron microscope grid, compatible for microscopy of thin materials and adjustable for various characterization method including Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Last but not least, we introduced a novel method to induce mechanical strain on the two-dimensional ake. This method allows a dynamic scanning electron microscopy of the strained structure, which could be utilized for versatile applications. It worth to mention that, a fabrication process is mainly based on mentoring wet-transfer, focused ion beam, and electron beam lithography. by Mehdi Ramezani. M. S...|$|E
