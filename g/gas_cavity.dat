40|$|Magnesium {{materials}} are of increasing {{interest in the}} development of biodegradable implants as they exhibit properties that make them promising candidates. However, the formation of <b>gas</b> <b>cavities</b> after implantation of magnesium alloys has been widely reported in the literature. The composition of the gas and the concentration of its components in these cavities are not known as only a few studies using non-specific techniques were done about 60 years ago. Currently many researchers assume that these cavities contain primarily hydrogen because it is a product of magnesium corrosion in aqueous media. In order to clearly answer this question we implanted rare earth-containing magnesium alloy disks in mice and determined the concentration of hydrogen gas for up to 10 days using an amperometric hydrogen sensor and mass spectrometric measurements. We were able to directly monitor the hydrogen concentration over a period of 10 days and show that the <b>gas</b> <b>cavities</b> contained only a low concentration of hydrogen gas, even shortly after formation of the cavities. This means that hydrogen must be exchanged very quickly after implantation. To confirm these results hydrogen gas was directly injected subcutaneously.

Overall, our results disprove the common misbelief that these cavities mainly contain hydrogen and show how quickly this gas is exchanged with the surrounding tissue...|$|R
40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with compression moulding {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted Compression Moulding (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional compression moulding cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic mould tools were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash compression mould tool design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional positive plug compression mould tool with a vertical shear edge. This created a fixed volume mould tool, which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant <b>gas</b> <b>cavity.</b> The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful <b>gas</b> <b>cavity.</b> The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time.

40|$|Trapped {{gas pockets}} may cause severe {{operational}} problems in liquid piping systems. The {{severity of the}} resulting transients depends on the size and position of the trapped air pocket. Previous numerical simulations by the authors have indicated that a beat is possible to develop for ‘medium’ size air pockets. This paper investigates the beat phenomenon in detail, both theoretically and experimentally. Trapped air pockets are incorporated as boundary conditions (discrete gas cavities) into two distinct numerical solution schemes: (1) the method of characteristic scheme (MOC) and (2) a conservative solution scheme (CSS). The classical discrete <b>gas</b> <b>cavity</b> model (DGCM) allows gas cavities to form at computational sections in the MOC. A discrete <b>gas</b> <b>cavity</b> is governed by the water hammer compatibility equations, the continuity equation for the <b>gas</b> <b>cavity</b> volume, and the equation of state of an ideal gas. A novel CSS-based DGCM solves the system of unsteady pipe flow equations and respective state equations for four dependent variables (pressure, density, cross-sectional area, flow velocity) rather than two variables (pressure, flow velocity) in the classical MOC approach. In the MOC-based DGCM, the Courant number is equal to unity. This condition is difficult to fulfil (without using interpolations) in complex pipe networks without modification of wave speeds and/or pipe lengths. The CSS-based DGCM offers flexibility {{in the selection of}} computational time and space steps, however, the numerical weighting coefficients in the scheme should be carefully selected. Both models incorporate a convolution-based unsteady friction model. Experimental investigations of beat phenomena have been carried out in the University of Adelaide laboratory apparatus (reservoirpipeline- valve system). A trapped air pocket is captured at the midpoint of the pipeline in a specially designed device. The transient event is initiated by rapid closure of a side-discharge solenoid valve. Predicted and measured results are compared and discussed. It is shown that the fully-developed beat is strongly attenuated by unsteady friction and not so by steady friction...|$|E

[1 – 7] The state of the art in nucleate boiling has focused on increasing the density of bubble nucleation using porous structures and microchannels[8 – 12] with characteristic sizes of tens of micro-meters. Traditionally, it is thought that nanoscale surfaces will not improve boiling heat transfer, since the bubble nucleation process is not expected to be enhanced by such small cavities. [13 – 15] In the experiments reported here, we observed communications 1084 unexpected enhancements in boiling performance for a nanostructured copper (Cu) surface formed by the deposition of Cu nanorods on a Cu substrate. Moreover, we observed striking differences in the dynamics of bubble nucleation and release from the Cu nanorods, including smaller bubble diameters, higher bubble release frequencies, and an approxi-mately 30 -fold increase in the density of active bubble nucleation sites. It appears that the ability of the Cu surface with nanorods to generate stable nucleation of bubbles at low superheated temperatures results from a synergistic coupling effect between the nanoscale <b>gas</b> <b>cavities</b> (or nanobubbles[16 – 18]) formed within the nanorod interstices and micrometer-scale defects (voids) that form on the film surface during nanorod deposition. For such a coupled system, the interconnected nanoscale <b>gas</b> <b>cavities</b> stabilize (or feed) bubble nucleation at the microscale defect sites. This is distinct from conventional-scale boiling surfaces, since for the nanostructured surface the bubble nucleation stability is provided by features with orders-of-magnitude smaller scales than the cavity-mouth openings...|$|R

Dike propagation necessarily entails the formation of a gas-filled cavity in the upper tip of the dike, underlain by a layer of magmatic foam. Eruption through the graben boundary faults of a mixture of free gas from the dike tip and vesiculating and fragmenting magmatic foam from the sill provided enough released gas to explain the extent of the pyroclastic deposit.
