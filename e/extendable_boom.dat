50|$|Telescopic {{handlers}} {{are like}} forklift trucks {{that have a}} telescoping <b>extendable</b> <b>boom</b> like a crane. Early telescopic handlers only lifted {{in one direction and}} did not rotate; however, several of the manufacturers have designed telescopic handlers that rotate 360 degrees through a turntable and these machines look almost identical to the Rough Terrain Crane. These new 360-degree telescopic handler/crane models have outriggers or stabiliser legs that must be lowered before lifting; however, their design has been simplified {{so that they can be}} more quickly deployed. These machines are often used to handle pallets of bricks and install frame trusses on many new building sites and they have eroded much of the work for small telescopic truck cranes. Many of the world's armed forces have purchased telescopic handlers and some of these are the much more expensive fully rotating types. Their off-road capability and their on site versatility to unload pallets using forks, or lift like a crane make them a valuable piece of machinery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Small {{satellite}} missions requiring {{attitude control}} can realize significant mass savings by extending the moment {{arm of a}} propulsion-based system. Replacing traditional torque rods and reaction wheels with small thrusters on <b>extendable</b> <b>booms</b> can significantly reduce {{the mass of the}} ACS. Small satellite buses pose significant integration challenges when incorporating electric micro-thrusters. Generally these satellites have low power capability and small geometries. This impacts attitude determination and control system (ADACS) thruster performance significantly, as it results in low thrust capability (due to power limitations) and small torque moment arms (due to size limitations). To address these technical challenges, the Air Force Research Laboratory is developing a lightweight deployable boom for extending the moment arm of Busek Inc. ’s Micro-Propulsion Attitude Control System (MPACS). Specific engineering requirements include increased stiffness, integrated power, and a telemetry wiring harness embedded within the boom’s multi-functional structure. A major design goal is to standardize a modular integration with satellites using the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA). Therefore, the boom is designed to stow within the ESPA interface port, a surface region that is generally unused on ESPA satellites. Deployment of the boom is accomplished with a series of elastic-memory composite (EMC) hinges that extend a multi-functional composite structure to a total length of 4 meters. Gravity-gradient stabilization for tip and roll control is abetted by a 6. 2 -kg tip mass, comprised of the MPAC...|$|R

The engine nacelles carried JEZEBEL sonobuoys in the rear (16 in early marks, 32 in the S-2E/G). [...] Early Trackers also carried 60 explosive charges, dispensed ventrally {{from the rear of}} the fuselage and used for active sonar (JULIE) with the AN/AQA-3 and later AQA-4 detection sets, whereas the introduction of active sonobuoys (pingers) and AN/AQA-7 with the S-2G conversion saw these removed.

40|$|To {{the present}} day, {{the idea of}} using solar sails for space {{propulsion}} is still just a concept, but one that provides a great potential for future space exploration missions. Several notable solar propulsion missions and experiments have been performed and more are still in the development stage. Solar Sailing is a method of space flight propulsion, which utilizes the light photons to propel spacecrafts through the vacuum of space. This concept will be tested in the near future with the launch of the NanoSail-D satellite. NanoSail-D is a nano-class satellite, < 10 kg, which will deploy a thin lightweight sheet of reflective material used to propel the satellite in its low earth orbit. Using the features of the NanoSail-D architecture, a second-generation solar sail design concept, dubbed FeatherSail, has been developed. The goal of the FeatherSail project is to create a sail vehicle with the ability to provide steering from the sails and increase the areal density. The FeatherSail design will utilize the NanoSail-D based <b>extendable</b> <b>boom</b> technology with only one sail on each set of booms. This design also allows each of the four sails to feather as much as ninety degrees. The FeatherSail concept uses deployable solar arrays to generate the power necessary for deep space missions. In addition, recent developments in low power, low temperature Silicon-Germanium electronics provide the capability for long duration deep space missions. It is envisioned that the FeatherSail conceptual design will provide the impetus for future sail vehicles, which may someday visit distant places that mankind has only observed...|$|E

The boom also can move front and back (boom telescoping), up and down (luffing) by separate drives so that it can fill all the corners of the ship hatches. Ship loaders are built in capacities from 1000 to 15000 TPH (tones per hour). The height of a ship loader can be in excess of 20 meters and the boom can extend to a length of more than 60 meters. Arc type of ship loaders are usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship. This type of ship loader can perform operations like long travel, luffing and slewing movement of the boom to reach maximum portions the ship hatch area. This type of ship loaders are less common in present day ports as it cannot load material to all portions of the ship hatches, requires huge berth construction work and more number of conveyors A Linear ship loader is usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship.
