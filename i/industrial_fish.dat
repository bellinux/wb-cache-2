50|$|Historically, {{the fish}} {{processing}} methods used {{for human consumption}} have been: fresh, canned, frozen, smoked or dehydrated - all {{of which would be}} used as a whole food rather than as an ingredient in other foods. Additionally, an <b>industrial</b> <b>fish</b> industry exists where whole fish and by products from fish processing have been cooked and dehydrated to form a product termed fish meal, which is used for animal feed, pet food and fish feed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> {{companies}} in Chile have reported {{no more than}} 10,000 employees. They own 55 {{percent of the market}} but only four companies own over 92 percent of the market: Marfood, Orizon, Blumar, and Camanchaca. In addition to the clear monopoly of profits, Chile’s new “Fisheries Act” is disproportionately beneficial to large-scale <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> companies. In February 2013, marine resources were privatized for “a period of 20 years, renewable and transferrable,” disproportionately benefiting the big <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> companies. Seven families will profit from the “Longueira Act”, named after the Economy Minister who created it. The beneficiaries are the Angelini, Sarkis, Stengel, Cifuentes, Jiménez, Izquierdo and Cruz families, who will enjoy no less than three million dollars in annual profits. The new legislation amends the scope of the sustainability of hydro-biological resources and access to <b>industrial</b> and artisanal <b>fishing,</b> as well as regulating the investigation and oversight of the industry. It creates 20-year renewable contracts to not only Chilean industrial fisheries but also to foreign companies, primarily from northern Europe and Asia Minor.|$|R

50|$|Fishery {{is common}} in all coastal towns but Puerto Rico {{does not have enough}} wild {{fisheries}} to supply the demand required to sustain a profitable fishing industry. There are no <b>industrial</b> <b>fish</b> farms on the island either. Common fish consumed by residents include cod (bacalao), mahi-mahi (pez dorado), marlin (marlín), salmon (salmón), snapper (chillo), trunkfish (chapín), and tuna (atún). Other seafood includes clams (almejas), crabs (cangrejos), lobsters (langostas), mussels (mejillones), octopi (pulpo), oysters (ostras), and squids (calamares). It is quite common for restaurants on the coast to serve fresh seafood.|$|E
50|$|The first American <b>industrial</b> <b>fish</b> canneries were {{established}} in Tlingit territory in 1878 at Klawock (Lawáak) and Sitka. Some Tlingit readily sold fish to the canneries or worked for wages processing fish. In the summer of the same year, Tlingit led by Anaxóots of the Kaagwaantaan protested the arrival of eighteen Chinese workers in Sitka, demanding that the Chinese would not take their jobs. The American managers reportedly resolved the conflict with promises that the Chinese would only work at skills in the cannery that Tlingit had not been taught, and if Tlingit learned those skills they would replace the Chinese.|$|E
50|$|Three broad {{categories}} of fishing in Denmark are industrial fishery, fishery {{for human consumption}} (also known as pelagic fishing), and demersal fishery. Industrial fishing is for industrial use of producing fish oil and fish meal. Initially, Industrial fishing using trawlers began in the 1940s with herring fishing in the North Sea. Over time, other fish species included sand eel, Norway pout, blue whiting and sprat (sprat in Skagerrak/Kattegat and in the Baltic Sea). By 1993, the percentage of sand eel was about 70%, when the total <b>industrial</b> <b>fish</b> catch was 1.2 million tons. However, in terms of cash value, cod fish was a better catch. This type of fishing is also found to be overall remunerative as it contributes to 27% in financial value from 77% of catch.|$|E
50|$|Monitored <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> boats limit fishing {{activities}} to—generally—5 nmi km {{from the coast}} of Chile. This leaves the 5 nm zone for “artisanal” or smaller fishing boats and limits excessive fishing effort being applied to inshore waters.|$|R
50|$|In {{the marine}} area, the threats posed are from <b>industrial</b> <b>fishing</b> (salmon farming and cultured mussels) and {{aquaculture}} {{particularly in the}} Gulf of Corcovado, intensive exploitation of marine resources, with large maritime traffic of trawls, associated fishing.|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} innovations brought by the 1996 protocol is the codification of the [...] "precautionary approach" [...] and the [...] "polluter pays principle." [...] Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called [...] "reverse list" [...] approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 ("the reverse list") of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this reverse list requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures {{to ensure that the}} issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of reverse list substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the reverse list include dredged material; sewage sludge; <b>industrial</b> <b>fish</b> processing waste; vessels and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of incineration at sea, except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or incineration at sea.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 1940s, {{fish stocks}} were under severe pressure. The market for fish grew since {{railways}} were available to carry fish to the coast and settlements in between. Improved fishing boats and nets were introduced. British colonial authorities set out to remedy this through the introduction of exotic species, including tilapia and the Nile perch. These introductions had five main impacts. The first of these was the rise of the Nile perch. The fish took some time to establish itself, and only began to appear catch statistics in the mid-1970s. By the 1980s, the 'explosion' of this species was being referred to as the Nile perch 'boom'. Catches climbed from about 335 mt in 1975, to a peak of 380,776 mt in 1990. The second impact was the Nile perch's devastation of the haplochromine species flock, its main food source. Catches of this species crashed. The third impact related to the lake's diminutive endemic silver cyprinid, the [...] Freed from competition (with haplochromine species) for food sources, this species thrived. It was not the main target of the Nile perch, and catches increased spectacularly from 13,000 mt in 1975, to an all-time high 567,268 mt in 2006. The fourth main impact of the introductions related to the exotic tilapia species. One of these, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), was to establish itself firmly in the fishery. Tilapia catches from the lake rose from about 13,000 mt in 1975, to an all-time high of around 105,000 mt in 2000. There {{can be little doubt that}} these introductions saved the fishery from collapse. With such increases, so too the entire production system on the lake changed, the fifth and final key change. Prior to the arrival of the colonial administration, the fishery was dominated by fishermen (mainly, although certain fishing techniques were reserved for women) who owned their labour and their fishing gear. Contributing to the near-collapse of the fishery in the 1940s and 1950s was the reorganisation of the fishery into fleets drawing on hired labour and much improved gear. The Nile perch 'boom' was to accelerate and massively expand this process. It coincided with an emerging European market for high-quality white fish meat, prompting the development of <b>industrial</b> <b>fish</b> processing capacity along the lake’s shores in Kisumu, Musoma, Mwanza, Entebbe and Jinja. The export of Nile perch has since expanded away from the European Union (EU) to the Middle East, the United States and Australia, and now represents large foreign exchange earnings to the lake's riparian states. In Uganda, indeed, its export is second only to coffee in the rankings of export earnings. In 2006, the total value of Nile perch exports from the lake was estimated to be US$250 million. The main market for the perch remains the EU, and the industry is, therefore, subject to the worries of EU health and safety inspectors. The EU has frequently closed its doors to the export for reasons ranging from unsatisfactory hygiene at factories to cholera outbreaks on the lake shores.|$|E

Therefore, it is necessary to replace as much as possible of the fish meal protein with competitive organic vegetable protein sources with high protein content as well as a relevant amino acid composition compared to that in fish meal. Opposite optimization of conventional fish feed the regulation does not allow addition of artificial amino acids to feed for organic fish. ...|$|E
