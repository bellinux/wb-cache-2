5|$|Born {{and raised}} in California, Hershberger {{attended}} Fullerton Union High School {{where he was a}} baseball standout. He was signed by the New York Yankees and was part of their minor league system for eight years. He was traded after the 1937 season to the Cincinnati Reds, where he found a place on the major league roster as a backup behind Ernie Lombardi. For three seasons, Hershberger played in relief of Lombardi, stepping in <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> a day off or was injured. After a slump in late July and early August, Hershberger committed suicide on August 3, 1940 in his hotel room; the Reds {{went on to win the}} 1940 World Series in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains the sewer system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, and removes snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E

Despite Bonchamps' protests about the danger, Bodson decided to go inside with just ten askari including a Dahomeyan and Hamadi-bin-Malum to find Msiri, while Bonchamps and the remaining askari waited outside. Bodson would fire his revolver <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> assistance.|$|E

25|$|The film Bruce Almighty (2003) {{originally}} {{featured a}} number {{that did not have}} the 555 prefix. In the cinematic release, God (Morgan Freeman) leaves 776-2323 on a pager for Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) to call <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> God's help. The DVD changes this to a 555 number. According to Universal Studios, which produced the movie, the number it used was picked because it did not exist in Buffalo, New York, where the movie was set. However, the number did exist in other cities, resulting in customers' having that number receiving random calls from people asking for God. While some played along with the gag, others found the calls aggravating.|$|E
25|$|CMLL held a {{steel cage}} match {{involving}} 12 Mini-Estrellas, the rules dictated {{that the last}} two men in the cage would have immediately to face off in a Luchas de Apuestas ("Bet match") with the loser either having to unmask or have his hair shaved off as a result. The match took place on November 6, 2012 in Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara, Jalisco and included Aéreo, Astral, , Fantasy, Mercurio, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Violencia, Pierrothito, Shockercito and Último Dragoncito. The wrestlers {{were not allowed to}} even attempt to leave the cage until three minutes into the ring, but once the deadline was up Pequeño Halcón was the first person out of the cage followed by Mercurio and Aéreo. Moments later, as Pequeño Olímpico was trying to climb over the top part of the wire mesh on the cage gave out and Pequeño Olímpico ended up with his arm trapped in the cage, needing help to get loose and to the floor where he was checked to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> medical attention. After that Fantasy climbed over the cage the floor, escaping the match and joining Mercurio and Aéreo, who were still on the floor. Moments later Astral {{climbed to the top of}} the cage and dove off the 15-foot-high cage, landing a Moonsault on Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were still on the floor. During the move Astral got caught in the cage and landed in an uncontrolled manner on the floor, hitting his head, which promoted the medical personnel to immediately rush him out of the arena. The bad fall also hurt Mercurio, who had to be removed from the ring on a stretcher. Many of the remaining contestants, including Pierrothito bled during the match, some was possibly intentional as part of the plan for the match while others were not intentionally bleeding. Demus 3:16 was the recipient of several throws and falls off the cage as he tried to escape, finally shaking off his opponents to climb out. Once Demus 3:16 was on the floor he needed help to even stand and had to be helped from the arena. The last person to escape was Pequeño Violencia, who's back was bleeding from being thrown against the cage repeatedly. With Pequeño Violencia out it left Shockercity and Pequeño Black Warrior as the last two men in the ring, with both of them risking their hair on the outcome of this part of the match. Shockercito finally managed to defeat his opponent when he applied the La Reienera submission hold on Pequeño Black Warrior, forcing him to submit. Following the loss Pequeño Black Warrior had all his hair shaved off. Following the match Shockercito stated that he hoped his victory would earn him a match against one of the Mini-Estrella champions.|$|E
500|$|In 1972–73 Shero hired Mike Nykoluk as an {{assistant}} coach on a one-year tryout basis. Although assistant coaches are common today, Nykoluk was the first full-time assistant coach in the league, and the decision to hire him led to rumors that Shero must not be much of a coach <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> help. However, with the additional help Shero guided the Flyers to their first winning season in franchise history, and Nykoluk stayed on as assistant throughout Shero's tenure. Prior to a game during the 72–73 season Shero wrote a quote about commitment on the dressing room blackboard, and the team won the game. From then on Shero wrote inspirational quotes prior to games. After finishing second in the West Division they faced off with the Minnesota North Stars whom they defeated 4-2 winning the first playoff series in Flyers history. [...] In the second round the Flyers matched up with the Montreal Canadiens, who defeated Philadelphia 4-1.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the style of hanging-back defensive play common in the later 1950s and 1960s, Orr {{was known for his}} fluid skating and end-to-end rushing. Orr's rushing enabled him to be where the puck was, allowing him not only to score effectively but also to defend when necessary. According to the Bruins' Phil Esposito, [...] "No matter how fast an opponent was, Bobby could skate faster than him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> {{to do it in the}} framework of a play. If he was caught up-ice and the other team had an odd-man rush, that's when you saw his truly great speed. Very seldom did he not get back to have a hand in breaking up the play." [...] Orr also benefited from playing most of his career in Boston Garden, which was [...] shorter than the standard NHL rink. This suited his rushing style very well, as he was able to get from one end of the ice to the other faster than in a standard rink.|$|E
500|$|He joined Luftwaffe on 7 November 1938, as a Fahnenjunker (officer candidate) and {{received}} his military basic training in Quedlinburg in the Harz region. On 1 March 1939 Marseille {{was transferred to}} the Luftkriegsschule 4 (LKS 4—air war school) near Fürstenfeldbruck. Among his classmates was Werner Schröer. Schröer reports that Marseille was often in breach of military discipline. Consequently, Marseille was ordered to stay on base while his classmates were on weekend leave. Quite frequently Marseille ignored this and left Schröer a note: [...] "Went out! Please take my chores." [...] On one occasion, while performing a slow circuit, Marseille broke away and performed an imaginary weaving dogfight. He was reprimanded by his commanding officer, Hauptmann Mueller-Rohrmoser, and taken off flying duties and his promotion to Gefreiter postponed. Soon after, during a cross-country flight, he landed on a quiet stretch of Autobahn (between Magdeburg and Braunschweig) and ran behind a tree to relieve himself. Some farmers came to enquire <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> assistance, but by the time they arrived Marseille was on his way, and they were blown back by his slipstream. Infuriated, the farmers reported the matter and Marseille was again suspended from flying.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, American stunt performer and Jackass actor Johnny Knoxville guest starred in the episode {{as the voice of}} Johnny Krill, the leader of an extreme sports team called the Drasticals and a champion of undersea extreme sports. The writing staff wrote the episode specifically for Knoxville. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt said [...] " [...] wanted to do a show about extreme sports and the first thing that came to mind was Johnny Knoxville, because there are few humans living that are as extreme as him." [...] Knoxville accepted the role because he is a fan of the show. Knoxville said [...] "I got a lot of street cred in the office for doing SpongeBob. Everyone is psyched As soon as I was done recording this episode, I started begging them to let me come back and record another one." [...] Knoxville asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> {{to come up with a}} funny voice for his character. However, the producers said [...] "No, we want [...]" [...] Knoxville claimed that [...] "it's not easy" [...] providing a vocal cameo. He added [...] "It's a different kind of work." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
2500|$|Aseity—That [...] "God is so {{independent}} that he {{does not}} need us." [...] It is based on Acts 17:25, where it says that God [...] "is not served by human hands, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> anything" [...] (NIV).

At that point Acevedo Vilá left, feeling that [...] "it was {{an insult to the}} Puerto Rican people left in the streets". Aponte denied this, and accused the Governor of lying.|$|E

Kilroy ran from the truck but was eventually intercepted by another vehicle driven by the gangsters' allies and taken at gunpoint.

2500|$|The 3D Mario games {{introduced}} Toad's role as {{a helper}} who would provide assistance to Mario <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> it, thus making him one of Mario's major allies. In Super Mario 64, Toad explains the backstory to Mario, as well as telling him {{what he has to}} do to proceed in the game. In the game's remake Super Mario 64 DS, Toad appears with the same role; however, he is given character-specific remarks (such as mistaking Luigi for Mario in green clothes or thinking that Wario would betray the rest of the group). In Luigi's Mansion, Toad appears in various parts of the mansion as a save point. Different colored Toads appear in Super Mario Sunshine as Peach's attendants. In Super Mario Galaxy, Toads appear at the beginning of the game as some of the citizens of Toad Town. Later on, a group of Toads appear as the Toad Brigade led by new character, Captain Toad, the captain of the brigade, who attempt to help Mario or Luigi retrieve the Power Stars. [...] Toad himself appears in the intro of the game, where he is holding hands with Toadette as the two look at the night sky. Captain Toad makes a reappearance in the sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, once again as the same cowardly character as before.. Like in the first game, he and his brigade would attempt to help Mario retrieve the Power Stars in order to save Princess Peach.|$|E
