5000|$|... "Bookland" [...] is the {{informal}} {{name for the}} Unique Country Code (UCC) prefix allocated in the 1980s for European Article Number (EAN) identifiers of published books, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN namespace can catalogue books by ISBN rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. In other words, Bookland is a fictitious country that exists solely in EAN {{for the purposes of}} non-geographically cataloguing books in the otherwise geographically keyed <b>EAN</b> <b>coding</b> system.|$|R
50|$|GS1 Sweden (earlier EAN Sweden) {{is part of}} GS1 {{international}} (earlier EAN international). GS1 international is {{a worldwide}} organisation that works with standards related to distribution. The foundation for the GS1-system is the unique series of digits, identifying products, places and goods. These areas can be concluded in The global language of business. To help reading the series of digits, different types of information carriers are used like barcodes, RFID-tags, data matrices etc. As a member of GS1 international, GS1 Sweden is representing GS1 in Sweden and also listening {{to the voice of}} Swedish companies to develop the GS1 standards. GS1 Sweden has today 9,000 customers. GS1 Sweden is also responsible to give <b>EAN</b> <b>codes</b> to Swedish companies.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, {{this system}} was abandoned. The current European system {{consists}} of 7 digits, mostly beginning with 86 {{and ending with}} 2 to indicate it is a CD single, e.g. 868384 2. (For the international <b>EAN</b> <b>code,</b> the standard 74321 number precedes the 7 digits and the 0 is added after the code).|$|E
5000|$|Each product sold on Amazon.com {{is given}} a unique ASIN. For books with 10-digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN), the ASIN and the ISBN are the same. [...] The Kindle edition of a book will not use its ISBN as the ASIN, {{although}} the electronic version of a book may have its own ISBN. In most cases, {{it is possible to}} convert an ASIN to obtain a corresponding <b>EAN</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
40|$|The witness seminar ”The {{introduction}} of bar codes in Sweden” {{took place at}} the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm on 22 October 2008 and was led by Gustav Sjöblom. The definition and implementation of EAN – a European standard for the identification and printing of unique article numbers – was a major innovation in the wholesale and retail trade, which led to substantial rationalization and revolutionized the generation and usage of sales data for ordering, marketing etc. The seminar panel was composed of three members of the Swedish and European EAN committees (representing suppliers and trade respectively); representatives of four major Swedish chains (ICA Essve, Åhléns, KF, and Dagab); and one supplier of cash registers (ADS Anker). The seminar was divided into two parts, the first dealing with the period from the initiation of European negotiations on the definition of the <b>EAN</b> <b>code</b> structure in 1973, to the signing in 1977 of the Swedish agreement between the suppliers’ organization DLF and the major chains. The theme of the second half was the implementation of EAN codes in actual practice, including manufacturers printing the EAN symbol on the packages and the supermarket chains installing equipment for reading and data capture. The <b>EAN</b> <b>code</b> was introduced in a few stores in 1981 and spread rapidly so that retailing in practice could be based on EAN from c. 1983...|$|E

50|$|The Digimarc Discover {{software}} development kit (SDK) enables application developers to build mobile apps (iOS/Android) that enable consumers to scan product packages and virtually any media with smartphones and tablets to discover more information. The SDK features proprietary optimizations for scanning the 1D consumer barcodes traditionally used at retail (UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN 8, <b>EAN</b> 13, <b>Code</b> 39, Code 128) and also supports scanning of QR codes. The SDK includes technology for detection of Digimarc Barcodes in audio, inaudible codes that enable a range of audience measurement, content monetization and so-called second screen broadcast applications.|$|R
40|$|ISBN is an unique {{international}} machine-readable {{identification number}} for monographic publications. The allocation {{of the number}} replaces the handling of long bibliographic descriptive records. Time and staff are saved, copying mistakes are avoided. The ISBN allows compilation and updating of book-trade directories and bibliographic databases, like Books in Print. Information on available books can be easily found. Ordering and distribution of books is mainly executed by ISBN; this is a fast and efficient method. The ISBN is machine-readable {{in the form of}} a 13 -digit Bookland <b>EAN</b> bar <b>code.</b> This is fast and avoids mistakes. The ISBN is needed for the running of electronic point-of-sale systems in bookshops...|$|R
40|$|The Librarianship, as a well {{standardized}} domain, is very {{suitable for}} the implementation of the e-business, so we think {{that it is possible to}} apply it within the ISSN Center of Serbia and Montenegro. If we can define the e-business as a new way of business transaction, where the interested parties are making their contacts by electronic means, rather than material exchange of data, we can say that the electronic business is in operation within the ISSN Center of Serbia and Montenegro, as we already receive all the demands mainly through our electronic system and the assigned ISSN Number and <b>EAN</b> <b>Code</b> are sent by electronic means to the Publisher...|$|E
40|$|This paper shows new {{algorithms}} and the implementations {{of image}} reorganization for EAN/QR barcodes in mobile phones. The mobile phone system used here {{consists of a}} camera, mobile application processor, digital signal processor (DSP), and display device, and the source image is captured by the embedded camera device. The introduced algorithm {{is based on the}} code area found by four corners detection for 2 D barcode and spiral scanning for 1 D barcode using the embedded DSP. This algorithm is robust for practical situations and the DSP has god enough perfor 4 mance for the real-time recognition of the codes. The performance of our image processing is 66. 7 frames / sec for <b>EAN</b> <b>code</b> and 14. 1 frames / sec for QR code image processing, and this is sufficient performance for practical use. The released mobile phone had performance of 5 - 10 frames / sec including OS and subsystem overheads...|$|E
40|$|This project {{describes}} {{the process of}} creating a cross-platform application, starting into an Android app and a web page designed to control food intolerances users. The system will control a full database of products, its composition and manage all user queries entering a <b>EAN</b> <b>code</b> (European Article Number) of a product or food. EAN is a 13 -digit bar code symbology, which is a superset of the original UPC (Universal Product Code), and adopted by over 100 countries and nearly one million businesses and printed on all products that can be purchased at stores in our country. The application will acquire this code by mobile phone camera (Android version) or by directly entering (all versions). It will also allow the user to incorporate all intolerances into the system, warning us about the danger of consuming any product or component stored as harmful in the app. The aim is to create a separate 3 -tier application where logic and storage of information are in unique and separate layers, detached of the presentation layer, since in our design we have two different fronts: on the one hand, a website and the other an Android app. This way, the effort required for implementation is substantially reduced, since it is only necessary to duplicate work in very specific parts, the both fronts. The final products are an Android app, a web page, a SaaS-based webservice that will manage both logic, a database system and a description of the most significant parts of the process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Within {{the coming}} years, low cost radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) systems are expected to become commonplace throughout the business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketplace. Much of the work to date on these systems pertains to systems engineering and electronic product code issues. This paper discusses ways to ensure personal privacy, and presents policies and technologies that could limit abuse. Introduction to RFID “Automatic Identification ” (Auto-ID) describes a wide class of technologies used for automatically identifying objects, individuals, and locations. Typical Auto-ID systems assign a code to a product model or type. This code can then be automatically read and manipulated by an information processing system. The Universal Product Code (UPC) / European Article Number (<b>EAN)</b> bar <b>code</b> present on most consume...|$|R

The drawing of the bars is realized by the TEX primitive. Some data from the standard for the EAN barcodes (tolerances and so on) are presented too. The corresponding TEX macro is available on CTAN in tex-archive/macros/generic/ean. I have prepared my rst book about TEX written in Czech (Olsak, 1995). My interest in preparing the book didn’t end with sending the manuscript or the type matter to the publisher because the publisher is our CSTUG (the Czechoslovak TEX users group) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A central task when {{integrating}} {{data from}} different sources is to detect identical items. For example, price comparison websites have to identify offers for identical products. This task is known, among others, as record linkage, object identification, or duplicate detection. In this work, we examine problem settings where some relations between items {{are given in}} advance – for example by <b>EAN</b> article <b>codes</b> in an e-commerce scenario or by manually labeled parts. To represent and solve these problems we bring in ideas of semi-supervised and constrained clustering in terms of pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints. We show that extending object identification by pairwise constraints results in an expressive framework that subsumes many variants of the integration problem like traditional object identification, matching, iterative problems or an active learning setting. For solving these integration tasks, we propose an extension to current object identification models that assures consistent solutions to problems with constraints. Our evaluation shows that additionally taking the labeled data into account dramatically increases the quality of state-of-the-art object identification systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Pharmacy {{inventory}} management (PIM) comprises business activities which are {{connected with the}} size and placement of stocked drugs. To manage minimal and maximal drugs stock, orders dynamics etc., pharmacies must track expiration dates of each drug in stock. Outdated drugs can’t be counted as stock and produce lot of costs, especially for their disposal. The most number of pharmacies in Bosnia use European Article Numbering (EAN 13) barcode by which is impossible to define drug expiration dates. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enables full automatization of PIM, {{but it is still}} not in use, mostly because of high costs of implementation of this system. In our research we have observed 52 Bosnian pharmacies and presented another approach to barcode technology which can be used in automatization of PIM. As the base we have used existing <b>EAN</b> 13 <b>code,</b> adding 6 digits for expiration dates. We have successfully created and tested program for extraction of EAN 13 and expiration dates from that barcode using separate files in database to keep inputs, outputs and stocks of each item by expiration dates...|$|R
50|$|The GS1 Databar Coupon code {{has been}} in use in retail {{industry}} since the mid-1980s. At first, it was a UPC with system ID 5. Since UPCs cannot hold more than 12 digits, it required another bar code to hold additional information like offer code, expiration date and household ID numbers. Therefore, the code was often extended with an additional UCC/EAN 128 bar <b>code.</b> <b>EAN</b> 13 was sometimes used instead of UPC, and because it starts with 99, {{it was called the}} EAN 99 coupon barcode, and subsequently GS1 Databar. After more than 20 years in use, there is now a need to encode more data for complex coupons, and to accommodate longer company IDs, so the traditional coupon code has become less efficient and sometimes not usable at all.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this article, we {{describe}} the algorithm for the transformation from the <b>EAN</b> 13 <b>code</b> (13 digit number) to the barcode (the sequence of bars and spaces) and we show the implementation of this algorithm to the macro language of TEX. The drawing of the bars is realized by TEX primitive. Some data from the norm for the EAN barcodes (tolerances and so on) are presented too. The corresponding TEX macro is available on CTAN. I have prepared my first book about TEX written in Czech [3]. My interest in preparing the book didn’t end by sending the manuscript or the type matter to the publisher because the publisher is our CSTUG (Czechoslovak TEX users group). I made the cover design of the book, I worked on the distribution problems like getting the ISBN, and so on. When I got the ISBN (International Standard Book Number), I converted it to the EAN 13 (Euro-pean Article Numbering) and I took concern about the barcode for this number, because {{it is commonly used}} on the book covers. I found out that it would be very expensive to let the commercial firms make the barcode. On the other hand, using TEX to produce the barcodes is a very natural application of this program because of its high accuracy and its algorithmic macro language. To find the description of the conversion algorithm with 13 digits on the input and the barcode metrics on the output was the only problem. This algorithm is described in [1]. The transformation from the ISBN to the EAN is simple. The ISBN is a 10 digit number. The dashes between digits divide the ISBN into the fields (country-publisher-number-checksum) and (essentially) can be ignored. First we write three new constant digits (978) {{to the front of the}} ISBN number. Next we compute a new check sum digit (the last one). The algorithm for computing the ISBN checksum is different from the one for computing the EAN checksum. For EAN, first we need to compute the sum of digits on the even positions. Let the sum be e. Next we compute the sum of digits on the odd positions (without the checksum digit). Let the sum be o. We evaluate the expression 3 × e + o. The difference of the result to the next modulo- 10 number is the check sum digit. For example the TEXbook har...|$|R
