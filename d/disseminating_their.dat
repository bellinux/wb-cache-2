25|$|As {{taught by}} Blavatsky, Theosophy holds {{that there is}} an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters, who — {{although}} found across the world — are centred in Tibet. These Masters are believed to have cultivated great wisdom and paranormal powers, and Theosophists believe that it was they who initiated the modern Theosophical movement through <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> teachings via Blavatsky. They believe that these Masters are attempting to revive knowledge of an ancient religion once found across the world and which will again come to eclipse the existing world religions.|$|E

2500|$|The Reformation {{messages}} were very controversial and were frequently banned {{in a number}} of Catholic cities. Despite this attempt by the Catholic Church to contain and repress Protestant propaganda, the Protestant propagandists found effective ways of <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> messages to their believers. The use of pamphlets became the primary method of spreading Protestant ideas and doctrine. Pamphlets took little time to produce and they could be printed and sold quickly making them harder to track down by the authorities and thus making them a very effective method of propaganda. [...] The sheer number of pamphlets produced during this time period indicates that Protestant works during the Reformation were available on a consistent basis and on a large scale, making the controversial ideas accessible to the masses. This {{is one of the reasons}} that the Protestants were successful in their propaganda campaign and in the Reformation.|$|E

The old house, with its great stone staircase, echoed hollowly to the sound of typewriters and of errand-boys from ten to six. The noise of different typewriters already at work, <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> views upon the protection of native races, or the value of cereals as foodstuffs, quickened Mary's steps, and she always ran up the last flight of steps which led to her own landing, at whatever hour she came, so as to get her typewriter to take its place in competition with the rest.|$|E
