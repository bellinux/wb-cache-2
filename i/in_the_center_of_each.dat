25|$|The {{carapace}} of {{the turtle}} has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, {{like those of}} other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> appendage.|$|E

25|$|With four {{direct-drive}} {{engines in}} a tandem push-pull arrangement, and a fully enclosed cockpit, the R.VI design required {{none of the}} complex gearboxes of other R-types. Each R.VI bomber cost 557,000 marks and required {{the support of a}} 50-man ground crew. The R.VI required a complex 18-wheel undercarriage consisting of twin nosewheels and a quartet of four-wheeled groupings for its main gear to support its weight, and carried two mechanics in flight, seated between the engines in open niches cut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> nacelle. The bombs were carried in an internal bomb bay located under the central fuel tanks, with three racks each capable of holding seven bombs. The R.VI was capable of carrying the 1000kg PuW bomb.|$|E

25|$|The {{lines that}} {{delineate}} {{the width of}} the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines {{to the inside of the}} doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.|$|E

The species name decemlineata, meaning 'ten-lined', derives from this feature.

500|$|The {{layout of}} ancient Chinese capitals, such as Bianjing, {{capital of the}} Northern Song, {{followed}} the guidelines in Kao Gong Ji, which specified a square city wall with several gates on each side and passageways for the emperor. The outer city of ancient Bianjing was built {{during the reign of}} Emperor Shenzong to a rectangular plan, almost square in proportions, about [...] from north to south and [...] from west to east. The south wall had three gates, with Nanxun Gate in the center, Chenzhou Gate to the east, and Dailou Gate to the west. The other walls had four gates each: in the east wall were Dongshui Gate (at the southern end), Xinsong Gate, Xinchao Gate, and North-East Water Gate; in the west wall Xinzheng Gate, West Water Gate, Wansheng Gate, and Guzi Gate; and in the north wall Chenqiao Gate (at the eastern end), Fengqiu Gate, New Wild Jujube Gate and Weizhou Gate. The gates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of the four sides were reserved for the emperor; these gates had straight passages and only two sets of doors, while the other city gates had zigzag passages and were guarded by three sets of doors.|$|E
2500|$|The nests and {{colonies of}} M. smithii were studied {{in great detail}} in Puerto Rico and Brazil. [...] On the surface, M. smithii nests can be {{recognized}} by their nest mounds consisting of excavated soil and clay. A nest entrance of roughly 1.2 mm in diameter is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> nest mound. Large M. smithii nests, which are presumably older, can contain up to 7 or so chambers. Some fungus chambers are shallow whereas others {{can be found in}} great depths, as deep as 2 meters. The abandoned chambers are used to deposit waste from the fungus garden and loose soil from chamber construction. The number of nest chambers tends to increase as colonies grow older. [...] Because M. smithii queens are capable of asexual reproduction, it is believed that colonies can also grow by budding [...] in addition to independent colony foundation. Colonies that grow by budding can result in large colony networks.|$|E

2500|$|... }} One {{reason for}} this given by the {{researchers}} is that B80 is actually more like the original geodesic dome structure popularized by Buckminster Fuller, which uses triangles rather than hexagons. However, this work has been subject to much criticism by quantum chemists as {{it was concluded that}} the predicted Ih symmetric structure was vibrationally unstable and the resulting cage undergoes a spontaneous symmetry break, yielding a puckered cage with rare Th symmetry (symmetry of a volleyball). The number of six-member rings in this molecule is 20 and number of five-member rings is 12. There is an additional atom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> six-member ring, bonded to each atom surrounding it. By employing a systematic global search algorithm, later {{it was found that the}} previously proposed B80 fullerene is not global minimum for 80 atom boron clusters and hence can not be found in nature. In the same paper by Sandip De et al., it was concluded that boron's energy landscape is significantly different from other fullerenes already found in nature hence pure boron fullerenes are unlikely to exist in nature.|$|E
2500|$|This {{particular}} sod {{house had}} several unique features which has helped it to survive until this day, {{nearly a century}} after first construction. [...] The sod [...] chosen were from a dried up waterlogged area or a dried up slough so the grass roots were quite thick. [...] Sods are usually overlapped when made into walls, however, Addison made a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> sod piece so that as the piece of sod dried it would tend to crumble in on itself, rather than outwards. [...] He also made each wall triangular, so that {{the width of the}} wall at the base was wider than the top. [...] The roofs which were the downfall of most sod houses was not typical on Addison's Sod house. [...] He departed from using sod for the roof, but made a wooden hip roof with wood shingles eliminating water damage from spring rains, and winter snow melting. [...] Addison also protected his sod walls from the elements, first by growing vines, then by covering the exterior with cedar shingles. [...] With the advent new technologies in home construction, the cedar shingles were replaced with asphalt, then with vinyl siding.|$|E
