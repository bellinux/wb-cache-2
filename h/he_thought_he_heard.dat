25|$|On 2 November 1962, Ladd {{was found}} lying {{unconscious}} {{in a pool}} of blood with a bullet wound near his heart, in what might have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt. The bullet penetrated Ladd's chest around the third and fourth rib, through the lungs and bounced off the rib cage. At the time, Ladd said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a prowler, grabbed a gun, and tripped over, accidentally shooting himself. This was accepted by the police investigating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} began {{during the}} afternoon of December 30, 1974, when Barbaro left his house with his mother's car. He told his brother, Chris, {{that he was going}} target shooting. Barbaro arrived at Olean High School at approximately 2:50p.m. After leaving his car, he entered the school building through an opened side entrance and proceeded to the third floor where he set off a coke bottle filled with gasoline and a wick. Unable to open the locked door to the student council room, Barbaro shot off the lock, entered the student council room, and tied the door shut. A 12-man custodial crew was doing routine maintenance {{in the basement of the}} school at this time. When they heard a fire alarm sound, the superintendent dispatched Earl Metcaff to see what the problem was at the 3rd floor. [...] He met Joe Kosidlo, the 3rd floor custodian, who asked him to vacate because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> gun shots. [...] Mr. Metcaff did not listen and proceeded to where he heard the noise. Anthony Barbaro was then confronted by Earl Metcaff, seeing Metcalf through the glass window of the student council room, he opened his door shot and killed him. Barbaro then positioned himself in the student council room on the third floor of the school. There, he began shooting at people outside of the school.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{finished}} your letter?" [...] she asked. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> faint amusement in her tone, {{but not a}} trace of jealousy.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> an answer, {{but was not}} certain, {{and again}} dashed forward, almost as speedily {{as if he had}} but just started.|$|R
6000|$|Ten minutes passed. Jimmy {{sprang from}} his chair. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> a footstep. <b>He</b> flung the door open. The passage was empty. He {{returned}} miserably to his chair. Of course {{she had not}} come back. Why should she? ...|$|R
60|$|Sammy {{looked as}} if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> hadn't <b>heard</b> right. Never before had he known Chatterer {{to admit that he}} was afraid, for you know Chatterer is a great boaster. It must be {{something}} very serious to frighten Chatterer like that.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Barringford {{calling and}} started to answer. Then he pushed forward once more, hoping each moment to gain higher ground.|$|E
60|$|So {{he went on}} and on, till {{his head}} spun round with the heat, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> church-bells ringing a long way off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} you have {{forgotten}} it,' said Mr. Bob Sawyer, glancing eagerly at the door, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{the noise of}} glasses jingling; 'very sorry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently, at a hint {{from his}} lady, Foy {{turned down a}} side street, unobserved, as <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> till <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a mocking voice calling after them, [...] "Good-night, Red Bow, hope {{you will have a}} fine supper with your Leyden shopboy." ...|$|R
60|$|Leo {{stood in}} front of the Crab, and the half {{darkness}} allowed him a glimpse of that vast blue-black back, and the motionless eyes. Now and again <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> some one sobbing, but the noise was very faint.|$|R
60|$|The fact is, Unc' Billy was {{thinking}} of the time when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> the voice of an old friend of his from way down South, and he was beginning to suspect that he had been right, and that his old friend really was somewhere in the Green Forest.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} morning while Lane was laboring over his wood pile, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{voices in the}} front yard, and presently Mel came around the walk accompanied by Doctor Wallace and Doctor Bronson.|$|E
60|$|Once, skittering {{along by}} dark, he {{realized}} that the halted car which he had just passed was the Gomez. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a shout behind him, but in a panic he kept going.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy Valentine {{put on his}} coat, {{and walked}} outside the {{railings}} towards the front door. As he went <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a far-away voice that he once knew call [...] "Ralph!" [...] But he never hesitated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nuffin, nuffin, Sah! Ah'm {{just walking}} fo' mah health," [...] replied Unc' Billy over his shoulder, as he hurried on. You see he didn't {{like to tell}} any one what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard,</b> for fear {{that it might not}} be true, and then they would laugh at him.|$|R
60|$|Whether Mr Seymour's {{conscience}} ached or not, cannot, of course, be discovered. But <b>he</b> {{had certainly}} <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a noise, {{and he had}} come to investigate.|$|R
6000|$|She cocked {{only one}} hammer, {{and she did}} it so gently {{that it did not}} frighten the rabbit, {{although}} he flirted his ears a little when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the [...] "click, click!" [...] Everything was so quiet that <b>he</b> probably <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> some insect, probably a young or ignorant cricket that {{did not know how to}} chirp properly.|$|R
60|$|Ferris {{stood beside}} Hal's body. Presently <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a low moan, and he {{imagined}} that Hal moved one arm. His teeth chattered worse than ever, {{and it was}} all he could do to keep from rushing away.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{his uncle}} shout, and getting up looked aft. Tom Hoskins was {{now at the}} helm. Tripper was {{standing}} beside him, and pointing at something broad away on the beam. Jack at once made his way aft.|$|E
60|$|At last <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{a slight}} noise, and drew {{back towards the}} thick canes. A moment later, however, he stepped forward, as a figure he at once {{recognized}} advanced across a patch of moonlight from the next clump of shrubs.|$|E
60|$|Chet was not superstitious, or <b>he</b> {{might have}} <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a ghost. <b>He</b> knew {{there must be}} some {{rational}} reason for the unusual noise, and he resolved to investigate.|$|R
60|$|In {{the stillness}} of the night <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a distant cry. But he was not sure that his ears had not deceived him. Far out he could see a faint light and, knowing that this marked the place where the ship was moored, he {{prepared}} to strike out for it.|$|R
60|$|Unc' Billy {{hung his}} head. He hadn't {{a word to}} say. He just couldn't tell {{her that he had}} spent the whole day {{tramping}} through the Green Forest looking for an old friend, whose voice <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> when <b>he</b> ought to have been helping her find a dinner for the eight little Possums. No, Sir, Unc' Billy hadn't a word to say.|$|R
6000|$|Rollo {{put down}} {{two or three}} {{branches}} very well, and was very much delighted at seeing it gradually begin {{to look like a}} house, when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a voice. He listened a moment, and heard some one at a distance calling, [...] "Rol--lo, Rol--lo." ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{hours after}} it became dark <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a {{confused}} sound, {{as of the}} trampling {{of a number of}} horsemen in the courtyard of the castle. He went to the door and, placing his ear against it, was convinced that he was not mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|When Christian had {{traveled}} in this sorrowful condition some considerable time <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{the voice of}} a man, as going before him, saying, [...] "Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had only}} {{advanced}} {{a few steps}} toward the Mere, when <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> or <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> a voice faintly calling after him, once and once only, the word Farewell. He stopped, {{with a feeling of}} uneasy surprise, and looked round.|$|R
50|$|In the 1945 VFL Grand Final, a spiteful match {{known as}} The Bloodbath, Whitfield was {{reported}} {{for attempting to}} strike field umpire Frank Spokes, using abusive language and for kicking the ball away after a free kick was given against him. When the umpire attempted to report Whitfield, he pulled his jumper {{over his head and}} ran down {{the other end of the}} field to stop the umpire taking his number, later claiming <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> the final siren and was running off to swap guernseys with his opponent.|$|R
60|$|Robin {{had walked}} no farther than where the {{bend of the}} road hid his good men from his view, when he stopped suddenly, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> voices. <b>He</b> stood still and listened, and {{presently}} heard words passed back and forth betwixt {{what seemed to be}} two men, and yet the two voices were wondrously alike. The sound came from over behind the bank, that here was steep and high, dropping {{from the edge of the}} road a half a score of feet to the sedgy verge of the river.|$|R
60|$|Interpreting {{these words}} as meaning that his aunt had some {{business}} {{of her own}} to attend to in the library, he shut the door. He had just advanced into the smoking-room beyond, when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the door open again. He turned round. Lady Janet had followed him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a voice, a husky whisper, say, [...] "Go to her"; and, {{a little}} {{surprised}} by this, he stepped {{to the door of}} the bedroom and peered in. There, sitting in an arm-chair, half hid in the gloaming, sat his mother with closed eyes and a gray-white face.|$|E
60|$|He {{slept in}} the guest-chamber, and at times during the night the child cried in Marcia's room and waked him; and then <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a sound of sobbing which was not the child's. In the morning, when he came down to breakfast, Marcia met him with swollen eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... “Then {{perhaps you}} know my mother’s artistic and {{literary}} associations,” Blunt went on in a subtly changed tone. “My mother has been writing verse {{since she was a}} girl of fifteen. She’s still writing verse. She’s still fifteen—a spoiled girl of genius. So she requested one of her poet friends—no less than Versoy himself—to arrange for a visit to Henry Allègre’s house. At first <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> hadn’t <b>heard</b> aright. You must know that for my mother a man that doesn’t jump out of his skin for any woman’s caprice is not chivalrous. But perhaps you do know? [...] .” ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not know}} why. For all that the child observed, and felt, and thought, that night--the present and the absent; what was then and what had been--were blended like the colours in the rainbow, or in the plumage of rich birds {{when the sun is}} shining on them, or in the {{softening}} sky when the same sun is setting. The many things he had had to think of lately, passed before him in the music; not as claiming his attention over again, or as likely evermore to occupy it, but as peacefully disposed of and gone. A solitary window, gazed through years ago, looked out upon an ocean, miles and miles away; upon its waters, fancies, busy with him only yesterday, were hushed and lulled to rest like broken waves. The same mysterious murmur he had wondered at, when lying on his couch upon the beach, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> still <b>heard</b> sounding through his sister's song, and through the hum of voices, and the tread of feet, and having some part in the faces flitting by, and even in the heavy gentleness of Mr Toots, who frequently came up to shake him by the hand. Through the universal kindness <b>he</b> still <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> it, speaking to him; and even his old-fashioned reputation seemed to be allied to it, he knew not how. Thus little Paul sat musing, listening, looking on, and dreaming; and was very happy.|$|R
60|$|So {{that night}} Alan carried down his fiery cross {{and set it}} in the bouman's window. He was troubled when he came back; for the dogs had barked and the folk run out from their houses; and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> a clatter of arms and seen a red-coat come {{to one of the}} doors. On all {{accounts}} we lay the next day in the borders of the wood and kept a close look-out, so that if it was John Breck that came we might be ready to guide him, and if it was the red-coats we should have time to get away.|$|R
