5|$|Loire and Sémillante {{had escaped}} from the battle into Black Sod Bay, where they hoped to hide until they had a clear passage back to France. However, late on 15 October, a British frigate {{squadron}} under James Newman-Newman rounded the southern headland of the bay, forcing the French ships to flee to the north. Pressing on sail in pursuit, Newman ordered HMS Révolutionaire to focus on Sémillante whilst he pursued Loire in HMS Mermaid, accompanied by the brig HMS Kangaroo under Commander Edward Brace. Loire and Sémillante separated to divide their pursuers; Mermaid and Kangaroo lost track of Loire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> and Sémillante evaded Révolutionaire after dark.|$|E

Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo-Canadian command but patrols probing German positions, created a false perception that no withdrawal was taking place.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm that}} would produce the EF5 Greensburg tornado began forming after 5:00 pm CDT (2200 UTC) {{in the northeastern}} corner of the Texas Panhandle, and went through phases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> across the Oklahoma Panhandle with a few {{isolated}} tornadoes. It slowly organized itself as it moved northeast through portions of Oklahoma, and then into Kansas. The first tornado warning with this cell was issued at 8:35 pm CDT (0135 UTC) for Clark County, Kansas, and the tornado first touched down at about 9:00 pm CDT (0200 UTC). Several storm chasers captured {{the formation of a}} tornado southwest of Greensburg around 9:20 pm CDT (0220 UTC).|$|E
5|$|Tornado watches {{were also}} issued for the Lower Great Lakes in the {{afternoon}} hours, and supercells began to track across southern Michigan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening.</b> Two tornadoes touched down in Michigan and caused damage to farm structures. Further east, severe thunderstorms caused scattered wind damage and large hail across Pennsylvania and New York. Two-inch-diameter hail was reported in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. An isolated supercell moved across Central New York {{throughout much of the}} afternoon, producing golf ball-sized hail in Syracuse, and spawned a very brief EF1 tornado in Verona Mills, causing primarily tree damage. Another tornado in Gilbertsville caused significant damage to an athletic field at a school.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> of 23 November 1963, at {{a market}} in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed {{to get into the}} Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic {{in the early spring}} of 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars were already a year old. The French Navy was already suffering from the upheavals of the French Revolution and the consequent dissolution of the professional officer class, while the Royal Navy had been at a state of readiness since the summer of 1792. During the early months of the war the French Navy focused heavily on raiding and disrupting British commerce and deployed frigates on raiding operations against British commercial shipping. In the English Channel, two of the most successful raiders were the frigates Réunion and Sémillante, based in Cherbourg on the Cotentin Peninsula. These frigates would make short cruises, leaving Cherbourg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> and returning in the morning with any prizes they had encountered during the night.|$|E
5|$|British {{forces were}} ordered {{withdrawn}} {{a few days}} later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north {{on the night of}} 3/4 June, and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This {{was the first time that}} high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> Hare {{took the}} stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> {{at around}} 5pm, Malone {{was killed in}} his {{headquarters}} trench by friendly fire, either from supporting artillery or possibly naval gunfire. Reinforcements, {{in the form of}} the Otago Battalion and two squadrons of the Wellington Mounted Rifles arrived later that evening, and the remnants of Malone's battalion withdrew, having suffered 690 men killed or wounded of its original complement of 760. Malone, along with 300 of his men, has no known grave. Two days later, Chunuk Bair, now held by British units, was lost to the Turks. With the battalion out of the line, a memorial service for Malone was held on 21 August. The service was attended by nearly all of the surviving men of the battalion. Malone was also mentioned in despatches for his leadership during the August offensive.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Cruiser Squadron was tasked {{to protect}} Allied {{merchant}} shipping from commerce raiders in the Caribbean {{and along the}} East Coast of North America and Craddock dispersed his ships shortly before the war began on 4 August 1914 in a futile search for the two German warships known {{to be in the}} area. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> of 6 August, Bristol spotted the German light cruiser , but failed to inflict any significant damage before engine problems allowed the German ship to disengage behind her own smoke. Later in the month, Bristol began patrolling off the northern coast of Brazil in an unsuccessful attempt to find the German ships. The ship was detached to continue to patrol the Brazilian coast and did not join Craddock's ships as they searched for the East Asia Squadron off the Chilean coast in October.|$|E

5|$|The 9th SS Panzer Division {{spent the}} day {{attempting}} to force the British lines between Rauray and the Odon. Supplemented by Panzergrenadiers of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and following a preliminary bombardment, tanks and infantry of 9th SS Panzer advanced behind a smoke screen and broke through the outer British defences. The Germans were stopped by secondary positions in front of Rauray and on high ground to the south-east, although some troops penetrated as far as Haut du Bosq. Further German attacks throughout the day, were met with intense artillery fire and made no progress, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> a British counter-attack with Sherman and flame-throwing Churchill Crocodile tanks restored the original front line. The attacks were costly for both sides, thirty German tanks were claimed destroyed, mostly by the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, troops of the 12th SS Panzer Division had been repulsed during the morning and artillery fire halted attacks from other formations.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for severe weather across western Kansas and small portions of Oklahoma, Colorado and Nebraska for May 4, while temperatures {{were in the}} mid to high 80s°F (near 30°C). The atmosphere remained capped for much of the day, but storms began to develop in the late afternoon hours in western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas Panhandle. The most intense supercells developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> hours across northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. They eventually produced 25 tornadoes, including the devastating Greensburg tornado and three other extremely large tornadoes which followed the Greensburg tornado late that evening. The supercells remained intact well into the overnight hours as the extremely unstable air mass precluded rapid dissipation expected with the loss of daytime heating which would normally be expected in the Plains. The last tornado of the night did not lift until shortly after 2:00a.m. early on May 5.|$|E
5|$|Advancing northward over land, the once-powerful {{hurricane}} weakened, with {{somewhat higher}} atmospheric pressures and winds of less severity reported at Charleston, South Carolina. Paralleling the coast while situated inland, it hastened quickly toward the north, swiftly passing through North Carolina and {{arriving in the}} Chesapeake Bay region by 13October. Southeasterly gusts persisted as the storm continued its northerly progression inland along {{the course of the}} East Coast of the United States. After reaching Washington, D.C., in the early morning, it arrived near New York City by sunrise, and transited across Boston during the afternoon of 13October. The storm likely underwent an extratropical transition by the time it arrived in New York state, elongating linearly east-to-west. The gale's winds swept toward the southeast with a brief hiatus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening.</b> As it neared New England, it produced little precipitation yet intense gusts, which peaked at force9-strength in the vicinity of New Bedford, Massachusetts. The cyclone's diameter over New England, at its largest point, reached , accompanied by Category2-force winds. The system was last sighted on the morning of 14October, rapidly weakening as it meandered into the Canadian Maritimes.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> of 7 April, German {{units in}} regimental {{strength}} began {{to cross the}} Drava near Barcs and established a second bridgehead in the sector of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. Affected by propaganda from the Ustaše, the border troops abandoned their positions and withdrew to Virovitica. Fifth column activities within units of the 4th Army were fomented by the Ustaše, which facilitated German establishment of the bridgehead at Barcs, and resulted {{in a number of}} significant revolts within units. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, which had mobilised in Bjelovar, was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions. On the night of 7/8 April, the Croats of the 108th Regiment revolted, arrested their Serb officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The regiment then marched back towards Bjelovar. The revolt of the 108th Regiment meant that the entire frontage of the division had to be covered by a single regiment. During the night, patrols were sent towards the German bridgehead, but Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight. By late evening on 7 April, Petrović's reports to the Yugoslav Supreme Command noted that the 4th Army was exhausted and its morale had been degraded significantly, and that Nedeljković concurred with his commander's assessment.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{moved into}} Magomero <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> while Livingstone {{and his wife}} were {{entertaining}} some dinner guests. The estate official, Duncan MacCormick, was in another house nearby. A third building, occupied by Emily Stanton, Alyce Roach and five children, contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club. The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone's house and injured him during hand-to-hand fighting, prompting him to take refuge in the bedroom, where his wife attempted to treat his wounds. The rebels forced their way into the bedroom, and after capturing his wife, decapitated Livingstone. MacCormick, who had been alerted, was killed by a rebel spear. The attackers took the women and children of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt, having reportedly treated them well. It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use the women and children as hostages, but this remains unclear. The attack on Magomero, and in particular the killing of Livingstone, had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe's men. The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury {{for the rest of the}} uprising.|$|E
