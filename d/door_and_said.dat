500|$|In August 1991 he {{returned}} to England with a £100,000 move to Port Vale; {{he was one of}} three new arrivals, along with Peter Swan (who took him in as a lodger) and Martin Foyle. He scored a brace against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 3 September, but tore his hamstring later in the month. He finished 1991–92 with five goals in 24 games, and went on to help the [...] "Valiants" [...] to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. The club finished bottom of the Second Division, though the introduction of the Premier League meant that they were demoted to the Third Division, which was immediately re-branded as the Second Division. He scored six goals in 28 league games in 1992–93, and did not feature in the League Trophy final or the play-off final. He fell out with manager John Rudge and the two stopped speaking to each other, and Houchen later admitted that [...] "I should have knocked on the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'This is stupid'".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{criticized the}} loud {{sound on the}} album and the lyrics. Jim Farber of the Daily News said the [...] "jerry-built" [...] sound the band used for the album [...] "isn't {{anything}} to be admired". MusicOMH reviewer Alex Nunn, gave the album two stars out of five and said, [...] "Musically it's power chords and big riffs-ahoy, generic, mundane, boring stuff. The Open Door {{is an exercise in}} how not to make a sophomore album." [...] Darryl Sterdan of Jam! also rated The Open Door with two stars, highlighting Lee's voice and criticizing the [...] "lather, rinse, repeat" [...] formula used for making the songs on the [...] record. He further explained the songs together make a [...] "monotonous blast of self-indulgent Evanonsense", concluding that [...] "some door are better off staying closed". Andy Gill of The Independent also criticized The Open <b>Door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> Lee's narrow vocal range was mirrored in the [...] "restricted breadth of the band's musical and emotional range, which never strays outside the short distance from paranoid to apocalyptic, concerns addressed in as bombastic and tune-dodging a manner as possible". At the 2007 NRJ Music Awards, The Open Door received a nomination for Best International Album of the Year, and the album won Album of the Year at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards. One of the album's songs, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice", was nominated in the category of Best Hard Rock Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards.|$|E

Abdullah's wife came in yesterday evening, and told the women here that her husband was asleep, but that he would come round in the morning. I warned her not to let him stir out of <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> I would come and see him.|$|R
2500|$|... "Woodward {{just showed}} up at the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he was in the area," [...] Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was {{published}} in 2002. [...] "He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|A similar fate would befall half of St. Philip's families, and {{the church}} was so despised locally for its Tory {{associations}} that legend has it a mob came together to burn it down {{at one point during}} the later years. They were supposedly dissuaded from doing so by George Washington himself, who stood at the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "That, sir, is my church!" [...] In gratitude the stained glass window in the church's vestibule depicts him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elevators}} in {{that particular}} building were operated by young girls, and I made special arrangements with one in advance. She agreed to cooperate and {{thought it would be}} fun. I went with the gentleman to the elevator. He wasn't afraid of walking into an elevator, but when it started to move it became an unbearable experience. So I chose an unbusy time and I had him walk {{in and out of the}} elevator, back in and out. Then at a point when we walked in, I told the girl to close the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Let's go up." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1972, after Curtiss and Genie had accidentally {{been locked}} out of the Riglers' home, Curtiss said to Genie, [...] "Tell them [...] what happened" [...] and Genie pointed to the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Tell door lock"; this {{indicated}} her language included recursion, which they considered an especially important development. The scientists interpreted another utterance from 1973, [...] "Ask David see swing", as both further confirmation she had grasped recursion and the first complex sentence she produced. By this time she understood and used intensifiers such as the word very, but only tenuously grasped superlatives. She never used them in her own speech but appeared to understand them, and while she was generally better with the suffix -est than with the word most Curtiss thought Genie might not have known the actual meaning of -est. The contrast between her understanding and lack of production of superlatives furthered the researchers' belief that, {{even in the absence}} of language, her cognition had developed in some form.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, [...] "Oh, My Lover", {{one of the}} {{two other}} songs, was {{considered}} the potential hit but the completed track for [...] "He's So Fine" [...] with its now-classic 'Doo-lang doo-lang doo-lang' background vocal - the suggestion of the session's sound engineer Johnny Cue - seemed an obvious smash, although Capitol Records for whom the Tokens were house producers rejected the track: Jay Siegal of the Tokens would recall Capitol president Voyle Gilmore dismissing the track as [...] "too trite...too simple". The Tokens shopped [...] "He's So Fine" [...] to ten labels before placing it with Laurie Records.
