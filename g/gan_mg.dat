Our calculated ionization energy for acceptor Mg in the passivated system is about 30 meV shallower than that in pure GaN, in good agreement with previous experimental measurement. Our model can explain that the enhanced electroluminescence intensity of InGaN/GaN MQWs based on Mg-doped p-type GaN is due to a decrease in the ionization energy of Mg acceptor with the presence of oxygen.

40|$|The ac {{characteristics}} of <b>GaN</b> : <b>Mg</b> and undoped <b>GaN</b> layers, grown by MOVPE on sapphire substrates, are measured {{for a wide}} range of temperature and bias conditions, in order to investigate the effect of the magnesium-related level on the transport properties.

The study of the frequency dependence of the impedance, with a model including the two metallic Au/GaN junctions, the GaN layer itself, shows that, besides the effect of the differential resistance of the layer which plays a role in both sample types, the presence of a Mg-related deep level contributes to the observed variations of the peaks in the admittance curves of the p-doped samples.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} unique {{material}} properties, group III nitrides are attractive {{for the application}} in devices, e. g. heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Group III nitrides exhibit an inherent macroscopic total polarization, which {{is the sum of}} the spontaneous polarization and the piezoelectric polarization. In a metal-polar heterostructure, in which a material with wider bandgap and larger absolute total polarization is deposited on GaN, the abrupt change of the polarization leads to fixed positive interface charges. As a consequence, a two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) is formed in the GaN layer to compensate these charges. Such a 2 DEG is widely exploited in HFETs, which are seen as possible candidates to replace conventional Si-based electronic devices in the power electronic sector. Sheet electron densities up to 3 ∙ 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2 have been demonstrated. These large electron densities, however, result typically in transistors of depletion mode (d-mode) type. To allow for GaN-based HFETs which can be easily integrated in current power-switching circuit architectures, the realization of enhancement mode (e-mode) devices is of major interest. In the lighting sector, LEDs have reached a high level of maturity, which is manifested by large luminous efficacies and high device lifetimes. However, the inherent polarization in the nitrides results in an electric field in the InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW), which in turn leads to a spatial separation of electrons and holes. As a result, the internal quantum efficiency is reduced and the emission wavelength is drifting with LED current. Further, the polarization is considered {{to be one of the}} causes for the typical efficiency droop at higher currents. There is consequently significant scientific and technological interest to explore the possibility and the limits of engineering the polarization effects in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this thesis, the method of polarization engineering with quaternary AlInGaN layers is studied. AlInGaN offers the highest possible flexibility in adjusting material properties independently, e. g. bandgap and lattice constant or strain state and polarization. While tensile strained AlInGaN on GaN exhibits a large total polarization, compressively strained layers feature a strongly reduced polarization. By changing the composition and, hence, the strain state, the polarization difference can be controlled. In the first part, a comprehensive study on the growth process by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and on structural properties of AlInGaN is presented. Optimum reactor conditions for the growth of AlInGaN are identified. A wide composition range of AlInGaN layers grown on GaN is achieved, which results in a large range of strain conditions from high tensile strain, to the almost unstrained case for nearly lattice-matched compositions and finally compressive strain. While in the first and second case, a high crystal quality is achieved, in the latter case, an inferior quality is observed due to large In contents. To describe relaxation effects in AlInGaN layers with significant In content, a multi-layer model is developed. In the second part, polarization engineering is utilized to obtain both d- and e-mode HFETs. While d-mode behavior is achieved with tensile strained AlInGaN layers with a large total polarization, e-mode behavior is realized with compressively strained AlInGaN layers with low polarization. However, for compressively strained AlInGaN with larger In contents and, hence, degraded crystal quality, inferior electrical properties are observed. Improved e-mode HFET performance is obtained with almost lattice-matched AlInGaN barriers with low In and Al contents. High-polarization and low-polarization layers are combined to provide positive threshold voltage and simultaneously low parasitic sheet resistance, enabling higher drain current and large transconductance. In analogy with the n-channel HFETs, the method of polarization engineering is applied to p-channel HFETs with 2 D hole gases (2 DHGs). Despite the success of n-channel HFETs with 2 DEGs, there are only sparse results on p-channel HFETs due to challenges on both the technology and material side. First, MOVPE nitrides feature a high n-type background doping. Second, the typical acceptor in <b>GaN,</b> <b>Mg,</b> exhibits a large ionization energy of several hundred meV. Third, the effective hole mass is one order of magnitude larger than the electron mass. To overcome these challenges, an AlInGaN backbarrier with a high total polarization is used for the generation of a polarization-induced 2 DHG. Both d- and e-mode characteristics are shown and record performance figures for p-channel devices are reported. In the third part, improved LED structures with AlInGaN layers with variable polarization are investigated. First, conventional GaN barriers in a MQW are replaced by AlInGaN barriers. It is confirmed that by changing the polarization in the AlInGaN barrier, it is possible to influence the internal electric fields. A smaller polarization results in a decreased emission wavelength and in improved optical oscillator strength. The wavelength shift due to the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) is found to depend on the AlInGaN composition. Finally, a novel concept for LEDs is introduced which utilizes the superior electrical properties of a 2 DHG. An inversed p-n junction in a metal-polar layer stack is applied, which results in a reversed polarization. This is realized by using a 2 DHG as a hole reservoir and as a current spreading layer at the bottom p-GaN side. With AlInGaN backbarriers featuring a high polarization, a large sheet hole density in the 2 DHG is achieved. A proof of concept is provided by the demonstration of prototype devices with stable emission wavelength...|$|E

An AlGaN buffer layer containing only 10 % Al is well suited and may be useful as conducting buffer in optoelectronic devices. When depositing GaInN, secondary epitaxial parameters like temperature, growth rate or carrier gas composition determine the In incorporation efficiency.

40|$|Post-growth {{annealing}} and {{electron beam}} irradiation during cathodoluminescence {{were used to}} determine the chemical origin of the main optical emission lines in moderately and heavily Mg-doped GaN.

40|$|A key aspect in device {{production}} is {{the incorporation of}} dopants that can alter the electronic, magnetic or optical properties of the host material. For example, Si {{is often used to}} generate n-type <b>GaN,</b> while <b>Mg</b> is the most frequently used p-type dopant. By combining a p- and n-type doped layer, one can manufacture a p-n junction, {{which is one of the}} fundamental building blocks of semiconductor technology. On the other hand, optical doping can be achieved by introducing rare earth elements (lanthanides) into the host material, since these elements exhibit sharp emission lines in the visible and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Moreover, the incorporation of magnetic transition metals (e. g. Cr, Mn or Fe) can produce so-called dilute magnetic semiconductors, which can not only make use of the charge of electrons, but also of their spin state. Finally, impurities, like transition metals, can unintentionally be introduced during the growth process and deteriorate the electronic properties of the material. In all cases, the exact influence of the dopant or impurity on the material properties will depend on the lattice site that it occupies within the semiconductor crystal. Therefore, it is important to know where the impurities are situated and how the incorporation site can be influenced by external parameters in order to drive them into active sites. In this thesis, a systematic study of the lattice site location of impurities in GaN and AlN will be presented.|$|R

The Mg incorporation and the electrical properties have been investigated as a function of growth temperature, Ga : N flux ratio and Mg: Ga flux ratio. It was found that the incorporation of Mg and the electrical properties are highly sensitive to the Ga : N flux ratio. The highest hole mobility and lowest resistivity were achieved for slightly Ga-rich conditions. In addition to an optimal Ga : N ratio, an optimum Mg: Ga flux ratio was also observed at around 1 %. We observed a clear Mg flux window for p-type doping of GaN : 0. 31 % < Mg : Ga < 5. 0 %. A lowest resistivity of 0. 98 Ohmcm was obtained for optimized growth conditions. The p-type GaN layer then showed a hole concentration of 4. 3 x 10 ^ 17 cm^- 3 and a mobility of 15 cm^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements indicate an acceptor depth in these samples of 100 meV for a hole concentration of 5. 5 x 10 ^ 17 cm^- 3.

Samples were characterized in situ by reflection high-energy electron diffraction and ex situ by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, convergent beam electron diffraction, and secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Growth on "dry" surfaces (without a Ga wetting layer) in the N-rich regime completely inverted to N-face upon exposure to Mg. No reinversion to Ga-face was detected for subsequent layers.

40|$|By an {{improved}} understanding of Mg-doped GaN through an exhaustive review of current limitations, increased {{control over the}} material was achieved by addressing several of these issues. To address {{the issues of the}} memory effect, low sticking coefficient and high vapor pressure of Mg, a new Mg dopant source was implemented, characterized and modeled for p-type doping of GaN. The device enhanced the sticking coefficient of Mg by energizing the outgoing Mg flux, and also allowed the first reported demonstration of an abrupt junction between two non-zero Mg concentrations and a graded Mg-doped GaN film. The significant compensation of Mg acceptors at high dopant concentrations was used advantageously to develop a new ex situ resistivity analysis technique using the energy distributions of SIMS to characterize doping of buried layers. The new technique was used to identify the barrier between conductive and resistive Mg doping for increased Mg concentration, which was then used to optimize Mg-doped <b>GaN.</b> Because <b>Mg</b> doping exhibits a dependence upon the growth regime, a new growth and regime characterization technique was developed using specific RHEED intensity responses to repeat growth conditions. During the development of this technique, a new surface kinetics growth model for III-nitrides was discovered based on DMS observations, which suggests preferential buildup of the metal bilayer before growth begins with an unfamiliar cation-anion exchange process initially upon metal shutter opening. Using the new RHEED growth and regime characterization technique, a new growth technique called metal modulated epitaxy (MME) was developed to increase repeatability, uniformity and smoothness. The MME technique was enhanced with a closed-loop control using real-time feedback from RHEED transients to control shutter transitions. This enhancement, called smart shuttering, led to improved growth rate and further improvement of surface roughness and grain size, which were repeatable within low percentages. Effects of smart-shuttering MME were observed with Si, Mg and In during GaN growths.

This impurity affects electrical properties substantially, notably in p-type <b>GaN</b> doped with <b>Mg</b> where it reduces the effective acceptor concentration. Application of density-functional theory to the zincblende and wurtzite forms of GaN has indicated that dissociated H in interstitial solution assumes positive, neutral, and negative charge states. The neutral species {{is found to be}} less stable than {{one or the other of}} the charged states for all Fermi energies. Hydrogen is predicted to form a bound neutral complex with Mg, and a local vibrational mode ascribed to this complex has been observed. The authors are developing a unified mathematical description of the diffusion, reactions, uptake, and release of H in GaN at the elevated temperatures of growth and processing. Their treatment is based on zero-temperature energies from density functional theory. One objective is to assess the consistency of theory with experiment at a more quantitative level than previously. A further goal is prediction of H behavior pertinent to device processing. Herein is discussed aspects relating to p-type GaN(Mg) ...|$|R
40|$|Gallium nitride (GaN) and its related {{semiconductor}} alloys are attracting tremendous {{interest for}} their {{wide range of}} applications in blue and green LEDs, diode lasers, high-temperature and high-power electronics. Nanomaterials such as InGaN/GaN core-shell three-dimensional nanostructures {{are seen as a}} breakthrough technology for future solid-state lighting and nano-electronics devices. In a core-shell LED, the active semiconductor layers grown around a GaN core enable control over a wide range of wavelengths and applications. In this thesis the capability for the heteroepitaxial growth of a proof-of-principle core-shell LED is advanced. A design that can be applied at the wafer scale using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) crystal growth on highly uniform GaN nanorod (NR) structures is proposed. This project demonstrates understanding over the growth constraints of active layers and dopant layers. The impact of reactor pressure and temperature on the morphology and on the incorporated InN mole fraction was studied for thick InGaN shells on the different <b>GaN</b> crystal facets. <b>Mg</b> doping and effectiveness of the p-n junction for a core-shell structure was studied by extensive growth experiments and characterization. Sapphire and Si substrates were used, and at all the stages of growth and fabrication. The structures were optimized to achieve geometry homogeneity, high-aspect-ratio, incorporation homogeneity for InN and Mg dopant. The three-dimensional nature of NRs and their light emission provided ample challenges which required adaptation of characterization and fabrication techniques for a core-shell device. Finally, an electrically contacted core-shell LED is demonstrated and characterized. Achieving a proof-of-principle core-shell device could be the starting point in the development of nanostructure-based devices and new physics, or in solving technical problems in planar LEDs, such as the polarization of emitted light, the quantum-confined Stark effect, efficiency droop, or the green gap...|$|R
40|$|The {{luminescent}} {{properties of}} Mg-doped GaN have recently received particular attention, e. g., {{in the light}} of new theoretical calculations, where the deep 2. 9 [*]eV luminescence band was suggested to be the main optical signature of the substitutional Mg Ga acceptor, thus, having a rather large binding energy and a strong phonon coupling in optical transitions. We present new experimental data on homoepitaxial Mg-doped layers, which together with the previous collection of data give an improved experimental picture of the various luminescence features in Mg-doped GaN. In n-type <b>GaN</b> with moderate <b>Mg</b> doping (3 ̆c 1018 [*]cm− 3), the 3. 466 [*]eV ABE 1 acceptor bound exciton and the associated 3. 27 [*]eV donor-acceptor pair (DAP) band are the only strong photoluminescence (PL) signals at 2 [*]K, and are identified as related to the substitutional Mg acceptor with a binding energy of 0. 225 [*]±[*] 0. 005 [*]eV, and with a moderate phonon coupling strength. Interaction between basal plane stacking faults (BSFs) and Mgacceptors is suggested to give rise to a second deeper Mg acceptor species, with optical signatures ABE 2 at 3. 455 [*]eV and a corresponding weak and broad DAP peak at about 3. 15 [*]eV. The 2. 9 [*]eV PL band has been ascribed to many different processes in the literature. It might be correlated with another deep level having a low concentration, only prominent at high Mg doping in material grown by the Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition technique. The origin of the low temperature metastability of the Mg-related luminescence observed by many authors is here reinterpreted and explained as related to a separate non-radiative metastable deep level defect, i. e., not the Mg Ga acceptor...|$|R
40|$|Today {{there is}} a strong drive towards higher {{efficiency}} light emitters and devices for power electronics based on GaN and its ternary compounds. Device performance can be improved in several ways on the material level. Development of bulk GaN to substitute sapphire and SiC as substrate materials can allow lower defect density epitaxial GaN layers to be grown. Using nonpolar homoepitaxial layers alleviates the problem of polarization fields present in polar GaN epilayers. This thesis advances the field by attacking outstanding problems related to doping and its influence on structural and optical properties of GaN. Optical and structural investigations were performed on bulk GaN grown by halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) and on polar and nonpolar epitaxial GaN grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), doped with different impurities: Mg, Si, O or C. Optical characterization was done using photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and cathodoluminescence (CL) in-situ scanning electron microscope, whereas structural properties were studied by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT). A correlation between Mg doping levels and stacking fault (SF) concentration in highly Mg-doped c-plane homoepitaxial GaN layers is found. Increasing Mg concentrations, from 2 × 1018 cm- 3 to 5 × 1019 cm- 3, coincides with increasing density of small, 3 - 10 nm-sized, SFs. Emission lines ascribed to SFs are observed in CL in all the studied samples. The observed SF-related luminescence can be explained by a model where Mg atoms interacting with the nearby SF changes the confinement for holes and leads to a pronounced defectrelated luminescence. Non-polar m-plane homoepitaxial <b>GaN</b> layers with <b>Mg</b> concentration of 2 × 1018 cm- 3 and 3 × 1019 cm- 3 exhibits high density of basal SFs {{as well as a number}} of prismatic SFs. Instead of normally observed in nonpolar GaN SF-related broad lines several sharp lines are detected in the 3. 36 - 3. 42 eV region. Their relation to donor-acceptor pair recombination (DAP) was dismissed by calculating the DAP energies and fitting with the measured spectra. The sharp lines are tentatively explained by some impurities bound to point defects or SFs. The origin of two Mg related acceptor bound exciton (ABE) peaks in the emission spectra is also proposed: narrower ABE 1 peak at 3. 466 eV is identified as coming from a substitutional Mg atom. Broader emission at 3. 454 eV is deemed to be coming from a Mg acceptor atom perturbed by a nearby SF. Additionally, Mg cluster formation in the highest doped sample ([Mg] = 1 × 1020 cm- 3) was revealed by APT. Simultaneous doping by Si and O was studied for HVPE grown bulk GaN. Doping with O concentration from 1017 cm- 3 leads to a decrease in the Si concentration to less than 1016 cm- 3. Si incorporation is believed to be suppressed by the competing Ga-vacancy-O incorporation process. Bandgap narrowing by 6 meV due to high doping was observed. Donor bound exciton (DBE) lifetime was obtained from TPRL experimental data and it is found to decrease with increasing doping. In non-polar m-plane homoepitaxial GaN Si doping influences the SF-related luminescence. At moderate Si concentrations excitons are bound to the impurity atoms or impurity-SF complex. Proximity of impurity atoms changes the potential for SF creating localization for charge carriers resulting in SF-related emission. At dopant concentrations higher than the Mott limit screening destroys the carrier interaction and, thus, the exciton localization at impurity-SF complex. Finally, C-doped HVPE grown bulk GaN layers were studied by TEM, CL, and TRPL. Enhanced yellow line (YL) luminescence was observed with increasing C doping. Stability of YL in a wide temperature range (5 - 300 K) confirms that YL is due to a deep defect, likely CN-ON complex. Low-temperature CL mapping reveals a pit-like structure with different luminescence properties in different areas. DBE emission dominates in CL spectra within the pits while in pit-free areas, in contrast, two ABE lines typical for Mg-doped GaN are observed...|$|R
