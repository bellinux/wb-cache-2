6000|$|P.S. I {{have been}} again reading out V, to myself (<b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> very well), and find I don't so much mind that blighted balance! ...|$|E
60|$|No {{less than}} three times were these words repeated, <b>I</b> <b>reading</b> <b>them</b> from the motion of his lips, for {{as a matter of}} course he did not dare to speak so loud that I could hear him.|$|R

60|$|VERA. <b>I</b> shall <b>read</b> <b>them.</b> [18]How fair he looks?[18] Methinks {{he never}} seemed so noble as to-night. Liberty is blessed in {{having such a}} lover.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear this," [...] he said to Grandon and Larry. [...] "I {{think after}} <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> a strong lecture they'll behave themselves." ...|$|E
60|$|Then we let off paper crackers, each {{of which}} {{contained}} a motto, And she listened while <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them,</b> till her mother told her not to.|$|E
60|$|LADY. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> {{the first}} thing after I rode away on that poor lieutenant's horse. So you see I know what's in them; and you don't.|$|E
60|$|My Dear Aunt,--To you, {{who read}} to me stories from the History of France, before <b>I</b> could <b>read</b> <b>them</b> for myself, this Chronicle is affectionately dedicated.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, but <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> when they're {{extraordinarily}} good, and I don't go to plays. I read Balzac for instance--I {{encounter the}} admirable portrait of Val√©rie Marneffe in La Cousine Bette." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] she said; [...] "I know. And when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> {{words in}} the {{newspaper}} I said to the gudeman there, we shall have bridecake from the cottage now before Christmas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{does not}} matter," [...] said the lady; [...] "of course <b>I</b> didn't <b>read</b> <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> gave them to my maid. She {{probably}} wouldn't know the difference, anyway." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{do you do}} {{when you}} see any literal {{mistakes}} in my letters? how do you set them right? for <b>I</b> never <b>read</b> <b>them</b> over to correct them. Farewell, again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{go to the}} City now, and I shall ask all our {{creditors}} to meet me to-morrow. <b>I</b> shall <b>read</b> <b>them</b> Pearson's letter, and {{put myself}} into their hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My laws," [...] she said, [...] "are {{of myself}} a part: [...] <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> by {{examining}} my heart." [...] "True," [...] he replied; [...] "like those to Moses known, [...] Thine also are engraven upon stone." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{translated}} these fragments {{long ago}} {{in one of the}} first things I ever tried to write. The passages are as touching and fresh, the originals I mean, as when first <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them,</b> and one hears the voice of Sylvie singing: ...|$|E

6000|$|And yet I now {{wondered}} at my long blindness.

And he loved me! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mildred, {{beyond what}} you have just said I know nothing of the {{contents}} of these letters; but whatever they may be, here and now, before <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them,</b> I again offer to marry you.

6000|$|... "He {{had already}} written out Ruth's history," [...] Arnold said, his voice shaking a little. [...] "He had written {{it out in}} pencil {{on a couple of}} sheets of foolscap.

60|$|The {{first part}} was {{composed}} {{almost entirely of}} sonnets and love-poems. One after another <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>them</b> and wondered. There was nothing amateurish, nothing weak, here. They were full of glowing imagery, of brilliant colouring, of passion, of fire.

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said my friend, [...] "I {{am not so}} bad as that neither. <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>them</b> bit by bit, just as I {{could get}} a moment's time, and I believe, I shall very soon get through them." ...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{some thought}} Brando used the cards out of laziness or an {{inability}} to memorize his lines. Once on The Godfather set, Brando was asked why he wanted his lines printed out. He responded, [...] "Because <b>I</b> can <b>read</b> <b>them</b> that way." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. I {{told you}} <b>I</b> was <b>reading</b> <b>them</b> while <b>I</b> waited for you. He {{came in and}} I put them away. I suppose he suspected. It was very {{easy for him to}} get into the room after amah and I went away.|$|R
