40|$|Bob Brown wasn’t <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{freedom to}} speak, {{he was also}} {{referring}} to due process, says Natasha Cica ONE DAY, Greens Senator Bob Brown’s a rude international embarrassment, banned from the debating chamber of the Australian parliament. The next he’s a ‘sanctimonious prick’ (polite description courtesy of Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett) or the same without the sanctimony (from News Ltd journalist Matt Price). That evening, he’s on the pointy end of a bipartisan peer group snub at Canberra airport. Scroll ahead a few days, and Liberal Senator George Brandis says he’s a Nazi. It might take a real victim of Nazism, or of a pogrom - rather than someone who appropriates those experiences for contemporary political ends - to appreciate the irony of much commentary on the US President’s recent visit to the Bush Capital. It might take a Franz Kafka or his fictional Joseph K {{to remind us of}} the surreality of a state, perhaps more correctly a state of mind, where an individual asserting the primacy of rule of law, transparency and accountability in law and governance is labelled deviant. Peel away the hysteria, and that’s all Brown was really doing last Thursday. He stood in the structural heart of Australian democracy and said the following, in relation to the two Australian nationals detained without charge at Guantanamo Bay, ‘Respect Australia. Return the Australians to this nation for justice,’ and ‘If you respect the world’s laws, the world will respect you. ’ (These words came courtesy of CNN, not the Hansard of the Australian Parliament, in which the text of Brown’s statement does not appear). At Brown’s utterance, the Man of Steel turned puce. In control, George Bush winked at Howard, and prepared himself for his comeback to the second interrupting Green, Senator Kerry Nettle - ‘I love free speech. ’ Brown, and many others, extended the courtesy of clapping in response. So - free speech, round of applause. And the following came quickly to me via email from an American friend of mine in his homeland, watching images picked up by American TV cameras - ‘Today, we are all Australian (Green Party Members). Thanks for the shout-out. ’ A few years ago, that same American calmly and constructively talked me through practical strategies for countering Hansonism, and fighting conspiracies that magically linked Jewish bankers, Asian immigrants and Indigenous land rights activists. I owe him, and his acute nose for democratic freedoms and deficits, a substantial debt. Borrowing his nose, I sense above the rotting bodies of bogong moths in Canberra an especial stench around the events of last Thursday. Because Brown wasn’t <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> freedom to speak, important though that is. He was also referring to due process, which has not been extended at home or abroad to either David Hicks or Mamdouh Habib. And he was alluding to the right to be free from torture. That’s recently been alleged in respect of the treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees. The claim has been made by the since-bombed-by-terrorists International Committee of the Red Cross (a most remarkable intervention given its foundational ethic of neutrality) and Justice Richard Goldstone, former Chief Prosecutor of the UN International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Their claims concern the kind of practices denounced as unlawful by the UN Committee against Torture in 1997, and the Supreme Court of Israel in 1999. Be clear that I have no instinctive prejudice in favour of Hicks or Habib. But they are human beings, and they happen to be Australian. These dual facts mean that I - as a human being, and as an Australian - owe them, at a basically decent minimum, commitment to the protections of international and domestic law. In both letter and spirit. In 1986 Paul Foot wrote an article for the London Review of Books on the conviction of the ‘Birmingham Six’ for IRA bombings in Britain in 1974. They had consistently protested their innocence, claimed they were tortured in detention, and were eventually exonerated and released after sixteen years in prison. Foot identified ‘a link between the enormity of a crime and the ignominy of which attaches to any journalist or investigator who publicly questions the guilt of those convicted for it. ’ There may prove to be important lessons from that episode for our own place and time.

40|$|In {{the entry}} # 009, I wrote about how biology is slowly {{moving from the}} {{gathering}} of limited data about organisms to relying on mass genotyping. Even the biologists working entirely with squishy organisms are looking to the genetic databases for clues and cues. Here are a few more implications to that transition. Implication four: Eugenics We can test for genetics not only among adults and children, but even fetuses. On one small survey, five out of 76 British ethics committee members (6. 6 %) “thought that screening for red hair and freckles (with a view to termination) was acceptable. ” 1 Fœtal gene screens to determine Down syndrome or other life-changing conditions are common, and 92 % of fetuses that return positive for the test for Down Syndrome are aborted [Mansfield et al. ]. Biology has an embarrassing past in eugenics. And we’re not <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Nazis—the USA has a proud history of eugenics {{to go along with}} its proud history of hating immigrants (I mean recent immigrants, not the ones from fifty years ago, who are all swell). [The lead author of my last paper refers me to this article on eugenics 2, and having read it I too recommend the first 80 %. ] If I may resort to a dictionary definition, the OED tells us that eugenics is the science “pertaining or adapted to the production of fine offspring, esp. in the human race. ” In the past, that meant killing parents who turned out badly in life or had big noses, but hi-tech now allows us to go straight to getting rid of the offspring before anybody has put in too heavy an investment. Anyway, I won’t go further with this, but to point out that what we’ll do with all this fœtal genetic info is an open question—and a loaded one, since the only choices with a fœtus are basically carry to term or abort. The consensus seems to be that aborting due to Down syndrome is OK and aborting due to red hair is not, but there’s a whole range in between. If you know your child has a near-certain chance of getting Alzheimer’s 80 years after birth, would you abort? [This Congressional testimony 3 approximately asks this question. ] Implication five: the ethics of information aggregation turf, so I’ll be brief...|$|E
40|$|Como afirma Durand (1988), a moda é assunto caprichoso, que nos convida a falar de muitas coisas. Falar em moda não é só lembrar dos grandes estilistas e desfiles importantes é sobretudo saber como se vestem as pessoas comuns, como o fazem para seguir a última moda e adaptá-la às suas vidas cotidianas. Trata-se de falar, como é objetivo do presente estudo, como era o comportamento de moda das mulheres em Vitória da Conquista - BA, entre os anos 1950 e 1965, de como a moda está relacionada com a vida de mulheres que viviam longe das grandes centros urbanos, numa realidade interiorana, em um período de poucos recursos e de acesso limitado à informação de moda. É lembrar, também, como as mulheres de diferentes classes sociais se vestiam no momento. Não apenas falar sobre a dama da sociedade, mas sim falar de como a trabalhadora, a vendedora da pequena loja da esquina, a dona de casa, a costureira se relacionavam com a moda. Para tanto, buscamos mostrar nesta pesquisa como as práticas vestimentares estão intimamente relacionadas com o papel que a mulher desempenhava na sociedade da época. Mostramos quais foram os principais influenciadores da moda na cidade, como revistas, desfiles, concursos de beleza e eventos sociais. Procuramos retratar quem foram as principais costureiras locais, as áreas comerciais e como o binômio produção/consumo constituem-se em marcas simbólicas de distinção. A abordagem adotada na presente investigação teve como sustentação metodológica a pesquisa histórica, em que privilegiamos a análise de imagens fotográficas, ancorada na história oral, e análise de outros documentos secundários como jornais e revistas da época. Do cruzamento do documento fotográfico com outras fontes complementares é que podemos reconstruir as práticas sociais e práticas vestimentares das conquistenses.

40|$|Tattoos, Inked, Women, ImageMarked Women by Deborah Rudacille Circus freak. Drug addict. Biker chick. Whore. Tattooed {{women have}} heard it all-or seen those {{judgments}} reflected in the stares {{of people on the}} street, in restaurants, in offices-anywhere that bold ink on women is viewed as a badge of infamy. "You're such a pretty girl," a salon client once told Vanessa Vale. "But I can't stand to look at you with all those tattoos. " When Michele Stuart-Johnson came home with her first tattoo twenty years ago, her mother gasped. "You look like a ruffian," she said. Jade Gorman says her husband hates her tattoos. Shamia Johnson's spouse thinks multiple tattoos on women-including hers-"are unladylike. " Trai Dagoucon was inked for nearly a decade before either of her parents caught a glimpse of her tattoos. Both were appalled, for different reasons. "The only people who had tats in her world were bikers and wrong-side-of-the-tracks-type people," Trai says of her Southern mother. For her Asian father: "It's gangsters. " So why do these women eagerly transform themselves into walking canvases? Beauty. Identity. Power. "This is my body," says Dawn Peck, president of the Maryland chapter of the Gypsy Queens, a nationwide organization dedicated to promoting positive images of tattooed women. "And I will do what I want with my body. " What does a woman's life look like? What images, colors, shapes, and patterns define the ever-shifting contours of female identity? Butterflies, flowers, cherubs, kittens. The face of a somber little girl. Dragons, pinup girls, tribal markings. A skull with dripping vampire fangs and pink bunny ears. Leaving behind a relationship, a bad habit, a way of life; celebrating an enduring tie, a joyful event, a triumph of the will or heart: All can inspire a piece. But so can the purely aesthetic desire to claim a particularly powerful image and to make it your own. "It's hard to generalize because everybody is unique," says tattoo artist Johnny Love (né John Garancheski), who says that he has inked far more women than men in his decade in the industry. "Guys will get more violent tats, stuff from the horror/gore genre. As a rule, women want smaller, more feminine images. But plenty want outrageous stuff. " His Glen Burnie shop, Tattooed Heart, is a custom operation. Unlike most tattoo parlors, his has no flash-commercial designs-hanging on the walls. Instead, customers come in with a picture, a photograph, or just an idea. Love and his staff help them craft that into an intensely personal image that will last a lifetime. "It's art that's living and breathing," he says. "It's inside your skin cells. It's not just hanging on walls. " The one thing he actively discourages, particularly among young women, is inking the name of a lover or spouse. "We always try to talk them out of it," Love says. Still, relationships inspire many women's tattoos. "I was madly in love with a boy, and he inked a cross on my finger with India ink and a needle," says Dawn of her first tattoo, received at 16. The relationship lasted two weeks, and the wound became infected. "I was scared I would have to get my finger cut off. " Jade got her first tattoo-a gypsy woman's face on her upper arm-at 38, {{in the wake of a}} breakup. Shamia got most of her tattoos during a year of intense marital conflict that ended in divorce. "I wanted to express my own freedom," she says. One of the pieces was also a prayer for better days to come. "I got my grandparents' names tattooed on my ring finger," she says. "They were married for sixty-six years when my grandmother passed. I did it for luck. " Apparently, it worked; she has since remarried. Dawn has the names of her husband and children inked with hearts and flowers on her lower back. Jade's mother, siblings, nieces, and nephews all have a family symbol inked on their wrists. She, her older sister, and her namesake niece all sport the legend "one love" in the same spot on their inner arms. "I guess a lot of my tattoos represent bonding in one way or another," Jade says. "I like sharing tattoos with people I love. " Ink can express ethnic bonding. "I have six paw prints on my thigh," says Shamia. The image has a risqué street name-Baltimore Pussy Prints. "It's an urban black thing, and a lot of Baltimore women have them. My girlfriend and I got them together. " Some of Trai's tattoos represent her efforts to come to terms with her "culturally enigmatic" ethnicity-part Southern white, part Asian. The imperial dragon and phoenix on her back is a tribute to her grandfather, a half-Filipino/half-Chinese Bataan Death March survivor. A tattoo can celebrate life passages-such as the name "Grace" inked on Dawn's wrist to anticipate the birth of her first grandchild-but it can also mourn. Sometimes an image serves as reminder of a hard-earned life lesson, such as a beautiful poppy with the word "poison" snaking across a banner beneath. "You earn a tattoo," says Dawn, and she's not <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pain inflicted by the instrument. "Life is beautiful, but hard," agrees Jade. "When I see photos of myself before I was tattooed, I sometimes feel nostalgic-like I was a clean slate. Pure. Now I'm marked.

50|$|The Alliance of Figurative Artists was an artist-run {{discussion}} group frequented {{by a majority}} of the figurative and realist painters and sculptors in New York City in the 1970s, including artists such as Alice Neel, Philip Pearlstein, Rackstraw Downes, Paul Georges, Lois Dodd, Gaberial Laderman, Richard Miller, Larry Faden, Sam Thurston, and Howard Kalish. It was held in New York City from February 14, 1969 until the 1980s. The first three meetings were held in artists' lofts and studios and thereafter at the Educational Alliance, 197 East Broadway, NYC. Although open to all without membership, it was intended as a forum for figurative and realistic painters and sculptors who felt isolated in an art world dominated by abstract and pop styles. The panels and individual speakers were usually artists. Bring work nights were also held. The organization was close to “anarchistic” (Tillim) and the discussions were often contentious to the point of driving people away. Philip Pearlstein noted “Between two and three hundred people showed up at these meetings. I started going there regularly. It was very exciting. All they {{wanted to do was to}} have panels and guest speakers, and <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> problems of figurative art representation, and the battles became terrific. It was mostly a split between the intellectuals and the expressionists; the ‘heads and the guts’”. The Artist’s Choice Museum grew out of the Alliance.|$|R
