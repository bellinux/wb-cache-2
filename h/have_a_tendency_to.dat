They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> use weasel words {{as part of a}} propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E

5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves {{can be used in}} monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.|$|E
5|$|With his group, Glicken {{compiled}} a landmark {{study in the}} field of volcanic landslides, establishing the principle that tall volcanoes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> collapse. The study garnered praise for its unique conclusions and attention to detail, inspiring volcanologists to identify similar deposit mounds at volcanoes around the world. After the findings from his dissertation were published in several shorter articles throughout the 1980s, Glicken earned recognition as the first geologist to explain the creation of hummock fields near tall volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, {{and the two}} chat in a hot tub. While {{reaching}} for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection {{of his time in}} the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E
5|$|Goldfish, {{domestication}} of: In ancient China, {{various species}} of carp (collectively known as Asian carps) were domesticated {{and have been}} reared as food fish for thousands of years. Some of these normally gray or silver species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420). During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. Goldfish were introduced into Europe during the 17th century, and into North America in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E

5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), {{also known}} as Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, is a rather starling-like bird, which is {{currently}} thought to be member of the crow family, Corvidae, though this is uncertain. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in overall colour which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> bleach to brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and the eye {{is surrounded by a}} band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the agencies {{have been accused of}} giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E
5|$|The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr {{attempted}} to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy {{in the light}} of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome sin on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.|$|E

5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E
