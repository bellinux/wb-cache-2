2500|$|The Iberian Peninsula has {{a highly}} varied {{geography}} {{with a central}} Meseta, a vast, flat plateau, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges and {{cut off from the}} rest of Europe by the Pyrenees. This meant that several distinct cultures co-existed on the peninsula with several unique cuisines. Since Ancient times it had been a colony of several Mediterranean cultures. The Phoenicians introduced the cultivation of olives and the Greeks brought the Malvasia grape, founding a wine industry that would become renowned in the Middle Ages. But it was the Roman Empire, of which the peninsula was the westernmost outpost, that had the biggest impact on Iberian cuisine. After the collapse of Roman rule, Visigothic invaders conquered most of the modern day Spain and Portugal in the 5th century. The Visigoths took on many Roman customs, like the focus on vegetables, and used Latin for official purposes. But it was the invasions of North African Muslims and the establishment of Al-Andalus that gave Iberian cuisine its unique nature. The Muslims brought with them the highly refined cuisine influenced by Arab courts in the Middle East. The center of this Arab civilization was Baghdad, at the time one of the largest cities in the world. The new rulers introduced many new customs and foodstuffs; goblets made of glass rather than metal, savory meat dishes cooked with <b>fruit,</b> <b>spices</b> and herbs like cinnamon, mastic, caraway, sesame and mint and the use of ground almonds or rice as thickeners and a fondness for adding tangy liquids like verjuice, tamarind and the juice of bitter oranges to produce a distinctly sweet-sour taste. The impact can clearly be seen in the multitude of Arab loanwords in Spanish; naranja [...] "orange", azúcar ("sugar"), alcachofa ("artichoke"), azafrán ("saffron") and espinaca ("spinach"), many of which eventually spread to other languages in Europe. The Spanish Muslims established the sequences of dishes which was to permeate the entire continent and which is still forms the basis for many modern European meals; soup followed by meat dishes and finished off with sweets. It also believed that escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, could very well be of Arab-Persian origin, though this has been contested.|$|E

5000|$|In the Middle Ages, [...] "bake mete" [...] {{described}} a pie in which meat or fish is baked with <b>fruit,</b> <b>spices,</b> etc. The meats and sauces {{were placed in}} a tough and inedible pastry shell, or [...] "coffin" [...] with a lid sealed on, then baked.

The process of raising {{the sides of the}} pie to form a strong protective crust is described in old cookery books as [...] "raising the coffin".The term [...] "mete" [...] referred to the pie, not the meat: a 15th-century cookbook gives a bake mete recipe for a pear custard pie.|$|E

5000|$|Moroccan and Algerian tajine {{dishes are}} slow-cooked savory stews, {{typically}} made with sliced meat, poultry or fish together with vegetables or <b>fruit.</b> <b>Spices,</b> nuts, and dried fruits are also used. Common spices include ginger, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and saffron. Paprika and chili {{are used in}} vegetable tajines. The sweet and sour combination is common in tajine dishes like lamb with dates and spices. Tajines are generally served with bread. Because the domed or cone-shaped lid of the tajine pot traps steam and returns the condensed liquid to the pot, a minimal amount of water is needed to cook meats and vegetables. This method of cooking is practical in areas where water supplies are limited or where public water is not yet available.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{the term}} kompot or compote refers euphemistically to kompot, a {{traditional}} compote-like dessert popular in Central and Eastern European countries made of stewed <b>fruit,</b> <b>spices,</b> and sugar. The so-called kompot method of making a crude opiate [...] "cocktail" [...] intended for injection involves stewing the pods of the opium poppy in nearly boiling water and an acid, and using the strained liquid (essentially like kompot is produced from the raw ingredients). However, in 1976 two Polish students from Gdańsk discovered a simple way of making it by extracting opiate alkaloids from poppy straw by using ion exchange resin, acetone, ammonia water and a few other chemicals used in the last step of production. In this method, opium poppy pods and stems are boiled in water for a few hours without adding acid, and then filtered. Strongly acidic ion exchange resin is then added. The resin is filtered and the opiates are recovered with the addition of ammonia water. The resulting liquid is evaporated using a chemical condenser, then when dry (it is then called glazura - glaze) it is acetylated using acetic anhydride in an anhydrous environment of a non-polar solvent, for example toluene, diethyl ether, chloroform, or most commonly acetone. After acetylation, the solvent is evaporated to remove the acetic anhydride, and finally water is added. The amount of water added depends on the amount of plant material used {{in the beginning of the}} process, most often 30 milliliters per kilogram of dry plant material. Although the drug is primarily intended for intravenous injection, kompot extraction as described here produces an end product containing residual plant matter, waste chemicals, impure water, and other contaminants, making this dangerous substance to inject since such impurities can lead to abscesses or anaphylactic shock.|$|E
