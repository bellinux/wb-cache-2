That same year Nortel announced its [...] "Digital World" [...] project, which foresaw {{the development and}} market introduction of a complete family of digital switching, transmission and business communications systems.|$|E
50|$|The Primary Rate Interface {{channels}} are typically used by medium to large enterprises with <b>digital</b> <b>private</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PBX) telephone systems to provide digital {{access to the}} {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN).

5000|$|It {{was derived}} from its South Bay Area cousin Silicon Valley. In 1969, Don Green, later nicknamed the [...] "Father of Telecom Valley", founded Digital Telephone Systems (DTS) in San Rafael, CA. It is {{considered}} the original seed for Telecom Valley which developed farther north in Sonoma County driven by lower cost facilities and housing. Digital Telephone Systems was an early innovator in the Telecom Equipment arena developing a Digital loop carrier (DLC) and <b>digital</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchange</b> systems. Bell Labs and Western Electric, the R&D and manufacturing arms of the original AT&T Bell System dominated the DLC markets with the SLC-96 and SLC series 5 systems prior to the 1984 Bell System divestiture. Digital Telephone Systems was purchased by Farinon Corporation which was subsequently acquired by Harris Corporation of Melbourne, Florida in 1980.|$|E
50|$|A {{telephone}} VoIP adapter (TVA), {{also called}} digital telephone adapter, is {{a device that}} allows <b>digital</b> PBX (<b>Private</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchange)</b> telephone handsets, e.g., Nortel Meridian, and BCM or Siemens Optiset/Optpoint, {{to be connected to}} a VoIP network, using, for example, SIP (session initiation protocol).|$|R
5000|$|Inose {{was well}} known, internationally, for his {{invention}} of the TSI system {{while he was at}} AT&T Bell Laboratories. The idea of the TSI was to implement time switches into digital switching systems. The system collects data and stores them in a time slot and allows the time slot to be interchanged with another. It contains one physical input and one physical output. [...] "He built a prototype digital time-division multiplexing (TDM) electronic switching system called CAMPUS, which is based on the TSI principle..." [...] Although this invention was crucial, it did not receive much recognition due to costly memory devices. Later in the 1970s when semiconductor technologies began advancing, TSI received more recognition. Since its first commercial deployment in 1976, it has been popular and utilized amongst the digital central office switching systems and <b>digital</b> <b>private</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transcript, 38 pp. French {{computer}} engineer Marc Levilion reflects {{upon his}} career with computers and computer networking that spanned from the 1950 s to the 1990 s. Levilion describes his 33 -year employment with IBM France, where he worked on projects {{at the intersection of}} computing and telecommunications including error-detection and correction codes, IBM <b>digital</b> <b>Private</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchanges,</b> IBM’s Systems Network Architecture (SNA), and IBM contributions to the X. 21 and X. 25 international standards. Levilion describes the relationship between IBM facilities in La Gaude, France and Raleigh, North Carolina; compares the networking concepts behind SNA, X. 21, and X. 25 to the concepts deployed in the Arpanet and by Louis Pouzin in Cyclades; and explains IBM’s global standards strategy and IBM’s involvement with French standards committees, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the European Computer Manufacturers’ Association, and the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique. Levilion reflects on his participation in Open Systems Interconnection in various roles: as IBM France representative to committees in Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR), as head of the AFNOR delegation to ISO, and as convenor of the OSI architecture Working Group. This set of nine interviews conducted with Tilly Bayard-Richard, Najah Naffah, Louis Pouzin, Marc E. Levilion, Michel Gien, Jean-Louis Grangé, Gérard Le Lann, Rémi Després, and André Danthine was funded by the ACM History Committee with a fellowship on “European Contributions to Computer Networks: An Oral History Project. ”ACM History Committe...|$|R

50|$|A key {{telephone}} system was originally distinguished from a <b>private</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PBX) {{in that it}} did not require an operator or attendant at the switchboard to establish connections between the central office trunks and stations, or between stations. Technologically, <b>private</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> share lineage with central office telephone systems, and in larger or more complex systems, may rival a central office system in capacity and features. With a {{key telephone}} system, a station user could control the connections directly using line buttons, which indicated the status of lines with built-in lamps.|$|R

50|$|The term PBX {{originated}} when switchboard operators managed company switchboards manually using cord circuits. As automated electromechanical {{switches and}} later electronic switching systems gradually replaced the manual systems, the terms <b>private</b> automatic <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PABX) and <b>private</b> manual <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PMBX) differentiated them. Solid-state digital systems were {{sometimes referred to}} as electronic <b>private</b> automatic <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> (EPABX). , the term PBX {{is by far the most}} widely recognized.
