25|$|The 1986 NSWRL Grand Final at the SCG {{between the}} John Monie coached Parramatta and {{defending}} premiers Canterbury-Bankstown, coached by Warren Ryan, and played <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the smallest Grand Final crowds in years (45,843), {{would go down}} as the lowest scoring and only try-less Grand Final in NSWRL history. Parramatta won their 4th premiership in six years with a tough 4–2 win thanks to two Mick Cronin goals to send captain Ray Price, and Cronin, into rugby league retirement on the winning note they deserved after stellar careers for Parramatta, NSW and Australia. Cronin retired from the game having scored 1,971 points in the Sydney premiership (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals, all for Parramatta), {{at the time the}} record number of points scored in a career.|$|E
25|$|Lord Clifden {{started the}} 1864 {{season in the}} Claret Stakes in April, where he only faced two rivals. As Parr led him onto the course a large crowd {{surrounded}} him. They got so close {{that they had to}} be ordered to get back of course officials. After the start, Rapid Rhone had a clear lead. Lord Clifden never got on terms and faded in the straight to finish second, ten lengths behind Rapid Rhone. On 9 June at Royal Ascot he run in the Gold Cup <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest crowds ever seen at Ascot. However he spent the whole of the race {{at the rear of the}} field and could not challenge the leaders. In the end he finished unplaced, over 20 lengths behind winner Scottish Chief. Little Stag was second and Lord Zetland third. In late July Lord Clifden was allotted top weight of 8st 12lb for the Chesterfield Cup run over one and a quarter miles at Goodwood. With half of a mile left to run, Lord Clifden was struck into by his half-sister Lady Clifden. This caused him to blunder and fall on his head, throwing John Osbourne to the ground, although the jockey did not sustain any serious injuries. The race was won by King of Utopia. Later the same day Lord Clifden walked over for a sweepstakes of £100 each. He was then retired to stud. For part of his four-year-old season, Lord Clifden was trained by William Bevill.|$|E
500|$|Davison's {{purpose in}} {{attending}} the Derby and walking onto {{the course is}} unclear. She did not discuss her plans with anyone or leave a note. Several theories have been suggested, including that she intended to cross the track, believing that all horses had passed; {{that she wanted to}} pull down the King's horse; that she was trying to attach one of the WSPU flags to a horse; or that she intended to throw herself <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the horses.

50|$|The fear of {{conflict}} in a team stems from an absence of trust, more specifically vulnerability based trust.

However, if team members trust each other and are comfortable being vulnerable <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> another, then debates can be a pursuit of a better and more effective method to achieve a task.|$|R

The second touchdown was scored at the 9-minute mark in the first half by left tackle Hugh White on a [...] "mass play" [...] on Chicago's left end. Shorts missed the kick for goal from touchdown. In the second half, Shorts scored Michigan's third touchdown after 5:45 had been played in the second half but missed the kick for goal as Michigan extended its lead to 16–0. Shorts also scored Michigan's fourth touchdown and kicked goal at the 7:30 mark of the second half. Michigan's defense held Chicago to three first downs, never allowed the Maroons into field goal range, and forced 11 punts while the Wolverines punted only once.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 March 1985, the Jesus and Mary Chain {{played a}} gig at the North London Polytechnic <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their largest crowds {{up to that}} point. The {{organizers}} had overbooked the venue, leaving hundreds of fans locked outside. When Gillespie and Hart attempted to break the locks, the police were called. Support band Meat Whiplash had stirred up violence before the Mary Chain set foot onto the stage when singer Paul McDermott threw an empty wine bottle into the audience, prompting {{four members of the}} crowd to attack him, leading to their set being abandoned. Second act The Jasmine Minks got through their set without incident, but the Jesus and Mary Chain then kept the audience waiting for over an hour before taking the stage, and then left the stage after playing for less than twenty minutes. Members of the audience began throwing cans at where the band were hiding behind the stage curtains, before mounting the stage to smash the equipment that remained there. The violence continued for some time before police eventually took control. The venue blamed the band's late appearance and two equipment breakdowns, while McGee issued a statement saying that [...] "the audience were not smashing up the hall, they were smashing up pop music", going on to say [...] "This is truly art as terrorism". The violence soon started to become a hindrance to the band, with people attending concerts simply for the violence rather than the music, William commenting [...] "I hate it, I despise it. It gets in the way in terms of getting more gigs, and it {{gets in the way of}} our image". Many performances were cancelled during the remainder of 1985, with promoters or local councils not prepared to risk a riot. The violence flared up again at a performance at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town in September, with bottles thrown at the band while they played, and a section of the audience smashing up the amplification equipment and smashing the lights afterwards, with several people injured by flying glass. A major factor in the audience reaction was the length of the band's sets at the time, which lasted less than twenty-five minutes, Jim explaining this with [...] "there's never been a group good enough to play any longer". Lack of songs was also a factor, according to Jim: [...] "We've only got enough songs to play for that long".|$|E
