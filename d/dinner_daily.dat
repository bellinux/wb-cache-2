60|$|The gentlemen ushers had a {{table at}} Kensington, and the Guard a very splendid <b>dinner</b> <b>daily</b> at St. James's, at either of which ordinaries Esmond was free to dine. Dick Steele liked the Guard-table better than his own at the gentlemen ushers', where there was less wine and more ceremony; and Esmond had many a jolly {{afternoon}} in company of his friend, and a hundred times at least saw Dick into his chair. If there is verity in wine, according to the old adage, what an amiable-natured character Dick's must have been! In proportion as he took in wine he overflowed with kindness. His talk was not witty so much as charming. He {{never said a word}} that could anger anybody, and only became the more benevolent the more tipsy he grew. Many of the wags derided the poor fellow in his cups, and chose him as a butt for their satire: but there was a kindness about him, and a sweet playful fancy, that seemed to Esmond far more charming than the pointed talk of the brightest wits, with their elaborate repartees and affected severities. I think Steele shone rather than sparkled. Those famous beaux-esprits of the coffee-houses (Mr. William Congreve, for instance, when his gout and his grandeur permitted him to come among us) would make many brilliant hits--half a dozen in a night sometimes--but, like sharp-shooters, when they had fired their shot, they were obliged to retire under cover till their pieces were loaded again, and wait till they got another chance at their enemy; whereas Dick never thought that his bottle companion was a butt to aim at--only a friend to shake by the hand. The poor fellow had half the town in his confidence; everybody knew everything about his loves and his debts, his creditors or his mistress's obduracy. When Esmond first came on to the town, honest Dick was all flames and raptures for a young lady, a West India fortune, whom he married. In a couple of years the lady was dead, the fortune was all but spent, and the honest widower was as eager in pursuit of a new paragon of beauty, as if he had never courted and married and buried the last one.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is the {{assessment}} of the dietary habits of Greek alpine ski athletes, with regard to the consumption of specific food groups as well as the evaluation of their compliance with the official dietary recommendations of international organizations. The sample consisted of 65 Greek skiers, both experienced and inexperienced. Three groups of trainees participated: 1) a group of students of Athens, elective skiing – 28 people, 2) a group of students of Athens, specialization skiing – 21 people, 3) group of experienced skiers - 16 people. The sample taking was based on the following criteria: a) the skiers had to be Greek, b) to be over 18 years old, c) the questionnaires had to be completed anonymously in their leisure time. The questionnaires were given to the participants, including the following subjects: frequency of <b>daily</b> <b>dinners,</b> <b>daily</b> intake of cereals – baked products, daily intake of dairy products, daily intake of animal protein, daily intake of seafood, daily intake of fatty food, daily intake of vegetables – juice – fruit and daily intake of sweets. Taking into account the results, we are driven to the following conclusions: the update of information of skiers concerning the intake of wrong food is considered necessary. It is ascertained that the majority of people (83 %) in all three groups (elective, specialization, experienced skiers) have 4 - 5 <b>dinners</b> <b>daily.</b> The majority of people in three groups have less than 3 servings daily: of animal protein, dairy products, vegetables, fruit and juice...|$|R

6000|$|We must go {{back for}} a while to Gatherum Castle and see the guests whom the Duchess had {{collected}} there for her Christmas festivities. The hospitality of the Duke's house had been maintained almost throughout the autumn. Just at the end of October they went to Matching, for what the Duchess called a quiet month,--which, however, at the Duke's urgent request became six weeks. But even here the house was full all the time, though from deficiency of bedrooms the guests were very much less numerous. But at Matching the Duchess had been uneasy and almost cross. Mrs. Finn had gone with her husband to Ireland, and she had taught herself to fancy that she could not live without Mrs. Finn. And her husband had insisted upon having round him politicians of his own sort, men who really preferred work to archery, or even to hunting, and who discussed the evils of direct taxation absolutely in the drawing-room. The Duchess was assured that the country could not be governed by the support of such men as these, and was very glad to get back to Gatherum,--whither also came Phineas Finn with his wife, and the St. Bungay people, and Barrington Erle, and Mr. Monk, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Lord and Lady Cantrip, and Lord and Lady Drummond,--Lord Drummond being the only representative of the other or coalesced party. And Major Pountney was there, having been urgent with the Duchess,--and having fully explained to his friend Captain Gunner that he had acceded to the wishes of his hostess only on the assurance of her Grace that the house would not be again troubled by the presence of Ferdinand Lopez. Such assurances were common between the two friends, but were innocent, as, of course, neither believed the other. And Lady Rosina was again there,--with many others. The melancholy poverty of Lady Rosina had captivated the Duke. [...] "She shall come and live here, if you like," [...] the Duchess had said in answer to a request from her husband on his new friend's behalf,--"I've no doubt she will be willing." [...] The place was not crowded as it had been before; but still about thirty guests sat down to <b>dinner</b> <b>daily,</b> and Locock, Millepois, and Mrs. Pritchard were all kept hard at work. Nor was our Duchess idle. She was always making up the party,--meaning the coalition,--doing something to strengthen the buttresses, writing little letters to little people, who, little as they were, might become big by amalgamation. [...] "One has always to be binding one's fagot," [...] she said to Mrs. Finn, having read her Æsop not altogether in vain. [...] "Where should we have been without you?" [...] she had whispered to Sir Orlando Drought when that gentleman was leaving Gatherum at the termination of his second visit. She had particularly disliked Sir Orlando, and was aware that her husband had on this occasion been hardly as gracious as he should have been, in true policy, to so powerful a colleague. Her husband had been peculiarly shy of Sir Orlando since the day on which they had walked together in the park,--and, consequently, the Duchess had whispered to him. [...] "Don't bind your fagot too conspicuously," [...] Mrs. Finn had said to her. Then the Duchess had fallen to a seat almost exhausted by labour, mingled with regrets, and by the doubts which from time to time pervaded even her audacious spirit. [...] "I'm not a god," [...] she said, [...] "or a Pitt, or an Italian with a long name beginning with M., that I {{should be able to do}} these things without ever making a mistake. And yet they must be done. And as for him,--he does not help me in the least. He wanders about among the clouds of the multiplication table, and thinks that a majority will drop into his mouth because he does not shut it. Can you tie the fagot any better?" [...] "I think I would leave it untied," [...] said Mrs. Finn. [...] "You would not do anything of the kind. You'd be just as fussy as I am." [...] And thus the game was carried on at Gatherum Castle from week to week.|$|E

This 3 -year longitudinal study examines cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between family food involvement, family dinner meal frequency and dietary patterns during late childhood. Questionnaires were completed by parents of 188 children from Greater Melbourne, Australia at baseline in 2002 (mean age = 11. 25 years) and at follow-up in 2006 (mean age = 14. 16 years). Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify dietary patterns. Factor analysis (FA) {{was used to determine}} the principal factors from six indicators of family food involvement. Multiple linear regression models were used to predict the dietary patterns of children and adolescents at baseline and at follow-up, 3 years later, from baseline indicators of family food involvement and frequency of family dinner meals. PCA revealed two dietary patterns, labeled a healthful pattern and an energy-dense pattern. FA revealed one factor for family food involvement. Cross-sectionally among boys, family food involvement score (β = 0. 55, 95 % CI: 0. 02, 1. 07) and eating family <b>dinner</b> meals <b>daily</b> (β = 1. 11, 95 % CI: 0. 27, 1. 96) during late childhood were positively associated with the healthful pattern.

40|$|Background: Warfarin is an {{effective}} oral anticoagulant which exert its effect by blocking the utilization of vitamin K. Warfarin therapy requires ongoing monitoring using the international normalized ratio (INR). In this study, effect of modest increase in vitamin K intake from vegetables on INR values was evaluated in warfarin treated patients. Methods: A single-center study involving 24 outpatients (mean age, 62 years) with two last INR in therapeutic range in which INR variations was less than 0. 5. Patients were selected based on their VKORC 1 1639 G→A polymorphism so that 8 patients from each of GG, AA or GA genotypes were recruited. Patients were asked to consume a vegetable mix (including lettuce, peeled cucumber and tomato) containing approximately 100 µg vitamin K (divided in two meals, lunch and <b>dinner)</b> <b>daily</b> for one week when INR response was measured. Results: Daily consumption of vegetable mix decreased patient’s INR from 2. 43 ± 0. 51 to 2. 08 ± 0. 46 (P< 0. 001). INR value had {{a significant decrease in}} each VKORC 1 genotypes (from 2. 55 ± 0. 55 to 2. 21 ± 0. 54 in GG, 2. 35 ± 0. 33 to 2. 00 ± 0. 25 in AA, and   2. 39 ± 0. 65 to 2. 00 ± 0. 25 in GA) but the values did not differ between genotypes. Conclusions: Daily increase in vegetable salad containing approximately 100 µg, decreased INR of patients. Therefore, avoiding variation in consumption of foods with even moderate content of vitamin K could help to prevent INR fluctuations in warfarin treated patients. </p...|$|E
