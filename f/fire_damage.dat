5|$|The {{church was}} said to have been rebuilt, after serious <b>fire</b> <b>damage,</b> around 1257–1265, though whether this was a rebuilding, or a {{continuation}} of work commenced after 1246, is unclear. It is not inconceivable that the <b>fire</b> <b>damage</b> was caused when, in 1256, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, with a large army, seized Llanbadarn Fawr from Norman control. Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, son of King Henry III and brother of King Edward I, was Lord of Cardigan from 1265. Given the size of the church it is probable that construction took many years, even if it were not interrupted. If it commenced in 1246 it is quite conceivable that work was not complete until 1265, or later.|$|E

5|$|The {{center of}} the city {{contained}} several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber-made workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to <b>fire</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Beiyang Fleet. Jingyuen was part of a flotilla which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Jingyuan first saw action during the First Sino-Japanese War.

She sank upright in shallow water, and Admiral Ding Ruchang gave orders for her to be destroyed by a naval mine. She was raised the follow year for scrap.|$|E

Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by <b>fire.</b> <b>Damage</b> to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through {{the core of the}} {{building}} to the 9th and 14th floors, as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors, had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the <b>fire</b> <b>damage</b> on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no fire sprinkler systems.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to <b>fire</b> <b>damage</b> at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, {{was established by}} Bishop Andreas before 1237 for {{the aid of the}} poor. It suffered <b>fire</b> <b>damage</b> in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.|$|E

5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict <b>fire</b> <b>damage.</b> Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, fire {{accidents}} {{have been}} steadily increased {{and the amount}} of property damage caused by the accidents has gradually raised. <b>Damaging</b> building structure, <b>fire</b> incidents bring about not only such property damage but also strength degradation and member deformation. As a result, the building structure undermines its structural ability. Examining the degradation and the deformation is very important because reusing the building is more economical than reconstruction. Therefore, engineers need to investigate the strength degradation and member deformation well, and make sure that they apply right rehabilitation methods. This study aims at evaluating deformation characteristics of <b>fire</b> <b>damaged</b> and rehabilitated normal strength concrete beams through both experiments and finite element analyses. For the experiments, control beams, <b>fire</b> <b>damaged</b> beams and rehabilitated beams are tested to examine deformation characteristics. Ten test beam specimens with compressive strength of 21 MPa are fabricated and main test variables are selected as cover thickness of 40 mm and 50 mm and fire exposure time of 1 hour or 2 hours. After heating, <b>fire</b> <b>damaged</b> beams are air-recurred for 2 months and rehabilitated beams are repaired with polymeric cement mortar after being removed the <b>fire</b> <b>damaged</b> concrete cover. All beam specimens are tested under four points loading. FE analyses are executed to investigate the effects of main parameters applied to experimental study. Test results show that both maximum load and stiffness of the rehabilitated beams are higher than those of the <b>fire</b> <b>damaged</b> beams. In addition, predicted structural behaviors from the analyses also show good rehabilitation effect and the predicted load-deflection curves are similar to the experimental results. For the further, the proposed analytical method can be used to predict deformation characteristics of <b>fire</b> <b>damaged</b> and rehabilitated concrete beams without suffering from time and cost consuming of experimental process.
