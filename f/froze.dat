40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the <b>freezing</b> point (Tf) of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fish burger using the cooling curve and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. Cooling curves were obtained for two household refrigerators, a freezer with no quick <b>freeze</b> function and another one equipped with a quick <b>freeze</b> compartment. <b>Freezing</b> point, <b>freezing</b> time and <b>freezing</b> rates were determined from the cooling curves. The freezers showed slow <b>freezing</b> rates ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 40 cm/h. The quick <b>freeze</b> function improved the <b>freezing</b> process, as it significantly reduced the <b>freezing</b> times by significantly increasing <b>freezing</b> rates. Tf of the tilapia fish burger was (− 2. 7 ± 0. 1) °C and no significant difference between <b>freezing</b> rates and the DSC method was observed. This investigation demonstrated that the cooling curve method using a simple experimental apparatus and domestic refrigerators can be used to measure <b>freezing</b> point of high moisture foods...|$|R
40|$|An {{explanation}} for why hot water will sometime <b>freeze</b> more rapidly than cold water is offered. Two specimens {{of water from the}} same source will often have different spontaneous <b>freezing</b> temperatures; that is, the temperature at which <b>freezing</b> begins. When both specimens supercool and the spontaneous <b>freezing</b> temperature of the hot water is higher than that of the cold water, then the hot water will usually <b>freeze</b> first, if all other conditions are equal and remain so during cooling. The probability that the hot water will <b>freeze</b> first if it has the higher spontaneous <b>freezing</b> temperature will be larger for a larger difference in spontaneous <b>freezing</b> temperature. Heating the water may lower, raise or not change the spontaneous <b>freezing</b> temperature. The keys to observing hot water <b>freezing</b> before cold water are supercooling the water and having {{a significant difference in the}} spontaneous <b>freezing</b> temperature of the two water specimens.

40|$|AbstractFresh {{harvested}} {{dates are}} perishable {{and there is}} a need for extending their shelf life while preserving their fresh like quality characteristics.

Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces.
