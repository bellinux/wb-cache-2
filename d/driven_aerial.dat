In terrestrial species, oxygen chemosensation is primarily through internal sensors, whereas in aquatic animals, such as the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, external oxygen chemo - receptors {{are thought to be}} more important, due to the low partial pressure of oxygen in water. It has been hypothesized that an external chemosensory organ, the osphradium, modulates aerial respiratory behaviour in hypoxic conditions in Lymnaea, but recent data indicate that {{this may not be the}} case. In the present study, we removed the input from this organ to the central nervous system and measured aerial respiratory behaviour. We assessed breathing behaviour prior to surgery and then operated on the snails, severing either (1) the osphradial nerve proximal to the osphradium or (2) the right internal parietal (RIP) nerve into which the osphradial nerve, in addition to other axons from the lung/pneumostome area, projects. We also used a sham-operated control group. Severing either the osphradial or RIP nerve did not alter breathing behaviour in eumoxic or hypoxic conditions relative to the behaviour prior to surgery or that of sham-operated animals.

50|$|Cyclic {{stress is}} the {{distribution}} of forces (aka stresses) that change over time in a repetitive fashion. As an example, consider {{one of the large}} wheels used to <b>drive</b> an <b>aerial</b> lift such as a ski lift. The wire cable wrapped around the wheel exerts a downward force on the wheel and the drive shaft supporting the wheel. Although the shaft, wheel, and cable move, the force remains nearly vertical relative to the ground.

40|$|Morphogenesis in the streptomycetes {{features}} the differentiation of substrate-associated vegetative hyphae into upwardly growing aerial filaments. This transition requires {{the activity of}} bld genes and the secretion of biosurfactants that reduce the surface tension at the colony–air interface enabling the emergence of nascent aerial hyphae. Streptomyces coelicolor produces two classes of surface-active molecules, SapB and the chaplins. While both mol-ecules are important for aerial development, nothing {{is known about the}} functional redundancy or interac-tion of these surfactants apart from the observation that aerial hyphae formation can proceed via one of two pathways: a SapB-dependent pathway when cells are grown on rich medium and a SapB-independent pathway on poorly utilized carbon sources such as mannitol. We used mutant analysis to show that while the chaplins are important, but not required, for devel-opment on rich medium, they are essential for differ-entiation on MS (soy flour mannitol) medium, and the corresponding developmental defects could be sup-pressed by the presence of SapB. Furthermore, the chaplins are produced by conditional bld mutants during aerial hyphae formation when grown on the permissive medium, MS, suggesting that the previ-ously uncharacterized SapB-independent pathway is chaplin dependent. In contrast, a bld mutant blocked in aerial morphogenesis on all media makes neither SapB nor chaplins. Finally, we show that a con-structed null mutant that lacks all chaplin and SapB biosynthetic genes fails to differentiate in any growth condition. We propose that the biosurfactant activi-ties of both SapB and the chaplins are essential for normal aerial hyphae formation on rich medium, while chaplin biosynthesis and secretion alone <b>drives</b> <b>aerial</b> morphogenesis on MS medium...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} simple {{solution}} for stabilization of a nano-hexacopter carrying a manipulator arm {{in order to increase}} the type of missions achievable by these types of systems. The manipulator arm is attached to {{the lower part of the}} hexacopter. The motion of the arm induces a change of the center of mass of the whole body, which induces torques which can produce the loss of stability. The present work deals with the stabilization of the whole system-that is hexacopter and arm-by means of a set of nonlinear control laws. First, an attitude control, stabilizes the hexacopter to a desired attitude taking into account the movement of the arm. Then, a suitable virtual control and the translational dynamics allow the formulation of a nonlinear controller, which <b>drives</b> the <b>aerial</b> vehicle to a desired position.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the relationship between man and environment in the Adige and Po fluvial systems and their influences to the natural and artificial landscapes during the centuries.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{decentralized}} controller to <b>drive</b> multiple unmanned <b>aerial</b> vehicles (UAVs) into a symmetric formation of regular polygon shape surrounding a mobile target. The proposed controller works for time-varying information exchange topologies among agents and preserves a network connectivity while steering UAVs into a formation. The proposed nonlinear controller is highly generalized and offers flexibility in achieving the control objective due to the freedom of choosing controller parameters {{from a range of}} values. By the virtue of additional tuning parameters, i. e. fractional powers on proportional and derivative difference terms, the nonlinear controller procures a family of UAV trajectories satisfying the same control objective. An appropriate adjustment of the parameters facilitates in generating smooth UAV trajectories without causing abrupt position jumps. The convergence of the closed-loop system is analyzed and established using the Lyapunov approach. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller which outperforms an existing formation controller by driving a team of UAVs elegantly in a target-centric formation. We also present a nonlinear observer to estimate vehicle velocities with the availability of position coordinates and heading angles. Simulation results show that the proposed nonlinear observer results in quick convergence of the estimates to its true values...|$|R

Yet, delivering high reso-lution images of the supervised surface to rescuers is time-critical. To help resolving this problem, we study how UAVs can take ad-vantage of their controlled mobility to derive the optimum strategy for data transmission. <b>Driven</b> by real-world <b>aerial</b> experiments with both airplanes and quadrocopters equipped with 802. 11 n technol-ogy, we show that the UAV should not necessarily transmit as soon as a wireless link is established. Instead, it should wait until it reaches a suitable distance to the receiving UAV, only to transmit when the time to move to the new location and transmit is mini-mal. We then apply the principle of delayed gratification, where the UAV attempts to solve the tradeoff between postponing until it reaches this minimum and the impatience to deliver as much data as soon as possible, before any physical damage on-the-fly may oc-cur. Our empirical-driven simulations demonstrate that the optimal distance of transmission greatly depends on the interplay of actual throughput, data size, UAV cruise speed, and failure rate, and that state-of-the-art UAVs can already benefit from our approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of baiting on feral swine (Sus scrofa) {{movements}} and corresponding likelihood of disease spread under real and simulated culling pressure. Our objectives were to determine the proportion of feral swine that used the bait station site, and if baiting of feral swine altered areas of utilization, distances from location centroids to treatment location (control or bait station), and movement rates by survivors during culling activities. We hypothesized that the bait station would increase the sedentary nature of feral swine, thus reducing the potential for dispersal and hence disease dispersal. Our experiment was conducted between February and May 2011 on the Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation (WWF) in San Patricio County, Texas. We trapped 83 feral swine and placed GPS collars on 21 animals. We established and maintained a centralized bait station {{on one side of}} the WWF from 13 March to 27 April. We conducted population-wide culling activities, including trapping, controlled shooting, <b>drive</b> shooting, and <b>aerial</b> gunning, from 3 to 27 April and removed 143 feral swine (4. 6 feral swine/km 2). Areas of utilization did not differ between treatments (control or bait station). However, we found location centroids of bait station site feral swine to be closer to the treatment location than those of control site animals and daily movement rates of bait station site feral swine to be 39 % greater than movement rates of control site animals. Based on our observation that only 62 % of feral swine trapped in proximity to the bait station used it, we cannot recommend baiting as an alternative to fences for containing animals during culling activities. However, there is value in using bait stations to describe patterns of feral swine movements, facilitate observation, and improve efficacy when conducting removals...|$|R
