5000|$|Lacing is {{the process}} of {{threading}} spokes through holes in the hub and rim so that they form a spoke pattern. While most manufacturers use the same lacing pattern on both left and right sides of a wheel, it is becoming increasingly common to find specialty wheels with different lacing patterns on each side. A spoke can connect the hub to the rim in a radial fashion, which creates the lightest and most aerodynamic wheel. However, to efficiently transfer torque from the hub to the rim, as with driven wheels or wheels with drum or disc brakes, durability dictates that spokes be mounted at an angle to the hub flange up to a [...] "tangential lacing pattern" [...] to achieve maximum torque capability (but minimum vertical wheel stiffness). Names for various lacing patterns are commonly referenced to the number of spokes that any one spoke crosses. Conventionally laced 36- or 32-spoke wheels are most commonly built as a cross-3 or a cross-2, however other cross-numbers are also possible. The angle at which the spoke interfaces the hub is not solely determined by the cross-number; as spoke count and <b>hub</b> <b>diameter</b> will lead to significantly different spoke angles. For all common tension-spoke wheels with crossed spokes, a torque applied to the hub will result in one half of the spokes - called [...] "leading spokes" [...] tensioned to drive the rim, while other half - [...] "trailing spokes" [...] are tensioned only to counteract the leading spokes. When forward torque is applied (i.e., during acceleration [...] ), the trailing spokes experience a higher tension, while leading spokes are relieved, thus forcing the rim to rotate. While braking, leading spokes tighten and trailing spokes are relieved. The wheel can thus transfer the hub torque in either direction with the least amount of change in spoke tension, allowing the wheel to stay true while torque is applied.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simplified propeller turbine unit to produce power in a low head micro hydroelectric power installation. To be appropriate for remote areas and developing countries, a micro hydro system needs to be simple in design. There are good turbine designs for medium to high heads but traditional designs for heads under about 10 m, ie, the crossflow turbine and waterwheel, are slow running, requiring substantial speed increase to drive an AC generator. Propeller turbines have a higher running speed but are normally too complicated for micro hydro installations. In this thesis a suitable propeller turbine was developed. The effect of flat blades and optimum turbine blade and guide vane angles has been determined, as has the effect of various cones attached to the downstream end of the hub. The large <b>hub</b> <b>diameter</b> is an important compromise. A prototype turbine for installation on a New Zealand farm was developed from model tests. The turbine has a <b>hub</b> <b>diameter</b> to blade tip diameter ratio of 0. 66 and 8 flat blades set at 30 ° to tangential (60 ° from axial). The best efficiency of the model turbine was 62 %, with an efficiency of 57 % at the best power point. Using scaling laws it is predicted that the prototype, with a blade tip diameter of 0. 410 m, will produce 6. 0 kW at 612 RPM from a head of 2. 7 m and a flow rate of 0. 41 m³/s. This gives 4. 3 kW output from the 50 Hz 2 -pole generator.

40|$|The present paper {{concerns}} {{the effect of}} the test configuration on the noise generated by axial flow fans employed for automotive cooling systems. During the development of a fan, a number of noise tests are usually taken on different configurations, whose characteristics depend on the design step. Often, significant discrepancies are observed between the results of different tests, resulting in difficulties in transferring and generalizing the measured SPL level spectra. Such differences regard both the broad band noise and the tonal one. In the present paper the effects of the following aspects are considered: the rotor balancing method, the geometrical tolerances, the rotor mounting system on simplified configurations (with and without downstream stator) and the production configuration (a stationary plastic shroud) without heat exchangers. The balancing method affects the high frequency part of the SPL spectrum, due to the broad band noise, while the mounting system may affect the OASPL and the low frequency part of the SPL spectrum, due to the tonal noise.

40|$|To model {{shrink-fitting}} {{in metal}} components, an analytical model for two long compound cylinders with temperature dependent material properties and interference {{between them is}} developed for calculating transient temperatures and stresses. A finite element model is developed for the same geometry which incorporated the temperature dependent material properties. A convergence study is performed on the finite element and analytical model. The finite element model is validated by comparing the approximations of finite element model with the analytical solution. In an assembly procedure of fulcrums for bascule bridges, called AP 1, the trunnion is shrink-fitted into a hub, followed by shrink fitting the trunnion-hub assembly into the girder of the bridge. In another assembly procedure called AP 2, the hub is shrink-fitted into the girder, followed by shrink-fitting the trunnion in the hub-girder assembly. A formal design of experiments (DOE) study is conducted on both AP 1 and AP 2 using the finite element model to find the influence of geometrical parameters such as radial thickness of the hub, radial interference, and various shrink-fitting methods on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length (OMCCL) - a measure of likelihood of failure by cracking. Using the results of DOE study conducted on both the assembly procedures, AP 1 and AP 2 are quantitatively compared for the likelihood of fracture during assembly. For single-staged shrink-fitting methods, for high and low hub radial thickness to <b>hub</b> inner <b>diameter</b> ratio, assembly procedure AP 1 and AP 2 are recommended, respectively. For fulcra with low hub radial thickness to <b>hub</b> inner <b>diameter</b> ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, for AP 2, cooling the trunnion in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder, and for AP 1, cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen is recommended. For fulcra with high hub radial thickness to <b>hub</b> inner <b>diameter</b> ratio and where staged shrink-fitting methods are used, cooling the components in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder is recommended for both AP 1 and AP 2. Due to the limitations of AP 2, assembly procedures by heating the girder with heating coils instead of dipping an already stressed trunnion-hub assembly in liquid nitrogen are studied for decreasing the likelihood of failure by cracking and yielding. In an assembly procedure called AP 3 -A, only the girder is heated to shrink-fit the trunnion-hub assembly in the girder. This assembly procedure AP 3 -A {{is found to be}} infeasible because the girder fails by yielding if heating is expected to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An alternative assembly procedure called AP 3 -B is suggested for shrink-fitting where the heating of the girder is combined with cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture. This assembly procedure AP 3 -B is found to be feasible. A complete DOE study is conducted on AP 3 -B to find the influence of parameters like hub radial thickness and radial interference at trunnion-hub interface on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length. The design parameter, OMCCL values during the assembly procedure AP 3 -B are quantitatively compared with the widely used assembly procedures (AP 1 single-stage shrink-fitting and AP 1 multi-staged shrink fitting). The results of this work suggest that increasing the hub radial thickness decreases the likelihood of fracture significantly. For hubs with large radial thickness, heating the girder combined with cooling the trunnion-hub in dry-ice/alcohol mixture (AP 3 -B) is recommended but for hubs with low radial thickness, multistage cooling of the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture followed by dipping in liquid nitrogen (AP 1 - multistage cooling) is recommended...|$|R

T/BEST {{may be used to}} provide guidelines to identify and prioritize high payoff research areas, help manage research and limited resources, show the link between advanced concepts and the bottom line, i. e., accrued benefit and value, and to communicate credibly the benefits of research. The T/BEST software computer program is specifically designed to estimating benefits, and benefit sensitivities, of introducing new technologies into existing propulsion systems. Key engine cycle, structural, fluid, mission and cost analysis modules are used to provide a framework for interfacing with advanced technologies. An open-ended, modular approach is used to allow for modification and addition of both key and advanced technology modules. T/BEST has a hierarchical framework that yields varying levels of benefit estimation accuracy that are dependent on the degree of input detail available. This hierarchical feature permits rapid estimation of technology benefits even when the technology is at the conceptual stage. As knowledge of the technology details increases the accuracy of the benefit analysis increases. Included in T/BEST's framework are correlations developed from a statistical data base that is relied upon if there is insufficient information given in a particular area, e. g., fuel capacity or aircraft landing weight. Statistical predictions are not required if these data are specified in the mission requirements. The engine cycle, structural fluid, cost, noise, and emissions analyses interact with the default or user material and component libraries to yield estimates of specific global benefits: range, speed, thrust, capacity, component life, noise, emissions, specific fuel consumption, component and engine weights, pre-certification test, mission performance engine cost, direct operating cost, life cycle cost, manufacturing cost, development cost, risk, and development time. Currently, T/BEST operates on stand-alone or networked workstations, and uses a UNIX shell or script to control the operation of interfaced FORTRAN based analyses. T/BEST's interface structure works equally well with non-FORTRAN or mixed software analysis. This interface structure is designed to maintain the integrity of the expert's analyses by interfacing with expert's existing input and output files. Parameter input and output data (e. g., number of blades, <b>hub</b> <b>diameters,</b> etc.) are passed via T/BEST's neutral file, while copious data (e. g., finite element models, profiles, etc.) are passed via file pointers that point to the expert's analyses output files. In order to make the communications between the T/BEST's neutral file and attached analyses codes simple, only two software commands, PUT and GET, are required. This simplicity permits easy access to all input and output variables contained within the neutral file.

40|$|Decades ago at pre – {{computer}} era {{design process}} consisted of empirically based {{set of rules}} application to choose main flow path dimensions. Serious model tests were obligatory before compressor manufacturing to check delivery pressure and efficiency. Better flow physical models and computer progress made possible to develop quickly operating programs to predict gas dynamic performance curves of an arbitrary flow path. TU SPb set of computer programs was named “The Universal modeling method” and its application still in mid 1990 th had lead to elimination of model tests in a design process of industrial centrifugal compressors. The Universal modeling {{state of the art}} including 4 th generation loss and work input models were presented in conferences in Germany, Japan, Great Britain and Poland. Set of algebraic equations describe surface friction losses, flow separation and following mixing losses. Flow deceleration along surfaces and velocity gradient along a normal to surfaces are taken into account. By 4 -th generation programs several dozens of compressor with delivery pressure up to 12, 5 MPa, number of stages up to 8, power up to 25 mWt were designed for some Russian and foreign manufacturers. Amount of compressor installed exceeds 400 with total power close to 5 000 000 kWt. In all cases the design parameters were achieved without preceding model tests. The 4 -th generation model was perfect enough to predict design point efficiency with accuracy about 2, 5 % if a single set of coefficients was applied. To raise accuracy of calculations to 1 % or less different sets of empirical coefficients were necessary for stages with different flow rate and work coefficients. The proposed text is focused on scientific background and realization of model improvements. The main of them are more precise impeller size presentation, impeller velocity diagram schematization very close to non viscid diagram, surface roughness introduction in the loss model, shroud leakage influence on flow at an impeller inlet, etc. As a result 5 -th generation model predicts efficiency curves of stages with different flow rate and work coefficients with mean deviation less than 0, 5 % at design point and 1, 5 % along all performance curves – with a single set of empirical coefficients. Then the compressors’ test performance curves were carefully correlated with the calculated ones by proper selection of empirical coefficients in models of pressure loss ant work coefficient. The stages of 16 tested compressors can be considered as 99 model stages with the range of gas dynamic and constructive parameters: flow rate coefficients 0, 025 – 0, 064, Euler work coefficients 0, 40 – 0, 85, relative <b>hub</b> <b>diameter</b> 0, 258 – 0, 483, outer relative diameter of a diffuser 1, 316 - 1, 720.

40|$|A {{bascule bridge}} {{is a type}} of movable bridge that can be opened or closed to {{facilitate}} the movement of water-borne traffic such as ships and yachts. Trunnion-Hub-Girder (THG) assembly plays a role as a fulcrum in the bascule bridge. To make the fulcrum, the trunnion is shrink-fitted into the hub, and then the trunnion-hub assembly is shrink-fitted into the girder. Hundreds of thousands of dollars could be lost due to failures during this step. Crack formations in the hubs of various Florida bascule bridges during assembly led the Florida Department of Transportation to commission a project with USF professors to investigate. Finite elements method (ANSYS package) is employed to model the THG assembly procedure and solve for the critical crack length and critical stress in this transient thermal structural problem. Design of experiments (DOE) is used with different cooling processes and the geometrical dimensions of the THG assembly to find the sensitivity of these parameters on the outputs. The influence of the <b>hub</b> outer <b>diameter</b> and the radial interference (between the trunnion and hub) is at different levels on the critical crack length and the stress ratio as it is dependent on fulcrum geometry.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{variability in}} aerodynamic {{performance of a}} compressor rotor due to geometric variation. The performance of the rotor is computed using a meanline model that includes the effect of tip clearance blockage, calculated by assuming the tip leakage behaves like a wake in a pressure gradient and incorporating the effects of double leakage. The model is used to quantify performance variability of the rotor at design flow coefficient and near stall given typical variations in blade profile geometry, <b>hub</b> and casing <b>diameters,</b> and tip clearances. Monte Carlo simulation performed at both operating conditions shows that the coefficient of variation of pressure rise, loss coefficient, axial displacement thickness, and flow angle at the exit of the blade row is similar at high and low loading. Mean shifts are smaller at design than near stall, where the mean pressure rise and loss shift - 0. 4 % and + 0. 6 % from their respective nominal values. A parametric analysis using a response surface showed that near stall, tip clearance variation drives performance variation; the pressure rise and loss coefficient standard deviation drop by 26 % and 20 % when tip clearance variability is removed. At design, tip clearance variability is still important, but leading and trailing edge blade geometries play {{a larger role in}} driving performance variability. by Nathan Andrew Fitzgerald.

Blood flow stagnation and clot formation within the pump are minimized by, among other things, providing the inducer <b>hub</b> with a <b>diameter</b> greater than the diameter of the flow straightener hub; by optimizing the axial spacing between the flow straightener hub and the inducer hub, and between the impeller hub and the diffuser hub; by optimizing the inlet angle of the diffuser blades; and by providing fillets or curved transitions between the upstream end of the inducer hub and the shaft mounted therein, and between the impeller hub and the shaft mounted therein...|$|R
40|$|No {{matter the}} source, {{offshore}} wind energy plant cost estimates are significantly higher than for land-based projects. For instance, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) review on the 2010 cost of wind energy found baseline cost estimates for onshore wind energy systems to be 71 dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), versus 225 $/MWh for offshore systems. There are many ways that innovation {{can be used to}} reduce the high costs of {{offshore wind energy}}. However, the use of such innovation impacts the cost of energy because of the highly coupled nature of the system. For example, the deployment of multimegawatt turbines can reduce the number of turbines, thereby reducing the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with vessel acquisition and use. On the other hand, larger turbines may require more specialized vessels and infrastructure to perform the same operations, which could result in higher costs. To better understand the full impact of a design decision on offshore wind energy system performance and cost, a system analysis approach is needed. In 2011 - 2012, NREL began development of a wind energy systems engineering software tool to support offshore wind energy system analysis. The tool combines engineering and cost models to represent an entire offshore wind energy plant and to perform system cost sensitivity analysis and optimization. Initial results were collected by applying the tool to conduct a sensitivity analysis on a baseline offshore wind energy system using 5 -MW and 6 -MW NREL reference turbines. Results included information on rotor <b>diameter,</b> <b>hub</b> height, power rating, and maximum allowable tip speeds...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the flow fields of mesoscale inlet guide vanes is presented in this paper. An in depth look at the design process is also presented. The guidelines set {{in place for the}} design and manufacturing of standard equipment were utilized with discretion. The parameters that were to be achieved for these designs were to keep the inlet vanes within a 1 to 2 cm tip diameter range. The difficulty with this is the manufacturability of something so small. In order to ease this problem the vanes were scaled to be twice as large as the original design size while keeping the <b>hub</b> the same <b>diameter.</b> This allowed the vanes to remain intact during the manufacturing process. ^ After the design was completed and the parts had been manufactured a method of testing such small-scale parts was needed, so the use of a water tunnel was chosen. The water tunnel was designed specifically for these tests so qualification tests for the determination of where in the tunnel to test were performed. Three testing methods are discussed in this paper, the two methods used experimentally are a Laser Doppler Anemometer and Particle Image Velocimetry; the numerical method of Computational Fluid Dynamics, was also used for comparative purposes with the other methods. ^ Once the testing had been completed and the analysis of the data performed, the separate test planes could be compared. Of the four test planes, only one would show evidence of all three test methods validating the other methods information. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{output from}} a {{high-resolution}} meteorological simulation, we evaluate {{the sensitivity of}} southern California wind energy generation to variations in key characteristics of current wind turbines. These characteristics include <b>hub</b> height, rotor <b>diameter,</b> and rated power, and depend on turbine make and model. They shape the turbine’s power curve and thus have large implications for the energy generation capacity of wind farms. For each characteristic, we find complex and substantial geographical variations in the sensitivity of energy generation. However, the sensitivity associated with each characteristic can be predicted by a single corresponding climate statistic, greatly simplifying {{understanding of the relationship}} between climate and turbine optimization for energy production. In the case of the sensitivity to rotor diameter, the change in energy output per unit change in rotor diameter at any location is directly proportional to the weighted average wind speed between the cut-in speed and the rated speed. The sensitivity to rated power variations is likewise captured by the percent of the wind speed distribution between the turbines rated and cut-out speeds. Finally, the sensitivity to hub height is proportional to lower atmospheric wind shear. Using a wind turbine component cost model, we also evaluate energy output increase per dollar investment in each turbine characteristic. We find that rotor diameter increases typically provide a much larger wind energy boost per dollar invested, though there are some zones where investment in the other two characteristics is competitive. Our study underscores the need for joint analysis of regional climate, turbine engineering...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{optimization}} of a variable speed, three blade, horizontal-axis wind turbine. The design parameters considered are the rotor <b>diameter,</b> <b>hub</b> height and generator capacity. The levelized cost {{of energy and}} simple payback are the figures of merit being minimized. Blade element momentum theory {{is used to calculate}} the power produced by the wind turbine rotor. Increasing the rotor diameter increases the power delivered to the generator at all wind speeds up to the limit of generator capacity. Increasing the generator capacity raises the limit on maximum power output. Increasing the hub height of a wind turbine increases power output due to the higher wind speeds at increased heights. However, all of these design changes involve an increase in capital cost. Furthermore, wind characteristics vary between wind resources. Therefore, the optimal wind turbine design will change depending on the wind resource. The model developed in this thesis is used to minimize the levelized cost of energy for various wind resources. The results of this study provide a guideline for the optimum wind turbine design in various wind resources. The model is also used to compare the difference between minimizing the levelized cost of energy and minimizing simple payback of a wind turbine located off the coast of Georgia. Simple payback is calculated by considering not only the total annual electricity produced and capital cost of the turbine but also the revenue the turbine will generate. Revenue is calculated from a time-dependent valuation of electrical power. The results of this study show that minimizing levelized cost of energy and minimizing simple payback result in the same optimum design for this particular site. The results show, however, that using a time-dependent valuation of electricity results in a different simple payback than when an average value of electricity is used. M. S.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between wind turbines in simple wind farm layouts is investigated {{with the purpose}} of observing the influence of wake loss phenomenon on the energy production of downwind turbines. Following an intensive exploration stage about wind farm aerodynamics and wake modeling subjects, several tests cases are designed to represent various wind farm configurations, consisting of different number of wind turbines. These cases are simulated by using DNV GL WindFarmer software which provides the opportunity of performing simulations with two different wake modeling techniques, namely Modified PARK and Eddy Viscosity. Various terrain and ambient turbulence intensity conditions are considered during the test cases. Also three different turbine types having different <b>hub</b> heights, rotor <b>diameters</b> and power-thrust coefficients are used in order to observe the effect of turbine characteristics on wake formation. Besides WindFarmer, WAsP and MATLAB tools are used in some simulation stages in order to generate input data such as wind and terrain conditions or farm layout configurations; and to process the data obtained in the end of these test cases. Simulations which are executed {{in the presence of a}} predominant wind direction from a narrow direction bin indicate that, even though there exists no significant {{interaction between}} the turbines placed in abreast configurations, successive turbine rows affect each other strongly due to the existence of the wake region of upwind turbines. It is observed that downwind spacing between turbine rows required to recover wake deficit up to a certain level changes depending on terrain and ambient turbulence intensity conditions together with turbine characteristics. For instance increasing surface roughness length (or ambient turbulence intensity) of a given site by keeping all the other parameters constant can provide up to 20 % (or 30 %) decrease in the required downstream distance to reduce wake loss to 5 % level in a simple tandem layout consisting of two wind turbines. Further test cases are executed with various numbers of wind turbines in different configurations to observe the effect of partial, full and multiple wake regions on total farm efficiency. The results obtained from these cases are used in order to have a comparison between several farm layouts and evaluate their advantages and drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|Profiles {{of fluid}} properties, {{including}} flow angle, static and total pressures {{have been obtained}} behind a free wheeling 8 " diameter transonic rotor. The latter consists of 40 blades with double circular arc profiles, a <b>hub</b> to tip <b>diameter</b> ratio of 0. 80 and a mean solidity of 0. 94. The variation of stagger angle along the blade span is such that the local relative velocity is aligned with the blade chord at a design point corresponding to an inlet axial Mach number of 0. 6 and a rotor speed of 35, 000 RPM. The profiles show strong evidence {{of the existence of}} standing acoustic waves in the flow passage at transonic relative Mach numbers. A strong drag rise is observed at subsonic relative Mach numbers (MT) close to unity, the slope of the drag curve being negative at MT = 1, but turning positive again shortly after MT = 1. For MT < 1, a remarkably good correlation is observed between the spanwise mean of the measured drag and previous 2 -D pressure drag measurements on similar profiles. At low supersonic relative Mach numbers, the drag due to shocks in the blade passages appears to overshadow the wave drag, and as yet, there is no definitive way to isolate the contribution of the wave drag experimentally. Computed values of the wave drag at these speeds, based on McCune's analysis for a non-lifting blade row, are "compared" with the measured drag. A linearized theory is presented for obtaining the induced drag of an axial compressor blade row subjected to- any- arbitrary blade loading distribution. The blades are replaced at their leading edges by bound vortex lines of varying strength along the span, and the induced drag obtained from the induced velocity field of the resulting trailing helical vortex sheets. Use of this lifting line approach restricts the useful range of the theory to relative Mach numbers less than unity, since such a quasi 2 -D theory would not be applicable to transonic flows which are believed to be inherently three dimensional.

40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to the use of a vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment as a passive stall control technique in a multistage axial-flow compressor. The focus of the research was to determine whether such a treatment could delay the initiation of stall at lower mass flow rates as well as providing the most beneficial improvement in flow characteristics without sacrificing compressor efficiencies. Specific objectives of this study were to examine possible improvements or deterioration in the flow characteristics including stall margin, peak pressure rise coefficients and maximum efficiency in a multistage axial flow compressor. A casing treatment in addition to several spacer rings was developed from two initial designs and tested on the first stage of a low speed three-stage axial-flow compressor with a (0. 7) <b>hub</b> to tip <b>diameter</b> ratio. The treatment configuration consisted of three parts: an outer casing ring, with a tubular shaped passage on the inside diameter, a set of 120 evenly spaced curved vanes, and a shroud or inner ring. The casing treatment was positioned following the inlet guide vanes upstream and partly covering the tip of the rotor blades. The main parts of the casing treatment including the recessed vanes in addition to some of the spacer rings were manufactured from high quality acrylic. Eight additional spacer rings of various shapes and geometry were added. The first ring held and partly covered the IGVs, in front of the casing treatment. The rotor tip exposure ratio was thought to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the casing treatment. Therefore the other seven rings were used to provide the desired uncovered region of the rotor tip axial chord of about 10 % in order to provide a range of exposures of (23. 2 %, 33. 3 %, 43. 4 %, 53. 5 %, 63. 6 %, 73. 7 %, and 83. 8 %). The results showed significant improvements in stall margin in all treated casing configurations along with insignificant efficiency sacrifices in some compressor builds. About (28. 56 %) of stall margin improvement in terms of corrected mass flow rate was achieved using a casing treatment with a (33. 3 %) rotor tip exposure. The compressor build with (0. 535) rotor exposure ratios was the best configuration in terms of efficiency gain and loss characteristics. This build was able to provide the highest values of the maximum efficiencies in comparison with the performance achieved from the solid casing. An improvement of (1. 81 %) in the maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 54 %) stall margin improvement in terms of the corrected mass flow rates were achieved by the application of this treatment configuration. The improvement in the peak pressure rise coefficients in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (2. 33 %). The compressor configuration using a casing treatment with a (0. 636) rotor exposure ratio was the best build in terms of the pressure rise coefficients. This configuration was able to provide highest value of the peak pressure rise in comparison with the characteristics achieved from the datum build. An improvement of (2. 65 %) in the peak pressure rise coefficient in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 49 %) improvement in stall margin in terms of the corrected mass flow rates was achieved from this casing treatment build. The improvement in maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (1. 03 %). The results suggest that the vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment designed as part of this investigation achieved the objectives, which were established for the research. In the majority of instances it not only produced gains in flow range, pressure rise coefficients and efficiencies, but also enabled the rotating stall, which developed at much lower mass flow rates in the compressor, to become progressive rather than abrupt...|$|R
