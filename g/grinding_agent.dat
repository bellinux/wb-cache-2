Element analysis using SEM–EDX detected chlorine associated with the metal particles which {{is compatible with the}} use of sodium chloride as an aid in the grinding process of the metal foil. The use of salt as <b>grinding</b> <b>agent</b> has been mentioned in literature dealing with Rococo and Baroque techniques [4]. The same source mentions that this method is more suited to the preparation of gold and silver pigment. In the case of copper containing alloys and, in order to avoid corrosion, grinding without salt is recommended, indicating that the corrosion acceleration in the presence of chlorine had been known.|$|E

Demand on the device performance requires flatter wafer surface, and less dimensional wafer variation. Prime silicon wafer is hard and brittle material. Due to its properties, double sided lapping machine with ceramic <b>grinding</b> <b>agent</b> were introduced for machining high quality standard silicon wafers. The main focus is the silicon wafer with high accuracy of flatness; to reduce total thickness variation, waviness and roughness. In this paper the lapping experiment and analysis showed that the double sided lapping machine is able to produce total thickness variation less than 10 um at controlled process parameters within short processing time. Machining using low mode method reduced the total thickness variation (TTV) value. The lapping load and speed directly reflected the performance and condition of final silicon wafer quality...|$|E

The mixtures at various compositions of clinker, gypsum fly ash and limestone are intimately ground and compared to other compositions without fly ash. Blended fly ash cements are also studied. The results show that fly ash acts as <b>grinding</b> <b>agent</b> by reducing the required time to obtain the same percentage of particles retained on a 80 -μm sieve as the standard cement. Fly ash cements lead to an important extension of setting time than limestone cements. The replacement of clinker by limestone gives better mechanical strengths than the mixtures containing fly ash at early days; after 28 days, the cements prepared by incorporation of fly ash gain an important strength.

30|$|In 2010, new European {{building}} lime standard EN 459 - 1, modified from previous version, was published [12]. Comparing to old version, {{natural hydraulic lime}} (NHL), formulated lime (FL) and hydraulic lime (HL) {{under the category of}} limes with hydraulic properties has been clearly specified. Natural hydraulic lime, its use can be dated back to Romans [13], is a lime with hydraulic properties produced by burning of more or less argillaceous or siliceous limestones with reduction to powder by slaking with or without grinding. No other additions are allowed except <b>grinding</b> <b>agents</b> up to 0.1 wt%. Hydraulic lime is, however, a binder consisting of lime and other materials such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials, but does not need to have a declaration of constituents. Formulated lime (FL), which is a new term, is a lime with hydraulic properties mainly consisting of air lime (CL) and/or natural hydraulic lime (NHL) with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. To protect the user especially in restoration and conservation, formulated limes contain a constituent’s declaration.|$|R

During the grinding of the cement particle, the effect of various parameters such as grinding time (1 – 6 [*]h) and <b>grinding</b> <b>agent</b> (methanol and ethanol) on the production of the ultrafine cement has also been investigated. Performance of newly produced ultrafine cement is elucidated by the chemical composition, particle size distribution, and SEM and XRD analyses. Based on the particle size distribution of the newly produced ultrafine cement, it was assessed that the size of the cement particle decreases efficiently with increase in grinding time. Additionally, it is optimized that the bead milling process is able to produce 90 % of the cement particle < 350 [*]nm and 50 % of the cement particle < 220 [*]nm, respectively, after 6. 3 [*]h milling without affecting the chemical phases.

40|$|Soil {{stabilisation}} {{using traditional}} binders such as Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), {{has a serious}} negative environmental impact, specifically carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions {{as a result of}} the manufacture of OPC. Because of this, the use of sustainable binders has become a critical issue to help reduce cement production through the use of by-product materials. This research seeks to develop a new ternary blended cementitious binder (TBCB) to replace cement for soft soil stabilisation. Different ternary mixtures containing wastes i. e., high calcium fly ash (HCFA), palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and rice husk ash (RHA) along with flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) gypsum used as a sulphate activator and <b>grinding</b> <b>agent,</b> were examined. The results illustrate that ternary mixtures improved the engineering and mechanical properties of stabilised soil. The results indicated that the plasticity index (PI) was reduced from 20. 2 to 13. 0 and the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) increased after 28 days of curing from 202 kPa to 944 kPa using the optimum non-FGD activated mixture. FGD contributed significantly by increasing the UCS to 1464 kPa at 180 days of curing, which surpassed that for the reference cement (1450 kPa), and by improving the soil consistency limits; where the PI decreased to 11. 7 using TBCB compared with 14. 5 for the soil treated with the reference cement. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed substantial changes in the diffraction patterns and microstructure components of the TBCB paste over the curing period, confirming the formation of cementitious products. A solid, coherent and compacted structure was achieved after treatment with TBCB as evidenced by the formation of C-S-H, CH and ettringite...|$|E
40|$|Releases {{from the}} F and H Area Seepage Basins on the Savannah River Site (SRS) have caused {{groundwater}} plumes that contain {{a variety of}} contaminants. These plumes are releasing contaminants into Fourmile Branch, which is a small tributary of the Savannah River. The metallic contaminant releases to the branch are being controlled by base injection. The base injection targets cationic contaminants and {{was not intended to}} reduce the concentration of I- 129 in groundwater. SRS and the regulatory agencies believe it is appropriate to investigate remedial alternatives that could reduce the I- 129. The Savannah River Site Area Closures Projects (ACP) and the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) are developing an innovative in situ treatment for I- 129 using silver chloride (AgCl). The proposed AgCl amendment has a very small particle size and is designed to be injected into the contaminated aquifer to capture I- 129. The solubility of AgI is several orders of magnitude lower than the solubility of AgCl. Thus, when I- 129 comes in contact with AgCl it forms silver iodide (AgI), which is very stable and essentially insoluble in water. SRNL has been performing bench-scale column tests on the effectiveness of silver chloride to capture iodine in an aqueous solution. These initial tests evaluate silver chloride in four different particle sizes; 4 - 5 millimeters (standard reagent silver chloride), approximately 1 millimeters (sieved reagent silver chloride), approximately 2 micrometers (ultra fine grind without a <b>grinding</b> <b>agent),</b> and < 1 micrometer (ultra fine grind with a <b>grinding</b> <b>agent).</b> The first two experiments with macro-sized particles were proof of principle tests. In these the AgCl was mechanically mixed into a portion of the soil filling the columns. The last two were to test the effectiveness of injecting particles suspended in an aqueous solution [...] the ability to inject the particles, their retention in the column and their effectiveness at removing dissolved iodide from solution. The amendments for these two columns were obtained from a private company specializing in ultra-fine grinding of materials. They were ground in propylene glycol because when ground in water silver metal electroplated onto the steel grinding equipment. Table 1 shows the list of columns and the amendment characteristics. The results of these column experiments demonstrate that solid silver chloride is highly effective at removing dissolved iodine from water and should be an effective amendment for removing I- 129 from groundwater. Based on known groundwater chemistry and the reaction of AgCl with I- to produce AgI, the only interference will be natural dissolved stable iodine (I- 127). Millings et al. (2002) reported a maximum I- 127 concentration of 2. 2 ug/L in groundwater from well P- 27 D, a background water table well near F-Area. The concentration of dissolved iodide used in these experiments is approximately 4500 times this natural concentration. Therefore, a AgCl amendment in the subsurface at the same concentration used in these experiments, might effectively remove I- 129 for up to 4500 times the number of pore volumes of groundwater as observed here. This assumes homogeneous distribution of the amendment and no occlusion by other minerals in the subsurface. The only reliable way to evaluate these effects is by trial in the field. The column studies also suggest that the amendment is readily injectable into sediments, but will not be highly mobile. The fact that the effluent from Column 4 shows no iodide breakthrough after nearly 11 pore volumes indicates that some of the injected AgCl was trapped in the column. A mass balance on iodide reacted so far suggests that a minimum of 0. 056 grams of silver chloride was trapped in the column to react with the iodide. This is 5. 6 % of the mass injected. Assume the 1 -foot column represents the first foot of sediment in the subsurface into which the amendment is injected. If 5. 6 % of the AgCl particles are trapped in each subsequent foot of sediment through which the injectate moves, at 100 feet the concentration of particles will be 3 % of the injection concentration. This is the maximum possible concentration indicated by these column studies, because far more AgCl may have been trapped in the column. Continued data collection will tell how much more. Dissolved silver concentrations from the silver chloride amendment will be low. Effluent from Column 1 was analyzed for dissolved silver and the concentrations were below the detection limit of 0. 2 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|Blast {{furnace slag}} cement {{concrete}} is used extensively {{in a number}} of countries. In comparison with OPC, it is particularly well known for its excellent performance in marine environments. One dis-advantage of slag cement is its vulnerability to scaling under the combined load of freezing-thawing and de-icing salts. The current investigation was triggered by positive observations regard-ing certain <b>grinding</b> <b>agents</b> used in slag cement production to improve frost salt scaling resistance. The investigation was aimed at explaining the cause of this improvement, at finding alternative methods to improve scaling resistance and at developing a model that would be suitable for the simulation of frost salt scaling behaviour. The investigation conclusions are essentially confined to high slag cement, particularly type CEM III 42, 5 /B which has a 67 % granulated slag content. The w/c ratio of the paste, mortar and concrete specimens is generally maintained at 0, 45. Carbonation, known as the critical parameter in frost salt scaling, constituted the key area of inter-est. From previous investigations it is known that carbonation increases porosity and coarsens the pore system in slag cement paste while it actually does the reverse in OPC paste. In the light of lit-erature a new hypothesis has been suggested that the transition zones, which are the weakest points in normal-performance cement-based materials, critically determine frost salt scaling resis-tance. These zones are even more indicative in the case of slag cement pastes because of the sig-nificant amount of transition zones that can be weakened by carbonation unlike with low-slag ce-ment or OPC pastes. In the present investigation it was observed that carbonation causes significant slag cement paste shrinkage. It was especially the transition zones between non-reacted slag particles and hydration products that were found to be affected. Consequently this process leads to the paste having a coarser pore structure thus making it prone to greater water uptake when compared to non-carbonated slag cement paste or OPC paste. The new hypothesis was supported by findings emerging from the ESEM study. It was observed that frost salt scaling attack generates cracks in the microstructure which adhere to slag-matrix interfacial zones. This was confirmed by nano-indentation tests which demonstrated that carbonation creates a significant number of weak zones in the slag cement paste. In the case of OPC paste the picture that emerged was quite different. Natural air carbonation influences the mineral characteristics of cement pastes. The XRD study re-vealed that both slag cement paste and OPC paste possess various types of carbonate minerals, namely: calcite, aragonite and vaterite. However, accelerated carbonation creates overwhelmingly stable calcite phases in both types of cement pastes which are subsequently transformed from me-tastable carbonates. This observation draws attention to the role played by Ca(OH) 2 in the good scaling resistance of OPC or low-slag cement systems. A curing regime, especially curing in lime water, appears to be favourable for slag cement materials. However, when compared to the effect of carbonation, the influence that the curing water quality has on scaling resistance is minimal. The contribution made by prolonged water curing to scaling resistance could have been greater but, as it was, the curing periods were limited to 5 weeks in the interests of remaining realistic and practi-cal. The main goal of the project was to investigate the improvements in frost salt scaling resistance in-stigated by chemical <b>grinding</b> <b>agents</b> {{on the basis of the}} various positive results gained from the preliminary tests. The intention was to study the effects that the chemicals had on the cement paste microstructure in order to understand frost salt scaling resistance in slag cement concrete and so as to contribute to structural improvements in that area. A microstructural comparative study was carried out on slag cement pastes that contain alkanola-mines/hydrocarboxylates (the best performing ones) and diethylene glycolâbased (the worst per-forming example) <b>grinding</b> <b>agents.</b> The most notable difference was in the pore structure of the paste samples. Alkanolamines/hydrocarboxylates-based <b>grinding</b> <b>agents</b> were found to produce smaller pore sizes when compared to the ones containing diethylene glycol. This is consequently likely to give rise to higher carbonation resistance, lower water uptake and, eventually, to higher frost salt scaling resistance. However, the improvement achieved by alkanolamines / hydrocarboxy-lates is not sufficient to enhance the scaling resistance of the slag cement materials investigated in similar detail to OPC pastes. Another technique that was investigated was sodium monofluorophosphate (Na-MFP) surface treatment. Remarkable improvements in frost salt scaling resistance were achieved by applying a 10 % Na-MFP solution to the surface of the carbonated slag cement paste and concrete. The scal-ing resistance improved by about 95 % after 7 freeze-thawing cycles. Evidence was found pertain-ing to the reaction between Na-MFP and metastable carbonates in the carbonated slag pastes. The application appears to significantly increase the tensile strength of the carbonated slag cement paste which is extremely favourable in terms of scaling resistance. The study finally resulted in the development of a new integrated model. The model mainly takes into account the glue-spall theory and the hypothesis developed in this thesis and it runs on the Delft Lattice Model platform. The model successfully demonstrates the experimental observations and the crack patterns created by the scaling action. The glue-spall theory suggests that cement-based material surface scaling derives from external ice layer cracking due to further cooling. Cooling consequently generates tensile stress due to the shrinkage of ice and causes cracking when the stress exceeds the tensile strength of the ice. This theory can explain many phenomena including the pessimum effect. On the basis of this theory, the new integrated model proved to be capable of simulating two important experimental observa-tions. Under identical conditions the model can predict higher surface scaling at a 3 % salt concen-tration level in relation to higher and lower values. The effect of ice layer thickness is furthermore found to be crucial with respect to frost salt scaling. Under identical material and environmental conditions the thicker external ice layer creates more damage than thinner ice layers. This observa-tion was also successfully demonstrated with the new integrated model. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study, using reference cohorts of blue collar workers and population rates for comparison. The exposed cohort comprises workers with at least 12 months employment time at two plants, producing stainless steel sinks and saucepans (n = 727). Also, reference cohorts of other industrial workers (n = 3965) and fishermen (n = 8092) were analysed. The observation period began 15 years after the start of employment. Standardised mortality or incidence ratios (SMRs, SIRs; county reference rates) were calculated for cause-specific mortality between 1952 and 1993, and for cancer morbidity between 1958 and 1992. RESULTS: In the exposed cohort, overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and all malignant mortality and morbidity were slightly lower than expected. Also, the risk estimates for cancer in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and for stomach cancer were lower than expected. There was an increase in morbidity from colon cancer, which was explained by an excess of tumours in the sigmoid part only. Here, the risk estimates were higher in workers with long employment time (1 - 14 years: four observed cases, SIR 1. 7, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 4 to 4. 5; > or = 15 years: three observed cases, SIR 4. 3, 95 % CI 0. 9 to 13) and the increased risk was especially pronounced among those first employed before 1942. A slight nominal excess of rectal cancers (nine observed cases, SIR 1. 4, 95 % CI 0. 6 to 2. 6), and a significant excess of prostate cancer morbidity (36 observed cases, SIR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 2. 4) were found. These risk estimates did not, however, increase with employment time. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of an increased risk of cancer in the sigmoid part of the colon, which was not found in the reference cohorts, and with indication of a relation between duration of employment and response, is consistent with a causal relation. The limited size of the exposed cohort makes a detailed exposure-response analysis unstable, and the confidence limits are wide. Albeit slightly raised, the risk estimate for rectal cancer in the exposed cohort was not different from the estimate among the other industrial workers...|$|R

The crystalline component is obtained using the rotary-pulse unit, which provides not only the <b>grinding</b> of <b>agents,</b> but their interaction with each other as well in order to accelerate the hydration and structure formation in cement stone. The degree, and kinetics of hydration, the composition of hydrated phases, the structure of the additives and cement stone was studied using the following methods: x-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electron microscope (SEM). Mechanical properties of cement were determined by standard methods and techniques. The expander produced by means of hydrodynamic activation of the sulfoaluminate clinker (SAC) consists of ettringite and hydrated calcium silicates, which are characterized by high dispersion rate (less than 10 µm) and reactivity as the seed for the crystallization of hydrated compounds. The introduction of the ultrafine additives of the crystalline SAC (within 1 - 5 %) was discovered to cause expansion of the cement stone. Implementation of the additives increases cement hydration and contributes to the formation of active centers of crystallization that lead to the fast formation of ettringite, hydrated calcium aluminates and calcium silicates. The activated crystalline additive provides for significant reduction of porosity, initial curing, and high strength of cement stone. In addition, the additive is an expansive component, forming needle-like crystals of ettringite during hydration.
