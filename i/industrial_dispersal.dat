50|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} contribution of Dr. Locsin to the upliftment of the Filipino people is his authorship {{of the bill}} popularly known as the “Filipino First Policy” during his term as Chairman of the National Economic Council (NEC, now the National Economic and Development Authority, or NEDA) from 1958 to 1961. As an effect of the Filipino First Policy, agro-industrial development was given impetus and encouragement. This resulted {{in the establishment of}} more cement factories, flour mills, and FILOIL-the first of the Filipino-owned gasoline companies. It also led to the banning of importation of plywood, the financing of irrigation and fertilizer programs, and the construction of artesian wells and hydro-electric power plants {{in different parts of the}} Philippines. Another major result was the development of new industries through the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Dispersal</b> Program, and the program for social and economic development of the Mindanao Region.|$|E

40|$|For both {{developing}} and developed countries, small and medium scale firms play {{important roles in}} the process of industrialization and economic growth. Apart from increasing per capita income and output, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) create employment opportunities, enhance regional economic balance through <b>industrial</b> <b>dispersal</b> and generally promote effective resource utilization considered critical to engineering economic development and growth. The development of SMEs is seen as accelerating the achievement of wider economic and socio-economic objectives, including poverty alleviation. Unleashing its influence on the way traditional business is conducted hitherto is the phenomenon of electronic commerce (e-commerce). The Internet through its reduction in distance-related costs is seen by many as a potential source of economic revitalization. This Internet economy has continued to grow at an unprecedented rate. Thus, this paper focused on the extent of Nigerian’s SMEs participation in this Internet economy. This will be achieved by considering the conceptual framework ofJIBC December 2008, Vol. 13, No. 3 - 2 -Internet/electronic economy, some applications of Internet/electronic economy, Nigeria SME participation in electronic economy, the benefits and limitations of electronic economy in general, the problems hindering Nigeria SMEs ’ participation in electronic economy and finally pointing out the way forward...|$|E
50|$|Geographically, the post-World War II {{protectorate}} {{corresponded to}} the current German state of Saarland (established after its incorporation into West Germany on 1 January 1957). A policy of <b>industrial</b> disarmament and <b>dispersal</b> of <b>industrial</b> workers was officially pursued by the Allies after the war until 1951 and the region was made a protectorate under French control in 1947. Cold War pressures for a stronger Germany allowed renewed industrialization, and the French returned control of the region {{to the government of}} the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957.|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of electric power {{to meet the}} needs of <b>industrial</b> growth and <b>dispersal</b> in the Philippines is aimed at attaining self-reliance through availment of indigenous energy resources. The Philippines by virtue of her position in the high-heat flow region has in abundance a number of exploitable geothermal fields located all over the country. Results indicate that the geothermal areas of the Philippines presently in various stages of exploration and development are of such magnitude that they can be relied on to meet a significant portion of the country's power need. Large scale geothermal energy for electric power generation was put into operation last year with the inauguration of two 55 -MW geothermal generating units at Tiwi, Albay in Southern Luzon. Another two 55 -MW units were added to the Luzon Grid in the same year from Makiling-Banahaw field about 70 kilometers south of Manila. For 1979 alone, therefore, 220 -MW of generating capacity was added to the power supply coming from geothermal energy. This year a total of 220 -MW power is programmed for both areas. This will bring to 443 -MW of installed generating capacity from geothermal energy with 3 -MW contributed by the Tongonan Geothermal pilot plant in Tongonan, Leyte, Central Philippines in operation since July 1977. Financial consideration of Philippine experience showed that electric power derived from geothermal energy is competitive with other sources of energy and is a viable source of baseload electric power. Findings have proven the technical and economic acceptability of geothermal energy resources development. To realize the benefits that stem from the utilization of indigenous geothermal resources and in the light of the country's ever increasing electric power demand and in the absence of large commercial oil discovery in the Philippines, geothermal energy resource development has been accelerated anew. The program includes development of eight fields by 1989 by adding five more fields to the currently developed and producing geothermal areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} modern utility systems {{together}} with improved transport infrastructures and information technologies introduced new spatial arrangements and temporalities in the territory. In time, these reveal {{a notion of}} urbanisation that does not only takes place in or directly adjacent to the traditional (territorially bounded) city, but in which co-evolving processes lead to differentiated territorial arrangements. Belgium’s distributed urban condition – the ‘nebular city’ – emerged out of the interplay of such multiple territorial arrangements. Often, it is explained by a historical roots in policies of <b>industrial</b> <b>dispersal,</b> while historical efforts to actively accommodate and organise the territory from the broader perspective of urbanisation are assigned a secondary role only. This article, however, takes {{a close look at}} two projects from the 1930 ’s that took the emerging condition of dispersal as their starting point and which both reflect on the role of urbanisation in the reproduction of the conditions in which industrialisation, among other processes of modernisation, can take place. In particular aspects surrounding the Belgian electrification are examined. Although not one of their main drivers, the electrification is both intertwined with the rise of industrial production and the development of an urban modern lifestyle. Only in the 1930 ’s, however, Belgian spatial planners started to explore issues concerning the distribution of electricity and its spatial and economic consequences. Both projects are embedded within the international debate on the functional city and present Belgium as a particular case. They show the general delay and mismatch between the process of industrialisation and urbanisation because of the nation’s chosen development path, both in spatial and temporal terms...|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{have largely}} {{overlooked}} the formative role of industry in both California's {{economic development and}} the San Francisco Bay Area's metropolitan expansion during the late nineteenth century. Beginning in the early 1880 s, leading firms in San Francisco's specialized industries, such as the iron and chemicals sectors, dispersed to the metropolitan periphery. This process of industrial suburbanization created an integrative metropolitan economy, {{as well as individual}} suburbs. In this dissertation, I explore the creation of one of the Bay Area's earliest industrial suburbs, Emeryville. I argue that an analysis of industrial dynamism on the regional scale is integral for understanding metropolitan development and industrial suburbanization. Symbiotic relations between resource extraction and industrial dynamism structured California's distinct mode of capitalist development. The expansion and diversification of resource extraction and processing industries fueled metropolitan growth. Within the broader context of regional capitalism, I examine the process of industrial suburbanization and the formation of Emeryville. I show how two processes greatly influenced <b>industrial</b> <b>dispersal</b> and factory relocation: the creation of an industrial property market and the endogenous logic of industrial production. A coalition of land developers, politicos, and transportation entrepreneurs created a new suburban industrial space. High rates of innovation and accumulation, as well as fierce competition, enabled certain firms to eschew the industrial core and locate their factories in early Emeryville. I draw on array of archival material and primary sources to weave together this distinctive story of California landscapes and industries, and cities and suburbs. My examination of the formation of Emeryville also presents a case study of how industry engenders metropolitan transformation. This dissertation provides insights into the necessarily conjoined processes of city development and industrial suburbanization...|$|E
40|$|Recent global trends have {{affected}} significantly territorial and economic policies, especially in advanced-economy democracies, weakening frequently their national sovereignty. This paper, through published data, documentary sources, and interviews, offers a comparative perspective of industrial localisation’s policies in Israel and Italy, {{focusing on the}} dualism national decision-making/local practice. Although they have two different political structures, both countries have shifted to greater decentralisation, increased deregulation, and more privatisation. Since {{the beginning of the}} State, Israel industrial localisation policy used tools as national and regional planning and fiscal incentives, with the objective of the <b>industrial</b> <b>dispersal.</b> But last years’ profound economic, political, and social changes have led to a transformation of Israeli industrial geography, shifting changes in the government policies, and reinforcing the local-government assertiveness. Developing industrial parks has become a top priority even for rural regional council, with the risk of over-investment in too many industrial parks of too small a size. Similarly, since post-war years Italy concentrated on regenerating the economic periphery, the southern regions, through the “Cassa per il Mezzogiorno”, helping finance and developing irrigation, agriculture and industrial development in the most disadvantaged areas with a policy of investments in infrastructures and financial supports to the localisation of large firms. The change of industrial models, now based on more flexible structures, has brought, almost spontaneously, the “Third Italy” phenomenon, a proliferation of ‘local production systems’ (LPS) where SMEs represent an high share of total employment. Based on an endogenous development model, the success of LPS is not guaranteed unless change and innovation take place among local SMEs and institutions and between the local production system and the external environment, competing areas and other spatial system. For both countries is necessary a comprehensive, strategic and flexible planning and a stable, efficient and no-bureaucratic decision-making process, at an intermediate scale between regional and local. ...|$|E
40|$|Since 1971, {{under the}} New Economic Policy (NEP) of eradicating poverty and {{restructuring}} society, the Malaysian government {{has tried to}} promote a balance in economic activities, which contributed to marked economic differences between geographical locations. Development planning has changed from "building upon the best" (under British colonial times) to "accelerating maximum growth" (1950 s and 1960 s) and finally to "growth with equal distribution" (1971 until now). The discussion in this article will attempt to establish the general pattern of demographic structural change in Peninsular Malaysia and its constituent regions and to examine {{the extent to which}} government policy (restructuring population and decreasing poverty) has influenced the pattern of regional inequalities in Peninsular Malaysia. The first part of this paper will discuss the demographic structural change 3 nd distribution in Peninsular Malaysia, including population growth and concentration, age structure and dependency and. how migration has responded to government policy to redistribute the population. The second part of this paper will discuss the status and change in poverty and society that occurred in the states and regions in Peninsular Malaysia since 1970. Generally, regarding demographic structural change, the research findings show that <b>industrial</b> <b>dispersal</b> and rural-to-urban and rural-to-rural migrations strategies have contributed to increased income and decreasing poverty but have also increased the urbanisation rate in the less developed states. However, poverty remains a problem in the less developed states. Althougll rural-to-urban migration has contributed to decreasing poverty and income distribution, it has also had side effects for the urban and rural population. In the urban areas, these include urban poverty, housing problems and a high influx of foreign workers, while in the rural areas; they include an increased dependency ratio, greater gender inequality, increased poverty and abandoned house...|$|E
