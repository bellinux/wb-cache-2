50|$|<b>Jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> praefertur oneribus: The {{right of}} {{survivorship}} is preferred to incumbrances. Co. Litt. 185o. Hence no dower or courtesy can be claimed out of a joint estate. 1 Steph. Comm. 316.|$|E
50|$|Once an {{interest}} has vested in the beneficiaries {{there can be}} no <b>jus</b> <b>accrescendi,</b> because if one of the beneficiaries dies his share vests in his estate. There is an obvious exception {{in the case of a}} usufruct; on the death of one of the usufructuaries, his interest accrues to the other usufructuaries.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> inter mercatores, pro benefio commercii, locum non habet: The {{right of}} {{survivorship}} has no place between merchants, {{for the benefit of}} commerce. Co. Litt. 182(1 2 Story, Eq. Jur. | 1207; Broom, Max. 455. There is no survivorship in cases of partnership, in contrast to joint-tenancy. Story, Partn. § 00.|$|E
50|$|The rules {{relating}} to the <b>jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> apply not only where the interest disposed of is ownership but also where it is a fideicommissary interest, or a usufruct, or a right to income under a trust; but not where it is a fiduciary interest, and adiation has taken place, for the interest has then vested.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jus</b> <b>accrescendi,</b> or {{the right}} of accrual, is the right of {{beneficiaries}} to whom an interest in property has been left jointly to take the share {{of one of them}} who fails to take his or her share. Such failure may take place by the death of the beneficiary before vesting occurs; or by the beneficiary’s incapacity to take his or her share; or by the beneficiary’s refusal to adiate.|$|E
50|$|Where the <b>jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> {{operates}} the co-beneficiaries {{to whom the}} vacant portion accrues take the same shares thereof as they do of their own portion. Where it does not operate the share vacated by a co-heir devolves upon the intestate heirs of the testator, while the share vacated by a co-legatee falls into the residue of the estate and devolves upon the heirs, testate or intestate, of the testator.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order that}} the <b>jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> should operate where the {{beneficiaries}} are appointed verbis tantum, it must appear from the will that the testator positively contemplated the lapse of a specific share, and that the testator intended that such share should in that event accrue to the other beneficiaries. It {{has been suggested that}} such an intention appears where the testator appoints two or more persons “sole and universal heirs.” ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> praefertur ultima voluntati: The {{right of}} {{survivorship}} is preferred to the last will. Co. Litt 1856. A devise of one's share of a joint estate, by will, is no severance of the jointure; for no testament takes effect till {{after the death of}} the testator, and by such death the right of the survivor (which accrued at the original creation of the estate, and has therefore a priority to the other) is already vested. 2 Bl. Comm. 18(i; 3 Steph. Comm. 316.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of any {{contrary}} indication in the will as to the testator’s intention the <b>jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> takes place where the beneficiaries have been appointed jointly, or re et verbis; but not where they have been appointed to separate shares, or verbis tantum. It is important to note, however, that even if the form of joinder of heirs in a will is verbis tantum the intention of the testator may be otherwise. It is in the will that indications of the testator’s opinion must be sought but it is permissible and sometimes essential to read and interpret the will {{in the light of the}} relevant circumstances existing at the time of its making.|$|E
5000|$|While a {{sole owner}} will {{generally}} {{be free to}} use and dispose of {{his interest in the}} way he sees fit, the rules differ when land is under co-ownership. The Law of Property Acts, which aimed to improve land's transferability on the market, required that land could have a maximum of four co-owners, who must all have the same title. This means that a purchaser need only deal with a maximum of four people to buy an interest (e.g. an outright purchase, or a mortgage) in it. The Law of Property Act 1925 sections 1(6) and 36(2) prohibits a divided legal title, known as a [...] "tenancy in common". If there are more people with a co-ownership interest, then by the Law of Property Act 1925 section 34(2) the first four people named on a conveyance will be deemed by law to be trustees for the further co-owners. In effect these first four people become legal representatives for the other owners in equity. Although to simplify conveyancing the law does not, equity does recognise unlimited numbers of co-owners, and owners with unequal interests (i.e. [...] "tenants in common"). If land is traded, their interests will be considered [...] "overreached", or effectively bought out over their heads with their interest detached from the land and reattached to purchase money, if money is paid to at least two trustees. The requirement for two trustees to receive the money is intended to reduce danger of one trustee running off with money {{to the detriment of the}} equitable owners. In the first main form of co-ownership, known as [...] "joint tenancy", the joint tenants are deemed to share equally in the value of the property if it is sold, and if one joint tenant dies, the others will (by the [...] "right of survivorship" [...] or <b>jus</b> <b>accrescendi</b> in Latin) take the whole of his share. This is a legal presumption, and owners are free to stipulate that they wish their share to be apportioned differently (e.g. depending on financial contribution to the property), and that they wish someone else to inherit their share. When making a transfer of property on HM Land Registry's [...] "TR1" [...] form, owners may indicate which relation they choose, however in Stack v Dowden the Supreme Court observed that this will not always be decisive, particularly where people do not have full understanding of the survivorship rule and have made very unequal financial contributions to the property. But otherwise, co-owners will remain as joint tenants in equity until they take action to sever their share.|$|E
