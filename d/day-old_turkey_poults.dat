40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Day-old</b> <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were {{obtained}} from a commercial hatchery which hatched eggs from a particular flock of breeders that produced a considerable num-ber (5 - 10 %) of culls. These cull poults showed symptoms almost classical for polyneuritis. Injection of the poults with a combination vitamin mixture containing thiamine, or of thiamine alone, caused decreased mortality and a remission of symptoms. Poults injected with thiamine grew and developed normally when fed a practical type diet. The addition of 2 mg. /kg. of thiamine to the breeder ration caused the condition to disappear in newly-hatched poults from the particular flock involved. Classical symptoms of polyneuritis were noted in newly-hatched quail from breeding flocks fed turkey breeder rations. These quail responded positively to thiamine injection. POULTKY SCIENCE 51 : 419 - 423, 1972 THE thiamine requirement for maxi-mum hatchability in chickens has been reported by Polin et al. (1963). These workers reported that a minimum yolk level of 0. 63 p. p. m. of thiamine was neces-sary for maximum hatchability. Their data indicated that a normal dietary level of 0. 68 p. p. m. would produce this level of thi-amine in the yolk. Sullivan et al. (1967) and Robenalt, (1960), reported the thia-mine requirement of young turkey poults to be between 1. 2 and 2 p. p. m. Armintrout et al. (1964), suggested that the require-ment for thiamine by the young turkey in-creases with age. Little is known of the fre-quency of thiamine deficiency among com-mercial turkey flocks. The natural abun-dance of thiamine in feed ingredients sug-gests that the condition is rare. However, borderline cases may occasionally go unrec-ognized. The present studies were initiated to in-vestigate a field problem apparently related to thiamine deficiency in newly-hatched tur-key poults and a polyneuritis condition ob-served in Coturnix quail.

40|$|The current National Research Council (NRC) {{selenium}} (Se) {{requirement for}} the turkey is 0. 2 μg Se/g diet. The sequencing of the turkey selenoproteome offers additional molecular biomarkers for assessment of Se status. To determine dietary Se requirements using selenoprotein transcript levels and enzyme activities, <b>day-old</b> male <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were fed a Se-deficient diet supplemented with graded levels of Se (0, 0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 μg Se/g diet) as selenite, and 12. 5 X the vitamin E requirement. Poults fed less than 0. 05 μg Se/g diet had a significantly reduced rate of growth, indicating the Se requirement for growth in young male poults is 0. 05 μg Se/g diet. Se deficiency decreased plasma GPX 3 (glutathione peroxidase), liver GPX 1, and liver GPX 4 activities to 2, 3, and 7 %, respectively, of Se-adequate levels. Increasing Se supplementation resulted in well-defined plateaus for all blood, liver and gizzard enzyme activities and mRNA levels, showing that these selenoprotein biomarkers {{could not be used}} as biomarkers for supernutritional-Se status. Using selenoenzyme activity, minimum Se requirements based on red blood cell GPX 1, plasma GPX 3, and pancreas and liver GPX 1 activities were 0. 29 - 0. 33 μg Se/g diet. qPCR analyses using all 10 dietary Se treatments for all 24 selenoprotein transcripts (plus SEPHS 1) in liver, gizzard, and pancreas found that only 4, 4, and 3 transcripts, respectively, were significantly down-regulated by Se deficiency and could be used as Se biomarkers. Only GPX 3 and SELH mRNA were down regulated in all 3 tissues. For these transcripts, minimum Se requirements were 0. 07 - 0. 09 μg Se/g for liver, 0. 06 - 0. 15 μg Se/g for gizzard, and 0. 13 - 0. 18 μg Se/g for pancreas, all less than enzyme-based requirements.

40|$|ABSTRACT A 3 -wk {{feeding trial}} using 920 <b>day-old</b> <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> was {{conducted}} to evaluate the addition of seven levels of phytase (Natuphos®; 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1, 000, and 1, 200 U/kg of diet) to diets containing three levels of nonphytate P (nP) (. 27,. 36, and. 45 %). A positive control diet contained. 60 % nP. Semi-purified basal diets contained soybean meal as the only protein source. The increase in BW gain from added phytase was greatest for the lowest nP diet (nP by phytase interaction, P <. 001). At. 27 % nP, gains improved (P <. 001) to 800 U of phytase/kg of diet and then reached a plateau. At. 36 and. 45 % nP, increases in gains were observed only for 200 U of phytase/kg of diet. The highest phytase addition to. 36 and. 45 % nP diets produced gains equal {{to those of the}} positive control diet. Feed intake increases paralleled those of BW gains. Gain:feed was lowest for the. 27 % nP diets without phytase, but improved (P <. 001) to 800 U of phytase/kg of diet and then reached a plateau. The high incidence of leg disorders and high mortality (40 %) observed for the poults fed the. 27 % nP diet without added phytase declined with the addition of 200 to 400 U of phytase/kg of diet. Ash percentage of toes and tibias increased as the levels of nP (P <. 001) and phytase (P <. 01) increased; the magnitude of the response to phytase decreased as nP in the diet increased, resulting in an nP by phytase interaction (P <. 001). Tibial shear force and stress responded in a similar manner to increasing levels of nP and added phytase. Results show that 652 U of microbial phytase is equivalent to 1 g of P from defluorinated phosphate in turkey starter diets using soybean meal as the only source of phytate P. The response per 100 U of phytase decreased as the total amount of phytase added was increased...|$|E
40|$|Four {{groups of}} <b>day-old</b> <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were fed a {{synthetic}} vitamin D-deficient diet. Poults received weekly, progressively increased oral repletion of: corn oil, group I; vitamin D 3, group II; 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, group III; 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 plus 24, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, group IV. Poults were examined for clinical and structural changes of bone and parathyroid glands;Poults in group I rapidly developed ricketic changes by day 10. In the growth plates of the proximal tibiotarsus, the lengths of the proliferating-prehypertrophied and unmineralized hypertrophic chondrocyte zones increased rapidly {{in conjunction with}} a reciprocal decrease in length of the mineralized hypertrophic degenerative zones. This reciprocal exchange occurred faster in the proximal tibiotarsus than in the distal tibiotarsus. Other significant findings included: decreases in bone ash, bone ash (calcium, phosphorus and magnesium), bone length, and body weight. Bone-ash, Ca/P ratios and plasma alkaline phosphatase actively increased. There were normocalcemia, hyper-to-normophosphatemia, parathyroid hyperplasia, and rapid depletion of vitamin D 3 metabolites. Ultrastructurally, hyperplastic parathyroid chief cells had expanded cytoplasmic volumes, reduced numbers of secretory granules, and tortous, interdigitated plasma membranes. Cartilage matrix vesicles (80 - 113 nm) and bone matrix-like vesicles (53 - 133 nm) were seen in all four groups;Group II poults (control) did not develop rickets. Group II poults had low plasma levels of 25 OHD 3 and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 indicating that growing turkey poults may require higher levels of vitamin D 3 than NRC requires;Groups III and IV had significant mild ricketic changes: elongated proliferating-prehypertrophied zone with irregular distal margin and elevated plasma alkaline phosphatase. Total bone ash calcium and phosphorus levels of group IV were similar to group II but group III values were significantly less than group II. These results suggest that 24, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 synergistically restores bone levels of calcium and phosphorus; thus, it is an important vitamin D 3 metabolite. These results also suggest that vitamin D 3 is more effective than 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and that 24, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 provides no synergism in preventing all ricketic changes...|$|E

40|$|THE {{riboflavin}} {{requirements of}} the chick {{and the consequences of}} ribo-flavin deficiency have been fairly well established by Lepkovsky and Jukes (1936).

40|$|Rye {{contains}} {{high concentrations}} of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), leading to reduced digestibility. Since poultry {{have little or no}} endogenous enzymes capable of hydrolyzing these NSP, exogenous carbohydrases as feed additives are used in an attempt to reduce the anti-nutritional effects of these polysaccharides. Previously, an in vitro study conducted in our laboratory showed that inclusion of certain Bacillus direct-fed microbial (DFM) candidates that produce exogenous phytase, lipase, protease, cellulase and xylanase in high NSP diets significantly reduced both digesta viscosity and Clostridium perfringens proliferation. In the present study, rye-based turkey starter diets with or without Bacillus-DFM were administered ad libitum to day-of-hatch <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> in two independent experiments. In both experiments, day-of-hatch <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were randomly assigned to either a control diet (CON) or a DFM treated diet (n = 25 birds/group). At ten days–of-age, all <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> from experiments 1 and 2 were weighted and 12 turkey poults/group were randomly selected and humanely killed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 In recent years, small poultry {{producers}} {{have been interested}} in finding an alternative for corn and soybean for a variety of reasons. Health concerns related to either naturally occurring isoflavones (phytoestrogens) or their genetically modified organism (GMO) status are the primary considerations behind this trend. Secondly, the recent high prices of corn and soy and unavailability of these two ingredients locally are other reasons to identify alternative feed ingredients. For these reasons, three experiments were performed to identify the feasibility of including locally grown alternative feed ingredients in turkey rations. The first experiment assessed the inclusion of up to 30 % wheat, 10 % lentils, and 10 % chickpea to replace all of the corn and a part of soybean in turkey diets to eight weeks of age. The wheat based diet was supplemented with Alpha Gal™ 180 P enzymes at level 0. 4 1 bs/ton. Day old <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the diets and body weight, feed consumption, and mortality were recorded at two, four, six and, eight weeks of age. Body weights of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed wheat based diets with and without enzymes outperformed (p = 0. 04) the body weights of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed the corn-soy based control diet. No significant (p > 0. 05) differences were observed between the body weights of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed diets with or without enzymes. There was no significant difference between the feed conversion ratios of the three groups. Feeding wheat-based diets improved growth rates in <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> compared with corn-soy based control diet but did not affect feed conversion. Adding AlphaGal™ 180 p to wheat-based diets did not improve growth rates or feed conversion in <b>turkey</b> <b>poults.</b> Experiment two compared the growth rates and feed conversions of turkeys fed a corn based –soy free, and, a wheat based (corn-soy free) to the control (corn-soy based) diets. Day old <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were randomly assigned to one of the diets. Body weight, feed consumption, and mortality were determined at two, four, six and, eight weeks of age. The final body weights of poults fed the control diet were significantly higher than those fed a corn based-soy free or a wheat based (corn-soy free) diets (P = 0. 001). There were no statistical differences between body weights (3. 1 kg) of birds fed a corn based-soy free diet and body weights (3. 2 kg) of birds fed a wheat based (corn-soy free) diet. The feed efficiency was not different between treatments. Excluding soybean from the diets decreased growth rates in <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> but did not affect feed conversion. It also increased mortality and cannibalism. Experiment three compared the growth rates and feed efficiency of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed wheat based diets containing different level of methionine (control 0. 5 %, organic 0. 15 %, and, no supplemental methionine 0 %) for six weeks. There were no significant differences between the mean body weights of birds fed a wheat based diet supplemented with 0. 5 % methionine (control) and the mean body weights of birds fed a wheat based diet supplemented with 0. 15 % methionine (organic), while <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> fed a ration containing 0 % supplemental methionine had significantly (P <. 05) lower bodyweight when compared to the organic (0. 15 % met) and control (0. 5 % met) diets.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{consumption}} of new wood shavings on hematology of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> was {{studied in the}} response of groups fed commercial turkey starter rations with added folic acid, with wood shavings {ad libitum), with both or neither. There were no significant dif-ferences in the hematological parameters of mean cell volume, erythrocyte numbers, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration or mean cell hemoglobin concentration indicating that the consumption of new shavings {{was not related to}} a folic acid deficiency severe enough to cause the classical macrocytic anemia. The consumption of wood shavings used for litter for <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> may be high under certain environmental or man-agement conditions. Previous experiments (Charles, 1972) have suggested that feather and leg problems of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> might be related to the consumption of old litter.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{susceptibility}} of 4 bird species (ducklings, goslings, turkeys and chickens) to a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H 6 N 2 subtype) and to evaluate the corresponding virus shedding periods. For that purpose, 9 <b>turkey</b> <b>poults,</b> 9 chickens, 7 ducklings and 6 goslings, were experimentally infected by the H 6 N 2 virus (105 ELD 50) by intravenous route whereas another 16 birds (2 ducklings, 2 goslings, 6 <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> and 6 chickens) were not infected and served as negative controls. The virus re-isolation method was performed on cloacal and oropharyngeal samples collected before inoculation and 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days after inoculation. The virus was re-isolated from all ducklings (100 %), 67 % of goslings, 56 % of <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> and from 33 % of chickens essentially during the first 10 days after virus inoculation. The proportion of positive cloacal samples was higher compared to that of oropharyngeal samples (positive cloacal samples were 72 %, 83 %, 80 % and 87 % from all positive samples in ducklings, <b>turkey</b> <b>poults,</b> chickens and goslings respectively). The mean virus shedding periods determined from cloacal samples were 10. 6, 6. 6, 5. 4 and 4. 3 days in ducklings, turkeys, goslings and chickens respectively. The longest periods observed in this study were 21 (ducklings), 10 (turkeys and goslings) and 5 days (chickens). The oropharyngeal virus shedding periods were shorter in the 4 species. Consequently, cloacal samples may be more relevant to exploring spontaneous avian influenza cases...|$|R

Two inde-pendent trials were conducted to evaluate the effect of rye {{as a source of}} energy on bacteri-al translocation, intestinal viscosity, gut microbiota composition, and bone mineralization, when compared with corn in <b>turkey</b> <b>poults.</b> In each experiment, day-of-hatch, <b>turkey</b> <b>poults</b> were randomly assigned to either a corn or a rye diet (n = 0 /group). At 10 d of age, in both experiments, 12 birds/group were given an oral gavage dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d). After 2. 5 h of oral gavage, blood and liver samples were collected to eval-uate the passage of FITC-d and bacterial translocation (BT) respectively. Duodenum, ileum and cecum gut sections were collected to evaluate intestinal viscosity and to enumerate gut microbiota. Tibias were collected for observation of bone parameters. Broilers fed with a rye diet showed increased (p< 0. 05) intestinal viscosity, BT, and serum FITC-d.
