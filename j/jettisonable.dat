5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a <b>jettisonable</b> crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|The P-4 {{contained}} {{many changes}} from the P-2 and P-3. The <b>jettisonable</b> loads {{were capable of}} considerable variation. Two external SC 1800kg (3,960lb) bombs, two LMA air-dropped anti-shipping mines, one SC 1,800kg plus four SC 250kg; or one SC 2,500kg external bomb could be carried on an ETC Rüstsatz rack. Depending on the load variation, an 835 L fuel and 120 L oil tank could be added {{in place of the}} internal bomb bay. The armament consisted of three defensive MG 15 machine guns. later supplemented by a further three MG 15s and one MG 17 machine gun. The radio communications were standard FuG X(10), Peil G V direction finding and FuBI radio devices. Due to the increase in defensive firepower, the crew numbers increased from four to five. The empty weight of the P-4 increased to 6,775kg (14,936lb), and the full takeoff weight increased to 13,500kg (29,762lb) owing to the mentioned alterations.|$|E
25|$|First Falcon 9 {{launch to}} have a <b>jettisonable</b> payload fairing, which {{introduced}} the risk of an additional separation event.|$|E
25|$|Carrier trainer {{version with}} <b>jettisonable</b> wheeled {{undercarriage}} and floats under wings to allow safe ditching. Navy designation Navy Type 10-2 Carrier Fighter.|$|E
25|$|The British {{design for}} a {{supersonic}} test aircraft Miles M.52 of necessity had a <b>jettisonable</b> pilot capsule {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The aircraft progressed no further than a nearly complete airframe before cancellation in 1946.|$|E
25|$|The {{improved}} HH-3E variant {{would follow}} later, with eight built, and all 50 CH-3Es {{were converted to}} this standard. Known as the Jolly Green Giant, the HH-3E featured protective armor, self-sealing tanks, a retractable inflight refueling probe, <b>jettisonable</b> external tanks, a high-speed hoist, and other specialized equipment.|$|E
25|$|Drop tanks, {{external}} tanks, wing tanks, pylon tanks or belly {{tanks are}} all terms {{used to describe}} auxiliary externally mounted fuel tanks. Drop tanks are generally expendable and often <b>jettisonable.</b> External tanks are commonplace on modern military aircraft and occasionally found in civilian ones, although the latter {{are less likely to}} be discarded except in the event of emergency.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the first}} {{launch of the}} Falcon 9 v1.1 in September 2013, which {{experienced}} a post-mission second-stage engine restart failure, the second-stage igniter propellant lines were insulated to better support in-space restart following long coast phases for orbital trajectory maneuvers. Falcon 9 Flight 6 was the first launch of the Falcon 9 configured with a <b>jettisonable</b> payload fairing.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} carrier-based fighter of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1926 was the Mitsubishi 1MF or Navy Type 10 Carrier Type Fighter, {{designed in}} 1921 by the ex-Sopwith British designer Herbert Smith. In April that year, a specification was issued to Mitsubishi, Aichi and Nakajima {{for a replacement}} for the Type 10, requiring the aircraft to stay afloat {{in the event of}} ditching in the sea. Mitsubishi gave the task of designing the new fighter to Joji Hattori, who had worked with Smith on the design of the Type 10. The resultant aircraft, the Experimental Taka-type (Falcon) fighter or 1MF9, was a single-bay biplane of wooden construction with fabric covering. It had a watertight fuselage and <b>jettisonable</b> fixed conventional landing gear to meet the Navy's ditching requirements (<b>jettisonable</b> because aircraft with fixed landing gear are very dangerous to land on water, since the drag from the water can easily flip the aircraft over when the wheels touch the surface), and was powered by a Mitsubishi Hi V-12 (licence-built Hispano-Suiza Lb). The pilot sat in an open cockpit, armed with two synchronised machine guns.|$|E
25|$|Fitted with Emerson nose turret {{with two}} 20 mm cannon {{replacing}} solid nose of earlier versions, while retaining dorsal and tail turrets. New, larger, <b>jettisonable</b> tip tanks, with traverable searchlight slaved to nose turret {{in front of}} starboard tip-tank and AN/APS-8 radar in nose of port tip-tank. AN/APS-20 search radar under fuselage. Later aircraft featured glazed observation nose and MAD gear in place of nose and tail turrets, and revised crew accommodation, with many earlier aircraft refitted. Dorsal turret often removed. 424 built.|$|E
25|$|In July the 56th FG {{was moved}} from its {{comfortable}} quarters at Horsham St. Faith to a much-less improved installation at RAF Halesworth, {{along the coast}} of Suffolk, both to be nearer to German-occupied territory and to allow Horsham St. Faith to be completed as a heavy bomber base. On 12 August it used partially filled and unpressurized 200-gallon ferry tanks as <b>jettisonable</b> fuel tanks {{for the first time in}} combat, escorting bombers headed for Bonn, Germany. In its first four months of missions, the 56th Group shot down 9 aircraft and lost 10.|$|E
25|$|Despite severe {{material}} shortages, work on {{the experimental}} design started in 1948, and the main designer became Bronisław Żurakowski (brother of test pilot Janusz Żurakowski), who designed the helicopter rotor and the control system. It used simpler Hiller rotor type, with two auxiliary blades. The structure of the fuselage, tail boom, auxiliary rotor and tricycle undercarriage were designed by Tadeusz Chyliński. The power unit and final drive were designed by Zbigniew Brzoska. The design utilized some components left by the Germans, like a piston engine Hirth HM 504 (re-configured for vertical use), rear gear from a Zündapp motorcycle and wheels from a DFS Kranich glider's <b>jettisonable</b> landing gear.|$|E
25|$|The Dornier D.I was one {{of several}} designs by Claude Dornier to have an {{all-metal}} stressed skin monocoque structure, {{and it was the first}} fighter to feature such construction and although production was cancelled prior to the completion of any production versions, it was also the first aircraft with these features to go into production. To reduce the hazards of inflight fires, it also had an external fuel tank, which, according to some sources may have been <b>jettisonable,</b> and thick-section cantilevered wings for improved aerodynamics. The Dornier Do H Falke was developed from it, but had an enlarged upper wing and dispensed with the lower wing.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Germany began a {{comprehensive}} upgrade program, {{known as the}} Improved Combat Efficiency (ICE) program, for their Alpha Jet fleet; these upgrades were to involve the installation of a Mil Spec 1553B databus, new sensors integrated with the navigation/attack systems, modernized electronic countermeasures suite, measures to minimize the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures, protection measures around the fuel system, and new armaments such as the AGM-65 Maverick. In 1988, {{it was announced that}} the ICE program has been cancelled. A more austere upgrade program did proceed in its place, which integrated the AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile and navigation computer upgrades, along with several minor airframe and equipment refinements, such as the addition of a <b>jettisonable</b> gun pod.|$|E
25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood stressed-skin tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a rubber-sprung tail skid. For take-off a <b>jettisonable</b> two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly at the right moment to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage. An aero-tow hook was provided in the extreme nose, as well as a bungee hook and twin winch-launch hooks either side of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The P-47D-16, D-20, D-22 and D-23 {{were similar}} to the P-47D-15 with minor {{improvements}} in the fuel system, engine subsystems, (the P-47D-20 introduced the R-2800-59 engine) a <b>jettisonable</b> canopy, and a bulletproof windshield. Beginning with the block 22 aircraft, the original narrow-chorded Curtiss propeller was replaced by propellers with larger blades, the Evansville plant switching to a new Curtiss propeller with a diameter of 13ft (3.96m) and the Long Island plant using a Hamilton Standard propeller with a diameter of 13ft 2in (4.01m). With the bigger propellers having barely 6in (152mm) of ground clearance, Thunderbolt pilots {{had to learn to}} be careful on takeoffs to keep the tail down until they obtained adequate ground clearance, and on landings to flare the aircraft properly. Failure to do so damaged both the propeller and the runway. A modification to the main gear legs was installed to extend the legs via an electric motor (un-extending before retraction) to accommodate the larger propeller diameter.|$|E
25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a <b>jettisonable</b> roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding artificial feel system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E
25|$|The record-breaking XB-42 {{prototype}} {{had been}} destroyed in a crash at Bolling Field. The second of two prototypes of the Douglas XB-42, 43-50225, on a routine flight out of Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., suffered in short order, a landing gear extension problem, failure of the port engine, and as coolant temperatures rose, failure of the starboard engine. Maj. Hayduck bailed out at 1,200 feet, Lt. Col. Haney at 800 feet, and pilot Lt. Col. (later Major General) Fred J. Ascani, after crawling aft to jettison the pusher propellers, at 400 feet – all three survived. The aircraft crashed at Oxen Hill, Maryland. Classified <b>jettisonable</b> propeller technology caused a problem for authorities in explaining what witnesses on the ground thought was the aircraft exploding. Possible fuel management problems were speculated, but this hypothesis was never proven by subsequent investigation. The remaining prototype was used in flight test programs, including fulfilling a December 1943 proposal by Douglas to fit uprated engines and underwing Westinghouse 19XB-2A axial-flow turbojets of 1,600lbf (7.1kN) thrust each, making it the XB-42A.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 890 Meteors {{were lost in}} RAF service (145 of these crashes {{occurring}} in 1953 alone), resulting {{in the deaths of}} 450 pilots. Contributory factors in the number of crashes were the poor brakes, failure of the landing gear, the high fuel consumption and consequent short flight endurance (less than one hour), causing pilots to run out of fuel, and difficult handling with one engine out due to the widely set engines. The casualty rate was exacerbated by the lack of ejection seats in early series Meteors; the ground-breaking high speed that the aircraft was capable of meant that, during the bailing out process, pilots were typically subject to high g forces hindering movement and the effect of slipstream winds; there was also a greater likelihood of the pilot striking the horizontal tailplane. Ejection seats would be fitted in the later F.8, FR.9, PR.10 and some experimental Meteors. The difficulty of bailing out of the Meteor has been noted by pilots during development, reporting several contributing design factors such as the limited size and relative position of the cockpit {{to the rest of the}} aircraft, and difficulty in using the two-lever <b>jettisonable</b> hood mechanism.|$|E
500|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} {{aircraft}} was its use of [...] "Metalite" [...] for its skin. This was made of balsa that was sandwiched between two thin sheets of aluminum. [...] "Fabrilite" [...] was also used for the surfaces of the vertical stabilizer and rudder; this was similar to Metalite, but used fiberglass instead of aluminum. Two fuel tanks were fitted {{in the center of}} the fuselage. The forward tank, ahead of the wing, contained [...] and the rear tank, [...] These were supplemented by two <b>jettisonable</b> [...] tip tanks. The cockpit was well forward and was provided with a bubble canopy which gave the pilot good visibility. He was provided with a Mk 6 lead-computing gyro gunsight. Underneath the cockpit were four 20mm (0.79in) M3 autocannon. Their 600 rounds of ammunition were carried behind the pilot. The empty casings of the two upper guns were retained in the aircraft, while those from the two lower guns were ejected overboard.|$|E
500|$|The Hotspur Mark I was {{constructed}} from wood and {{was designed to}} accommodate eight fully armed airborne troops. Its wingspan was [...] and it was [...] in length. With a full load (approximately [...] ), it weighed approximately [...] The Mk I was distinguished from its other variants {{by the addition of}} cabin portholes along its fuselage, and hooks on the nose and tail to allow multiple Hotspurs to be towed together. The two pilots, and later the pilot and instructor when the Hotspurs were used as training gliders, sat in tandem in the cockpit. It had a <b>jettisonable</b> undercarriage, and its unusual fuselage functioned like a lid; once the Hotspur had landed, the troops inside would throw off {{the top half of the}} fuselage and then climb out of the lower half, much like leaving a small boat. A total of 18 Hotspur Mk Is were produced, 10 by GAl and eight by Slingsby Aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The ratio between {{length and}} {{wingspan}} was practically {{the same as}} that of an Avro Lancaster bomber, which had a wingspan of [...] and a length of , in contrast to modern sport gliders which possess a particularly large wingspan to enhance gliding performance. This was the result of a decision taken by the War Office in early 1940 on how military gliders would be used; the idea was for the glider to be released at a low altitude close to the landing zone and conduct a steep descent to reduce time in the air and exposure to enemy fire. The glider also possessed large flaps which assisted in a steep and rapid descent, and through adjustments of their angle during landing a precise control over descent rate and point of landing could be achieved; they also allowed a slower touchdown speed to be attained. They were operated through a small bottle of compressed air large enough only for a single landing; a small bottle not only saved weight, but gave a smaller chance of it being hit by enemy fire, thereby exploding and damaging the glider. Standard approach speed for the Hamilcar was , although for shorter landings this could be slowed to , and stalling speeds were [...] with flaps up or [...] with flaps deployed. The Hamilcar was fitted with tailwheel landing gear, with oleo-pneumatic shock absorbers that could be deflated to bring the fuselage nose down for loading or unloading purposes. A <b>jettisonable</b> undercarriage was initially designed for the glider, as it was discovered that it travelled for a shorter distance when it landed only on its skids. However, this was eventually replaced with a fixed undercarriage – the same as had been designed for ferrying operations – as pilots found that they preferred to land on wheels because of the extra control it gave them and the ability to avoid other gliders and potential collisions in the landing area. The wheeled undercarriage was not fitted until after the glider had been loaded; two 15-ton jacks were used to lift the aircraft for the fitting.|$|E
2500|$|... 200 U.S. gallon (758l) ferry tank: A {{conformal}} tub-shaped <b>jettisonable</b> tank made of paper, which barely {{cleared the}} ground on grass airfields, {{was used as an}} interim measure between 30 July and 31 August 1943.|$|E
2500|$|G-2/R1: Long-range fighter-bomber. It {{carried a}} bomb up to 500kg (1,100lb) under the {{fuselage}} {{and had a}} modified fuel system with underwing fittings for a 300L (80US gal) drop tank. As a standard Bf 109G had not enough ground clearance to carry a 500kg bomb, a <b>jettisonable</b> auxiliary undercarriage was added just aft of the cockpit. The prototype was the FiSk 199. No production known ...|$|E
2500|$|Development of the BQ-2 {{began on}} July 10, 1942, under {{a program for}} the {{development}} of [...] "aerial torpedoes" [...] - unmanned flying bombs - that had been instigated in March of that year. Fleetwings was contracted to build a single XBQ-2 assault drone, powered by two Lycoming XO-435 opposed piston engines, and fitted with a fixed landing gear in tricycle configuration; the landing [...] gear was <b>jettisonable</b> for better aerodynamics.|$|E
2500|$|Trials proving satisfactory, {{the type}} went into {{production}} and service. Most of the F.17s shipped aboard the carriers HMS Campania, [...] {{and the first}} aircraft joined Campania and the type took its name from her. Only Campania possessed a flight deck; Campanias operated from this using <b>jettisonable,</b> wheeled bogies fitted to the floats. The aircraft in the other ships took off from {{the water in the}} normal way.|$|E
2500|$|Pioneering {{developments}} in jettisonable-cockpit style escape capsule systems occurred in Nazi Germany, by both Heinkel Flugzeugwerke {{and by the}} Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (German Institute for Glider Research). [...] Heinkel Flugzeugwerke built the first ejection-seat-equipped combat aircraft, the Heinkel He 219. [...] Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug flew the Heinkel He 176 rocket plane (in 1939), and the DFS 228 research aircraft, both of which had a <b>jettisonable</b> nose.|$|E
2500|$|The M.S.325 was {{relatively}} modest in its concept still featuring an open cockpit (originally the tail surfaces were fabric covered) and fixed-gear with the semi-elliptical two-spar wings braced by exterior struts. The wings had two <b>jettisonable</b> wing root fuel tanks {{with a pair}} of [...] Châtellerault machine guns mounted one above each of the widely spaced landing gear legs. More unusual was that the incidence of the starboard wing greater than that of the port wing to counter torque; the engine was also canted slightly to port to counter the resultant yaw.|$|E
2500|$|The S-35 was a {{sesquiplane}} with a fixed tailskid landing gear. It {{was modified}} to take three [...] Gnome-Rhône Jupiter 9A radial engines and fitted with <b>jettisonable</b> auxiliary landing gear.These modifications {{took time to}} complete and the aircraft first flew on 23 August 1926 from Roosevelt Field. Sikorsky started a series of test flights but as none were at the maximum takeoff weight of , Sikorsky wanted to delay the transatlantic crossing until early 1927, but the promoters of the flight would not accept a delay and the aircraft was prepared for the crossing.|$|E
2500|$|The AC-6 is a [...] {{wing span}} {{development}} of the [...] span AC-5M, with longer, higher aspect ratio wings terminating in winglets. Like the AC-5, the AC-6 wing employs a Wortmann FX 60-157 airfoil. Assembly of the wing to the fuselage uses a cam pin and incorporates automatic hookups for the ailerons and air brakes. The landing gear is a retractable [...] tire monowheel gear suspended with a pneumatic-hydraulic shock absorber. The wheel has a lever and cable operated drum brake. The cockpit can accommodate pilots up to [...] in height. The canopy provides 300° field of view and is <b>jettisonable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|George Carter of Sopwith-based {{his design}} for the transatlantic {{aircraft}} on the single-engined Sopwith B.1 bomber aircraft. [...] It was a large, two-bay biplane powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle engine in a tractor configuration. [...] It had a deeper fuselage than the B.1, housing a fuel tank carrying 330Imperial Gallons (1,500L) of petrol and with the crew of two sat well aft of the wings. [...] The undercarriage mainwheels were <b>jettisonable</b> to reduce drag, while a boat was provided in case of emergency landing on the sea, being built into the fuselage decking behind the crew's cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|... 1970 was {{the year}} that Cessna {{introduced}} the A150K Aerobat, a Cessna 150K with limited aerobatic capabilities. It retained the [...] Continental O-200 all 150s used, but differed from the baseline 150K in having more structural strength, being rated +6/-3 g. Other [...] "aerobatic" [...] features included four-point harnesses for both occupants, dual overhead skylights for upward visibility (which, while standard on the Cessna 140, had not {{been part of the}} 150 design) <b>jettisonable</b> doors, a more sporty checkerboard paint scheme and removable seat cushions so that parachutes could be worn. In 1970, an Aerobat cost $12,000 as opposed to the $11,450 price for a 150K Commuter model.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning F.6 was the {{ultimate}} Lightning version to see British service. Originally, it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two [...] ferry tanks on pylons over the wings. These tanks were <b>jettisonable</b> in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified {{in the form of}} a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from , but the cannon made the F.6 a “real fighter” again.|$|E
2500|$|R-37 (missile) (AA-X-13/AA-13 'Arrow') was {{developed}} from the R-33 (missile) (AA-9 'Amos') and is intended for the Sukhoi Su-35 Flanker-E, Sukhoi Su-37 Flanker-F, MiG 1.42 MFI and other future fighters. According to Defence Today the range depends on the flight profile, from [...] for a direct shot to [...] for a cruise glide profile. Jane's reports two variants, the R-37 and the R-37M; the latter has a <b>jettisonable</b> rocket booster that increases the range to [...] "300-400km" [...] (160–220nmi). Work on the missile appears to have restarted in late 2006, {{as part of the}} MiG-31BM programme to update the Foxhound with a new radar and ground attack capability.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, the French {{aircraft}} manufacturer Ateliers d'Aviation François Villiers was formed at Meudon near Paris. One {{of its first}} designs was to meet a requirement of the French Navy for a two-seat shipboard fighter. [...] Villier's design, the Villiers II was a single-engined sesquiplane (i.e. a biplane with the lower wing {{much smaller than the}} upper wing). Although of conventional tractor configuration with the engine in the nose driving a two-bladed propeller, and a tailwheel undercarriage, in order to allow safe ditching {{in the event of an}} emergency, it had a number of unusual features, with the fuselage being watertight and in the form of a flying boat hull, and the undercarriage being <b>jettisonable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the D.VI was circular in cross-section, {{with its}} 11-cylinder, [...] Siemens-Halske Sh.IIIa rotary engine completely cowled {{in the nose}} driving a four blade propeller. [...] The fuselage diameter decreased markedly to the tail but an unusual <b>jettisonable</b> fuel tank bulged out below for about 35% of the overall length. [...] The blunt delta shaped tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height and had a single balanced elevator. [...] The fin was small, with a generous, balanced, swept back, blunt topped rudder. [...] The fighter had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle supported by wire braced [...] V-struts to the lower fuselage. [...] Its tall tailskid was faired aft forming a little ventral fin.|$|E
