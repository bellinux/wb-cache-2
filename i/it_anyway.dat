5|$|While still {{starring}} in The Drew Carey Show, Carey began hosting the American {{version of the}} improvisational comedy show Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?</b> in 1998. He would announce the improv guests, direct the games, and then would usually involve himself in {{the final game of}} the episode. The show ran for a total of 220 episodes until the show's cancellation in 2006. In 1998, the New York Friars' Club made Carey the newest inductee of the group's Comedy Central Roast. His friend Ryan Stiles (who costarred in The Drew Carey Show and Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?)</b> served as the roastmaster. Carey's income from Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?</b> and The Drew Carey Show led to his inclusion on the Forbes list of highest-paid entertainers of 1998, at 24th with $45.5 million.|$|E
5|$|For the WB's 2004–2005 {{prime time}} schedule, Carey co-produced {{and starred in}} Drew Carey's Green Screen Show, a {{spin-off}} of Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?.</b> It was canceled by the WB, but picked up shortly afterward by Comedy Central. The show's premise relied {{on the use of}} a green screen for all of the actors' improv interactions. Animation on the screen was inserted during post-production.|$|E
50|$|Do It Anyways: The New Generation of Activists, Courtney E. Martin, Beacon Press 2010. Do <b>It</b> <b>Anyways</b> fights {{the claims}} that the younger {{generation}} is apathetic by telling the stories of eight activists who, despite being ordinary people, are {{making a difference in}} the world.|$|R
5000|$|David Dewhurst {{personally}} did {{not find}} [...] "Frozen" [...] entertaining, but released <b>it</b> <b>anyways</b> at the prompting of his younger family members and campaign staff. Dewhurst commented that the advertisement [...] "was {{not intended to be}} disrespectful" [...] to Patrick. [...] One Dewhurst staffer referred to [...] "Frozen" [...] as [...] "just like a lighthearted thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Tower Witch {{whose main}} {{strength}} is meticulous planning {{and preparation as}} opposed to any overtly magic power. Though Weekend is not her real name, she uses <b>it</b> <b>anyways</b> for the notoriety it brings her. Weekend's specialty involves setting up explosives of both magic and non-magic varieties. Runs her own small faction to kidnap Honoka for his [...] "white stuff" [...] as well.|$|R
5|$|Carey {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Improv All-Stars, a group of eleven actors who perform in unscripted skits. The group joined Carey in all three of his improv shows, Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?,</b> Drew Carey's Green Screen Show, and Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza, and some members had major roles or guest-starred on The Drew Carey Show. The Improv All-Stars travel on comedy tours, {{performing}} at comedy clubs throughout the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated the Petite messe solennelle, partly for fear that others would do <b>it</b> <b>anyway</b> after his death. As he disliked the sound of cathedral boys' choirs, he {{requested}} permission from the pope to perform the work with female voices at a church. When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the chamber music version anyway.|$|E
5|$|Shark, {{now working}} for Maxie, {{suggests}} to Danny they beat up Primont {{to help his}} father. One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about {{his involvement in the}} mugging, and then does <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Convention, Hamilton {{was still}} not content with the final Constitution, but signed <b>it</b> <b>anyway</b> as a vast {{improvement}} over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also. Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, Lansing, Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
5|$|At Goerdeler's insistence, Stauffenberg {{is ordered}} to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the Führer's command bunker, the Wolf's Lair. At a final briefing, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim instructs the {{committee}} {{members in the}} use of pencil detonators. Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel, who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase, but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do <b>it</b> <b>anyway,</b> the meeting is over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that if they try to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.|$|E

6000|$|... "It wasn't anything," [...] Lemuel interrupted. [...] "There wasn't {{the least}} danger; and Mrs. Evans did <b>it</b> all herself, <b>anyway.</b> <b>It</b> made me sick {{to see how}} the papers had it. It's a shame!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, yes, you will,' I {{came back}} in that lying way we think is kind with dying people. I suppose <b>it</b> is; <b>anyway,</b> <b>it</b> turned out all right with Blakey, as he'll testify if you look him up {{when you go to}} Florence. By the way, he lives in that villa now." ...|$|R
25|$|Mochrie {{returned}} for the CW network's revival of Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?</b> {{in the summer}} of 2013. Mochrie had a recurring role in the short-lived television comedy series Working the Engels.|$|E
25|$|Cattrall {{also has}} been linked with former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, actor Daniel Benzali, {{musician}} Gerald Casale of the new wave group Devo, French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy, and her Whose Life Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?</b> co-star, Alexander Siddig.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, {{this study}} showed the impact {{that a group of}} engaged or {{enthusiastic}} employees can have on the organization. The participant group in this study had a dominant group characteristic of interest in innovation. This study indicates that the participating group’s excitement and engagement for innovation was likely contagious to the nonparticipating group. Even though the nonparticipant group chose to not participate in the formal training, in the end, they learned from <b>it</b> <b>anyways</b> by means of the participant group.|$|R

25|$|One of {{his most}} famous portraits is of Marlene Dietrich, taken in 1942. She protested the {{lighting}} that he had selected and arranged, but he used <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> Dietrich liked the results and subsequently used a photo from the session in her own publicity.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Cook {{appeared}} as a contestant on the improvisation comedy show Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?</b> Cook was declared the winner, his prize being to read the credits {{in the style of}} a New York cab driver – a character he had portrayed in Peter Cook & Co.|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} years, YTV filled its {{schedule}} with relatively old and obscure acquired programs. British sitcoms {{were used to}} fill prime-time slots, and remained on the channel's late-night schedule {{for well over a}} decade, including the North American premiere of Red Dwarf and the improv series Whose Line is <b>it</b> <b>Anyway?.</b>|$|E

25|$|Upon {{finishing}} his stint with Second City in 1988, Mochrie's career {{was quiet for}} a while as he spent some time with his new wife and child. In 1989, he auditioned for the new British Channel 4 improv show Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?,</b> but did not make the cut. Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving yourself the chance to stand out. He moved to Los Angeles the following year, and again auditioned for Whose Line, this time making the cut and was asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go. The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?</b> and remained a cast member until the show's end in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Five {{people were}} {{nominated}} for the presidency. On 5 November they successfully passed the Abkhaz language examination. Bagapsh and Khajimba were exempted from it as they had already passed a similar examination during the 2004 Presidential election, but they both volunteered to undergo <b>it</b> <b>anyway.</b> On 6 November, all five nominees were officially registered as candidates, and they received their certificates on 9 November.|$|E
25|$|He {{used the}} Maudsley episode {{as a key}} {{framework}} in his 2012 tour, Out of My Head. He gave many examples of his experiences there, conversations with staff and fellow patients were played out as sketches with his fellow performers, Richard Vranch, Lee Simpson and Suki Webster. He stated that, during his time at the Maudsley, he was simultaneously appearing in Whose Line Is <b>It</b> <b>Anyway?</b> on Channel 4.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] said Horton solemnly, [...] "is--all of them. It's {{the square}} thing. Is {{there any reason}} why a man shouldn't {{do what is right}} because <b>it</b> suits him? <b>Anyway,</b> <b>it</b> needn't worry you, because you can just sit up and watch the circus begin." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reception for Glory of Heracles {{was mostly}} positive, {{but it was}} not without some criticism. RPGamer was {{critical}} of the dungeon designs and combat, and labeled the game [...] "Average." [...] Adriaan den Ouden posted a review saying, [...] "Glory of Heracles isn't going to win any gold medals, but cheer for <b>it</b> <b>anyways.</b> <b>It</b> certainly tries hard." [...] Patrick Gann of RPGFan was largely positive and seemed to express fears of the game keeping a low profile; he urged in his closing remarks, [...] "I approached this game with cautious optimism and was rewarded for giving it a chance. I would ask that you do the same." [...] He also noted the high quality of the game's localization in his final remarks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody {{will grant}} that, Edward--grant <b>it</b> privately, <b>anyway.</b> For six months, now, the village {{has been its}} own proper self once more--honest, narrow, self-righteous, and stingy." ...|$|R
