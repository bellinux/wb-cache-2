The album was released under the name Kele, dropping his surname. Okereke explained the album title, saying [...] "as a boxer, you have to rely on nobody else but yourself to achieve what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> achieve. Even though you take hits, you have to keep focus on your priorities and keep going. I thought that was an inspiring image." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Tenderoni", was released on 14 June 2010.|$|E

The minute you see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E

5000|$|Apex Predator was {{met with}} mixed reviews from music critics. Bruce Smith of HipHopDX gave the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "At times, Slaughterhouse as a whole has been accused by some {{of not being able to}} write a good song. If there was any doubt Crooked I can’t as an individual, Apex Predator, should erase any such doubts. Unfortunately, Crook doesn’t display that ability {{consistently}} throughout project. Potential is a word seldom used for someone as experienced as Crooked I, however, with this being his proper debut album, you can definitely see the potential of what Crooked could accomplish for his next go round. While a decent project, Apex Predator falls short of what Crooked I is now clearly capable of releasing." [...] Emmanuel C.M. of XXL gave the album an L, saying [...] "All in all, Apex Predator doesn’t keep listeners interested as one might hope for a debut full-length. Crooked I can rap—no question about it—but the LP lacks innovative production and enough creativity to make this more than just another rap album. The disappointing thing about it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> root for Crooked I, but after it ends, you’re left wishing there was something to takeaway from it." [...] Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a 6.5 out of 10, saying [...] "Ultimately, it is an intense listen and thankfully only eleven tracks in length, any more and it would become too much. Given the lyrical nature of an artist like Crooked, I'd have liked to hear a bit more variety, as what we are offered here is a Slaughterhouse record with one member rather than a true Crooked I album. Sonically, this album is well produced but does have some dodgy moments; [...] "Tell Them Motherfuckers We Made It" [...] cuts right through the most tolerable ear drums, while [...] "No Sleep Gang" [...] is a weak attempt at a Dirty South style anthem that gets drowned out in bass. Overall though, if you enjoy arrogant lyricism with in-your-face production (essentially what Slaughterhouse is all about) then you'll be satisfied with [...] "Apex Predator" [...] - it's just disappointing it couldn't have been a bit more polished and lyrically introspective.|$|E
40|$|On {{the first}} Mega-Store trip on move-in day at Midwest University, Sally {{and her mom}} picked up {{groceries}} for the dorm. Sally’s mom insisted on getting bottled water for her daughter because of her firm belief that bottled water was safer and cleaner than tap water. Back at the dorm, however, Sally’s new roommate, Jane, a sophomore Environmental Studies major, argued against this with facts she had learned in class. “Did you know that while tap water is frequently tested to maintain public health and safety, bottled water has no guidelines for testing? The fda can’t regulate water that is bottled and sold within the same state, which accounts for 60 – 70 % of bottled water. ” Sally was taken aback by her new roommate’s comments {{on the first day}} that they met. “Ummmm, ok, but it can’t be that bad, ” she mumbled. Sally’s mother, on the other hand, admired Jane’s enthusiasm and passion for the environment, and her knowledge of bottled water. “So what you’re saying <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> pay a lot more for untested water sealed in bottles that are horrible for the environment, especially since people don’t recycle? ” said Jane. “Water bottles are convenient … anyway, I recycle … sometimes, ” stuttered Sally. Jane was appalled to hear that her new roommate didn’t recycle often. What kind of person was she? “Do you know what happens to the unrecycled water bottles?! ” she asked...|$|E

40|$|There {{is nothing}} more {{intriguing}} than well-reported documented stories of real life experiences and genuine autoethnographic dialogue. When writers communicate and relate stories about the self and their experiences and include others who share a personal story, there is an amazing connection, unique intensive and extensive understanding and interpretation, and a cultural and social exchange in an authoethnographic representation of self and the respective culture of study. A dialogue generated among the authors as educators as they shared stories {{inside and outside the}} disabilities culture was the performance and autoethnographic delivery in Phil Smith’s book, Both Sides of the Table: Autoethnographics of Educators Learning and Teaching Within/in [Dis]ability. For Smith’s purpose, both sides of the table represent both parties negotiating an academic Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for individuals with disabilities. The transitions from self to group and the ability to move freely inside and outside the culture {{as a member of the}} culture, presents a “wider lens” as one often hears in the autoethnographic and ethnographic language needed to gain a more complete picture of what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know and learn, and what is permissible to reveal. An autographic lens is widely accepted for this dialogue (Chang, Ngunijiri, 2 ̆ 6 Hernandez, 2013; Creswell, 2013; Ellis, Adams, 2 ̆ 6 Bochner, 2011). Pragmatically, autoethnography was a method realistically supported by the voice of these educators with a unique understanding of their own disabilities world and a story to tell...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate my accumulated knowledge and experience in the field of survey research. After studying and working under Dr. Dan E. Jones, an Associate Professor of Political Science and Director of the Bureau of Government and Opinion Research, for approximately four years, I have been involved in the many phases of survey research on numerous projects including public opinion surveys, political polls, elite interviewing, and election projections. With the approval of Dr. Sanders, Director of the Honors Program, and under the direction of Dr. Dan E. Jones, I was involved in all steps of the December 1973 KCPX News Survey, including writing the analysis which comprises the remainder of this report. Following is a simplified outline of the steps in this survey project which I helped direct and implement: 1. HYPOTHESIZING [...] deciding what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> study. 2. DESIGNING [...] establishing the procedures and methods to use. 3. PLANNING [...] figuring materials and personnel needed. 4. SAMPLING [...] choosing which people are to be interviewed. 5. DRAFTING [...] framing the questions for use in the field. 6. CONSTRUCTING [...] planning the format of the questionnaire. 7. PRE-TESTING [...] determining whether the questions elicit the data desired. 8. BRIEFING [...] showing interviewers how to use the questionnaire. 9. INTERVIEWING [...] securing data from respondents. 10. CONTROLLING [...] seeing that the interviewing gets done. 11. VERIFYING [...] assuring that the collected data are accurate. 12. CODING [...] preparing the data for analysis. 13. PROCESSING [...] organizing data mechanically or electronically. 14. ANALYZING [...] interpreting the data.
