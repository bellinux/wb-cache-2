(2) Any non-stoichiometric iron-deficient <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides</b> must be reduced to exactly stoichiometric FeS before spontaneous non-oxidative dissolution can occur. The dissolution of Fe. S 1 o and slightly iron-deficient FeS compounds under open-circuit conditions occurs only when an oxidation reaction (usually the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur) can provide the electrons necessary for the production of exactly stoichiometric FeS.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{geological}} factors {{linked to the}} quarrying and quality of roofing slate deposits, and gives recent research results on the loss of fissility by dewatering, and the oxidation of <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides.</b> Mineralogy, resulting (from the original protolith composition and the metamorphic grade, controls the colour, brightness and durability of slate tiles. The microtexture of the rock mainly controls the split fitness of slate (fissility). The structure: (folding, slaty cleavage development, So-S 1 angle, lack of crenulation cleavage and kink-bands, joints and faults) controls the exploitability. Additional factors, such as bed thickness and changes in facies are also important. Both very cold environments, giving frost, and arid conditions, drying the rock enough to remove water, produce a loss of fissility in slate. Ostwald-ripening by dewatering and some collapse of the crystallographic structure of phyllosilicates cause the loss. A mineralogical study of the <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides</b> in roofing Spanish slate (pyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite), encompassing crystal habit and size, and their biochemical alteration processes (stain spots), allow the oxidation behaviour of different slates to be predicted.

40|$|The {{mass flow}} event {{resulting}} from the 1996 flood in the Saguenay region buried the mercury-contaminated indigenous sediments {{at the head of}} the Saguenay Fjord under up to 50 cm of postglacial deltaic sediments. This study investigated whether this deposit served as an efficient geochemical barrier to the remobilization of mercury and its availability to the benthic organisms. The vertical distributions of total mercury and methyl mercury (MeHg) in the sediments and pore waters were measured in box cores recovered at three stations along the main axis of the Saguenay Fjord and in the Baie des Ha!Ha!, in successive years between 1996 and 2002. The total solid mercury profile time-series shows that most of the mercury remobilized from the contaminated, indigenous sediments was trapped below or slightly above the former sediment-water interface. Strong correlations with acid-volatile sulphide profiles and extractions of pyrite-associated mercury indicate that most of this mercury was co-precipitated with authigenic <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides.</b> The mercury that was not sequestered by <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides,</b> diffused into the flood layer where it was scavenged by organic matter or methylated. Mercury sequestration at SAG- 05 occurred within the older indigenous sediments, in contrast to SAG- 09 where it occurred at or above the original sediment-water interface. The sediments are richer in organic matter, more reducing and, thus, establishment of suboxic conditions and precipitation of authigenic <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides</b> occurred more rapidly. The abundance of mercury at the former sediment-water interface and the low dissolved SigmaH 2 S concentrations, buffered by acid-volatile sulphide precipitation, both favored mercury methylation. A strong correlation between the distribution of acid-volatile sulphides and methyl mercury in the sediment also reveal that the former may serve as a sink for the latter. Throughout the sediment cores, sediment-water partitioning of MeHg as well as Hg(II) is controlled in great part by the residual organic matter content of the sediment...|$|R

A continuous, high throughput (up to 100 t/h), belt–based microwave cavity operating at up to 100 kW {{has been designed to}} interface directly with commercially available sorters at industrially relevant scales. In this paper, the fragment-by-fragment thermal response of 16 porphyry copper ore samples following microwave treatment in the bespoke system is evaluated to elucidate key performance criteria and identify likely candidate ores for microwave sorting. Microwave treatment energy dose was found to be {{the driving force behind the}} ultimate average temperature fragments experience, with other process variables (e. g. belt speed, power, belt mass loading, thermal equilibration time) having little effect on sortability performance. While fragment mineralogical texture and ore textural heterogeneity were shown to influence the average temperature rise of the fragment surface presented to the thermal camera, in most cases this variability did not adversely affect sortability performance. An abundance of microwave-heating gangue minerals (e. g. <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides,</b> <b>iron</b> oxides and hydrated clays) was shown to be the dominant source of deviation from intrinsic sortability. However, low average moisture content and co-mineralisation of copper and <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides</b> (or bulk sulphide sorting) was found to mitigate the deviation and provide better sortability performance. An attractive separation could be proposed for many of the ores tested, either to remove a large proportion of barren fragments from ore-grade material or concentrate a large proportion of copper values from waste-grade material...|$|R
40|$|The geochemical {{cycles of}} iron and sulphur in marine sediments are {{strongly}} intertwined and {{give rise to a}} complex network of redox and precipitation reactions. Bioturbation refers to all modes of transport of particles and solutes induced by larger organisms, and in the present-day seafloor, bioturbation {{is one of the most}} important factors controlling the biogeochemical cycling {{of iron and}} sulphur. To better understand how bioturbation controls Fe and S cycling, we developed reactive transport model of a coastal sediment impacted by faunal activity. Subsequently, we performed a model sensitivity analysis, separately investigating the two different transport modes of bioturbation, i. e. bio-mixing (solid particle transport) and bio-irrigation (enhanced solute transport). This analysis reveals that bio-mixing and bio-irrigation have distinct—and largely opposing effects on both the iron and sulphur cycles. Bio-mixing enhances transport between the oxic and suboxic zones, thus promoting the reduction of oxidised species (e. g. iron oxyhydroxides) and the oxidation of reduced species (e. g. <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides).</b> Through the re-oxidation of <b>iron</b> <b>sulphides,</b> bio-mixing strongly enhances the recycling of Fe and S between their reduced and oxidised states. Bio-irrigation on the other hand removes reduced solutes, i. e. ferrous <b>iron</b> and free <b>sulphide,</b> from the sediment pore water. These reduced species are then reoxidised in the overlying water and not recycled within the sediment column, which leads to a decrease in Fe and S recycling. Overall, our results demonstrate that the ecology of the macrofauna (inducing bio-mixing or bio-irrigation, or both) matters when assessing their impact on sediment geochemistry. This finding seems particularly relevant for sedimentary cycling across Cambrian transition, when benthic fauna started colonizing and reworking the seafloor...|$|R
