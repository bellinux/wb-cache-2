5000|$|Bond {{insurance}} {{of residential}} mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) commenced in the 1980s but expanded at an accelerated pace in the 2000s, {{leading up to}} the 2008 financial crisis. As the housing bubble grew in the mid-2000s, bond insurers generally increased the collateral protection required <b>for</b> <b>RMBS.</b> However, both the bond insurers and the rating agencies that evaluated their credit did not anticipate the collapse of the real estate market that precipitated the financial crisis and the magnitude of the disruption to the residential mortgage market that accompanied the financial crisis. In addition, following the crisis, the bond insurers became aware that many RMBS they had insured included large percentages of loans that were ineligible for securitization and were subject to repurchase by, or [...] "putback" [...] obligations of, the RMBS sponsors, in originating the securitizations due to a breach of applicable representations and warranties ("R&W") regarding the securitized mortgage loans.|$|E
40|$|Radial {{magnetic}} bearings (RMBs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} commonly used magnetic bearings. They are used widely in the field of ultra-high speed and ultra-precise numerical control machine tools, bearingless motors, high speed flywheels, artificial heart pumps, and molecular pumps, and they are being strengthened and extended in various important areas. In this paper, a comprehensive overview is given of different bearing topologies of RMBs with different stator poles that differ in their construction, the driving mode of electromagnets, power consumption, cost, magnetic circuits, and symmetry. RMBs with different poles and couplings between the two bearing axes in the radial direction responsible for cross-coupling generation are compared. In addition, different shaped rotors are compared, as the performances of magnetic bearing-rotor systems are of great concern to rotor constructions. Furthermore, the parameter design methods, the mathematical models and control strategies of the RMBs are described in detail. From the comparison of topologies, models and control methods <b>for</b> <b>RMBs,</b> the advantages, disadvantages and utilizable perspectives are also analyzed. Moreover, several possible development trends of the RMBs are discussed. Keywords: Radial magnetic bearings (RMBs), Topologies, Mathematical mode, Control strategies, Development trend...|$|E

40|$|The Chinese currency, Renminbi Yuan (RMB), has had {{restricted}} convertibility {{outside the}} mainland, namely in Hong Kong, from early 2004. From July 2009, much wider convertibility has been permitted, with the RMB {{being used as}} a cross-border trade settlement currency. This paper attempts to assess the factors that have motivated RMB internationalisation, and the role Hong Kong has played in the process, against the background of China’s evolving foreign exchange markets and the RMB exchange rate benchmarking to the Hong Kong market. It shows that China’s ultimate goal of full convertibility of the capital account has provided the underlying motivation <b>for</b> <b>RMB</b> internationalisation, and that the 2008 global financial crisis acted as a catalyst in the process. With the political blessing of the central authorities and its extensive business and financial links with the mainland, Hong Kong has gradually established an RMB offshore market to supplement capital account liberalisations on the Mainland. The prospects <b>for</b> <b>RMB</b> internationalisation will be determined by the growth of the Chinese economy, reinforcing flows of RMB funds between the offshore Hong Kong and onshore Shanghai markets, and the balanced development of these two markets.

25|$|In November 1993 the Third Plenum of the Fourteenth CPC Central Committee {{approved}} a comprehensive reform strategy in which foreign exchange management reforms were highlighted {{as a key}} element for a market-oriented economy. A floating exchange rate regime and convertibility <b>for</b> <b>RMB</b> were seen as {{the ultimate goal of}} the reform. Conditional convertibility under current account was achieved by allowing firms to surrender their foreign exchange earning from current account transactions and purchase foreign exchange as needed. Restrictions on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was also loosened and capital inflows to China surged.|$|R
30|$|The above {{empirical}} conclusions can {{be explained}} economically by the following reasons. First, since the reform of the exchange rate system, the continuous appreciation and high expectations <b>for</b> <b>RMB</b> appreciation brought in massive speculative capital inflows, coupled with China’s high reliance on foreign trade; {{this led to the}} stock market’s increased sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations. Second, the implementation of a managed floating exchange rate regime strengthened the control of capital accounts and to some extent, limited the exchange of information between the exchange and stock markets, ultimately resulting in an insignificant volatility spillover effect from the stock to the foreign exchange market.|$|R

40|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to develop fingerprints from the surface of currency. There are studies reporting that the high vacuum metal deposition (VMD) method can be used to detect fingerprints on certain types of currency notes. Both VMD and 1, 2 -indandione/ninhydrin techniques are employed to visualize latent fingermarks on porous surfaces, such as paper. The current study explores whether the VMD method or 1, 2 -indandione/ninhydrin reagent method is more effective in the development of fingerprints on renminbi (RMB). Uncirculated, circulated, and water-exposed RMB was utilized in this study, along with five donors who ranged in their age and potential to leave fingermarks.
