2500|$|While the {{proposal}} for Phoenix was being written, the Mars Odyssey Orbiter used its <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{and found the}} distinctive signature of hydrogen on {{some areas of the}} Martian surface, and the only plausible source of hydrogen on Mars would be water in the form of ice, frozen below the surface. The mission was therefore funded on the expectation that Phoenix would find water ice on the arctic plains of Mars. In August 2003 NASA selected the University of Arizona [...] "Phoenix" [...] mission for launch in 2007. It was hoped this would be the first in a new line of smaller, low-cost, Scout missions in the agency's exploration of Mars program. The selection was the result of an intense two-year competition with proposals from other institutions. The $325 million NASA award is more than six times larger than any other single research grant in University of Arizona history.|$|E

50|$|Natural holmium {{contains}} one stable isotope, holmium-165. Some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known; {{the most}} stable one is holmium-163, with a half-life of 4570 years. All other radioisotopes have ground-state half-lives not greater than 1.117 days, and most have half-lives under 3 hours. However, the metastable 166m1Ho has a half-life of around 1200 years because of its high spin. This fact, combined with a high excitation energy resulting in a particularly rich spectrum of decay <b>gamma</b> <b>rays</b> produced when the metastable state de-excites, makes this isotope useful in nuclear physics experiments {{as a means for}} calibrating energy responses and intrinsic efficiencies of <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometers.</b>|$|R

Some of the required parameters e. g., neutron yield, fusion power and power density, ion temperature profile in the core plasma, and characteristics of confined and escaping alpha particle populations are best measured by fusion product diagnostic techniques. To make these measurements, ITER will have dedicated diagnostic systems, including radial and vertical neutron cameras, neutron and <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometers,</b> internal and external fission chambers, a neutron activation system, and diagnostics for confined and escaping alpha particles. Engineering integration of many of these systems is in progress, and other systems are under investigation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, CdTe {{detectors}} {{are widely used}} {{for the development of}} room temperature X-ray and <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> Typically, high resolution CdTe detectors are fabricated with blocking contacts (indium, aluminum) ensuring low leakage currents and high electric field for optimum charge collection. As well known, time instability under bias voltage (termed as polarization) is the major drawback of CdTe diode detectors. Polarization phenomena cause a progressive degradation of the spectroscopic performance with time, due to hole trapping and detrapping from deep acceptors levels. In this work, we studied the polarization phenomenon on new Al/p-CdTe/Pt detectors, manufactured by Acrorad (Japan), through electrical and spectroscopic approaches. In particular, we investigated on the time degradation of the spectroscopic response of the detectors at different temperatures, voltages and energies. Current transient measurements were also performed to better understand the properties of the deep acceptor levels and their correlation with the polarization effect...|$|R
