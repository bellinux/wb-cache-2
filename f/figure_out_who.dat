25|$|Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial {{candidate}} (and the late Congressman Flood's nephew), Harry F. Byrd supported creation of Shenandoah National Park, as did his friend William E. Carson, a businessman {{who had become}} Virginia's first chairman of the Commission on Conservation and Development. Development of the western national parks had assisted tourism, which produced jobs, which Byrd and local politicians supported. The land that became Shenandoah park was scenic, mountainous, and had also lost about half of its trees to the Chestnut blight (which was incurable and affected trees as they reached maturity). However, it had been held as private property for over a century, so many farms and orchards existed. After Byrd became governor and convinced the legislature to appropriate $1 million for land acquisition and other work, Carson and his teams (including surveyors and his brother Kit who was Byrd's law partner) tried to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> owned the land. They found that it consisted of more than 5,000 parcels, some of them inhabited by tenant farmers or squatters (who were ineligible to receive compensation). Some landowners, including wealthy resort owner George Freeman Pollock and Luray realtor and developer L. Ferdinand Zerkel, had long wanted the park created and had formed the Northern Virginia Park Association {{to win over the}} national park selection committee. However, many local families who had lived in the area for generations (especially people over 60 years old) did not want to sell their land, and some refused to sell at any price. Carson promised that if they sold to the state, they could still live on their homesteads {{for the rest of their}} lives. Carson also lobbied the new President Herbert Hoover, who bought land to establish a vacation fishing camp near the headwaters of the Rapidan River (and would ultimately donate it to the park as he left office; it remains as Rapidan Camp).|$|E
500|$|Bell [...] "wanted {{the snake}} church people {{to end up}} being the good guys." [...] However, the trick would be to {{disguise}} the real bad guys in plain sight. According to Bell, [...] "The way the shows usually work out, Mulder is the one to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> the bad guys are. So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being wrong. Because Mulder believes so strong it's the other guy, it helped hide the true identity of the bad guy from the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Hurley {{worries that}} the Hatch {{implosion}} turned Desmond into the Hulk, a Marvel Comics character who turned large and green upon being exposed to Gamma rays. The Bible verses seen on Mr. Eko's stick include , which says [...] "Do not obey the lusts of sin" [...] and , which says [...] "Jesus answered, 'I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit'." [...] Hurley's numbers are also partially visible. Dominic Monaghan as his character Charlie, says, while trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> Locke needs to speak to: [...] "Trees? Yea I heard they are wonderful conversationalists", a reference to Monaghan's work in The Lord of the Rings, in which he talks to trees.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble—she is trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you.|$|E
500|$|She {{just sort}} of sits there with her {{cigarette}} and her hair, and she would pull stuff— these very disparate elements— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." [...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|Headstrong is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Ashley Tisdale, {{released}} on February 6, 2007, by Warner Bros. Records. [...] Tisdale {{began working on}} the project after the first installment of High School Musical (2006), and after she had achieved the feat {{of being the first}} female artist to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Tisdale describes her work on the album saying. [...] "I didn't really know who I was and I was trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> to do. I now am way more comfortable in my own skin." [...] The singer worked with a variety of established writers and producers on the album, including Diane Warren, J.R. Rotem, Ryan Tedder, Evan [...] "Kidd" [...] Bogart, and Kara DioGuardi, among others. Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E
5000|$|A large subplot {{revolves}} around <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> sabotaged Foreman's interview at New York Mercy Hospital. When House denies that he sabotaged the interview, others (Cuddy, Wilson, Cameron, and even Chase) become suspects. Chase, realizing {{that everyone was}} chasing ghosts, <b>figures</b> <b>out</b> that House sabotaged the interview after all.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> would do something like this, {{the only way to make}} sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E
500|$|After seven episodes, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{disliked the}} series {{so much that}} he {{discouraged}} viewers from watching it for that particular season. He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored. Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the [...] "woefully underdeveloped" [...] characters of Devil Survivor 2 who are only given rudimentary back-stories. This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> exactly is a one-off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death. Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension. Eisenbeis went on to write that the other characters were contrast to the main villain (or antihero) Yamato Hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of the series' runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all the other characters combined. This helps give an in-depth understanding of the character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain.|$|E
500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong."

500|$|Lewis's sister Leslie Lewis {{provides}} backing vocals on two tracks, {{while her}} father Eddie Gordon plays the bass harp and harmonica. [...] "He was ill last year, {{so we started}} speaking to one another," [...] Lewis told The Independent. [...] "There were no hard feelings. He just wasn't around. Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But I thought this was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened.

500|$|In 2002, Hill collaboratively {{wrote an}} autobiography, , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, {{published}} by W.W. Norton & Company. As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E
