The Danbury Nurses Union voted 96% to reject a proposal to eliminate <b>evening</b> and weekend <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> {{in order to save}} the jobs of twenty-five nurses, arguing that the hospitals should cut executive pay and use the $35m annual profit to cover the budget shortfall.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 48) <b>Shift</b> <b>differentials</b> are {{a form of}} bonus typically paid {{to employees}} who work "premium" shifts such as evenings (3 PM- 11 PM) and nights (11 PM- 7 AM). This practice was introduced in hospitals when individual organizations began to {{find it difficult to}} recruit and place prospective employees for night and evening coverage, and now payment of <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is commonplace in hospitals in the San Fernando Valley. An inflationary economy, rapid changes in technology, spiraling costs, and shortages in many allied health resources, have forced many hospitals to compete for declining employee resources by providing more attractive benefits, employment bonuses, and <b>even</b> larger <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> for employees working night and <b>evening</b> <b>shifts</b> in an attempt to attract and retain qualified personnel. Consequently, increased demand for allied health professionals has led to a gradual escalation of salary and incentive programs directed at employee recruitment and placement. Concern over the increasing use of <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> and bonuses inspired one local hospital to more closely review the uses and effects of <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> in an attempt to gain greater insight into the need for <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> and the effectiveness of dollar oriented bonuses in the placement and retention of night duty personnel. A study was implemented to survey prevailing administrative attitudes in area hospitals relative to the need for <b>shift</b> <b>differentials,</b> and a second survey of registered nurses in a local hospital was conducted to identify the effect <b>shift</b> <b>differentials</b> have on the recruitment, placement and longevity of night nursing personnel. Study results, although not conclusive, seem to indicate that payment of <b>shift</b> <b>differential</b> is necessary due to the reduced supply of and increasing demand for qualified personnel in the labor market, as well as increased inter-institutional competition for available resources. This was observed even though night nurses ranked dollar oriented incentives secondary to job oriented motivators in the selection of night duty. Based on preliminary study, it was concluded that hospitals should not discontinue use of <b>shift</b> <b>differentials,</b> but should explore alternative incentives that will improve the quality of the job...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, various chaos based {{modulation}} schemes were evolved, {{of which}} the CS-DCSK modulation technique provides a better BER performance and bandwidth efficiency, due to its code domain approach[10]. The QCSK modulation technique provides double benefit, namely: higher data rate with similar BER performance and same bandwidth occupation as DCSK. By combining the advantage of code <b>shifted</b> <b>differential</b> chaos <b>shift</b> keying (CS-DCSK) and Quadrature chaos shift keying (QCSK) scheme, a novel CS-QCSK modulation scheme called code shifted Quadrature chaos shift keying is proposed. The noise performance of CS-QCSK is better to most conventional modulation schemes and also provides an increased data transmission rates with greatly improved robustness. Analytical expressions for the bit-error rates are derived for both AWGN channel and Rayleigh multipath fading channel. The simulation result shows that the proposed method outperforms the classical approaches in terms of bit error rate and spectral efficiency.
