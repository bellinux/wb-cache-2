5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, <b>frosting</b> or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|The term fluffernutter {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} other foods that feature peanut butter and marshmallow fluff, including Fluffernutter cookies, bars and cupcakes. Durkee-Mower, the company that produces Marshmallow Fluff, a brand of marshmallow fluff, produces a cookbook that features recipes for Fluffernutter bars, <b>frosting,</b> pie and a shake. In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured peanut butter and Marshmallow Fluff in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also {{the name of a}} candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} <b>frosting</b> {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E

25|$|The {{seasonal}} <b>frosting</b> and defrosting of {{the southern}} ice cap results {{in the formation of}} spider-like radial channels carved on 1 meter thick ice by sunlight. Then, sublimed CO2 – and probably water – increase pressure in their interior producing geyser-like eruptions of cold fluids often mixed with dark basaltic sand or mud. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars.|$|E

40|$|One-dimensional <b>frost</b> {{growth and}} {{densification}} in laminar flow over flat surfaces has been theoretically investigated. Improved representations of <b>frost</b> density and effective thermal conductivity applicable {{to a wide}} range of <b>frost</b> circumstances have been incorporated. The validity of the proposed model considering heat and mass diffusion in the <b>frost</b> layer is tested by a comparison of the predictions with data from various investigators for <b>frost</b> parameters including <b>frost</b> thickness, <b>frost</b> surface temperature, <b>frost</b> density and heat flux. The test conditions cover a range of wall temperature, air humidity ratio, air velocity, and air temperature, and the effect of these variables on the <b>frost</b> parameters has been exemplified. Satisfactory agreement is achieved between the model predictions and the various test data considered. The prevailing uncertainties concerning the role air velocity and air temperature on <b>frost</b> development have been elucidated. It is concluded that that for flat surfaces increases in air velocity have no appreciable effect on <b>frost</b> thickness but contribute to significant <b>frost</b> densification, while increase in air temperatures results in a slight increase the <b>frost</b> thickness and appreciable <b>frost</b> densification...|$|R

40|$|<b>Frost</b> {{formation}} {{is a common}} phenomenon under cryogenic conditions.

The phase change, the initiation of <b>frost</b> formation and the different shapes of <b>frost</b> crystal at various time stages are described. It is proved {{from the present study}} that the main factors that affect <b>frost</b> formation in natural convection are plate temperature, air humidity and air temperature. In order to explain the <b>frost</b> thickness difference under various conditions, a <b>frost</b> thickness growth driving force is defined and compared with the experimental results. Hydrophobic surfaces are used to release <b>frost</b> formation on cold surfaces and the results show that these surfaces can retard the formation and growth of <b>frost</b> significantly...|$|R
