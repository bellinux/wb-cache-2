5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{begin in}} one hemisphere {{of the brain}} while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. <b>Gliosis,</b> neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific {{areas of the brain}} are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the glial scar is a complex process. Several main classes of molecular mediators of <b>gliosis</b> have been identified and are briefly discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Glial scar {{formation}} (<b>gliosis)</b> is a reactive cellular process involving astrogliosis {{that occurs}} after {{injury to the}} central nervous system. As with scarring in other organs and tissues, the glial scar is the body's mechanism to protect and begin the healing process in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The classic histologic {{appearance}} is spongiform {{change in the}} gray matter: the presence of many round vacuoles from one to 50 micrometres in the neuropil, in all six cortical layers in the cerebral cortex or with diffuse involvement of the cerebellar molecular layer. These vacuoles appear glassy or eosinophilic and may coalesce. Neuronal loss and <b>gliosis</b> are also seen. Plaques of amyloid-like material {{can be seen in}} the neocortex in some cases of CJD.|$|E
25|$|Multiple system atrophy can be {{explained}} as cell loss and <b>gliosis</b> or a proliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the central nervous system. This damage forms a scar which is then termed a glial scar. The presence of these inclusions (also known as Papp-Lantos bodies) in the movement, balance, and autonomic-control centres of the brain are the defining histopathologic hallmark of MSA. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the major filamentous component of glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions is alpha-synuclein. Mutations in this substance may play a role in the disease.|$|E
25|$|Glia {{retain the}} ability to undergo cell {{division}} in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot. The view {{is based on the}} general deficiency of the mature nervous system in replacing neurons after an injury, such as a stroke or trauma, while very often there is a profound proliferation of glia, or <b>gliosis</b> near or at the site of damage. However, detailed studies found no evidence that 'mature' glia, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, retain the ability of mitosis. Only the resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells seem to keep this ability after the nervous system matures. On the other hand, there are a few regions in the mature nervous system, such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, where generation of new neurons can be observed.|$|E
25|$|Neuroinflammation, {{which is}} a {{fundamental}} reaction to brain injury, {{is characterized by the}} activation of resident microglia and astrocytes and local expression {{of a wide range of}} inflammatory mediators. Acute and chronic neuroinflammation has been studied in the mouse brain following exposure to HZE. The acute effect of HZE is detectable at 6 and 9 Gy; no studies are available at lower doses. Myeloid cell recruitment appears by 6 months following exposure. The estimated RBE value of HZE irradiation for induction of an acute neuroinflammatory response is three compared to that of gamma irradiation. COX-2 pathways are implicated in neuroinflammatory processes that are caused by low-LET radiation. COX-2 up-regulation in irradiated microglia cells leads to prostaglandin E2 production, which appears to be responsible for radiation-induced <b>gliosis</b> (overproliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the CNS).|$|E
25|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{the other}} chief complication {{that leads to the}} basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, or abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of bilirubin overwhelms that of albumin and some of the bilirubin remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier. Normally bilirubin {{would not be able to}} diffuse across the blood–brain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. Bilirubin is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, <b>gliosis</b> and demyelination were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the globus pallidus.|$|E
25|$|The main {{occupational}} risks {{posed by}} this acid are skin contact leading to burns (see above) and the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure to aerosols at high concentrations leads to immediate and severe irritation of the eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membranes: this ceases rapidly after exposure, {{although there is}} a risk of subsequent pulmonary edema if tissue damage has been more severe. At lower concentrations, the most commonly reported symptom of chronic exposure to sulfuric acid aerosols is erosion of the teeth, found in virtually all studies: indications of possible chronic damage to the respiratory tract are inconclusive as of 1997. Repeated occupational exposure to sulfuric acid mists may increase the chance of lung cancer by up to 64 percent. In the United States, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for sulfuric acid is fixed at 1mg/m3: limits in other countries are similar. There have been reports of sulfuric acid ingestion leading to vitamin B12 deficiency with subacute combined degeneration. The spinal cord is most often affected in such cases, but the optic nerves may show demyelination, loss of axons and <b>gliosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Gliosis</b> is the {{universal}} {{response of the}} CNS to tissue injury and {{occurs as a result}} of many acute conditions such as trauma, ischemia, and stroke. In addition, <b>gliosis</b> is present {{in a wide variety of}} CNS pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Korsakoff's syndrome, multiple system atrophy, prion disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS dementia complex, vasculitis, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. In every case, <b>gliosis</b> involves some degree of hypertrophy or proliferation of glial cells, but the extent and nature of the <b>gliosis</b> response vary widely based on the triggering insult. <b>Gliosis</b> in any form entails an alteration in cellular activity that has the potential to create widespread effects on neurons as well as other non-neural cells, causing either a loss of normal functions or a gain of detrimental ones. In this light, <b>gliosis</b> may be seen not only as a characteristic of many neuropathologies but as a potential contributor to, or even cause of, many CNS disease mechanisms. A select group of CNS conditions associated with <b>gliosis</b> are described below.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gliosis</b> is a nonspecific {{reactive}} {{change of}} glial cells {{in response to}} damage to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). In most cases, <b>gliosis</b> involves the proliferation or hypertrophy of several different types of glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. In its most extreme form, the proliferation associated with <b>gliosis</b> leads to the formation of a glial scar.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{trauma to}} the brain or spinal cord results in <b>gliosis,</b> most often in its severe form with the {{development}} of a glial scar. Different locations around the lesion site may exhibit different severities of gliosis; for example, a glial scar at the location of damaged tissue may be surrounded by areas with less severe astrocyte proliferation or hypertrophy. Diffuse traumatic injury can result in diffuse or more moderate <b>gliosis</b> without scar formation. In such cases, <b>gliosis</b> may also be reversible. In all instances of <b>gliosis</b> resulting from CNS trauma, the long-term clinical outcome is highly dependent on the degree of astrogliosis and scar formation.|$|E
50|$|Amyotrophic Lateral SclerosisThis disease causes {{neuronal}} {{loss and}} <b>gliosis,</b> which can include the subthalamic nucleus {{and other areas}} of the brain. Essentially any disorder that causes some form of neuronal loss or <b>gliosis</b> in the basal ganglia has the potential to cause hemiballismus.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} <b>gliosis</b> {{involves}} {{a series of}} cellular and molecular events that occur over several days. Typically, the first response to injury is the migration of macrophages and local microglia to the injury site. This process, which constitutes a form of <b>gliosis</b> known as microgliosis, begins {{within hours of the}} initial CNS injury. Later, after 3-5 days, oligodendrocyte precursor cells are also recruited to the site and may contribute to remyelination. The final component of <b>gliosis</b> is astrogliosis, the proliferation of surrounding astrocytes, which are the main constituents of the glial scar.|$|E
50|$|Autopsy {{on one of}} {{the sister}} with Behr Syndrome {{revealed}} central atrophy of the optic nerves and total disarray of the normal laminar pattern of the lateral geniculate nucleus, dropout of neurons, and <b>gliosis.</b> There were numerous axonal spheroids in the neuropil. Similar spheroids with cell loss and <b>gliosis</b> were also observed in other thalamic nuclei and, rarely, in the pallida.|$|E
50|$|In general after any CNS insult, <b>gliosis</b> begins {{after the}} {{blood brain barrier}} is disrupted, {{allowing}} non-CNS molecules, such as blood and serum components, to enter the brain. These components, along with activated macrophages they carry, {{are known to have}} a role in beginning the formation of the glial scar by inducing the disconnection of axons, also called secondary axotomy, and the upregulation of fibrous extracellular matrix components which eventually form the scar tissue. The specific molecular triggers responsible for this action, however, remain unknown. One potential trigger is transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). TGF-β2, whose expression is gradually increased as <b>gliosis</b> occurs, has been shown to increase astrocyte production of scar-forming proteoglycans. Experimental reduction of both TGF-β2 and TGF-β1, which is expressed immediately after injury, has resulted in reduced glial scarring. The interleukins are another potential molecular trigger of <b>gliosis.</b> These molecules, notably IL-1, initiate an inflammatory response in various cells including astrocytes that contributes to the <b>gliosis</b> reaction. Finally, interactions between the inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) may also be responsible for the induction of <b>gliosis.</b> In culture, both molecules act as mitogens, prompting the proliferation of astrocytes. Moreover, addition of IFN-γ to brain legion sites has resulted in an increase in glial scarring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gliosis</b> has {{historically}} been given a negative connotation due to its appearance in many CNS diseases and the inhibition of axonal regeneration caused by glial scar formation. However, <b>gliosis</b> {{has been shown to}} have both beneficial and detrimental effects, and the balance between these is due to a complex array of factors and molecular signaling mechanisms, which affect the reaction of all glial cell types.|$|E

50|$|The pallidal {{deposits}} stain positively for iron. Diffuse <b>gliosis</b> may {{surround the}} large deposits but significant loss of nerve cells is rare.|$|E
50|$|Pradhan {{has done}} {{extensive}} research on epilepsy. His studies revealed that patients {{are likely to}} suffer from chronic epileptogenesis with poor seizure outcome if <b>gliosis</b> is present around their lesions. He averred that the patients with neurocysticercosis are prone to developing perilesional <b>gliosis,</b> may develop drug resistance during anti‑epileptic drug (AED) therapy and may suffer seizures if the drug is stopped. He has also explained tickling seizures and micturition induced reflex epilepsy, both reported to be first time findings.|$|E
50|$|Formation of a septum {{implies that}} through <b>gliosis,</b> a {{membrane}} of glial cells has developed across the aqueduct. This abnormal membrane most commonly forms {{at the lower}} and distal portion of the aqueduct, and completely obstructs the canal. This barricade causes {{the portion of the}} aqueduct above it to become dilated with the excess CSF which in turn applies more pressure to the cells in this upper part. This increased pressure amplifies the effects of <b>gliosis,</b> as described in the next section.|$|E
50|$|Bergmann <b>gliosis</b> is {{hyperplasia}} of Bergmann glia (in the cerebellum) due to Purkinje cell death, as {{may occur}} in a hypoxic-ischemic insult or peritumoral compression.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of the glial scar is a complex process. Several main classes of molecular mediators of <b>gliosis</b> have been identified and are briefly discussed below.|$|E
50|$|With this condition, the {{aqueduct}} {{begins as}} partially blocked. To {{compensate for the}} partial blockage and increase the CSF flow to normal rates, the pressure in the third ventricle is increased thereby also increasing the velocity of the CSF. This in turn creates more shear stress in the aqueduct, causing more damage to the epithelial cells lining the ventricle, and resulting in <b>gliosis</b> and a proliferation of glial cells. This increased number of cells thus causes the blockage to worsen, necessitating more pressure and velocity, and continuing the cycle of <b>gliosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In vertebrates, {{the retina}} {{contains}} Müller cells, {{a type of}} glia not found elsewhere in the CNS. Upon retinal injury, <b>gliosis</b> of these cells occurs, functioning to repair damage, but often having harmful consequences in the process, worsening some of the diseases or problems that initially trigger it. Reactive <b>gliosis</b> in the retina can have detrimental effects on vision; in particular, the production of proteases by astrocytes causes widespread death of retinal ganglion cells. A 2011 study compared the effects of two glial toxins, AAA and Neurostatin, on retinal <b>gliosis</b> in mice. AAA did not inhibit the production of protease by astrocytes, and so did not prevent ganglion cell apoptosis. However, Neurostatin successfully inhibited activation of astrocytes, in turn decreasing retinal ganglion cell death significantly. Neurostatin is also effective in the inhibition of other glial cells, and may be an area {{of interest in the}} treatment of degenerative diseases such as glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|Human retina is {{devoid of}} myelin, but {{inflammation}} is prominent in MS even at late stages of disease, showing prominent <b>gliosis</b> and inflammation surrounding the vessels {{of the inner}} retina.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gliosis</b> {{has long}} been known as a {{characteristic}} of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), although its exact role in the disease remains unknown. <b>Gliosis</b> and glial scarring occur in areas surrounding the amyloid plaques which are hallmarks of the disease, and postmortem tissues have indicated a correlation between the degree of astrogliosis and cognitive decline. Exposure of reactive astrocytes to β-amyloid (Αβ) peptide, the main component of amyloid plaques, may also induce astroglial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. In addition, the ability of reactive astrocytes to degrade extracellular Αβ deposits may suggest that astrogliosis may affect the progression or severity of AD.|$|E
50|$|The {{implications}} of <b>gliosis</b> in various neuropathologies and injury conditions {{has led to}} the investigation of various therapeutic routes which would regulate specific aspects of <b>gliosis</b> in order to improve clinical outcomes for both CNS trauma and a wide range of neurological disorders. Because <b>gliosis</b> is a dynamic process which involves a spectrum of changes depending on the type and severity of the initial insult, to date, no single molecular target has been identified which could improve healing in all injury contexts. Rather, therapeutic strategies for minimizing the contribution of astrogliosis to CNS pathologies must be designed to target specific molecular pathways and responses. One promising therapeutic mechanism is the use of β-lactam antibiotics to enhance the glutamate uptake of astrocytes in order to reduce excitotoxicity and provide neuroprotection in models of stroke and ALS. Other proposed targets related to astrogliosis include manipulating AQP4 channels, diminishing the action of NF-kB, or regulating the STAT3 pathway {{in order to reduce the}} inflammatory effects of reactive astrocytes. Astrogliosis may also be attenuated by inhibiting the microgliosis response. One notable microglial activation inhibitor is minocycline, which is a known suppressor of astrogliosis. The cell cycle inhibitor olomoucine also has been shown to suppress both microglial and astroglial proliferation as well as glial scar formation. Future directions for identifying novel therapeutic strategies must carefully account for the complex array of factors and signaling mechanisms driving the <b>gliosis</b> response, particularly in different stages after damage and in different lesion conditions.|$|E
50|$|A 2008 paper {{presented}} {{a study of}} 116 cases, observed over 36 years. The authors looked at the family trees of people with MMND, and found evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance in 15 of the 16 families studied, and autosomal dominant inheritance in the other. They also described postmortem studies of people with MMND, {{and found that the}} spinal cord had extreme loss of anterior horn cells and demyelination and sclerosis of the ventrolateral columns; which could explain peripheral weakness, paresthesias, or paralysis. They also found changes in the color of the myelin of the optic nerves, decreases in Purkinje cells, increase in Bergman glia, demyelination of fibers around the dentate nucleus with <b>gliosis,</b> swollen globular neurons of deep nuclei of the cerebellum, neural depletion and <b>gliosis</b> of the cochlear nucleus {{on both sides of the}} brainstem, and demyelination and axonal loss of the cochlear nerve. The authors said that the consistent findings of <b>gliosis</b> shows that inflammation in central nervous system is a key factor in how the disease harms people.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the edge}} of necrosis, astrocytes proliferate. These cells extend processes, and form a {{delicate}} rim of <b>gliosis</b> around the margin of damage. The empty space left by brain tissue fills up with cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E

50|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{pathology}} of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Post-mortem studies of some individuals have shown lymphocytic vasculitis of venules and veins in the brain-stem and a diffuse <b>gliosis</b> involving gray matter more than white matter.|$|E
50|$|Aqueductal stenosis, a {{narrowing}} of the cerebral aqueduct, obstructs {{the flow of}} CSF and {{has been associated with}} non-communicating hydrocephalus. Such narrowing can be congenital, arise via tumor compression, or through cyclical <b>gliosis</b> secondary to an initial partial obstruction.|$|E
50|$|White matter hyperintensities can {{be caused}} by a variety of factors {{including}} ischemia, micro-hemorrhages, <b>gliosis,</b> damage to small blood vessel walls, breaches of the barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain, or loss and deformation of the myelin sheath.|$|E
50|$|In HDLS, {{there is}} {{enlargement}} of the lateral ventricles and marked thinning or weakening of cerebral white matter. The loss of white matter is caused by myelin loss. These changes are associated with diffuse <b>gliosis,</b> moderate loss of axons and many axonal spheroids.|$|E
