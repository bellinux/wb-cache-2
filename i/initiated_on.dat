5|$|As King of the Isles, Lǫgmaðr faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} factions supporting his younger brothers, Haraldr and Óláfr. At some point, the Islesmen {{are reported to}} have petitioned Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster to select a temporary ruler in the region. This act may have been <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> behalf of a faction supporting Óláfr. Whatever the case, Ua Briain responded by placing an Uí Briain relative upon the throne. The Uí Briain interlopers, however, {{do not appear to}} have been well received; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen, perhaps led by supporters of Lǫgmaðr himself.|$|E
5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.|$|E

The location was temporarily renovated to mirror an abandoned Federal Emergency Management Agency camp. Michael Riley, the production manager for the episode, contacted the Newnan Police Department to collaborate with producers. Because of the large size of the filming location, Riley's production company notified surrounding neighborhoods, to avoid inconvenience.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} {{wave that}} would become John moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 17. It entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 24, and quickly showed signs of organization. That night, Dvorak classifications were <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> the system while it was just west of Costa Rica, and it moved west-northwestward at 10–15mph (15–25km/h). Conditions appeared favorable for further development, and convection increased late on August 26 over the area of low pressure. Early on August 27, the system became much better organized about 250miles (400km) south-southwest of Guatemala, although convection remained minimal. Early on August 28, banding increased within its organizing convection, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven-E.|$|E
5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E

5|$|Badajoz was {{captured}} by Alfonso IX of León on 19 March 1230. Shortly after its conquest, {{in the time of}} Alfonso X the Wise of Castile, a bishopric see was established and work was <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. In 1336, during the reign of Alfonso XI of Castile, the troops of King Afonso IV of Portugal besieged the city. However, soon afterwards, the Castilian-Leonese troops, which included Pedro Ponce de León the Elder and Juan Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Coronel, second lord of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and son of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, defeated the troops of Alfonso IV in the Battle of Villanueva de Barcarrota. Their victory forced the king of Portugal to desert the city and it fell into neglect.|$|E
5|$|Between 1984–1985, {{the city}} of Roanoke {{developed}} an Airport Master Plan calling for $43.8 million to be spent {{in the development of}} a new terminal building, in addition to other improvements throughout the site. With $15.4 million secured in state and local funding for its implementation, the remainder of the costs were covered by local authorities. From this need for funding, the idea for the creation of a Regional Airport Commission to oversee airport operations was proposed. Approved by the Virginia General Assembly on February 18, 1986, and <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> July 1, 1987, the Roanoke Regional Airport Commission consisted of five members, with three appointed from Roanoke City and two appointed from Roanoke County. The creation of the commission ended {{the city of}} Roanoke's role as the sole operator of the airport, which had stretched from 1934 through 1987.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gilma {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast}} of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the second week of July 1994. The wave was of little note until it crossed Central America and entered the Northeastern Pacific hurricane basin on July15–16. Convection began to increase; however, the system remained disorganized. Tracking westward, gradual development took place, leading to the Dvorak classification being <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> July20. Several hours later, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated the system as Tropical Depression Seven-E. A strong ridge situated north of the depression steered the system steadily westward. This movement would remain the same throughout most of the storm's existence. The depression was initially hard to locate due to its large size.|$|E

5|$|Residents in Florida {{loaded up}} {{supplies}} on September16 when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch along Florida's west coast from Bonita Beach to the Suwannee River. The hurricane watch extended northward and westward {{later in the}} day to Apalachicola. Hurricane warnings were <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> September17 for areas along the Florida coast from Anna Maria Island to Ochlockonee River. Tropical storm warnings were issued south of Anna Maria Island to Bonita Beach and west of Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass. Tropical storm warnings were also issued along the east coast of the United States from Titusville in Florida to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. The Florida Division of Emergency Management in Tallahassee issued a mandatory evacuation in Hernando County, while voluntary evacuations were called for some of the coastal areas along Florida's west coast. Anticipating that Gordon will make landfall and move inland, two tornado watches were in effect from Sarasota to Naples, and tornado warnings were issued from Orlando to Vero Beach. Flash flood warnings were also in effect in parts of Florida.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{monetary}} reform of 1991, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, was the last {{monetary reform}} prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. <b>Initiated</b> <b>on</b> 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fuelling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.|$|E
5|$|The exit of Finland {{from the}} war on 3 September {{provided}} the political impetus for abandoning Estonia. The next day, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian suggested {{that it would not}} be possible to hold Ostland and ordered plans for the evacuation operation, codenamed Königsberg, to be drawn up. Hitler, however, declared that Ostland must not be given up at any cost, since doing so would provide support to those Finns that did not favour the new course of the government, and would influence Sweden to maintain its current foreign policy. After lunch, Guderian ordered that the Königsberg plan nevertheless be secretly <b>initiated.</b> <b>On</b> the next day, Oberst Natzmer visited the headquarters of Army Detachment Narwa to discuss details of the evacuation. On 11 September, the evacuation of Estonia was discussed in the Army Headquarters at length. On 15 September, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Group, Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner, requested that Guderian convince Hitler to order the evacuation of German troops from the continental part of Estonia, codenamed Operation Aster. Schörner emphasised that although the front was still holding, delaying the order would mean the units in Estonia would be trapped. Hitler agreed on 16 September.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was <b>initiated</b> <b>on</b> 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E
