40|$|BACKGROUND: Impaired {{olfaction}} is a common, nonmotor {{manifestation of}} Parkinson disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, qualitative olfactory disturbances, such as odor distortions, {{have not been}} extensively reported in this condition. OBJECTIVE: To describe 2 patients who reported positive olfactory symptoms preceding typical PD, which were consistent with olfactory hallucinations (phantosmias) {{in the absence of}} major smell deficit. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University hospital. Patients We describe 2 patients, both seen in 2007, who reported pleasant olfactory hallucinations for several years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Iodine I 123 -labeled <b>ioflupane</b> single-photon emission computed tomography and olfactometric testing results. RESULTS: The (123) I-labeled <b>ioflupane</b> single-photon emission computed tomography showed reduced radiotracer uptake in both striatum more marked in the putamen and on the left side in patient 1 and reduced radiotracer uptake in both putamen more marked on the right side in patient 2. Olfactometric testing showed mild hyposmia in patient 1 and normal function in patient 2. The disappearance of the phantosmias in both patients coincided with the development of typical PD. CONCLUSION: We propose phantosmia as a new premotor manifestation of PD and suggest that qualitative abnormalities of olfaction, rather than the typical smell loss demonstrated in this condition, should be more carefully examined in the prodromal phase of PD...|$|E

Software is developed for image classification based on well- established eigenimage techniques. Using a publicly available database of images an area under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) of 0. 980 is achieved.

40|$|<b>Ioflupane</b> is {{an analog}} of cocaine that binds {{reversibly}} with high affinity to the dopamine transporter (DaT) protein, a marker for presynaptic terminals in dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. <b>Ioflupane</b> 123 I Injection {{is also known}} as DaTscan or DaTSCAN (123 I-ioflupane is also called 123 I- 2 -β-carbomethoxy- 3 β-(4 -iodophenyl) -N-(3 -fluoropropyl) nortropane or 123 I-FP-CIT). The diagnostic efficacy of DaTscan has been described elsewhere. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the safety of DaTscan starting from initiation of clinical development through 13 y after the date of first market approval. Safety data in the sponsor’s clinical development safety database from 10 completed DaTscan clinical trials were pooled, and postapproval experience was summarized from standardized aggregate safety reports submitted to regulatory agencies. A total of 1, 180 clinical trial subjects (92 % of 1, 284 subjects planned to receive DaTscan in the clinical trials) received DaTscan. Percentages of subjects with adverse events by category were as follows: all (22 %), considered at least possibly related to DaTscan by the investigator (4 %), any severe (3 %), headache (4 %), nausea (2 %), dizziness (2 %), nasopharyngitis (1 %), and injection site hematoma (1 %). Four percent of subjects had at least 1 serious adverse event; 5 subjects (&# 60; 1 %) had serious adverse events that led to death. All serious adverse events, including those that led to death, were deemed by an expert clinician to be unrelated to DaTscan. An estimated half a million market doses of DaTscan (for single use) were administered from July 2000 through the July 2013 reporting period. In postapproval safety assessment, 1 death was reported 20 d after (and unrelated to) DaTscan administration. Two spontaneously reported serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 32 spontaneously reported nonserious ADRs were submitted, approximately half of which are identified in labeling. Headache (in clinical trials) and injection site pain (postapproval) were the most commonly reported events or reactions. Although adverse events were reported for 1 in 5 clinical trial subjects, most were mild and considered unrelated to DaTscan administration. Severe events were uncommon, and no serious adverse event occurring in more than 1 subject was deemed related to DaTscan administration. In postapproval experience, the frequency of ADRs spontaneously reported was less than 1 per 10, 000 doses administered. Comprehensive safety data show that DaTscan was well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain MR imaging is {{routinely}} {{performed in the}} work-up of suspected PD, yet its role is essentially limited {{to the exclusion of}} other pathologies. We performed a pattern-recognition analysis based on DTI data to detect subjects with PD at the individual level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 40 consecutive patients with Parkinsonism suggestive of PD who had DTI at 3 T, brain 123 I <b>ioflupane</b> SPECT (DaTSCAN), and extensive neurologic testing including follow-up (17 PD: age range, 67. 8 6. 7 years; 9 women; 23 Other: consisting of atypical forms of Parkinsonism; age range, 67. 2 9. 7 years; 7 women). Data analysis included group-level TBSS and individual-level SVM classification. RESULTS: At the group level, patients with PD versus Other had spatially consistent increase in FA and decrease in RD and MD in a bilateral network, predominantly in the right frontal white matter. At the individual level, SVM correctly classified patients with PD at the individual level with accuracies up to 97 %. CONCLUSIONS: Support vector machine–based pattern recognition of DTI data provides highly accu-rate detection of patients with PD among those with suspected PD at an individual level, which is potentially clinically applicable.

3000|$|... (123 I)FP-CIT (<b>ioflupane)</b> single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) is routinely used for assessment and differential diagnosis {{of patients with}} Parkinsonian syndromes. (123 I)FP-CIT SPECT is pathological in patients with any neurodegenerative form of Parkinsonism, including not only classical Parkinson’s disease (PD), but also atypical Parkinsonian disorders such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). It is normal in patients with non-neurodegenerative movement disorders such as drug-induced Parkinsonism or essential tremor. In recent years, different automated classification algorithms have been developed which aim to accurately separate these images into binary diagnostic groups: either with disease or without disease. Many such classifiers are based on machine learning approaches. For instance, Palumbo et al. created classifiers based on support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks to separate patients with PD from those without [1]. Huertas-Fernández et al. developed and evaluated models based on logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis and SVMs to differentiate between patients with PD and vascular Parkinsonism [2]. A summary of recently published machine learning algorithms for (123 I)FP-CIT classification is presented in recent work by Taylor [3]. Performance figures from many of these classification tools appear to be impressive, with accuracies in excess of 95 % commonly reported [3]. However, {{it is not yet}} clear whether such algorithms provide benefits in the clinic in terms of increased diagnostic accuracy or consistency as compared to standard reporting procedures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract 123 I-ioflupane single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) is a sensitive and well established imaging tool in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS), yet a discrimination between PD and APS {{has been considered}} inconsistent at least based on visual inspection or simple region of interest analyses. We here reappraise this issue by applying advanced image analysis techniques to separate PD from the various APS. This study included 392 consecutive patients with degenerative parkinsonism undergoing 123 I-ioflupane SPECT at our institution over the last decade: 306 PD, 24 multiple system atrophy (MSA), 32 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 30 corticobasal degeneration (CBD) patients. Data analysis included voxel-wise univariate statistical parametric mapping and multivariate pattern recognition using linear discriminant classifiers. MSA and PSP showed less <b>ioflupane</b> uptake in the head of caudate nucleus relative to PD and CBD, yet {{there was no difference}} between MSA and PSP. CBD had higher uptake in both putamen relative to PD, MSA and PSP. Classification was significant for PD versus APS (AUC 0. 69, p< 0. 05) and between APS subtypes (MSA vs CBD AUC 0. 80, p< 0. 05; MSA vs PSP AUC 0. 69 p< 0. 05; CBD vs PSP AUC 0. 69 p< 0. 05). Both striatal and extra-striatal regions contain classification information, yet the combination of both regions does not significantly improve classification accuracy. PD, MSA, PSP and CBD have distinct patterns of dopaminergic depletion on 123 I-ioflupane SPECT. The high specificity of 84 – 90 % for PD versus APS indicates that the classifier is particularly useful for confirming APS cases...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is {{a common}} form of dementia. The {{presence}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology modifies the clinical features of DLB, making it harder to distinguish DLB from AD clinically during life. Clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB applied at presentation can fail to identify up to 50 % of cases. Our aim was to determine, {{in a series of}} patients with dementia in whom autopsy confirmation of diagnosis was available, whether functional imaging of the nigrostriatal pathway improves the accuracy of diagnosis compared with diagnosis by means of clinical criteria alone. Methods: A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan was carried out with a dopaminergic presynaptic ligand [I- 123]- 2 beta-carbometoxy- 3 beta-(4 -iodophenyl) -N-(3 -fluoropropyl) nortropane (FP-CIT; <b>ioflupane)</b> on a group of patients with a clinical diagnosis of DLB or other dementia. An abnormal scan was defined as one in which right and left posterior putamen binding, measured semiquantitatively, was more than 2 SDs below the mean of the controls. Results: Over a 10 year period it was possible to collect 20 patients who had been followed from the time of first assessment and time of scan through to death and subsequent detailed neuropathological autopsy. Eight patients fulfilled neuropathological diagnostic criteria for DLB. Nine patients had AD, mostly with coexisting cerebrovascular disease. Three patients had other diagnoses. The sensitivity of an initial clinical diagnosis of DLB was 75 % and specificity was 42 %. The sensitivity of the FP-CIT scan for the diagnosis of DLB was 88 % and specificity was 100 %.

40|$|Objectives: I- 123 <b>ioflupane</b> (FP-CIT) single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} is a recognized {{tool in the}} diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes. In practice, data interpretation relies on visual and semiquantitative analyses. Good interobserver reproducibility is a prerequisite before claiming the robustness of a technique. This study aimed at evaluating interobserver reproducibility of this approach. Methods: Thirty nuclear medicine physicians participated in the study. Data included FP-CIT images and semiquantitative measurements of 12 cases, covering {{a wide spectrum of}} scintigraphic patterns and for which a 'true' clinical diagnosis based on long-term follow-up was available. Interobserver agreement was defined, for each case, as the highest percentage reached among the three proposed answers with complete agreement arbitrarily set at 80 % or more. Variability in an individual observer's sensitivity to assess data as normal, equivocal or abnormal was scored using a three-point scale. Results: Response rate was 99. 7 %. Among the three possible answers, 'normal' accounted for 41. 2 % of the total, 'abnormal' for 49. 8 % and 'equivocal' for 8. 1 %. The mean interobserver agreement was 76 % (range: 37 - 100 %), with complete agreement being reached only in five cases. The interpretation proposed by most observers accorded to clinical diagnosis in 75 % of the cases. Abnormalities of the central nervous system were encountered in all the cases with disagreement between the observer's interpretation and clinical diagnoses. An important variability in the observers sensitivity was seen. Conclusion: In the particular setting of this preliminary study evaluating the reproducibility of FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography interpretation in a group of nuclear medicine physicians with various experiences, interobserver agreement was suboptimal. Collegial discussion and standardized interpretation criteria could contribute to an improved reproducibility. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer HealthSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background Semi-quantification {{methods are}} well {{established}} in the clinic for assisted reporting of (I 123) <b>Ioflupane</b> images. Arguably, these are limited diagnostic tools. Recent research has demonstrated the potential for improved classification performance offered by machine learning algorithms. A direct comparison between methods is required to establish whether a move towards widespread clinical adoption of machine learning algorithms is justified. This study compared three machine learning algorithms {{with that of a}} range of semi-quantification methods, using the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) research database and a locally derived clinical database for validation. Machine learning algorithms were based on support vector machine classifiers with three different sets of features: Voxel intensities Principal components of image voxel intensities Striatal binding radios from the putamen and caudate. Semi-quantification methods were based on striatal binding ratios (SBRs) from both putamina, with and without consideration of the caudates. Normal limits for the SBRs were defined through four different methods: Minimum of age-matched controls Mean minus 1 / 1. 5 / 2 standard deviations from age-matched controls Linear regression of normal patient data against age (minus 1 / 1. 5 / 2 standard errors) Selection of the optimum operating point on the receiver operator characteristic curve from normal and abnormal training data Each machine learning and semi-quantification technique was evaluated with stratified, nested 10 -fold cross-validation, repeated 10 times. Results The mean accuracy of the semi-quantitative methods for classification of local data into Parkinsonian and non-Parkinsonian groups varied from 0. 78 to 0. 87, contrasting with 0. 89 to 0. 95 for classifying PPMI data into healthy controls and Parkinson’s disease groups. The machine learning algorithms gave mean accuracies between 0. 88 to 0. 92 and 0. 95 to 0. 97 for local and PPMI data respectively. Conclusions Classification performance was lower for the local database than the research database for both semi-quantitative and machine learning algorithms. However, for both databases, the machine learning methods generated equal or higher mean accuracies (with lower variance) than any of the semi-quantification approaches. The gain in performance from using machine learning algorithms as compared to semi-quantification was relatively small and may be insufficient, when considered in isolation, to offer significant advantages in the clinical context...|$|E

Understanding individual-reader diagnostic performance of (123) I-ioflupane {{in a variety of}} clinical scenarios is essential. Sensitivity, specificity, interreader, and intrareader data from 5 multicenter clinical studies were reviewed. The different study designs offered an assortment of variables to assess the effects on the diagnostic performance of (123) I-ioflupane: on-site versus 3 - 5 blinded image readers, number of image evaluations, early/uncertain versus late/confirmed clinical diagnosis as reference standard, and subjects with movement disorders versus dementia. Eight hundred eighteen subjects had individual-reader efficacy data available for analysis. In general, sensitivity and specificity were high and comparable between on-site versus blinded independent readers. In subjects with dementia, when the clinical diagnosis was made at month 12 versus baseline, specificity improved from 77. 4 %- 91. 2 % to 81. 6 %- 95. 0 %. In subjects with movement disorders, this effect was observed to an even greater extent, when diagnostic performance using month- 18 diagnosis as a reference standard (sensitivity, 67. 0 %- 73. 7 %; specificity, 75. 0 %- 83. 3 %) was compared versus month- 36 diagnosis (77. 5 %- 80. 3 % and 90. 3 %- 96. 8 %, respectively). Diagnostic performance was similar in subjects with dementia (74. 4 %- 89. 9 % and 77. 4 %- 95. 0 %, respectively) and subjects with movement disorders (67. 0 %- 97. 9 % and 71. 4 %- 98. 4 %, respectively). In most of the comparisons, between-reader agreement was very good (almost perfect), with κ ranging from 0. 81 to 1. 00. Within-reader agreement, measured in 1 study, was 100 % for 3 blinded readers. Individual-reader diagnostic performance, as assessed by measuring sensitivity and specificity of (123) I-ioflupane to detect {{the presence or absence of}} striatal dopaminergic deficit, using the clinical diagnosis as a reference standard, was high in subjects with either movement disorders or dementia and was similar in on-site readers versus blinded analyses.
