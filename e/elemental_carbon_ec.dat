Field sampling results indicated that PM 2. 5 concentrations over sea were generally higher than those at the offshore islands, while the PM 2. 5 concentrations in the daytime were commonly higher than those at nighttime. Moreover, the concentrations of PM 2. 5 were generally {{higher than those of}} coarse particles (PM 2. 5 – 10) with an exception of the winter cruise in 2014. Moreover, sea salts accounted for 6. 5 – 11. 1  % and 11. 0 – 13. 5  % of PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands and over sea, respectively. The contributions of non-sea salt-water soluble ions (nss-WSI) to PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands were obviously higher than those over sea, while the contributions of ss-WSI for PM 2. 5 at the offshore islands were much lower than those over sea during the cruise sampling campaigns. Anthropogenic metallic elements including Zn, Mn, Pb, Cr, and Ni had higher concentrations over sea than those at the offshore islands, suggesting that PM 2. 5 was not only influenced by marine aerosols but also by anthropogenic particles originated from human activities such as industrial processing, fuel burning, and vehicular and shipping exhausts. Higher mass ratios of Ni/Al and Ni/Fe over sea than those at the offshore islands suggested that shipping emissions had higher influences on marine fine particles than crustal dusts in open sea while compared to those at the offshore islands.

40|$|Combustion {{aerosols}} consist {{mainly of}} <b>elemental</b> and organic <b>carbon</b> (<b>EC</b> and OC). Since EC strongly absorbs light and thus affects atmospheric visibility and radiation balance, {{there is great}} interest in its measurement. To this end, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published a standard method to determine the mass of EC and OC on filter samples. Another common method of measuring carbon in aerosols is the aethalometer, which uses light extinction to measure "black carbon" or BC, which is considered to approximate EC. A third method sometimes used for estimating carbon in submicron combustion aerosols, is to measure particle size distributions using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and calculate mass using the assumptions that the particles are spherical, carbonaceous and of known density.

In this study, we utilize comprehensive physical and chemical field measurements of biomass burning aerosols in Brazil to constrain the densities and refractive indices (RI) of EC and OC in these particles, by comparing their optically and chemically derived RI. The optically derived effective RI are retrieved from the measured absorption and scattering coefficients using a Mie scattering algorithm, and serve as a reference dataset, while the chemically derived effective RI are calculated from the measured chemical composition using electromagnetic mixing rules. The results are discussed in light of the observed combustion conditions, and in an effort to derive conclusions as to the chemical and optical properties of the usually less well-characterized components of biomass burning aerosols, namely, <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> and organic matter. The best agreement between the optically and chemically derived RI was achieved by assigning a density of rho(EC) = 1. 8 g cm(- 3) and refractive index RIEC = 1. 87 - 0. 22 i to the EC component, and rho = 0. 9 g cm(- 3) and RI = 1. 4 - 0 i to the unidentified organic matter fraction of the particles. These parameters suggest low graphitization levels for the EC, and a dominant proportion of aliphatic compounds in the unidentified organic matter. Combining the density and RI of the unidentified organic matter with the properties of the chemically characterized organic fraction yields rho = 1. 1 g cm(- 3) and RI = 1. 3 - 0 i for the total aerosol OC.

Samples were analyzed for total carbon by the Gamma Ray Analysis of Light Elements (GRALE) technique and for <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> by reflectance. Total carbon concentrations at downtown Los Angeles averaged 24 µgm^(- 3) and <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> concentrations averaged 9 µgm^(- 3) during the 7 am to 1 pm period. The light absorption efficiency of ambient <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> particles {{was determined to be}} 11. 9 + 0. 9 m^ 2 g^(- 1), and it was estimated that light absorption by <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> could account for up to 17 % of total light extinction in downtown Los Angeles. Baseline conditions for <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> concentrations in the Los Angeles area prior to the introduction of large numbers of diesel passenger cars into the vehicle fleet are established by these measurements. A method for reconstruction of a long time series of past historical air monitoring data on <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> concentrations is described...|$|R
40|$|Particulate matter {{samples were}} {{collected}} in a road tunnel in Lisbon (PM 0. 5, PM 0. 5 - 1, PM 1 - 2. 5, and PM 2. 5 - 10) and at two urban locations representing roadside and background stations (PM 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 - 10). Samples were analysed for organic and <b>elemental</b> <b>carbon</b> (OC and <b>EC),</b> n-alkanes, n-alkenes, hopanes, some isoprenoid compounds, and steranes. Particulate matter concentrations in the tunnel were 17 - 31 times higher than at roadside in the vicinity, evidencing an aerosol origin almost exclusively in fresh vehicle emissions. PM 0. 5 in the tunnel comprised more than 60 % and 80 % of the total OC and EC mass in PM 10, respectively. Concentrations of the different aliphatic groups of compounds in the tunnel were up to 89 times higher than at roadside and 143 times higher than at urban background. Based on the application of hopane-to-OC or hopanes-to-EC ratios obtained in the tunnel, {{it was found that}} vehicle emissions are the dominant contributor to carbonaceous particles in the city but do not represent the only source of these triterpenic compounds. Contrary to what has been observed in other studies, the Sigma hopane-to-EC ratios were higher in summer than in winter, suggesting that other factors (e. g. biomass burning, dust resuspension, and different fuels/engine technologies) prevail in relation to the photochemical decay of triterpenoid hydrocarbons from vehicle exhaustinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
