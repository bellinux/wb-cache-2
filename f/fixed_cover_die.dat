500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The <b>cover</b> <b>die</b> {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The <b>cover</b> <b>die</b> is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|R

5000|$|The Plug comic {{was never}} a big hit, {{possibly}} because, at 9 pence, it was too expensive compared to other D.C. Thomson comics at the time, which were priced at around 5 pence.

50|$|Designed by Fritz Fiedler, the 326 {{featured}} a box-section frame that could readily be adapted for derivative models. Also innovative were the torsion bar rear suspension, {{inspired by the}} dead axle suspension of the Citroën Traction Avant, and the hydraulic braking system, {{the first to be}} used on a BMW car. Styled by Peter Schimanowski, the 326 was offered as a four-door sedan and as a two- or four-door cabriolet. The 326 sedan was the first BMW available with four doors. The BMW 320, BMW 321, BMW 327, and BMW 335 were based on the 326. The streamlined form of the body contrasted with previous relatively upright BMWs: drag was presumably reduced further by including a <b>fixed</b> <b>cover</b> over the spare wheel at the back.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Physical and {{mathematical}} models of microstructure evolution during the solidification process of die casting AZ 91 D alloy were investigated in this paper. Coupled with solute concentration, a modified three-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) model was proposed. Considering the solute enrichment {{and the formation}} of eutectic microstructure, these models can reproduce the whole microstructure evolution process of Mg alloy, from the formation of primary phase to the eutectic transformation. The microstructure of the AZ 91 D alloy cylinder head <b>cover</b> <b>die</b> casting was simulated with the proposed models. The simulated results are in agreement with the experimental...|$|R
