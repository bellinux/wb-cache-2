2500|$|On {{the eve of}} World Environment Day in June 2011, {{environmental}} groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 {{environmental groups}} and legislators, gathered in Taipei with banners that read: [...] "I love Taiwan, not nuclear disasters". They protested against the nation's three operating nuclear power plants {{and the construction of}} a fourth plant. They also called for [...] "all nuclear power plants to be thoroughly re-evaluated and shut down immediately if they <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> safety inspections". According to Wang To-far, economics professor at National Taipei University, [...] "if a level-seven nuclear crisis were to happen in Taiwan, it would destroy the nation".|$|E
2500|$|Professor George Chauncey of Yale University, {{a social}} {{historian}} {{who specializes in}} LGBT history, described how previous government campaigns had attempted [...] "to demonize gay people as dangerous sexual deviants and child molesters". He then analyzed campaign material from the Yes on 8 campaign to show how they played upon the same message. He analyzed the words of Dr. William Tam, which included assertions that, were California to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Proposition 8, other states would follow and [...] "fall into Satan's hands", and that following legalization of same-sex marriage, the advocates of the [...] "gay agenda" [...] would attempt to [...] "legalize having sex with children". Chauncey connected these messages to the earlier history of government demonizing gays and lesbians which he had previously discussed. Helen Zia, a scholar on Asian American social and political movements who was also asked to analyze those words, explained how her encounters with similar Asian community organizers encouraged her to [...] " [...] into the closet and [...] the door." [...] David Thompson for the defense cross-examined Prof. Chauncey {{by focusing on the}} progress that had been made for mainstream acceptance of gays and lesbians in the last twenty years. Thompson noted anti-discrimination laws, support for domestic partnerships, and the proliferation of media like the sitcom Will & Grace and 2005 film Brokeback Mountain. Thompson's line of questioning was intended to establish [...] "whether systemic bias against lesbians and gay men prevents them from being treated by others as equal citizens in the political process".|$|E

60|$|Lisle {{pursued the}} regular {{course of his}} work, in happy {{unconsciousness}} that any suspicion as to his identity entered the minds of his officers. His spirits were now not forced; the fatiguing marches, the night pickets, and the pressure of his duty so occupied his thoughts that he had little time to dwell upon his loss. It was now three months since his father had died, and yet {{it seemed to him}} in the far distance, so much had happened since. Occasionally he thought with disgust that, when this was all over, he must return to England to the uncle he had never seen, and become a schoolboy, spending his days in study; and perhaps, in the end, <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> his examination. He would be a stranger amongst strangers. He could not expect that his uncle should feel any particular interest in a lad he had never before seen, and he drew pictures to himself of the long, friendless interval before, even at the best, he could again don a uniform.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, on {{our side}} of the Atlantic, to cite our own faults first, we still cling to the {{supposed}} humour of bad spelling. We have, indeed, told ourselves a thousand times over that bad spelling is not funny, but is very tiresome. Yet it is no sooner laid aside and buried than it gets resurrected. I suppose the real reason is that it is funny, at least to our eyes. When Bill Nye spells wife with [...] "yph" [...] we can't help being amused. Now Bill Nye's bad spelling had absolutely no point to it except its oddity. At times it was extremely funny, but as a mode it led easily to widespread and pointless imitation. It was the kind of thing--like poetry--that anybody can do badly. It was most deservedly abandoned with execration. No American editor would print it to-day. But witness the new and excellent effect produced with bad spelling by Mr. Ring W. Lardner. Here, however, the case is altered; it is not the falseness of Mr. Lardner's spelling that is the amusing feature of it, but the truth of it. When he writes, [...] "dear friend, Al, I would of rote sooner," [...] etc., he is truer to actual sound and intonation than the lexicon. The mode is excellent. But the imitations will soon debase it into such bad coin that it will <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> current. In England, however, the humour of bad spelling does not and has never, I believe, flourished. Bad spelling is only used in England as an attempt to reproduce phonetically a dialect; it is not intended that the spelling itself should be thought funny, but the dialect that it represents. But the effect, on the whole, is tiresome. A little dose of the humour of Lancashire or Somerset or Yorkshire pronunciation may be all right, but a whole page of it looks like the gibbering of chimpanzees set down on paper.|$|E
