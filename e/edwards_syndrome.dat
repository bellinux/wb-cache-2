25|$|<b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{chromosomal}} abnormality {{characterized by}} the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 18th chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 18) or in part (such as due to translocations). The additional chromosome usually occurs before conception. The effects of the extra copy vary greatly, depending on the extent of the extra copy, genetic history, and chance. <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome</b> occurs in all human populations, but is more prevalent in female offspring.|$|E

30|$|Standard {{testing to}} detect {{constitutional}} anomalies (present at or before birth) is chromosome analysis (karyotyping) at the 450 – 500  G-band level. Karyotyping can detect large genomic imbalances (losses or gains of DNA) in LD {{conditions such as}} Down, Turner and <b>Edwards</b> <b>Syndromes.</b> However, the resolution is insufficient to routinely detect rearrangements smaller than 5  million base pairs (5  Mb) and even abnormalities of 15  Mb may be missed where the banding pattern is indistinct.|$|R
25|$|<b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{occurs in}} {{about one in}} 5,000 live births, but more conceptions are {{affected}} by the syndrome because the majority of those diagnosed with the condition prenatally will not survive to birth. Although women in their 20s and early 30s may conceive babies with <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the risk of conceiving a child with it increases with a woman's age. The average maternal age for conceiving a child with this disorder is 32½.|$|E
25|$|A small {{percentage}} of cases occur when {{only some of the}} body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 18, resulting in a mixed population of cells with a differing number of chromosomes. Such cases are sometimes called mosaic <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Very rarely, a piece of chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome (translocated) before or after conception. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18 plus extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, a person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 18, and the abnormalities are often less severe than for the typical <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or trisomy-18, {{the second}} most common trisomy. Symptoms include motor retardation, {{developmental}} disability and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health problems. Ninety percent of those affected die in infancy. They have characteristic clenched hands and overlapping fingers.|$|E
50|$|Non-invasive {{techniques}} include {{examinations of}} the woman's womb through ultrasonography and maternal serum screens (i.e. Alpha-fetoprotein). Blood tests for select trisomies (Down syndrome in the United States, Down and <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndromes</b> in China) based on detecting cell-free placental DNA present in maternal blood, {{also known as}} non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), have become available. If an elevated risk of chromosomal or genetic abnormality is indicated by a non-invasive screening test, a more invasive technique may be employed to gather more information. In the case of neural tube defects, a detailed ultrasound can non-invasively provide a definitive diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Relatar dois pacientes, um acometido por trissomia do cromossomo 13 em mosaico e outro por trissomia do cromossomo 18, ambos com apresentações clínicas não usuais. DESCRIÇÃO DO CASO: Paciente do sexo feminino de dois meses de idade, que apresentava deficiência de crescimento, dismorfias menores de face e de membros, paresia facial unilateral, cardiopatia congênita, hipotonia e evolução com o surgimento de manchas hipocrômicas e atraso do desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor. O segundo caso é de um paciente do sexo masculino, com 19 dias de vida, que também mostrava deficiência de crescimento, anomalias faciais menores, defeito radial, cardiopatia congênita e hipertonia. Os cariótipos por bandas GTG confirmaram o diagnóstico, respectivamente, de síndromes de Patau e de Edwards.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the differences in short-term course between DSM-IV alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence in a community sample of men and women. Eight hundred seventy-six individuals were given a baseline interview that included DSM-IV criteria for alcohol use disorders, and were followed up with a similar interview approximately one year later. Group differences were com-pared with chi-square tests. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to test group differences controlling for potential confounders. The course of alcohol abuse and dependence differed significantly from each other, and from individuals with no alcohol diagnosis at baseline. Chronicity was the most common outcome for depen-dence but not for abuse. Most subjects with baseline diagnoses of abuse received the diagnosis with only one symptom, repeated drunk driving. While the validity of the alcohol dependence diagnosis was supported in this community sample, the results con-cerning alcohol abuse remain equivocal. The definitions of alcohol dependence in DSM-III-R, ICD- 10 and DSM-IV have been based on a common underlying concept, the Dependence <b>Syndrome</b> (<b>Edwards</b> & Gross...|$|R
40|$|Meiosis is a {{specialised}} {{cell division}} {{that results in}} the formation of four genetically unique haploid daughter cells from one diploid parent cell. This is achieved by one round of DNA replication followed by two rounds of nuclear division. This is in contrast to mitosis, which produces genetically identical diploid daughter cells. Errors during meiosis can result in aneupolidy. In humans, aneuploidy can cause miscarriage and disease such as Patau, <b>Edwards</b> and Down <b>syndromes</b> (trisomies 13, 18 and 21, respectively). Therefore, understanding how meiosis is regulated is of great importance in understanding the causes of aneuploidy and disease in humans. In this thesis, I have used the model organism budding yeast to study how meiosis is regulated in yeast cells, with a view to understanding how meiosis is regulated in human cells. PP 2 ACdc 55 is a highly conserved phosphatase and its role in meiosis was not addressed in any organism before my work. I constructed a meiotic null allele of CDC 55 (cdc 55 -mn) by replacing its promoter with the mitosis-specific PCLB 2. By carefully characterising the phenotype of cdc 55 -mn strains, I showed PP 2 ACdc 55 is crucial for timing the activation of the FEAR network. I have demonstrated that premature activation of FEAR during meiosis (caused by a lack of PP 2 ACdc 55 activity) blocks spindle assembly and nuclear divisions. In cdc 55 meiotic null (cdc 55 -mn) cells, the Cdk-counteracting phosphatase Cdc 14 is prematurely released from the nucleolus concomitant with hyperphosphorylation of Net 1. I have found that a mutant form of Net 1 that lacks 6 of the Cdk phosphorylation sites rescues the meiotic null defect of cdc 55 -mn cells. Therefore, I have shown that phosphoregulation of Net 1 by PP 2 ACdc 55 is essential in order to prevent precocious exit from meiosis I. In my work described in Chapter 4, I isolated mutant alleles of cdc 55 that suppressed the spo 12 Δ dyad phenotype confirming the opposing roles of Net 1 -phosphorylation by Cdc 55 and Spo 12 in the FEAR pathway. I also isolated alleles of CDC 55 that suppressed the spo 11 Δ spo 12 Δ spore lethality. These alleles affected reductional segregation during meiosis I in achiasmate cells but had no effect in wild type cells. Investigating these alleles further might shed insights into mechanisms that work with chiasmata in ensuring efficient monopolar attachment during meiosis I...|$|R
25|$|Human trisomies {{compatible}} with live birth, other than Down syndrome (trisomy 21), are <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome</b> (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). Complete trisomies of other chromosomes {{are usually not}} viable and represent a relatively frequent cause of miscarriage. Only in rare cases of a mosaicism, {{the presence of a}} normal cell line, in addition to the trisomic cell line, may support the development of a viable trisomy of the other chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome</b> occur due to {{problems}} during {{the formation of}} the reproductive cells or during early development. The rate of disease increases with the mother's age. Rarely cases may be inherited from a person's parents. Occasionally not all cells have the extra chromosome, known as mosaic trisomy, and symptoms in these cases may be less severe. Ultrasound can increase suspicion for the condition, which can be confirmed by amniocentesis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{physical}} malformations {{associated with}} <b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome</b> include small head (microcephaly) {{accompanied by a}} prominent back portion of the head (occiput), low-set, malformed ears, abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), cleft lip/cleft palate, upturned nose, narrow eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis), a short breast bone, clenched hands, choroid plexus cysts, underdeveloped thumbs and/or nails, absent radius, webbing of {{the second and third}} toes, clubfoot or rocker bottom feet, and in males, undescended testicles.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{also known}} as trisomy 18, is a genetic {{disorder}} [...] caused {{by the presence of}} all, or part of a third copy of chromosome 18.

Other features include a small head, small jaw, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and severe intellectual disability.|$|E
2500|$|Most embryos cannot survive with {{a missing}} or extra {{autosome}} (numbered chromosome) and are spontaneously aborted. The most frequent aneuploidy in humans is trisomy 16, although fetuses affected {{with the full}} version of this chromosome abnormality do not survive to term (it is possible for surviving individuals to have the mosaic form, where trisomy 16 exists in some cells but not all). [...] The most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21, which is found in Down syndrome, affecting 1 in 800 births. Trisomy 18 (<b>Edwards</b> <b>syndrome)</b> affects 1 in 6,000 births, and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) affects 1 in 10,000 births. 10% of infants with trisomy 18 or 13 reach 1 year of age.|$|E

[...] Because about 3% of cases with unknown outcomes are {{likely to result in}} a live birth, the total number of live births is estimated to be 37 (2008/09 data are provisional). [...] Major causes of death include apnea and heart abnormalities. It is impossible to predict an exact prognosis during pregnancy or the neonatal period. Half of the infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life. The median lifespan is five to 15 days. About 8-12% of infants survive longer than 1 year. One percent of children live to age 10, though a retrospective Canadian study of 254 children with trisomy 18 demonstrated ten year survival of 9.8%.|$|E
