60|$|A light <b>haze</b> fringed the <b>horizon,</b> {{and she was}} not {{discovered}} {{until three}} miles off shore, when the Mayflower made her out and signalled the Vicksburg and Morrill. Captain Smith of the Vicksburg immediately clapped on all steam and started in pursuit.|$|R
6000|$|Too {{prudent to}} excite the natives' {{attention}} unnecessarily, the cautious Frenchman whispered, {{in the most}} commonplace voice on earth to Felix: [...] "Don't look at once; {{and when you do}} look, mind you don't exhibit any agitation in your tone or manner. But what do you make that out to be--that long black <b>haze</b> on the <b>horizon</b> to southward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{little before}} dark {{the head of}} the Montauk was {{inclined}} towards Lisbon, as if her intention was to run in, but the moment the dark spot that pointed out the position of the Foam was lost in the <b>haze</b> of the <b>horizon,</b> Captain Truck gave the order to [...] "ware" [...] and sail was made to the west-south-west.|$|R
60|$|When {{the south}} wind, in May days, With a net of shining <b>haze</b> Silvers the <b>horizon</b> wall, And with {{softness}} touching all, Tints the human countenance With a color of romance, And infusing subtle heats, Turns the sod to violets, Thou, in sunny solitudes, Rover of the underwoods, The green silence dost displace With thy mellow, breezy bass.|$|R
5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight <b>haze</b> on the <b>horizon</b> ahead of them, {{but did not}} make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{panoramic}} view of the ships in the outer harbor at Long Beach, taken from the city, ca. 1925. A line of large ships is visible through <b>haze</b> along the <b>horizon</b> in the distance beyond the city, visible {{at the bottom of the}} image. Hoyt's Theatre, the Hotel Arlington, the Crystal Cafeteria and the Ambassador Ballroom Dancing buildings are visible, as well as the tracks for a wooden rollercoaster and a ferris wheel...|$|R
60|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{which had}} attracted their professional attention {{did not appear}} to either of the Girdlestones to be a very important one. The <b>haze</b> on the <b>horizon</b> to the north was rather thicker than elsewhere, and a few thin streaky clouds straggled upwards across the clear cold heaven, like the feelers of some giant octopus which lay behind the fog bank. At the same time the sea changed in places from the appearance of quicksilver to that of grained glass.|$|R
50|$|Traditional sextants have a half-horizon mirror, which {{divides the}} field of view in two. On one side, there is a view of the horizon; on the other side, a view of the {{celestial}} object. The advantage of this type is that both the horizon and celestial object are bright and as clear as possible. This is superior at night and in <b>haze,</b> when the <b>horizon</b> can be difficult to see. However, one has to sweep the celestial object to ensure that the lowest limb of the celestial object touches the horizon.|$|R
50|$|Triton, Neptune's largest moon, has an atmosphere, {{but it is}} so thin {{that its}} sky is still black, {{possibly}} with some pale <b>haze</b> at the <b>horizon.</b> Because Triton orbits with synchronous rotation, Neptune always appears in the same position in its sky. Triton's rotation axis is inclined 130° to Neptune's orbital plane and thus points within 40° of the Sun twice per Neptunian year, much like Uranus's. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun for 82 years at a stretch, resulting in radical seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps this {{beneficial}} change, slight {{but still}} delightful, might {{be attributed to}} the softness and the splendour of the morn. Before the approach of winter, it seemed that the sun was resolved to remind the Venetians that they were his children; and that, although his rays might be soon clouded for a season, they were not to believe that their parent had deserted them. The sea was like glass, a golden <b>haze</b> suffused the <b>horizon,</b> and a breeze, not strong enough to disturb the waters, was wafted at intervals from the gardens of the Brenta, fitful and sweet.|$|R
6000|$|The {{view from}} this point was indeed stupendous. The vision seemed to range not only over an almost {{limitless}} world of forests, lakes, and rivers--away to where the <b>haze</b> of the <b>horizon</b> seemed to melt with them into space--but beyond that to where the great backbone of the New World rose sharp, clear, and gigantic above the mists of earth, until they reached and mingled with the fleecy clouds of heaven. To judge from their glittering eyes, even {{the souls of the}} not very demonstrative Indians were touched by the scene. As for the prairie chief, who had risen to the perceptions of the new life in Christ he halted and stood for some moments as if lost in contemplation. Then, turning to the young hunter at his side, he said softly-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Haze causes {{issues in}} the area of {{terrestrial}} photography, where the penetration of large amounts of dense atmosphere may be necessary to image distant subjects. This results in the visual effect of a loss of contrast in the subject, due to the effect of light scattering through the haze particles. For these reasons, sunrise and sunset colors appear subdued on hazy days, and stars may be obscured at night. In some cases, attenuation by haze is so great that, toward sunset, the sun disappears altogether before reaching the <b>horizon.</b> <b>Haze</b> can be defined as an aerial form of the Tyndall effect therefore unlike other atmospheric effects such as cloud and fog, haze is spectrally selective: shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more, and longer (red/infrared) wavelengths are scattered less. For this reason many super-telephoto lenses often incorporate yellow filters or coatings to enhance image contrast. Infrared (IR) imaging may also be used to penetrate haze over long distances, with a combination of IR-pass optical filters (such as the Wratten 89B) and IR-sensitive detector.|$|R
5000|$|The third song, [...] "When That Head Splits", was {{inspired}} by the Salvador Dalí poem and painting Metamorphosis of Narcissus and the story of Narcissus saying that he was an exceptionally proud man, in that he disdained those who loved him. Nemesis saw this and attracted Narcissus to a pool where he saw his own reflection in the water {{and fell in love with}} it. Unable to embrace the watery image, he pined away, and the gods immortalized him as a Narcissus. The title of the song is a direct line from the poem, they wanted to use words from the poem to put in the song but, due to legal issues, they decided against it. The next track, [...] "Shimmering", is supposed to be set in the full heat of the day. The title refers to the <b>haze</b> on the <b>horizon</b> and the lyrics talk about mirages and optical illusions caused by the sun. It {{was inspired}} by Camus' novel The Outsider, saying they wanted to, musically, recreate the [...] "wooziness" [...] of it.|$|R
60|$|I was too late. By {{the time}} I reached the water's edge {{he was a}} hundred yards away, making the boat spring with every stroke of his {{powerful}} arms. I uttered a wild cry of impotent anger, and stamped {{up and down the}} sands like a maniac. He turned and saw me. Rising from his seat he made me a graceful bow, and waved his hand to me. It was not a triumphant or a derisive gesture. Even my furious and distempered mind recognised it as being a solemn and courteous leave-taking. Then he settled down to his oars once more, and the little skiff shot away out over the bay. The sun had gone down now, leaving a single dull, red streak upon the water, which stretched away until it blended with the purple <b>haze</b> on the <b>horizon.</b> Gradually the skiff grew smaller and smaller as it sped across this lurid band, until the shades of night gathered round it and it became a mere blur upon the lonely sea. Then this vague loom died away also and darkness settled over it--a darkness which should never be raised.|$|R
60|$|The region {{which lies}} behind the West African coast {{is not a}} {{pleasant}} one to traverse, and bad fortune seemed to attend Maxwell's expedition from the time it marched out of the seaboard settlement, where he had had trouble with certain French officials, {{as well as with}} the black head man from whom he hired his carriers. All of this Dane remembered when he halted, one burning afternoon, shoulder-deep in the tall grass of a swamp, worn out in body and perplexed in mind. Few Europeans are capable of much exertion in that country, especially during the hottest part of the afternoon; but the hammock boys were too weary to drag their burdens farther, and there was urgent need for haste. Dane accordingly had taxed his strength to the utmost during the last few hours. The tall grass stems were almost too hot to touch, and foul mire bubbled about their roots. At least a league of it, through which, slashed by saw-edged blades and stabbed by broken stalks, the expedition must force its way, stretched toward an inland ridge of higher ground that rose from the morass. Beyond this, in turn, flat-topped hills dimmed by a yellow heat <b>haze</b> cut the <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Latitude was {{measured}} in the past either by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon (the [...] "noon sight"), or by measuring the altitudes of any other celestial body when crossing the meridian (reaching its maximum altitude when due north or south), and frequently by measuring the altitude of Polaris, the north star (assuming it is sufficiently visible above the horizon, which {{it is not in}} the Southern Hemisphere). Polaris always stays within 1 degree of the celestial north pole. If a navigator measures the angle to Polaris and finds it to be 10 degrees from the horizon, then he is about 10 degrees north of the equator. This approximate latitude is then corrected using simple tables or almanac corrections to determine a latitude theoretically accurate to within a fraction of a mile. Angles are measured from the horizon because locating the point directly overhead, the zenith, is not normally possible. When <b>haze</b> obscures the <b>horizon,</b> navigators use artificial horizons, which are horizontal mirrors of pans of reflective fluid, especially mercury historically. In the latter case, the angle between the reflected image in the mirror and the actual image of the object in the sky is exactly twice the required altitude.|$|R
6000|$|The nights as yet, we {{will not}} say {{disappointed}} us,--for to see new stars, like Canopus and Fomalhaut, shining in the far south, even to see Sirius, in his ever-changing blaze of red and blue, riding high in a December heaven, is interesting enough; but {{the brilliance of the}} stars is not, at least at this season, equal to that of a frosty sky in England. Nevertheless, {{to make up for the}} deficiency, the clouds were glorious; so glorious, that I longed again and again, as I did afterwards in the West Indies, that Mr. Ruskin were by my side, to see and to describe, as none but he can do. The evening skies are fit weeds for widowed Eos weeping over the dying Sun; thin, formless, rent--in carelessness, not in rage; and of all the hues of early autumn leaves, purple and brown, with green and primrose lakes of air between: but all hues weakened, mingled, chastened into loneliness, tenderness, regretfulness, through which still shines, in endless vistas of clear western light, the hope of the returning day. More and more faint, the pageant fades below towards the white <b>haze</b> of the <b>horizon,</b> where, in sharpest contrast, leaps and welters against it the black jagged sea; and richer and richer it glows upwards, till it cuts the azure overhead: until, only too soon-- ...|$|R
60|$|On the north, the Calton Hill {{is neither}} so abrupt in itself nor has it so {{exceptional}} an outlook; and yet even here it commands a striking prospect. A gully separates {{it from the}} New Town. This is Greenside, where witches were burned and tournaments held in former days. Down that almost precipitous bank, Bothwell launched his horse, and so first, as they say, attracted the bright eyes of Mary. It is now tesselated with sheets and blankets out to dry, {{and the sound of}} people beating carpets is rarely absent. Beyond all this, the suburbs run out to Leith; Leith camps on the seaside with her forest of masts; Leith roads are full of ships at anchor; the sun picks out the white pharos upon Inchkeith Island; the Firth extends on either hand from the Ferry to the May; the towns of Fifeshire sit, each in its bank of blowing smoke, along the opposite coast; and the hills enclose the view, except to the farthest east, where the <b>haze</b> of the <b>horizon</b> rests upon the open sea. There lies the road to Norway: a dear road for Sir Patrick Spens and his Scots Lords; and yonder smoke on the hither side of Largo Law is Aberdour, from whence they sailed to seek a queen for Scotland.|$|R
60|$|A slight <b>haze</b> {{blurred the}} <b>horizon.</b> Outside the harbour the measureless expanse of smooth water lay {{sparkling}} like a floor of jewels, and as empty as the sky. The short black tug gave a pluck to windward, {{in the usual}} way, then let go the rope, and hovered {{for a moment on}} the quarter with her engines stopped; while the slim, long hull of the ship moved ahead slowly under lower topsails. The loose upper canvas blew out in the breeze with soft round contours, resembling small white clouds snared in the maze of ropes. Then the sheets were hauled home, the yards hoisted, and the ship became a high and lonely pyramid, gliding, all shining and white, through the sunlit mist. The tug turned short round and went away towards the land. Twenty-six pairs of eyes watched her low broad stern crawling languidly over the smooth swell between the two paddle-wheels that turned fast, beating the water with fierce hurry. She resembled an enormous and aquatic black beetle, surprised by the light, overwhelmed by the sunshine, trying to escape with ineffectual effort into the distant gloom of the land. She left a lingering smudge of smoke on the sky, and two vanishing trails of foam on the water. On the place where she had stopped a round black patch of soot remained, undulating on the swell--an unclean mark of the creature's rest.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the time}} of the day when the sun, having lost his {{greatest}} power, still threw a bright light and enveloped the atmosphere with a vague hue, a luminous and speckled mist which appears in certain regions of the globe. Imagine, beyond this sparkling gauze, an unlimited plain crossed by a large river which, like a silver blade, appears out of the <b>haze</b> along the <b>horizon</b> and on your right bathes the walls of twenty palaces; beyond the river, on this side, are the Pyramids of Giza whose proud mass has braved centuries and survived destruction; in front and towards the background are the Pyramids of Sakkarah, much older; a girdle of sand surrounds them and cuts off the horizon on that side; beyond the Pyramids is a pleasant plain, intersected by numerous divisions of the river into so many ribbons, from which rise minarets, villages and thick woods. (...) Nearer to you, these ruins appear in their actual dimensions and form pleasant groupings detached in their semi-tints against the background. Nearer yet is the necropolis of the califs, the city of tombs, and an immense vaulted aqueduc; then minarets, domes, platforms and at last the town of Cairo at your feet, so elegant, its bold minarets, its thousands of terraces, and its enormous mosques of which a vivid colour brings out the entire picture and makes remote the entire perspective. That is a detail of the tableau we have before our eyes, but the general effect, the grandeur, the harmony of this magnificent tableau, is what strikes us with a kind of stupor; but to depict it words fail, and it would be necessary in order to render the magic of this marvel, to borrow the sun's rays and trace the painting with gold and azure." ...|$|R
40|$|Watercolour. [base centre] "Note Mainmast of the Beagle {{a little}} farthur aft. Miz. Mast to rake more. "; [top right] "RF" FitzRoy. The sky is painted in purplish-blue, with some {{indication}} of cirrus clouds in the top centre, and cumulo-cirrus in mid height; there is a brownish <b>haze</b> nearer the <b>horizon,</b> especially from the left centre {{to the right of}} the picture. Much of the foreground is blank, though in the centre brown earth is shown, with the impression of a couple of very small shrubs, behind which the ground is sandy. In the left midground, above the annotation, a large tripod stands, seemingly made from oars, which project upwards to twice the height of the point where they are lashed together. The base of the triangle is approximately equilateral, the sides measuring about 2. 5 m. Around the tripod there are six figures, four standing, two near the rightmost apex, one each near the others. The rightmost of these standing figures is depicted in colour, wearing white trousers and a blue-fronted jacket with a dark or black back. Behind this figure is the fifth figure, seated; and the sixth figure is hanging on rope by the ankles from the join of the tripod; he is wearing black trousers, and his head and torso are possibly covered in a sack. Behind and {{to the right of the}} tripod and group of figures, vegetation is shown at the water's edge, uncoloured at its left-hand end, brown in its central portion, dark brownish grey at its right-hand end. There is a similar group of dark plants in the right centre of the picture, behind the stretch of sandy ground. The whole width of the midground is occupied by calm blue water, paler to the left, darker in the area to the right of the picture where the Beagle is moored to the left of the Adventure, both shown side-on facing right, with some detail in the depiction of the masts and rigging, there being no sails visible. In the background, land appears behind a far shore, vaguely indicated on the left and right behind the figures and boats, shown in more detail in the centre, where a low rocky shoreline is discernible, with a larger hill behind it. Its surface seems covered with vegetation, including what may be a tall tree or small group of trees on its summit. The rocky shoreline in the background is painted brownish-purple, with some darker patches; the hillsides are a greyish green, this colour continuing to the right-hand edge of the picture. A faint purplish-blue outline suggests more distant elevated relatively flat land on the horizon stretching from the centre to the right of the picture. Annotations in the lower right of 26 v read: "The whole landscape of a rich brown green with purples and occasional touches of red and yellow on the crags" and "Water very light [s?]and dull greenish yellow".
