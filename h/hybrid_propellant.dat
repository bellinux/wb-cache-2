40|$|Because <b>hybrid</b> rocket <b>propellant</b> {{materials}} are individually chemically stable prior to mixing within the combustion chamber, these systems possess well-known safety advantages. Unfortunately, the relative stability of traditional <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellants</b> also makes <b>hybrid</b> systems difficult to ignite. Hybrid ignition has historically involved {{one of three}} means, 1) pyrotechnic charges, 2) plasma torch, and 3) electric spark plugs with bi-propellant injectors. All of these methods possess distinct disadvantages. This paper details {{the development of new}} concept for hybrid rocket ignition that circumvents many of the difficulties associated with conventional ignition systems. During a testing campaign investigating Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) as a fuel for hybrid rocket systems, it was discovered that ABS possesses unique electrical breakdown characteristics that facilitate ignition. Strategic application of an electric field induces an electrostatic arc along the surface of an additively-manufactured ABS fuel section resulting producing hydrocarbon vapor that seeds combustion. This behavior forms the basis of a novel arc ignition system. Multiple incremental prototype systems were designed, built, and tested. Minimum conditions for successful operation were discovered, including minimum ignition pressure, optimal geometry, and electrical power requirements. Hands-off restart capability was demonstrated repeatedly on a lab-scale system. Paths of inquiry for future research are outlined...|$|R

Oberth also worked on a hybrid rocket motor using LOX as the oxidizer and graphite as the fuel. The high heat of sublimation of carbon prevented these rocket motors from operating efficiently, as it resulted in a negligible burning rate.In the 1940s, the California Pacific Rocket Society used LOX in combination with several different fuel types, including wood, wax, and rubber. The most successful of these tests was with the rubber fuel, which is still the dominant fuel in use today. In June 1951, a LOX/rubber rocket was flown to an altitude of 9 km.|$|E

This paper gives a short introduction into the technology of both propulsion system types, which both use advanced propellants and propellant combinations to realize these benefits.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to launch small payloads into LEO {{by means of}} an electromagnetic railgun is the motivation of the present study. Here it is assumed that an electromagnetic railgun with barrel length of 180 m is able to launch a 120 mm diameter projectile at a speed of 6 km/s. In order to the payload achieves orbital motion and to compensate the velocity losses due to gravity and aerodynamic drag, a rocket engine which supplies the required velocity difference is integrated into the projectile structure. The development of such propelled projectile requires key technologies that could also benefit other industrial sectors. The paper presents the main concept and design aspects to be considered for such propelled projectile with special emphasis on: flight mechanics, aero-/thermodynamics, materials and propulsion characteristics. The aerodynamic form of the projectile is optimized to achieve minimum drag and lower heat loads. Launch angles and trajectory optimization analysis are carried out by means of 3 degree of freedom simulations (3 DOF). Furthermore, three concurrent propulsions systems are here considered for the rocket engine: solid, liquid and <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellants</b> type. The results of analysis pointed that the most promising propulsion systems are: (I) hybrid engine based on hydrogen peroxide/wax propellants and (II) liquid engine based on hydrogen peroxide/hydrocarbon propellants.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the use of reactive energetic fuel additives that have the potential to increase the combustion performance of <b>hybrid</b> rocket <b>propellants</b> in terms of solid fuel regression rate and combustion efficiency. Additives that can augment the combustion flame zone in a hybrid rocket motor by means of increased energy feedback to the fuel grain surface are of great interest. Metal hydrides have large volumetric hydrogen densities, which gives these materials high performance potential as fuel additives in terms of specifc impulse. The excess hydrogen and corresponding base metal may also cause an increase in the hybrid rocket solid fuel regression rate. Pyrophoric additives also have potential to increase the solid fuel regression rate by reacting more readily near the burning fuel surface providing rapid energy feedback. ^ An experimental performance evaluation of metal hydride fuel additives for hybrid rocket motor propulsion systems is examined in this study. Hypergolic ignition droplet tests and an accelerated aging study revealed the protection capabilities of Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as a fuel binder, and the ability for unaided ignition. Static hybrid rocket motor experiments were conducted using DCPD as the fuel. Sodium borohydride (NabH 4) and aluminum hydride (AlH 3) were examined as fuel additives. Ninety percent rocket grade hydrogen peroxide (RGHP) was used as the oxidizer. In this study, the sensitivity of solid fuel regression rate and characteristic velocity (C*) efficiency to total fuel grain port mass flux and particle loading is examined. These results were compared to HTPB combustion performance as a baseline.

The advantages mark the hybrid rocket as a potential replacement or alternative for current and future solid propellant booster systems. The issues are addressed and recommendations are made concerning oxidizer feed systems, injectors, and ignition systems as related to hybrid rocket propulsion. Early in the program a baseline hybrid configuration was established in which liquid oxygen would be injected through ports in a solid fuel whose composition is based on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB).

HTPB is the state-of-the-art binder used in solid propellant rocket motors and {{is considered to be a}} potential candidate fuel for hybrid rocket applications due to its higher regression rate characteristics, greater fuel value, higher carbon/hydrogen ratio and solid loading capability. One of the effective ways of increasing the regression rates in hybrids is the addition of solid oxidizer such as AP in the fuel in small percentages.

The HPM concept would provide the fundamental building block for an efficient, reusable in-space transportation system for both crewed and uncrewed missions. Each HPM would be equipped to implement an advanced zero-boil-off method of managing cryogenic fluids, and would include a fluid-transfer interface comprising standardized fittings that would be compatible with fittings on all supply facilities and on spacecraft to be supplied. The HPM, combined with a chemical or electric orbital transfer spacecraft, would provide an integrated propulsion system. HPMs would supply chemical propellant for time-critical transfers such as crewed missions, and utilize the more efficient electric-propulsion transfer vehicles to transport filled HPMs to the destinations and to return empty HPMs back to near-Earth orbits or other intermediate locations for replenishment and reuse. The HPM prepositioned using electric propulsion would provide the chemical propellant for the crew s return trip {{in a much more}} efficient manner than a chemical-only approach. The propellants to fill the HPMs would be delivered from the Earth or other initial supply locations to the intermediate locations by use of automated, compatible spacecraft designed specifically for that purpose.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a mission architecture called 'Mars Direct' which brings together several technologies and existing hardware into a novel mission strategy {{to achieve a}} highly capable and affordable approach to the Mars and Lunar exploratory objective of the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). Three innovations working in concept cut the initial mass {{by a factor of}} three, greatly expand out ability to explore Mars, and eliminate the need to assemble vehicles in Earth orbit. The first innovation, a <b>hybrid</b> Earth/Mars <b>propellant</b> production process works as follows. An Earth Return Vehicle (ERV), tanks loaded with liquid hydrogen, is sent to Mars. After landing, a 100 kWe nuclear reactor is deployed which powers a propellant processor that combines onboard hydrogen with Mars' atmospheric CO 2 to produce methane and water. The water is then electrolized to create oxygen and, in the process, liberates the hydrogen for further processing. Additional oxygen is gained directly by decomposition of Mars' CO 2 atmosphere. This second innovation, a hybrid crew transport/habitation method, uses the same habitat for transfer to Mars {{as well as for the}} 18 month stay on the surface. The crew return via the previously launched ERV in a modest, lightweight return capsule. This reduces mission mass for two reasons. One, it eliminates the unnecessary mass of two large habitats, one in orbit and one on the surface. And two, it eliminates the need for a trans-Earth injection stage. The third innovation is a launch vehicle optimized for Earth escape. The launch vehicle is a Shuttle Derived Vehicle (SDV) consisting of two solid rocket boosters, a modified external tank, four space shuttle main engines and a large cryogenic upper stage mounted atop the external tank. This vehicle can throw 40 tonnes (40, 000 kg) onto a trans-Mars trajectory, which is about the same capability as Saturn- 5. Using two such launches, a four person mission can be carried out every twenty-six months with minimal impact on shared Shuttle launch facilities at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The same launch vehicle, habitat, and upper stage of the ERV can also be used to perform Lunar missions.

40|$|A BNTEP {{system is}} a dual <b>propellant,</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{propulsion}} concept that utilizes Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Rocket (BNTR) propulsion during high thrust operations, providing 10 's of kilo-Newtons of thrust per engine at a high specific impulse (Isp) of 900 s, and an Electric Propulsion (EP) system during low thrust operations at even higher Isp of around 3000 s. Electrical power for the EP system {{is provided by the}} BNTR engines in combination with a Brayton Power Conversion (BPC) closed loop system, which can provide electrical power on the order of 100 's of kWe. High thrust BNTR operation uses liquid hydrogen (LH 2) as reactor coolant propellant expelled out a nozzle, while low thrust EP uses high pressure xenon expelled by an electric grid. By utilizing an optimized combination of low and high thrust propulsion, significant mass savings over a conventional NTR vehicle can be realized. Low thrust mission events, such as midcourse corrections (MCC), tank settling burns, some reaction control system (RCS) burns, and even a small portion {{at the end of the}} departure burn can be performed with EP. Crewed and robotic deep space missions to a near Earth asteroid (NEA) are best suited for this hybrid propulsion approach. For these mission scenarios, the Earth return V is typically small enough that EP alone is sufficient.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the hybrid {{propulsion}} has been considering as a viable alternative of chemical energy conversion stored in propellants into kinetic energy. This energy is applied in propulsive systems of manned platforms, maneuvering procedures {{and even in the}} repositioning process of micro satellites. It presents attractive features and good balance between performance and environmental impact. Paraffin based grains are the hybrid solid fuels appointed as polymeric fuel substitute. The liquid layer formed on the burning surface ensures high regression rate when driven into the flame front. Paraffin grains allow raw material recovery and reduce the risk of explosion in the presence of erosive burning. The structure of the grain and the control of the liquefying burning surface layer depend on the additives concentration, such as carbon black, which are added to the fuel matrix during the production process. In the solid propellant paraffin based grain a cylindrical center port developed during the centrifugation tends to concentrate carbon black in the outer region of the grain. The influence of carbon black distribution and hardness gradient in paraffin based grain were evaluated in this work. Despite being a well-known material, scarce data on the relation of activation energy (Ea) of paraffin is available. In this work, the kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) of microcrystalline 140 / 1450 F paraffin have been raised through Thermo Gravimetric Analysis in conjunction with the Arrhenius kinetic mechanism, according to ASTM-E 1461. The analysis indicated that the microcrystalline 140 / 1450 F paraffin presents activation energy of 242 kJ. mol- 1 and pre-exponential factor from 1. 42 x 1020 min- 1 to 2. 90 x 1025 min- 1. Ignition was achieved with a 50 W pyrotechnic igniter. Firing tests with 140 / 1450 F paraffin as solid fuel and gaseous oxygen (GOX) as oxidizer were carry on at pressure above 3. 8 MPa. The study suggests that multiple thin layers grain may generate burning surfaces with hardness and carbon black concentration almost constant. In this work combustion instability presented by rocket engine was calculated applying the frequency and boundary layer delay time relationship as proposed by Karabeyoglu. The frequency instability up to was evaluated using LabVIEW data acquisition system. In hybrid propulsion the carbon black has been playing {{a key role in the}} gas production process on the burning surface, the contribution of carbon black in the combustion instability suppression of hybrid propulsion system with paraffin-based propellant was evaluated.

40|$|The safe, {{affordable}} and effective transfer of ever-larger payloads and eventually personnel beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) {{is a major}} challenge facing future commercial development and human exploration of space. Without reusable systems, sustained exploration or large scale development beyond LEO appears to be economically non-viable. However, reusable systems must be capable of both good fuel efficiency and "high utilization of capacity", or else economic costs will remain unacceptably high. Various options exist that can provide high fuel efficiency - for example, Solar Electric Propulsion Systems (SEPS) - but only {{at the cost of}} low thrust and concomitant long transit times. Chemical propulsion systems offer the potential for high thrust and short transit times - including both cryogenic and non-cryogenic options - but only at the cost of relatively low specific impulse (Isp). Nuclear thermal propulsion systems offer relatively good thrust-to-weight and Isp - but involve public concerns that may be insurmountable for all except the most-critical of public purposes. Fixed infrastructures have been suggested as one approach to solving this challenge; for example, rotating tether approaches. However, these systems tend to suffer from high initial costs or unacceptable operational constraints. A new concept has been identified - the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Propellant</b> Module (HPM) - that integrates the best features of both chemical and solar electric transportation architectures. The HPM approach appears to hold promise of solving the issues associated with other approaches, opening a new family of capabilities for future space exploration and development of near-Earth space and beyond. This paper provides a summary overview of the challenge of Earth neighborhood transportation and discusses how various systems concepts might be applied {{to meet the needs of}} these architectures. The paper describes a new approach, the HPM, and illustrates the application of the concept for a typical mission concept. The paper concludes with a discussion of needed technologies and a possible timeline for the development and evolution of this class of systems concepts...|$|E
40|$|Access {{to space}} {{is now more}} {{important}} than ever. For the last few years, smaller and smaller satellites are acquiring the capacity {{to do what was}} previously only possible with large platforms. Currently, most small countries can build a small satellite, but most cannot afford to launch one by themselves. Air launching rocket vehicles has been touted as a possible solution to reduce the cost of both the launch vehicle and its operation, especially for the launch of small payloads. Most research in the field looks into solid rockets, here, however, hybrids are investigated. Hybrid rocket vehicles work by burning solid fuel with liquid oxidizer. Unlike solid rockets, hybrids can be re-ignited, are safer, and have a potentially higher orbital injection accuracy and specific impulse. To study the feasibility and performance of such a solution, a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization tool was used. The tool is an improvement upon a previous software package that only supported solid rocket technology. It addresses trajectory computation, estimation of vehicle dimensions and propulsion performance and launch simulation. The tool was developed in C++, and is now capable of handling multi-stage solid-only rockets, hybrid-only rockets and mixed configurations. It consists of performance and dimension estimators for individual rocket stages, these are integrated into a launch vehicle whose launch is simulated and analysed. The tool has been used to optimize the configuration of a rocket vehicle designed to attain a circular orbit (eccentricity < 0. 01) at 780 km altitude. By iterating on the design using an optimization process known as Particle Swarm Optimization, it attempts to reduce the take-off weight of its solutions. The tests allow one to compare <b>hybrid</b> <b>propellant</b> rockets to solid ones in both air and ground launched scenarios. Based on the assumptions made, it was found that air-launch reduces GTOW by about 70 % when compared to an equivalent ground launch. It is also found that, in general, hybrid rockets have a GTOW similar to, or higher than, their solid counterparts. The research also tackles whether mixed configurations (with both solid and hybrid stages) allow one technology to strengthen the other. Results are also shown on the launch performance of existing engines, to both validate the models and offer insight to manufacturers into how their vehicles will perform once launched.
