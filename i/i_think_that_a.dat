2500|$|Three years later, {{at the age}} of 22, LaMarche moved {{straight}} to Los Angeles to further his stand-up career. This move, LaMarche says, would always be something he regretted doing instead of moving to New York: [...] "... in retrospect, I thought it was a mistake. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> couple of years in New York would have made me a stronger comedian." ...|$|E
2500|$|It's [...] {{different}} from 30 years ago. There's no rebellion left. Everyone {{is just a}} passive zombie. Food supply {{has something to do}} with its – dumbed down everyone to obese, lethargic corpses ... People are worn down ... It's a fragmented society. People have access now to amazing amounts of information, but their attention spans are getting shorter, their focus is gone. Instant gratification. Instant knowledge orgasm! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lot of the great thinkers couldn't achieve what they did through a computer.|$|E
2500|$|James S. Ketchum, {{a retired}} psychiatrist, {{veteran of the}} former U.S. {{chemical}} warfare program, and advocate of chemical warfare, believes that people who fear chemical agents more than bullets and bombs are irrational. He cited the Russian government actions approvingly: [...] "It’s been looked at by some skeptics {{as a kind of}} tragedy...They say, ‘Look, a hundred and thirty people died.’ Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> hundred and thirty is better than eight hundred, and it’s also better, as a secondary consideration, not to have to blow up a beautiful theatre." ...|$|E
5000|$|Grant's {{critics have}} {{accused her of}} [...] "going commercial." [...] Grant refutes such claims, arguing that if fashion {{products}} are produced with a [...] "certain finesse that represents Haida culture and Canada, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>a</b> sell-out. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>a</b> positive step toward creating an employment for Native people and a national identity." ...|$|R

2500|$|When Lucas {{drafted the}} script for The Phantom Menace, he envisioned a [...] "link between Padmé and Princess Leia, the {{daughter}} who follows so closely in her footsteps." [...] According to Natalie Portman, [...] "It definitely did come into play how strong and smart a character Carrie Fisher portrayed, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of that is}} passed on from parent to child. I think George wrote Amidala as a strong, smart character, but it helped to know that I had this great woman before me who had portrayed her character as a fiery woman." [...] Paul McDonald notes that there are [...] "inevitable comparisons" [...] between the two characters: [...] "both develop soft spots for rogue pilots, and both have a knack for slipping into and out of stilted British accents." [...] Despite being diplomats, each is also the best marksman of her respective trilogy, rarely missing.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was noted}} that Mayor Koch held steadfast in {{his support of}} Ward. [...] Although Koch said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the {{videotape}} of the police response, {{as he had done}} in the past he refused to utter a negative word about Ward. [...] "The day <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> commissioner, including a police commissioner, isn't as good as he should be to run whatever he's running, that's the day I will ask him to submit his resignation," [...] said Koch. [...] "I think Ben Ward will go down {{as one of the greatest}} police commissioners this city has ever had. Bob McGuire is the other, and I appointed both of them." [...] However, Koch's support eroded as evidence mounted that municipal disorganization and a lack of police leadership that night likely sparked the riots. [...] "The film that I saw causes me to believe that there may have been an overreaction. I was not happy with what I saw on film. [...] Those films were disturbing to me, and I think they disturbed Ben Ward as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2014, the Las Vegas Sun {{featured}} {{an article}} about the adult industry's possible relocation from Southern California to Las Vegas. According to commentary by AVN magazine's political analyst Mark Kernes, the author of the Sun article, Andrea Domanick, [...] "manages to make a few good points—and snags some quotes from Kink.com CEO Peter Acworth". In the article Acworth is quoted as saying, [...] "Vegas is looking more and more attractive as time goes by... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lot of companies are doing what we’re doing. They’re setting up satellite offices and getting their feet wet with Vegas as a potential place to shoot. The move is happening, but quietly. They don’t want a target on their back." [...] Acworth had announced several weeks earlier that he was shopping for office/production space in Las Vegas. The article also mentions the ease of production relative to California by stating that Nevada requires film permits only for specific locations and conditions. It states, [...] "Shooting on private property, frequently the choice of porn producers, requires no permit or notification, and the state has no explicit regulations about condom use." [...] The article also quotes a technician with knowledge of the mainstream film industry in Southern California and Nevada. Jim Reid of JR Lighting, one of Nevada's largest production rental companies stated, [...] "A lot of people I know in the mainstream industry started out in the adult industry in California. It’s a very good training ground." ...|$|E
5000|$|Howard Schmidt, an American {{cybersecurity}} expert, {{argued in}} March 2010 that [...] "there is no cyberwar... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is <b>a</b> terrible metaphor and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is <b>a</b> terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Marriage {{should be}} a man and <b>a</b> woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>a</b> good {{way to deal with}} it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be <b>a</b> good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{basically}} {{would set}} up a liability structure about who is liable for climate change...And while <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>a</b> very important question for people to answer, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> the world is ready for that yet." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> Dahlia {{makes such}} a great {{character}} because she's very action-oriented, she's very physical and she's very visual...
