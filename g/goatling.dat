40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the thermal gradients of Anglo nubian <b>goatling</b> fed artificially and maintained under the same environmental conditions in semiarid. Were used 22 <b>goatling</b> aged 90 days and in this experiment a completely randomized design was used. The rectal temperature, respiratory rate and the surface temperature of the animals were measured. The thermal characterization of the environment was realized, through the Black Globe Temperature Humidity Index. The thermal gradients were evaluated by the difference between the rectal temperature and surface temperature (TRTS) and the difference between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature (TSTA). The values found for the Black Globe Temperature Humidity Index were 79. 37 °C and for the thermal gradients were 3. 6 °C and 5. 3 °C for TRTS and TSTA respectively. The Anglo-nubian <b>goatling</b> showed good adaptability to semi-arid region...|$|E
