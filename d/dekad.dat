40|$|International audience—The NRT {{algorithm}} for near-real time {{estimation of}} global LAI, FAPAR, and FCOVER variables from SPOT/ VEGETATION (VGT) satellite data is described here. It {{consists of three}} steps: 1) neural networks (NNT) (one for each variable) to provide instantaneous estimates from daily VGT-P reflectances; 2) a multistep filtering approach to eliminate data mainly affected by atmospheric effects and snow cover; and 3) Savitzky–Golay and climatology temporal smoothing and gap filling techniques to ensure consistency and continuity as well as short-term projection of the product dynamics. Performances of NRT estimates were evaluated by comparing with other products over the 2005 – 2008 period: 1) the offline estimates from {{the application of the}} algorithm over historical time series (HIST); 2) the geoland 2 version 1 products also issued from VGT (GEOV 1 /VGT); and 3) ground data. NRT rapidly converges closely to the HIST processing after six <b>dekads</b> (10 -day period) with major improvement after two <b>dekads.</b> Successive reprocessing will, therefore, correct for some instabilities observed in the presence of noisy and missing data. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between NRT and HIST LAI is lower than 0. 4 in all cases. It shows a rapid exponential decay with the number of observations in the composition window with convergence when 30 observations are available. NRT products are in good agreement with ground data (RMSE of 0. 69 for LAI, 0. 09 for FAPAR, and 0. 14 for FCOVER) and consistent with GEOV 1 /VGT products with a significant improvement in terms of continuity (only 1 % of missing data) and smoothness, especially at high latitudes, and Equatorial areas...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the onset and cessation dates of {{the rainy season}} over Ghana using rain gauge data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) over the period of 1970 – 2012. The onset and cessation dates were determined from cumulative curves using the number of rainy days and rainfall amount. In addition, the inter-annual variability of the onset and cessation dates for each climatic zone was assessed using wavelet analysis. A clear distinction between the rainfall characteristics {{and the length of}} the rainy season in the various climatic zones is discussed. The forest and coastal zones in the south had their rainfall onset from the second and third dekads of March. The onset dates of the transition zone were from the second <b>dekad</b> of March to the third <b>dekad</b> of April. Late onset, which starts from the second <b>dekad</b> of April to the first <b>dekad</b> of May, was associated with the savannah zone. The rainfall cessation dates in the forest zone were in the third <b>dekad</b> of October to the first <b>dekad</b> of November, and the length of the rainy season was within 225 – 240 days. The cessation dates of the coastal zone were within the second and third <b>dekad</b> of October, and the length of rainy season was within 210 – 220 days. Furthermore, the transition zone had cessation dates in the second to third <b>dekad</b> of October, and the length of the rainy season was within 170 – 225 days. Lastly, the savannah zone had cessation dates within the third <b>dekad</b> of September to the first <b>dekad</b> of October, and the length of rainy season was within 140 – 180 days. The bias in the rainfall onset, cessation and length of the rainy season was less than 10 days across the entire country, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was in the range of 5 – 25 days. These findings demonstrate that the onset derived from the cumulative rainfall amount and the rainy days are in consistent agreement. The wavelet power spectrum and its significant peaks showed evidence of variability in the rainfall onset and cessation dates across the country. The coastal and forest zones showed 2 – 8 - and 2 – 4 -year band variability in the onsets and cessations, whereas the onset and cessation variability of the transition and savannah zones were within 2 – 4 and 4 – 8 years. This result has adverse effects on rain-fed agricultural practices, disease control, water resource management, socio-economic activities and food security in Ghana...|$|E

40|$|After 15 {{years of}} {{operational}} service, the VGT instrument has reached its end-of-life in May 2014. Before this date, the PROBA-V satellite (PV) {{was launched in}} May 2013 by ESA, as a “gap filler”, i. e., between the SPOT VGT and the future Sentinel 3 satellite, foreseen to be launched in mid- 2015. In order to evaluate the quality and usability for operational crop monitoring of the new PV satellite NDVI data we compared it to other moderate to low spatial resolution instruments. The analysis has been performed over the Horn of Africa using TAMSAT rainfall estimates and NDVI from METOP and MODIS instruments as term of comparison. We found large disagreement (up to more than 40 % according to the proposed classification scheme) between NDVI anomaly derived from PV the one hand, and METOP or eMODIS on the other hand. The disagreement between METOP and eMODIS is lower and normally within 30 %. The analysis also shows that in case of disagreement, the difference between paired anomalies is biased when PV is compared {{with one of the}} other two sensors. That is, when PV and one of the two sensors do not agree on the sign of the anomaly, it is PV indicating a positive anomaly and the other sensor a negative one in 80 % of the cases. Visual inspection of anomalies support these findings and highlight the fact that this agreement has indeed operational implications. That is, PV appears to deliver a contrasting information regarding vegetation status as compared to METOP and eMODIS, especially in some specific <b>dekads</b> (e. g., <b>dekads</b> 25 to 28). Performing the same comparison for the year 2013 when NDVI data were provided by VGT instead of PV, we confirm that major differences among the three sensors were not present and we corroborate the hypothesis that the cause of the problem is related to the use of PV NRT data with VGT LTA data to compute the anomalies. Finally, rainfall estimates time series of 2014 were used as an additional and qualitative check for the observed differences. The visual inspection of rainfall anomalies suggests that the anomalies shown by PV are generally too positive while METOP and eMODIS are showing a better convergence with the rainfall estimates. The results of this preliminary comparison call for further analysis to understand the cause of the observed seasonality of the agreement between the PV anomalies and those of other comparable sensors (METOP and eMODIS). Also it is not known at the moment whether this situation is specific for the East African window or if similar patterns can also be observed in other regions of the world. JRC.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{developed for}} the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) sensor {{makes it possible to}} detect temporary small water bodies in arid and semi-arid areas by analysing the spectral contrast of each pixel compared to its neighbourhood. This algorithm captures surface water and humid areas, the last category being likely to include vegetation. These maps are generated every 10 days allowing to monitor the small temporary water bodies and humid area seasonality. In addition, a reference map of the temporary water bodies was prepared by validating the historical record of the small water body detection. The procedure consists in checking individually any SPOT VGT water bodies detection that lasted for more than 3 consecutive <b>dekads</b> between 1999 and late 2004. The validation has been done over Western Africa. Several sources of information have been used to validate the detections: the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), the Drainage Network of the Digital Chart of the World, Spot VGT colour composite images, the SRTM digital elevation model, Landsat quicklook images and Google Earth. Pixels of the history of occurrence that were not referenced in the GLWD or DCW database have been checked manually. This validation process resulted in a map of three categories: validated water bodies, positive vegetation anomaly with no obvious sign of water but indicating water availability in arid areas and false detections.

40|$|Remote-sensing-based drought {{monitoring}} methods provide {{fast and}} useful information for a sustainable management strategy of drought impact over a region. Common pixel-based monitoring methods {{are limited in}} the analysis of the dynamics of this impact at regional scale. For instance, these hardly allow us to quantify the movement of drought in space and time and to compare drought with rainfall deficits without losing the variability of these events within a region. This study proposed an object-based approach that allowed us to visualize and quantify the spatio-temporal movement of drought impact on vegetation, called vegetative drought, in a region. The GIS software Dynomap was used to extract and track objects. Measures of distance and angle were used for determining the speed and direction of vegetative drought and rainfall deficit objects, calculated from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) normalized difference vegetation index and rainfall estimates data. The methods were applied to the two rainy seasons during the drought year 1999 in East Africa. Results showed that vegetative drought objects moved into the southwestern direction at an average angle of[*]− 138. 5 ° during the first season and[*]− 144. 5 ° during the second season. The speed of objects varied between 38 km dekad− 1 and 185 km dekad− 1 during the first season and between 33 km dekad− 1 and 144 km dekad− 1 during the second season, reflecting the rate of spread between <b>dekads.</b> Vegetative drought objects close to rainfall deficit objects showed similar trajectories and sometimes regions overlapped. This indicated that the two events are related. We conclude that a spatiotemporal relationship existed between the two types of events and that this could be quantified...|$|R

In this study, frost (0 °C threshold) probabilities within different growing periods starting from the first <b>dekad</b> of October to the third <b>dekad</b> of February for a 100 -day, 120 -day, and 140 -day crop were determined. The data used in the investigation was daily minimum temperature obtained from 55 weather stations located in and around the Free State Province with data from 1950 to 2010. The results show high spatial and temporal variability of frost within the different growing periods. The western, central, northern, and northwestern parts of the province have the longest planting window for all the growing lengths from mid-October to mid-January.

40|$|Temperature {{is one of}} the {{important}} environmental parameters that determines the development of a crop from one stage to another. It is integral in the calculation of heat units. In this study, the thermal index concept is used to determine the length of the growing period of short season, medium season, and medium-late season maize crop varieties for different sowing dates (1 st <b>dekad</b> of October to 1 st <b>dekad</b> of January). The results show high spatiotemporal variation in the median growing period for all three maize varieties. The length of the growing period for the short, medium, and medium-late season varieties is relatively short during October to early December with values in some areas of less than 100, 120, and 120 days, respectively. The duration of the planting period increases exponentially in most places starting from the 2 nd <b>dekad</b> of November to 2 nd <b>dekad</b> of December, depending on the region and crop variety. Long growing periods are likely to align maize growing period with dates of high frost risk and water shortages.

40|$|Understanding {{variations}} in rainfall in tropical regions is important {{due to its}} impacts on water resources, health and agriculture. This study assessed the dekadal rainfall patterns and rain days to determine intra-seasonal rainfall variability during the March–May season using the Mann–Kendall (M K) trend test and simple linear regression (S L R) over the period 2000 – 2015. Results showed an increasing trend of both dekadal rainfall amount and rain days (third and seventh dekads). The light rain days (S L R = 0. 181; M K = 0. 350) and wet days (S L R = 0. 092; M K = 0. 118) also depict an increasing trend. The rate of increase of light rain days and wet days during the third <b>dekad</b> (light rain days: S L R = 0. 020; M K = 0. 279 and wet days: S L R = 0. 146; M K = 0. 376) was slightly greater than during the seventh <b>dekad</b> (light rain days: S L R = 0. 014; M K = 0. 018 and wet days: S L R = 0. 061; M K = 0. 315) <b>dekad.</b> Seventy-four percent accounted for 2 – 4 consecutive dry days, but no significant trend was detected.

40|$|The {{potential}} of using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the AgroMetShell (AMS) to forecast and estimate maize yield at Rural Development Project (RDP) level in Malawi was investigated. NDVI {{is derived from}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series of polar-orbiting satellites. AMS is a soil water balance water balance modeling software that produces a number of output parameters (potential yield predictors) {{that can be used to}} develop regression models for yield estimation and or forecasting. Using climatic, NDVI and yield data for the years 1983 to 2004, NDVI parameters were correlated with rainfall and yield to establish NDVI-rainfall and NDVI-yield relationships. NDVI parameters tested include cumulative, seasonal maximum, seasonal averages, dekadal and monthly increments, and dekadal and monthly values. Overall, most of the NDVI parameters tested gave little or no correlation with maize yield in most RDPs. Dekadal and monthly NDVI values were found to be positively and significantly correlated with maize yield especially towards the end of the growing season (March and April) for a number of RDPs. Regression equations were developed for only eight of the thirty RDPs in which high correlations were observed for consecutive <b>dekads.</b> There was no consistency in the RDPs giving high correlation from one NDVI parameter to the other. Between the hybrid and local maize varieties no variety took precedence over the others in giving higher correlations. For the few regression models developed, the coefficients of determination (r 2) ranged from 0. 23 to 0. 54. AMS output parameters were correlated then regressed with maize yield at RDP level. Similar combinations of parameters were used for all the RDPs in a particular agroclimatological zone. Soil water deficit and actual evapotranspiration during the reproductive phases were identified to be critical in yield determination for most areas. RDPs with high values of r 2 were distributed across the country but the Lakeshore and Shire Valley areas had most of the RDPs giving significant r 2 values. The 1983 / 84 to 2001 / 02 seasons were used to develop regression models for maize yield estimation and forecasting. Hybrid maize regression models gave higher r 2 than the local maize models. r 2 values for AMS parameters and maize yield ranged between 0. 08 and 0. 82. For hybrid maize variety, 19 out of 30 RDPs gave r 2 > 0. 40 while for the local variety, 15 out of 30 RDPs realized r 2 > 0. 40. The standard errors for the regression models were higher for the hybrid than for the local variety. The models were tested with data from the same seasons used to develop them. In most RDPs the models simulated the yield well. Models were also tested with independent data (for 2002 / 03 season). In the majority of the RDPs tested, the errors of prediction fell within the standard error bands. For the eight RDPs where regressions were done for both approaches, generally the AMS-developed yield models gave higher r 2 values compared to the NDVI-developed models. The AMS approach can be recommended for yield estimation and prediction in Malawi, while the NDVI approach needs further refinement before it can be implemented on an operation level...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Wheat {{producers}} in the South Western Cape (SWC) of South Africa need to cope with biophysical and socio-economic systems exposing farmers to a multidimensional decision- making environment. The rain fed wheat production in the Swartland region is highly susceptible to the interannual variability of winter rainfall. Producers, therefore, need relevant climatic information to identify ways to improve profitability and to make sound economic decisions. Seasonal forecasting {{has the potential to}} provide wheat producers with invaluable information regarding the climatic conditions. However, due to the complex nature of the atmospheric dynamics associated with winter rainfall in South Africa, seasonal forecasting models have been found to have very little skill in predicting the variability of winter rainfall. Such a shortfall has created a gap for which this study has attempted to bridge. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between wheat-specific rainfall characteristics, large-scale modes of climate variability and wheat yields in the Swartland region to assess whether these relationships could provide useful climatic information to the wheat farmers. Six wheat-specific rainfall characteristics (total rainfall; number of wet days; number of ‘good’ rainfall events; number of heavy rainfall events; percentage ‘good’ rainfall; and the number of dry <b>dekads)</b> on various time scales (winter; seasonal; monthly and dekadal) were correlated against wheat yield records over a 17 year period from 1994 to 2010. From this analysis, the distribution and timing of the rainfall throughout the wheat growing season (April to September) emerged as an important determinant of wheat yield. An accurate statistical wheat prediction model was created using farmer stipulated rainfall- wheat yield thresholds. Three teleconnections (El Niño-Southern Oscillation [ENSO], Antarctic Oscillation [AAO] and South Atlantic sea surface temperatures [SSTs]) represented by eight climate indices (Nino 3. 4 Index, Ocean Nino Index [ONI], Southern Oscillation Index [SOI], AAO index, Southern Annular Mode Index [SAM], South Atlantic Dipole Index [SADI], South Western Atlantic SST Index [SWAI] and South Central Atlantic SST Index [SCAI]), were correlated against wheat yield data over a 17 year period from 1994 to 2010. The relationships between the three teleconnections and wheat yield in the Swartland were established. Teleconnection-wheat yield correlations were found to be limited, with regards to the application of this information to farmers, {{due to the lack of}} a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of how the three teleconnections influence the local climate and, therefore, the wheat yield in the Swartland. The eight climate indices, representing the three teleconnections, were correlated against the six wheat-specific rainfall characteristic indices from each of the three study areas over the period from 1980 to 2012. The state of ENSO during the first half of the year was shown to be correlated with rainfall characteristics during both the first (April to July) and second (July to September) halves of the wheat growing season; however, these correlations differ ed in their sign. Correlations suggested a negative phase of AAO was associated with above normal rainfall throughout the year across the Swartland region. Sea surface temperatures in the central South Atlantic during March to October showed significant negative correlations with rainfall during the latter half of the wheat growing season (July to October) across the Swartland region. This study presented evidence supporting the plausibility and validity for the use of the state of large-scale modes of variability in the prediction of wheat-specific rainfall characteristics and aggregated yields in the Swartland region. This has the potential to provide useful information to wheat farmers in the Swartland to aid in their decision making proces...|$|R

Data from 1999 - 2015 for three representative wheat-growing sites in Luxembourg were used to develop a threshold-based weather model for predicting wheat stripe rust. First, the range of favorable weather conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation method based on the Dennis model were characterized. Then, the optimum combined favorable weather variables (air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall) during the most critical infection period (May-June) was identified and was used to develop the model. Uninterrupted hours with such favorable weather conditions over each <b>dekad</b> (i. e., 10 -day period) during May-June were also considered when building the model. Results showed {{that a combination of}} relative humidity > 92 % and 4 °C < temperature < 16 °C for a minimum of 4 continuous hours, associated with rainfall ≤ 0. 1 mm (with the <b>dekad</b> having these conditions for 5 - 20 % of the time), were optimum {{to the development of a}} wheat stripe rust epidemic.

The GIS-based CSWB model was developed for three different resolutions: agro-ecological zone (AEZ) polygons; 7. 6 -kilometer pixels; and 1. 1 -kilometer pixels. The model was validated by comparing model production estimates from archived satellite and agro-meteorological data to historical district maize production reports from two Kenya government agencies, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and the Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing (DRSRS). For the AEZ analysis, comparison of model district maize production results and district maize production estimates from the MoA (1989 - 1997) and the DRSRS (1989 - 1993) revealed correlation coefficients of 0. 94 and 0. 93, respectively. The comparison for the 7. 6 -kilometer analysis showed correlation coefficients of 0. 95 and 0. 94, respectively. Comparison of results from the 1. 1 -kilometer model with district maize production data from the MoA (1993 - 1997) gave a correlation coefficient of 0. 94. These results indicate the 7. 6 -kilometer pixel-by-pixel analysis is the most favorable method. Recommendations to improve the model are finer resolution images for area planted, soil moisture storage, and RFE maps; and measuring the actual length of growing season from a satellite-derived Growing Degree Day product...|$|E
40|$|Yield {{forecasts}} {{for summer}} crops at EU- 28 level remain low and {{are comparable to}} last month’s forecast. September was warmer than usual in northern, eastern and south-eastern Europe and colder than usual in western Europe. October has generally been colder than usual so far, especially during the second <b>dekad,</b> when negative minimum temperatures occurred {{in many areas of}} central and eastern Europe. Wetterthan- usual conditions were recorded in south-eastern Europe, south-eastern France, central and southern Italy, northern Germany and several parts of northern Europe. Large areas in south-eastern Europe faced a period of abundant rains slowing down the harvesting activities of maize and sunflower and hampering the sowing of winter crops. Dry conditions have persisted in Poland, Lithuania, western Ukraine and southern Russia. In these regions, the winter crops sown in September germinated under unfavourable conditions which further worsened due to the low temperatures that occurred in October. The sowing of winter cereals has progressed without major problems in the EU’s largest producing states, France, Germany and the UK. JRC. H. 4 -Monitoring Agricultural Resource...|$|E
40|$|TOTAL CEREAL PRODUCTION LOWER THAN FIVE‑YEAR AVERAGE FOR EU- 27 BUT GOOD PROSPECTS FOR SUMMER CROPS Highlight The last <b>dekad</b> of July and {{the first}} <b>dekad</b> of August {{continued}} to be cooler than average in western and central Europe. Most of the European countries (France, Benelux, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Finland, the Baltic States, Ukraine and Romania) showed average temperature accumulation in August. As very high temperatures persisted in the Mediterranean region and around the Adriatic Sea from mid‑August onwards, the sum of active temperatures was above the long‑term average (LTA) in Italy and Slovenia, on the Dalmatian coast and in Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and eastern Spain (by > 10 %). Summer continued into September, pushing accumulated temperatures well above the average in Italy and the Balkans, with maximum temperatures above 30 degrees. Towards the end of July and {{until the beginning of}} August rain fell predominantly in central Europe. In the major agricultural areas these weather conditions increased soil moisture and created a large surplus in the climatic water balance. Rain continued to be plentiful in areas around the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, moving accumulated values into surplus for the month of August. Access to fields for harvesting was hampered and held up by spells of abundant precipitation. Scarce precipitation was recorded around the Mediterranean Sea, in the Black Sea region and the area between the Black Sea and the Adriatic, where the weather favoured harvesting activities. Total wheat production is estimated at 135. 36 Mt, less than in 2010 (- 2. 9 %) but still 0. 5 % higher than the five‑year average. The fall in production since the last forecast in August is - 0. 8 %, reflecting mainly the reduced acreage since the last report (- 0. 8 %). Total barley production is also down since the last forecast by - 3. 4 % and is now estimated at 51. 88 Mt (- 2. 8 % vs 2010 and - 11. 6 % vs the five‑year average). This {{is the result of the}} acreage reduction (mainly for winter barley: - 7. 9 % vs 2010, spring barley being stable at + 0. 3 %). The grain maize yield forecast at EU- 27 level has been revised downwards since the end of August by - 0. 4 %. Production is estimated at 61. 20 Mt, which is still + 5. 3 % higher than in 2010. For summer crops, production is estimated to be higher than in 2010 for sugar beet, potato and sunflower. The yield forecasts for those three crops are higher than in 2010 and even much higher than the five‑year average. JRC. H. 4 -Monitoring agricultural resource...|$|E
40|$|African {{societies}} {{are dependent on}} rainfall for agricultural and other water-dependent activities, yet rainfall is extremely variable in both space and time and reoccurring water shocks, such as drought, can have considerable social and economic impacts. To help improve {{our knowledge of the}} rainfall climate, we have constructed a 30 -year (1983 – 2012), temporally consistent rainfall dataset for Africa known as TARCAT (TAMSAT African Rainfall Climatology And Time-series) using archived Meteosat thermal infra-red (TIR) imagery, calibrated against rain gauge records collated from numerous African agencies. TARCAT has been produced at 10 -day (<b>dekad)</b> scale at a spatial resolution of 0. 0375 °. An intercomparison of TARCAT from 1983 to 2010 with six long-term precipitation datasets indicates that TARCAT replicates the spatial and seasonal rainfall patterns and interannual variability well, with correlation coefficients of 0. 85 and 0. 70 with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) gridded-gauge analyses respectively in the interannual variability of the Africa-wide mean monthly rainfall. The design of the algorithm for drought monitoring leads to TARCAT underestimating the Africa-wide mean annual rainfall on average by − 0. 37 [*]mm[*]day− 1 (21 %) compared to other datasets. As the TARCAT rainfall estimates are historically calibrated across large climatically homogeneous regions, the data can provide users with robust estimates of climate related risk, even in regions where gauge records are inconsistent in time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost African {{countries}} {{struggle with}} food production and food security. These issues {{are expected to}} be even more severe in the face of climate change. Our study examines the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture with a view to propose adaptation options, especially in hard hit regions. We use a crop model to evaluate the impact of various sowing decisions on the water satisfaction index (WSI) and thus the yield of maize crop. The crop model is run for 176 stations over southern Africa, subject to climate scenarios downscaled from 6 GCMs. The sensitivity of these simulations is analysed so as to distinguish the contributions of sowing decisions to yield variation. We compare the WSI change between a 20 year control period (1979 - 1999) and a 20 year future period (2046 - 2065) over southern Africa. These results highlight areas that will likely be negatively affected by climate change over the study region. We then calculate the contribution of sowing decisions to yield variation, first for the control period, then for the future period. This contribution (sensitivity) allows us to distinguish the efficiency of adaptation decisions under both present and future climate. In most countries rainfall in the sowing <b>dekad</b> is shown to contribute more significantly to the yield variation and appears as a long term efficient decision to adapt. We discuss these results and additional perspectives in order to propose local adaptation directions...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to test the}} validity of an FAO method for monitoring and forecasting sorghum yield in three main sorghum production areas of the mechanized rain-fed sub-sector; namely, Al-Gadarif, Al-Damazin and Kosti. The periods of crop development were determined from the plots of mean normal (30 years) rainfall (Pn) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) versus 10 -days interval (<b>dekad)</b> during the growing season. Annual water satisfaction (SI) indices were estimated for 10 years from annual water balance for the study period (1987 - 1996). This index indicates {{the extent to which}} the water requirement of the crop was satisfied in cumulative way. Highly significant cubic relationships between Pn or PET and seasonal dekads were obtained. The growing season of Al-Gadarif was semi-normal and that of Al-Damazin was typically normal, whereas that of Kosti was characterized by the absence of a wet period. An example for the calculation of SI for sorghum grown in 1987 in each of the three study areas was presented and analyzed. The correlations between sorghum yield and seasonal rainfall was highly significant (r 2 = 0. 747) and linear in Al-Damazin area and significant (r 2 = 0. 514) and cubic in Al-Gadarif area. The relationship was not significant in Kosti area. The correlation between yield and SI were significant and cubic for Al-Gadarif (r 2 = 0. 537) and Al-Damazin (r 2 = 0. 439) but not for Kosti. The pooled data gave a significant correlation (r 2 = 0. 127) between yield and SI index. However, the coefficient of determination was very low...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology for simulating rainfall in dekads across {{a set of}} spatial units in areas where long-term meteorological records are available for {{a small number of}} sites only. The work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of Zimbabwe, which includes a crop production component for yields of maize, small grains and groundnuts. Only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records. Preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra-seasonal temporal correlation was negligible, but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations. This spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of 30 related variables, representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30 wards. For each ward, log-transformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation, which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations. A covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards. Sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given <b>dekad.</b> Cross-validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well. The methodology developed is useful in situations where long-term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation, but negligible temporal correlation...|$|E
40|$|Some {{years ago}} the MARS-FOOD group was {{established}} to support the Food Aid and Food Security policies of the European Commission. The activities are aimed at improving methods and information on crop yield prospects. Russia, Central Asia, and non-European Mediterranean countries (MECA region), Eastern Africa (IGAD sub-region) and the MERCOSUR region in South America were selected as pilot areas. Crop growth indicators are produced based on low resolution remote sensing data, global meteorological modelling outputs (ECMWF model) and crop growth simulation models (CGMS and FAO-WSI). Crop yield forecasting is done using predictors selected from the crop growth indicators. Dekadal SPOT-VEGETATION data are used {{as a basis for}} calculation of remote sensing indicators of crop growth. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and results of Dry Matter Production modelling (DMP) applying the Monteith approach (Monteith, 1972) are used as a main source of remote sensing indicators for the MECA region. The indicators are used in aggregated for sub-national administrative unit form applying crop mask. Some indicators are derived for a network of representative points. The current dekadal indicators are compared with previous year dekadal values or with long-term average dekadal data. Additionally relative time mosaics of indicators are used as a tool for crop growth monitoring (Savin, Nègre, 2002). We analyze additionally seasonal cumulative values of indicators by comparing seasonal time profiles. As a result, near 10 remote sensing indicators can be derived for each crop for each <b>dekad</b> of growing season in aggregated form and the same amount for representative points. Crop yield forecasting starts from an attempt to build simple regression equation between statistical crop yield and crop growth indicators. We found that regression with high R...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the tree radial growth response to climate is crucial for dendroclimatological research. However, the response relationships between tree-ring indices and climatic factors at different timescales are not yet clear. In this study, the tree-ring width of Huashan pine (Pinus armandii) from Huashan in the Qinling Mountains, north-central China, was used to explore the response differences of tree growth to climatic factors at daily, pentad (5 days), <b>dekad</b> (10 days) and monthly timescales. Correlation function and linear regression analysis were applied in this paper. The tree-ring width showed a more sensitive response to daily and pentad climatic factors. With the timescale decreasing, the absolute value of the maximum correlation coefficient between the tree-ring data and precipitation increases as well as temperature (mean, minimum and maximum temperature). Compared to the other three timescales, pentad was more suitable for analysing the response of tree growth to climate. Relative to the monthly climate data, the association between the tree-ring data and the pentad climate data was more remarkable and accurate, and the reconstruction function based on the pentad climate was also more reliable and stable. We found that the major climatic factor limiting Huashan pine growth was the precipitation of pentads 20 - 35 (from April 6 to June 24) rather than the well-known April-June precipitation. The pentad was also {{proved to be a}} better timescale for analysing the climate and tree growth in the western and eastern Qinling Mountains. The formation of the earlywood density of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) from Shimenshan in western Qinling was mainly affected by the maximum temperature of pentads 28 - 32 (from May 16 to June 9). The maximum temperature of pentads 28 - 33 (from May 16 to June 14) was the major factor affecting the ring width of Chinese pine from Shirenshan in eastern Qinling...|$|E
40|$|Meso-scale {{catchments}} {{are often}} {{of great interest}} for water resources development and for development interventions aimed at uplifting rural livelihoods. However, in Sub-Saharan Africa IWRM planning in such catchments, and the basins they form part of, are often ungauged or constrained by poor data availability. Regionalisation of a hydrological model presents opportunities for prediction in ungauged basins and catchments. This study regionalises HBVx, derived from the conceptual hydrological model HBV, in the semi-arid Mzingwane Catchment, Limpopo Basin, Zimbabwe. Fifteen meso-catchments were studied, including three that were instrumented during the study. Discriminant analysis showed that the characteristics of catchments in the arid agro-ecological Region V were significantly different from those in semi-arid Region IV. Analysis of flow duration curves statistically separated sub-perennial catchments from (sub-) ephemeral catchments. Regionalised parameter sets for HBVx were derived from means of parameters from the sub-perennial catchments, the (sub-) ephemeral catchments and all catchments. The parameter sets that performed best in the regionalisation are characterised by slow infiltration with moderate/fast “overland flow”. These processes appear more extreme in more degraded catchments. This is points to benefits {{to be derived from}} conservation techniques that increase infiltration rate and from runoff farming. Faster, and possibly greater, sub-surface contribution to streamflow is expected from catchments underlain by granitic rocks. Calibration and regionalisation were more successful at the <b>dekad</b> (10 days) time step than when using daily or monthly data, and for the sub-perennial catchments than the (sub-) ephemeral catchments. However, none of the regionalised parameter sets yielded CNS ⩾ 0. 3 for half of the catchments. The HBVx model thus does offer some assistance to river basin planning in semi-arid basins, particularly for predicting flows in ungauged catchments at longer time steps, such as for water allocation purposes. However, the model is unreliable for more ephemeral and drier catchments. Without more reliable and longer rainfall and runoff data, regionalisation in semi-arid ephemeral catchments will remain highly challengin...|$|E
