40|$|The {{purpose of}} present {{research}} was to analyze the effect of <b>draft,</b> <b>sliver</b> hank and delivery speed {{on the quality of}} cotton yarn using different auto-leveller system at draw frame. Drawing is considered to be the key process in the whole set-up of yarn formation as all efficiency and quality of subsequent process depends upon the behavior of the sliver formed at drawing stage. In present research it is elaborated that during drawing, three factors are more important i. e. break draft, delivery speed and sliver hank. The best quality of yarn is obtained by controlling these factors. Rieter RSBD- 35 is better in performance as compared to Trutzschler HSR- 1000 which is efficient and modern autolevelling system with high speed servo drive motor at Rieter draw frame. The overall results show that moderate break draft, D 2 (1. 3), delivery speed S 2 (700 yards/min) and sliver hank H 2 (60 grain/yards) produced the better results...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on {{modelling}} and control of an important textile engineering process: the textile <b>sliver</b> <b>drafting</b> process. This process {{plays a crucial role}} in textile production chain because low irregularity of <b>drafted</b> <b>sliver</b> is essential for production of high quality yarn. It is shown that this process can be modelled as a nonlinear time delay system with distributed delays. This model is linearized and distributed delays are converted into equivalent lumped delay system. Control system for this process is designed in the last section of this paper using the combined feedforward/feedback internal model control approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Textile <b>sliver</b> <b>drafting</b> {{process has}} decisive {{influence}} on produced yarn quality {{and from the}} system theoretic point of view it is marked by non-linearity, distributed delays and highly oscillatory disturbance response. Similarly as most other textile manufacturing processes, this process has enjoyed almost no attention in control engineering literature. Motivated by current needs of textile manufacturing, the paper introduces a suitable mathematical model of this process and it proposes a control scheme based on internal model control approach. Due {{to the complexity of}} non-linear distributed delay model, the internal model controller is based on approximate rational model. Simulation results are given...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{important}} textile engineering process: the textile <b>sliver</b> <b>drafting</b> process. It is shown {{that this process}} can be modelled as a non-linear time delay system with distributed delays. To convert it into a form more suitable for control purposes, this model is linearized and distributed delays are converted into equivalent lumped delay system. An easy to apply method of distributed delay to lumped delay reduction is outlined as a by-product of this procedure. The main result of the paper {{is a model of}} important process with time delays that has never been described in control engineering literature and that {{can be used as a}} starting point for controller design. Thus, the paper opens a way of time delay systems theory applications to the field of textile engineering...|$|R
