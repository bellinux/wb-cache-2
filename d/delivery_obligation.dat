Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted with non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal residents from 2006 to 2009, I explore the creation of ‘domains’ within this context. These domains are constituted by the separation of residences and places of work through physical barriers such as fences and/or segregation into particular areas of the township. At the same time, such domains are reinforced through social closure; a lack of social interaction between non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal people other than what is necessary to fulfil the service <b>delivery</b> <b>obligation.</b> Thus, despite living in the township, some for many years at a time, non-Aboriginal people are rarely integrated in Aboriginal kinship and remain, in Redmond’s (2005) terms, ‘relative strangers’ rather than ‘strange relatives’...|$|E
40|$|The highly {{seasonal}} Norwegian cod fisheries {{give rise to}} problems downstream in the value chain and the authorities have introduced several schemes to counter the strong incentives for seasonal harvesting. This paper studies how the trawler <b>delivery</b> <b>obligation</b> (TDO) regime influences aspects of the harvesting pattern, focusing on the temporal and geographic distribution of landings. The analysis shows that the trawlers as a group have far less seasonal variations in their cod landings compared to the coastal fleet. While the Norwegian fleet lands about 75 % during the first half-year, the corresponding share for trawlers is about 50 %. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the independent trawlers fished the most off-season; about 57 % of their total landings. Trawlers controlled by vertically integrated firms landed considerably less (about 45 %) and independently owned trawlers with landing obligations fell between these two strategic groups (about 50 %). Vertically integrated vessels have a higher fulfilment of their landing obligations than the independently owned. The differences between the strategic groups are relatively high, at 68 % vs. 38 %. These results indicate that delivery obligations alone are not sufficient to provide control over the geographic distribution.

In February 1950 Pravda published a blanket condemnation of general-purpose zvenya. The main reason given was that the small-scale plots of the `independent' zvenya inhibited the use of machinery. (For the same reason row- and industrial-crop zvenya were acceptable in as far as mechanization was not yet sufficiently developed in these areas.)

Downstream of these dams are endangered fish species, sport fisheries, white water recreation and national parks or monuments. One way of reconciling the conflicts that have surfaced is to use “surplus water” or “water at risk of spill”. Based on forecasts, water is identified beyond what is needed to fill reservoirs, meet water <b>delivery</b> <b>obligations</b> and generate electrical power. This amount of water is then patterned in terms of timing, magnitude and duration to meet downstream environmental needs. Hydrological/operational studies have shown that “water at risk of spill” can meet the biological flow recommendations for endangered fish species for the Gunnison River below Blue Mesa Dam. Moreover, “water at risk of spill” forms the underpinnings of beach and habitat building opportunities below Glen Canyon Dam.

In April 2016, GLC inaugurated the GLC Hub in Singapore, {{which is expected}} to boost cargo volume in Asia-Pacific. However, Smith faces issues further down the supply chain due to problems with road freight vendors. GLC utilises a hub-and-spoke method to transport cargo. Last mile deliveries are typically outsourced to small local transportation providers in the Asia-Pacific region who would complete the delivery by road. These vendors are usually small companies with only a few vehicles.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. This thesis {{investigates the}} {{challenges}} facing local government in South Africa by developing a means of exploring {{to what extent the}} problems of providing basic services currently experienced by municipalities are influenced by the political, administrative and financial configuration of the decentralized system of governance. It is argued here that the design of the intergovernmental governance system does not promote the constitutional objectives of decentralisation. The current system of governance does not empower local government to become more distinctive and autonomous. The problem in many cases is not what to decentralize or whether a basic service should be provided by national, provincial or local government, but rather how to align shared rule or concurrency of the particular service with the various levels of government. One of the key questions posed in this thesis is to what extent the system of decentralized governance in South Africa enables or hinders municipalities. abilities to provide basic services in an autonomous and sustainable manner. It focuses particularly on their authority to make and implement autonomous political, administrative and financial decisions pertaining to the provision of basic services. While this study cannot conclusively report on the impact of decentralisation on basic service delivery in South Africa, it does identify some of the systemic and structural aspects that impact on the manner or way in which local municipalities provide basic services. It raises concerns that the basic service <b>delivery</b> <b>obligations</b> of local municipalities are strenuous and financially challenging, {{and will continue to be}} as long as local municipalities rely on or are controlled by other spheres of government in meeting their constitutional mandate, especially with regard to the intergovernmental transfers of fiscal resources...|$|R

To gain ownership, each producer pays $ 10, 000 per unit of production, which is equal to 10, 000 boxes. Another example is Midwest Elderberry Cooperative, formed in 2012 in response to an economic opportunity as elderberry demand increased and import supply decreased. With member producers in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, {{the primary purpose of the}} cooperative is to facilitate scale economies by managing the regional supply of elderberries for use in wines, juices, and concentrates.

Also, a $ 0.10 share of Class C stock grants the owner the right and the obligation to deliver one pound of elderberries to the cooperative. Associate membership, which lacks voting privileges, is available at $ 100. Arguably the best example is still Mountain States Lamb Cooperative, which served as the impetus for the Wyoming Processing Cooperative Law. At its formation in 2001, the cooperative sold 324, 471 Class A shares at $ 22 each, with each share granting the right and obligation to deliver one market-lamb per year.

40|$|The Rio Grande {{originates}} {{from the}} San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado, and flows year-round south {{through the entire}} length of New Mexico. It has an approximate drainage area of 1. 9 million acres in New Mexico (USGS 1996), and provides habitat for diverse wildlife along the river, including the silvery minnow, an endangered indicator species. The hydrology of the river is characterized by low flow during the winter months, a snow-induced peak in spring/early summer, and smaller peaks in July and August due to the effect of the monsoon season. In the five recent decades, the Rio Grande has experienced near averages as well as extremes similar to the variability of the climate of the last one-thousand years (Papadopulos 2004). Moreover, many climatic models have generated future climate change scenarios associated with altered temperature and precipitation. To estimate future average streamflow of the Rio Grande, the Hydrologic Engineering Center – Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) software was adopted to simulate streamflow for different climate change scenarios for the Rio Grande watershed above Elephant Butte Dam. The historical monthly streamflow, precipitation, and temperature of the tributary areas for the Rio Grande from Del Norte, Colorado, to Elephant Butte, New Mexico were collected to calibrate an HEC-HMS hydrologic model for the period of 1971 - 2000. With the projection for temperature and precipitation associated with future climate change scenarios generated by a climatic General Circulation Model (GCM), the calibrated hydrologic model for the Rio Grande was employed to generate six future climate change hydrographs. The results generated by the calibrated hydrologic model represent the amount of water New Mexico delivers to Texas. The projection of the streamflow under different scenarios of climate change at Elephant Butte outlet were used in conjuction with the projection for the Rio Grande at Otowi bridge to quantify how well New Mexico would meet its obligations to deliver water to Texas under the requirements of the Rio Grande Compact.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Public Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006. Every {{organisation}} {{needs to}} have well-trained and experienced human resources to perform organisational activities. In {{the absence of such}} resources, it is necessary to raise the skills levels and increase the versatility and adaptability of current personnel. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the impact of training and development on service delivery in the City of Cape Town. Chapter one introduced the study and includes the terms of reference, the problem statement, the objectives of the study and the key questions pertaining to the study. As part of the methodology the researcher conducted a pre-testing of the competencies of the experimental group, investigating the extent to which present competencies contributed towards execution of service <b>delivery</b> <b>obligations</b> and the extent to which lack of capacity contributed to lack of service delivery. Chapter two provided information on the evolution of local government training and development in South Africa. The chapter found that there has been a complete democratization of local government structures where the emphasis has been on greater development, particularly in terms of human resource development. Chapter three analysed the Human Resource Development Strategy for staff development in the Western Cape Provincial Administration. Legislation such as the South African Qualifications Authority Act 1996 (SAQA), the Skills Development Act of 1998 and the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999 formed the basis for Human Resource Development Strategy in the Western Cape Province particularly the in City of Cape Town. Chapter four put forward the research design and methodology. The technique used to obtain information for the study included a literature review. A survey was conducted with selected employees. In the chapter a brief overview of the study is provided, as well as the methods utilized, data collected and the proposed data analysis. Chapter five concluded the study and put forward recommendations.
