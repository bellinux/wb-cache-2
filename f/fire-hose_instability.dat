40|$|Detailed {{properties}} of the classical hydromagnetic Alfven wave and the <b>fire-hose</b> <b>instability,</b> driven by an excess in the parallel energy are well understood in the nonrelativistic regime. In this brief communication, the analysis is extended to the fully relativistic regime. The analysis is carried out for fully relativistic bi-Maxwellian distributions of electrons and ions (or positrons). It is shown that the relativistic effect has a nonnegligible effect on the wave and stability {{properties of}} the low-frequency modes under certain conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTaking {{into account}} the {{pressure}} anisotropy in the solar wind, we study the magnetic field and plasma parameters downstream of a fast shock, as functions of upstream parameters and downstream pressure anisotropy. In our theoretical approach, we model two cases: a) the perpendicular shock and b) the oblique shock. We use two threshold conditions of plasma instabilities as additional equations to bound the range of pressure anisotropy. The criterion of the mirror instability is used for pressure anisotropy p /p > 1. Analogously, the criterion of the <b>fire-hose</b> <b>instability</b> is taken into account for pressure anisotropy p /p < 1. We found that the variations of the parallel pressure, the parallel temperature, and the tangential component of the velocity are most sensitive to the pressure anisotropy downstream of the shock. Finally, we compare our theory with plasma and magnetic field parameters measured by the WIND spacecraft...|$|E

The electron temperature {{is found to be}} independent of solar-wind speed over the range from 290 to 675 km/sec. Comparison of the simultaneous alignment of the local magnetic-field vector with the direction of the electron-temperature anisotropy reveals a high correlation.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{resonant}} Hamiltonian {{model for the}} vertical response of a stellar disk {{to the growth of}} a bar perturbation. As a bar perturbation grows stars become trapped in vertical Inner Lindblad resonances and are lifted into higher amplitude orbits. The vertical structure of a boxy and peanut shaped bulge as a function of radius and azimuthal angle in the galaxy plane can be predicted from the strength and speed of the bar perturbation and the derivatives of the gravitational potential. This model predicts that stars on the outer side of the resonance are lifted higher than stars on the inner side, offering an explanation for the sharp outer edge of the boxy/peanut. Subject headings: 1. introduction The existence of spiral galaxy bulges with boxy or peanut shapes has been recognized for many years through the study of edge-on galaxies (e. g., Burbridge & Burbridge 1959; de Vaucouleurs 1974). Recent work has found that edge-on galaxies with prominent boxy or peanuts shaped bulges in most cases show kinematic evidence for noncircular motions associated with a bar, whereas galaxies lacking boxy or peanut shaped bulges do not show kinematic evidence for a bar (Bureau & Freeman 1999; Merrifield & Kuijken 1999). A few cases exist where highly inclined systems exhibit both bars and peanuts (e. g., NGC 7582, Quillen et al. 1997 and NGC 4442, Bettoni & Galletta 1994). The link between a galactic bar and a boxy/peanut shaped bulge has been firmly established. Mechanisms proposed to explain the formation of boxy and peanut shaped structures include accretion of small satellite galaxies (Binney & Petrou 1985), bar-buckling via the <b>fire-hose</b> type <b>instability</b> (Toomre 1966; Raha e...|$|R
40|$|After that, FLR {{terms and}} their effects are taken into accounts. We show how such terms affect the {{development}} of the instability in the linear and nonlinear phase, introducing in the system a natural asymmetry which depends on the sign of the scalar product of the magnetic field with the fluid vorticity, Ω·B. In particular, we show that in the nonlinear phase also a hydrodynamic-like effects would compete with FLR effects. This influences the vortex pairing process and could be interpreted in terms of a quantity called generalized vorticity. At the end, conclusions about all these effects and their relevance to the modeling of collisionless plasma dynamics are drawn. We also discuss applications to the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction problem. A qualitative discussion of preliminary, but impressive results concerning secondary anisotropy-driven instability (<b>fire-hose</b> <b>instability)</b> and the dynamo problem are presented. These will be part of future works based on the application of this new model in 2 D and in 3 D geometry...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTemperature or {{pressure}} anisotropies {{are characteristic}} of space plasmas, standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for describing large-scale plasma phenomena however usually assumes isotropic pressure. In this paper we examine the characteristics of MHD waves, fire-hose and mirror instabilities in anisotropic homogeneous magnetized plasmas. The model equations are a set of gyrotropic MHD equations closed by the generalized Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) laws with two polytropic exponents representing various thermodynamic conditions. Both ions and electrons are allowed to have separate plasma beta, pressure anisotropy and energy equations. The properties of linear MHD waves and instability criteria are examined and numerical examples for the nonlinear evolutions of slow waves, fire-hose and mirror instabilities are shown. One significant result is that slow waves may develop not only mirror instability but also {{a new type of}} compressible <b>fire-hose</b> <b>instability.</b> Their corresponding nonlinear structures thus may exhibit anticorrelated density and magnetic field perturbations, a property used for identifying slow and mirror mode structures in the space plasma environment. The conditions for nonlinear saturation of both fire-hose and mirror instabilities are examined...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{time-lapse}} sequence of 20 near-infrared (J and K 0 band) snapshots {{of the central}} 20; 20 of the Crab pulsar wind nebula, taken at subarcsecond resolution with the Hokupa‘a /QUIRC adaptive optics camera on the Gemini North Telescope and sampled at intervals of 10 minutes and 24 hr. It is observed that the equatorial wisps and polar knots in the termination shock of the pulsar wind appear to fluctuate in brightness on kilosecond timescales. Maximum flux variations of 24 % 4 % and 14 % 4 % relative to the mean (in 1. 2 ks) are measured for the wisps and knots, respectively, with the greatest statistical significance in the J band, where the nebula background is less prominent. The J and K 0 flux densities imply different near-infrared spectra for the nonthermal continuum emission from the wisps and the outermost polar knot (the ‘‘sprite’’), giving F / 0 : 560 : 12 and F / 0 : 210 : 13, respectively. The data are compared with existing optical and UV photometry and applied to constrain theories of the variability of the wisps (relativistic ion-cyclotron instability) and knots (relativistic <b>fire-hose</b> <b>instability)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We analyse the {{temperature}} anisotropy of the pro-tons {{in the solar}} wind and thereby concentrate on plasma data obtained in the year 1976 of the Helios 1 and Helios 2 mis-sions. We derive the core proton temperatures T ⊥ and T‖, in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field, {{as well as the}} core parallel plasma beta, β‖. The data are separately analysed for two distance ranges, R≤ 0. 4 AU and R> 0. 4 AU, and divided into 24 bins for the plasma beta, in the range from β‖= 0. 1 to β‖= 10, and into 72 bins for the total temperature anisotropy, A= 1 −T⊥/T‖, which is here considered in the range from − 0. 9 to 0. 9. The number of spectra in each bin is determined to obtain distributions. The statistical results are presented in two-dimensional his-tograms.

40|$|The present work {{is part of}} {{the first}} approach, e. g the fluid {{modeling}} of the main kinetic effects due to Finite Larmor Radius (FLR). It can be roughly divided in two parts: the first one concerns fluid models and the theoretical modeling of kinetic effects, while the second one is about the numerical implementation of the model adopted and simulations results. After a discussion on the several fluid models one could adopt, we present how the FLR contributions are derived. In doing this, we focus our attention on the properties of these terms under magnetic field inversion. Also, we give a more general formulation of these terms for whatever magnetic field orientation is taken. Both these two features are not found in the existing literature and are particularly relevant for systems in which the magnetic field directions changes during the evolution. Then we present governing equations implemented in the numerical codes, from the original Two-Fluids (TF) version to the FLR-Landau-fluid (FLRLF) version, developed during this thesis. The first original contribution presented in this work is the extension to an anisotropic (i. e. gyrotropic) electronic pressure tensor starting from an isotropic (i. e. scalar) pressure adopted in the previous model. We also derive from the pressure tensor equation the FLR corrections then implemented in the numerical code for both ionic and electronic pressure tensor. Ion's FLR corrections are included in the equation of motion, while corrections for both species are included, together with gyrotropic pressures for both species, in generalized Ohm's law. Retaining ionic FLR terms in momentum equation is relevant in the initial configuration problem and for the K-H instability development. Moreover, adopting gyrotropic pressures with explicit evolution equations, could be relevant for anisotropy-driven secondary instabilities (e. g. <b>fire-hose</b> <b>instability)</b> and, together with retaining the full pressure tensors in the generalized Ohm's law, could be relevant in magnetic reconnection and dynamo problem. After a discussion of the plasma stability for configurations including FLR terms, we also give {{a brief description of the}} basic numerical procedures and of boundary conditions implemented in the code. Finally, a detailed analysis of the numerical simulations results is done. The analysis could be divided in two different parts: the first one concerns the initialization problem when FLR terms are taken into accounts, while the second one is focused on the K-H instability development. About the initialization problem, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that a MHD-type configuration is no more an equilibrium initialization when FLR corrections are retained in the equation of motion. This is particularly important since the rapid readjustment of the large-scale system to a new equilibrium configuration modifies a relevant parameter for the K-H instability such as the velocity shear width. A simple fluid approach to the equilibrium configuration problem in presence of FLR terms, together with a convergent approximation method to solve it, are developed and a set of equilibrium profiles is given. We then show that adopting these profiles the initialization problem is solved, recovering the control over the initialization parameters.|$|E
