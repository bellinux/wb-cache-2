5|$|A British {{horsewoman}} named Francesca Kelly {{founded a}} group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995, {{with the goal of}} promoting and preserving the Marwari horse around the world. In 1999, Kelly and Raghuvendra Singh Dundlod, a descendant of Indian nobility, led a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> founded the Indigenous Horse Society of India (of which the Marwari Horse Society is part), a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> works with the government, breeders, and the public to promote and conserve the breed. Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses– the first in the country. The pair worked with other experts from the Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards.|$|E

5|$|According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Lactarius, L.torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls into a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> includes L.torminosulus, and that these two species {{are closely related to}} a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses newly {{available}} {{data from the}} 1995 Lobby Disclosure Act to assess the argument that PAC contributions are used {{to gain access to}} legislators. First, we find a much stronger connection between lobbying and campaign contributions than previous statistical research has revealed [...] <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> have both a lobbyist and a PAC account for 70 percent of all interest group expenditures and 86 percent of all PAC contributions. Second, we find <b>that</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> engage in relatively large amounts of lobbying [...] and therefore presumably have a high demand for access [...] allocate their campaign contributions differently than <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> do not. <b>Groups</b> <b>that</b> emphasize lobbying pay more attention to members' positions of power inside Congress, and less attention to members' electoral circumstances, than other <b>groups.</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>that</b> emphasize lobbying also appear to be more bipartisan and less ideological than other groups, giving more equally to both parties and more broadly across the ideological spectrum. ...|$|R
