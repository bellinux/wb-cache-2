5000|$|Warranties are {{statements}} by a manufacturer or seller concerning a product during a commercial transaction. Warranty claims commonly require privity between the injured {{party and the}} manufacturer or seller; in plain English, this means they must be dealing with each other directly. Breach of warranty-based product liability claims usually focus on one of three types: (1) breach <b>of</b> an <b>express</b> <b>warranty,</b> (2) breach <b>of</b> an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability, and (3) breach <b>of</b> an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitness</b> for a particular purpose. Additionally, claims involving real estate may also take the form <b>of</b> an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> habitability. <b>Express</b> <b>warranty</b> claims focus on express {{statements by}} the manufacturer or the seller concerning the product (e.g., [...] "This chainsaw is useful to cut turkeys"). The various implied warranties cover those expectations common to all products (e.g., that a tool is not unreasonably dangerous when used for its proper purpose), unless specifically disclaimed by the manufacturer or the seller.|$|R
