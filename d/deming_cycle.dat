5000|$|Lean project {{management}} is {{the method used}} to plan and execute a lean (improvement) project. There {{are many ways to}} do this, but the two most prevalent are the 6 Sigma DMAIC method or the <b>Deming</b> <b>Cycle</b> (Called the [...] "A3" [...] since the steps are recorded on an A3 size paper). 6 Sigma Companies use 6 Sigma Black Belts to take an improvement project through the steps of Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. Other companies use the A3 Problem solving Process which includes the statement of the problem, the current situation, the root cause of the problem, suggest alternative solutions, suggest a recommended solution and have a cost-benefit analysis. This information would fit all on one A3 size sheet of paper. Another type of lean {{project management}} is called Kanban. Kanban endeavours to increase productivity by limiting multitasking, keeping work uninterrupted, urging to plan ahead, remaining focused, encouraging to tackle larger tasks first, and to actually finish projects. Generally, all methods allow the project team to follow a disciplined method to measure the current state, define the future state, and put into place countermeasures to improve the process. Associated with the project are measurable metrics, as well as foundational lean elements that are implemented to improve those metrics. Either method is helpful in achieving better results for the project outcome.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Corporate Social Environmental Reporting is {{a process}} through which {{companies}} and organisations can inform the societies within which they operate about their performance on non-economic issues including environmental performance. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an internationally recognised organisation which has frameworks and guidelines organisations can use to standardise the reports which they issue to the society. Data gathering for reporting on environmental performance {{can be done in}} several ways, including by means of the data required for an Environmental Management System (EMS) based on the ISO 14001 “plan – do – check - act” commonly known as the <b>Demming</b> <b>cycle,</b> aimed at continual improvement of environmental performance by an organisation. The clauses in an EMS allow for an organisation to measure its performance and hence the generation of data which can be used for interpretation on environmental performance. The utility of data generated from an EMS is optimised for input towards the generation of a Corporate Social Environmental Report by the level of alignment between the reporting process and the system used for data generation. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level of such an alignment between the two processes for AngloGold Ashanti (AGA), a multinational gold mining company which issues its reports according to GRI guidelines and also has an ISO 14001 EMS in place. The method used entailed a desktop documentary analysis, a questionnaire answered by individuals responsible for implementation of the EMS and an interview posed at corporate level. It was found that despite corporate commitment to continually improve CSER, there is a relative weak alignment between the two systems, with consequent duplication of effort and sub optimal use of human resources. Recommendations for improved alignment include focused education and training of staff on the relationship between CSER and EMS, and improvements in EMS monitoring and measuring procedures.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 For today’s {{ubiquitous}} portable devices, innovative {{integrated circuits}} with high performance yet very low power are necessary. As these devices {{are used to}} communicate and sense real world signals in the environment, analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and systems are the key interface circuits needed to digitize the sensed information and they represent {{one of the most}} challenging aspects in the overall design. Fundamentally, {{this is due to the}} inherent imperfections in integrated circuit process technology because they cause degradations in the ADC performance. In this thesis, noise-shaping techniques are used to mitigate analog inaccuracies such as non-linearity and mismatch. These approaches are applied to ΔΣ analog-to-digital based systems. Two systems are presented in this work. The first is an architectural technique to highlight the benefits of low power, highly digital VCO-based analog-to-digital converters. It overcomes the limited SFDR due to VCO non-linearity. In this approach, a multi-loop delta-sigma (ΔΣ) ADC architecture is introduced that has a multi-rated VCO-based ADC in its second stage. A custom IC prototype of this architecture fabricated in a 130 nm 1 P 8 M CMOS process achieves 77. 3 dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over a 4 MHz signal bandwidth with a power consumption of 13. 8 mW. The second system includes a new dynamic element matching (DEM) algorithm in the reference generating circuit of a ΔΣ modulator. The most basic DEM algorithm known as data weighted averaging (DWA) increases in-band noise due to intermodulation between the DEM tone and quantization error. In the proposed technique, by completing an integer multiple of the <b>DEM</b> <b>cycles</b> within one ΣΔ <b>cycle,</b> the <b>DEM</b> tone is moved to an integer multiple of the ΣΔ sample rate. As a result, with no additional circuitry or power consumption, the new DEM technique prevents any increase in the in-band noise. To prove its effectiveness, the DEM algorithm is embedded in a temperature-to-digital Converter (TDC) which requires a high precision reference. This TDC consists of a BJT-based temperature sensor followed by a 2 nd-order feed-forward ΔΣ ADC as a readout circuit. It is fabricated in an 180 nm 1 P 5 M CMOS process consuming 5 µA current from 1. 4 V supply voltage achieving resolution of 25 mK/Conversion...|$|R

The base for the empirical material is collected through qualitative interviews with staff on four different international organizations. The results proclaim that the EPE model can help organizations to narrow down focus and to categorize results, which help organizations to analyze ethical behavior. If the EPE model is complemented with an improvement model (the <b>Deming</b> <b>cycle)</b> an ethical improvement model is created. Conclusions are that evaluating ethical performance is not simple and {{the results can be}} ambiguous.

The aim of this dissertation is to design an artefact that would support the decision making of marketing specialists and thus the management of online marketing activities. The starting point is an explorative research among Czech companies, which identifies the issues felt as problematic and the needs of the selected set of organizations. Introduced at the same time is the current state of use of selected tools for online marketing by these organizations, and the situation is compared with worldwide development. The output of this explorative research, the examination of scientific literature, and a critical analysis serve as a basis for designing an own method, Genoma, whose purpose is to support the decision making of marketing specialists, and thereby also the management of marketing activities in internet-mediated environment. This method is presented as <b>Deming</b> (PDCA) <b>cycle,</b> which enables it to be used not only separately, but also as part of other frameworks for the management of marketing activities (e. g. the frameworks PMF, MCPF and RACE, which are presented in the dissertation). The Genoma method uses mainly the genetic algorithm for selecting a suitable portfolio of online marketing tools for a particular campaign. The selection is {{made on the basis of}} expected feedback at the level of social interaction, meeting the given marketing targets, and the financial demands of the individual tools.

MethodsStatistical analysis alone, although necessary, may not always represent the practical significance of the intervention. Thus, to ascertain the true economic impact of the intervention, the statistical results can be integrated into the budget impact analysis. The intervention of the case study consisted of a comprehensive approach that integrated new provider roles and new technological infrastructure for multimorbid patients, with the aim of reducing patient decompensations by 10 % over 5 years. The study period was 2012 to 2020. ResultsGiven the aging of the general population, the conventional scenario predicts an increase of 21 % in the health care budget for care of multimorbid patients during the study period. With a successful intervention, this figure should drop to 18 %. The statistical analysis, however, showed no significant differences in costs either in primary care or in hospital care between 2012 and 2014. The real costs in 2014 were by far closer to those in the conventional scenario than to the reductions expected in the objective scenario. The present implementation should be reappraised, because the present expenditure did not move closer to the objective budget.

40|$|The load {{deformation}} of ballasted rail tracks subjected to cyclic loading is investigated experimentally using a large-scale track process simulation apparatus and numerically through a combined discrete element-finite-difference approach. Laboratory tests {{were performed to}} examine the deformation and degradation of ballast subjected to cyclic loading at 15 Hz and a lateral confinement of 10 kPa 10 kPa. The laboratory results reveal that ballast undergoes significant deformation during the initial load cycles, followed by gradually increasing deformation attaining a steady value {{toward the end of}} testing. A numerical model based on a combined discrete element method (DEM) and finite-difference method (FDM) is introduced to study the load-deformation response of the ballast assembly while considering interaction between the ballast aggregates and the subgrade layer. In this coupled model, the discrete ballast grains are modeled by DEM, and the subgrade domain is modeled as a continuum by FDM. Interface elements are introduced to transmit the interacting forces and displacements between adjoining material domains in which the DEM transfers contact forces to the FDM, and then the FDM updates the displacements, which provides subsequent input into the <b>DEM.</b> This computational <b>cycle</b> continues with the increasing number of loading cycles. The numerical model is validated by comparing the predicted cyclic load-deformation response with the laboratory measurements.

40|$|Modern {{machinery}} {{is expensive}} and therefore must run at high availability and effectiveness which cannot be achieved without an effective maintenance policy. Condition monitoring, (CM), techniques can be utilised {{to reduce or}} arrest the rate of deterioration of a component so increasing operating life. The main result reported in this thesis is that the rolling element bearing’s mean effective life could be extended appreciably if an existing vibration-based maintenance policy is used effectively. This result is achieved {{by a combination of}} data analysis and logical development. A new maintenance approach was developed to overcome some of the limitations of total productive maintenance, TPM, and reliability-centered maintenance, RCM, and is based upon the <b>Deming</b> managerial feedback <b>cycle</b> (Plan-Do-Check-Act). This method is called Total Quality Maintenance, (TQMain). It is a methodology to sustain and improve continuously the technical and economic effectiveness of the manufacturing process elements. It is shown logically that by using vibration-based monitoring, (VBM), program in the frame of a common database for a plant IT-system the causes behind quality deviations and failures can be identified and eliminated effectively at an early stage and the company’s economics would be improved. The condition-based maintenance effectiveness and accuracy are usually related to the ability of the CM system to detect failure causes and follow defect development. Criteria to select the most cost-effective VBM system and the most cost-effective vibration-based maintenance policy are developed. But, in most real cases, CM systems are not utilised effectively and companies are satisfied with the partial savings achieved in maintenance cost. It is shown, by two case studies, that improvements in vibration-based maintenance can be achieved by effective feedback of the results of failures, renewal condition and VBM history analysis. Unfortunately the data coverage and quality in these studies were not sufficient, among other reasons due to the low number of failures and long bearing lives, so the conclusions, although supported by the work results, remain strong qualitative indications, rather than statistical proof. Criteria to measure the effect of improvements to confirm whether it is economically beneficial and to identify the basic reasons why it is not, are developed. The contribution of this thesis is: The development of a sequential method for the selection and improvement of a cost-effective vibration-based maintenance policy. This methodology can be used to justify, on economic criteria, the use of VBM systems to indicate when rolling element bearings should be renewed. It is achieved through; Tools used in quality and maintenance technology and reliability analysis have either been modified or developed beyond their original concept such as; Maintenance cost equation, Total Time On Test-plots. Development of new tools to monitor maintenance effectiveness and accuracy, select the most informative CM parameter(s) and cost-effective vibration-based maintenance policy.
