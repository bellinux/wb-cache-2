5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, {{which are now}} encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 <b>glaciologist</b> Charles R. Bentley {{estimated}} that the tent with the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{scientist}} Peter Kropotkin {{first proposed}} {{the idea of}} fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets {{at the end of}} the 19th century. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian <b>glaciologist</b> I. A. Zotikov, who wrote his Ph.D. thesis on this subject in 1967.|$|E
5|$|During {{his studies}} Lethbridge {{decided to join}} an {{expedition}} to visit Jan Mayen island in the Arctic Circle, alongside fellow Cambridge students James Chaworth-Musters and William Syer Bristowe and a don from St. John's College, Cambridge, the geologist James Wordie. Although initially planning to travel independently, they decided to join a Norwegian expedition led by Hagbord Ekerold and accompanied by Swiss mountaineer and <b>glaciologist</b> Paul Louis Mercanton. The expedition set sail from Bratvaag aboard two ships in August 1921, and upon arriving at Jan Mayen they became {{the first team to}} successfully climb the Beerenberg. During the expedition, Lethbridge was also able to explore his growing interest in archaeology by excavating at an abandoned Eskimo settlement. The Times recognised the expedition as the mountaineering event of the year.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a <b>glaciologist</b> was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two general}} {{categories}} of glaciation which <b>glaciologists</b> distinguish: alpine glaciation, accumulations or [...] "rivers of ice" [...] confined to valleys; and continental glaciation, unrestricted accumulations which once covered {{much of the}} northern continents.|$|R

2500|$|During the 18th century, erratics {{were deemed}} a major {{geological}} paradox. Erratics were once considered {{evidence of a}} vast flood approximately 10,000 years ago, similar to the legendary floods described in the texts of ancient civilizations throughout the world. Ancient legends of an epic flood come from many cultures including Mesoamerican, Sumerian (Epic of Gilgamesh), Hebrew (Old Testament) and Indian culture. Among others, the Swiss politician, jurist and theologican [...] saw glaciers as a possible solution as early as 1788. However the idea of ice ages and glaciation as a geological force {{took a while to}} be accepted. Ignaz Venetz (1788 — 1859), a Swiss engineer, naturalist, and <b>glaciologist</b> {{was one of the first}} scientists to recognize glaciers as a major force in shaping the earth.|$|E
2500|$|John Muir ( [...] ; April 21, 1838 – [...] December 24, 1914) {{also known}} as [...] "John of the Mountains", was a Scottish-American naturalist, author, {{environmental}} philosopher, <b>glaciologist</b> and early advocate {{for the preservation of}} wilderness in the United States.

[...] His activism has helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and many other wilderness areas.

Other such places include Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, John Muir College, Mount Muir, Camp Muir, Muir Grove, and Muir Glacier. In Scotland, the John Muir Way, a 130-mile-long route, was named in honor of him.|$|E
50|$|Situated {{below the}} peak of the Corno Grande is the Calderone glacier, until 2009 the southernmost known glacier in Europe; {{deglaciation}} has significantly reduced the glacier's size. <b>Glaciologists</b> now question whether the glacier will survive past 2020.|$|R
50|$|The monthly gravity {{anomalies}} maps {{generated by}} GRACE {{are up to}} 1,000 times more accurate than previous maps, substantially improving the accuracy of many techniques used by oceanographers, hydrologists, <b>glaciologists,</b> geologists and other scientists to study phenomena that influence climate.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>glaciologists</b> have {{predicted}} that the glacier will disappear by 2020. However, 2014 has been slightly positive for the glacier. By the end of August 2014, the volume of residual ice was larger than {{during the same period}} in 2013.|$|R
2500|$|The melt zone, where summer warmth turns {{snow and}} ice into slush and melt ponds of meltwater, has been {{expanding}} at an accelerating rate in recent years. When the meltwater seeps down through cracks in the sheet, it accelerates the melting and, in some areas, allows the ice to slide more easily over the bedrock below, speeding its movement to the sea. Besides contributing to global sea level rise, the process adds freshwater to the ocean, which may disturb ocean circulation and thus regional climate. In July 2012, this melt zone extended to 97 percent of the ice cover. Ice cores show that events such as this occur approximately every 150 years on average. The last time a melt this large happened was in 1889. This particular melt {{may be part of}} cyclical behavior; however, Lora Koenig, a Goddard <b>glaciologist</b> suggested that [...] "...if we continue to observe melting events like this in upcoming years, it will be worrisome." [...] Global warming is increasing growth of algae on the ice sheet. [...] This darkens the ice causing it to absorb more sunlight and potentially increasing the rate of melting.|$|E
2500|$|... the <b>glaciologist</b> and Director of the Mont Blanc Observatory at {{the time}} of the incident, {{published}} detailed accounts of his investigations into the Catastrophy of Saint Gervais. Measurements and photographs taken shortly afterwards showed that part of the glacier's snout (terminus) had been torn away, revealing a cavity 40 metres in diameter and 20 metres above its base. From this a 3 metre high tube led back some 85 metres and at a 36° angle to an even larger second cavity, up to 40m high and 50 m wide. Maps drawn up shortly afterwards confirmed a depression in the centre of the glacier. It was estimated that 100,000 cubic metres of liquid water had drained away during the glacier's collapse, plus a further 100,000 cubic metres of broken ice. Together with the soil and rock broken away by the force of the rushing water, Vallot estimated that a weight of 500 million kilograms of material had borne down on the villages. He also warned that a repeat of water build-up was quite likely to occur, and that this would become more dangerous as time went on. He advocated the use of explosives to ensure a permanent flow of meltwater away from the glacier.|$|E

25|$|<b>Glaciologists</b> have {{predicted}} that if carbon dioxide levels increase at a worst-case scenario, all the glaciers in the park, including Grinnell, will disappear by the year 2030.
