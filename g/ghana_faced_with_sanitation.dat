40|$|Ghana, {{like other}} {{developing}} nations, was not {{left behind in}} embracing the eight time-bound Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in September 2000. The millennium development goals aimed towards peace and good standards of living have been <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> series of problems in its attainment in Ghana. These problems have undermined {{the extent to which}} Ghana could achieve the MDGs. The study adopting qualitative research method shows that <b>Ghana</b> is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> difficulty in achieving these eight millennium development goals in certain portions of the nation most especially in the rural communities due to lack of infrastructure. The study therefore recommends that Ghana should focus more on improving the standard of living of the rural dwellers by increasing the public services in the area.   The need for Ghana to focus more on solving these problems is strategic for a better result in this new era of Sustainable Development Goals...|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} {{countries around the}} world are <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the dilemma “brain-drain” as their healthcare professionals seek better economic opportunities in other countries. This problem is compounded by a lack of robust healthcare infrastructure requiring substantive improvements to bring them up to date. This impacts a countries ability to understand morbidity and mortality patterns which impact health care policy and program planning. The lack of IT infrastructure also negatively affects the safety, quality, and efficiency of health care delivery in these countries. <b>Ghana</b> is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> this precise set of circumstances as it struggles to adopt policies to overcome these challenges. The Republic of Ghana is implementing strategies to accelerate is development through information and communication technology (ICT), however in implementing this in the health sector {{it is also important to}} put into operation a system that is secure and protects the privacy of health consumers. One technique that has proven effective in recent years in facilitating the delivery of quality healthcare services to a wide range of consumers is the use of smart cards. Research into the viability of smart cards is therefore necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{priority}} of every {{government is to}} develop the economy of its country to raise the living standard of the citizenry. Mass transit system plays {{a vital role in}} this quest. The energy demand within the transport subsector is immense. Indeed Ghana subsidises petroleum products by GH¢ 45 million monthly and the government of <b>Ghana</b> is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the dilemma of whether or not this subsidy be removed as it is putting pressure on national budget. For this reason the need for energy efficiency management has become imperative. This study assessed the role of mass transit in urban transportation system and how it affects energy demand. Secondary data was used for the study. The study revealed that the use of mass transit would reduce energy demand within the transport sector due to its fuel efficiency potentials. Therefore expanding the intra-city mass transit services within Kumasi Metropolis could offer one of the most effective, efficient and feasible strategy for improving fuel efficiency within the transport sub sector. Therefore policy decision should give attention to metro mass transit services within metropolitan areas...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: ICT offers {{teacher and}} {{students}} both technological tools and resources which are beyond the boundary of their classrooms. Therefore, when the policy is properly implemented, it could support and transform the learning situation in every country. However, the best intentions might not always achieve the reality as projects on making ICT education accessible mostly fail to achieve its objectives. Objective: It {{is in line with}} this the study was conducted to ascertain some of the challenges associated with the implementation of ICT policy at Nwabiagya District in Ashanti region. Methods: The study adopted case study design and a mixed method of data collection. In all, a total of 512 were recruited {{to be part of the}} study. Findings: The study revealed that there is lack of computers, unqualified teachers, limited practical after teaching as well as lack of internet access. These challenges were confirmed by both the teachers and the students within the various schools sampled. Conclusion: The study found that the teaching and learning of ICT in basic schools in <b>Ghana</b> is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> barriers and efforts have to be put in place in order to provide the needed resources and personnel to handle the subject in the various schools...|$|R
40|$|Tamale, one of {{the fastest}} growing cities in <b>Ghana,</b> is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> {{daunting}} challenges in the management of Municipal Solid Waste. A corresponding increase of population and rising quality of life with high rates of resource consumption patterns have led to serious problems of high volumes of waste generated and costs involved. This research was therefore designed to focus on the Municipal Solid Waste Management strategies in Tamale, seeking to assess the performance of newly introduced tricycles for waste collection. The study employed the methodology of administration of questionnaire and interviews. The questionnaire and interviews revealed that there is a relationship in the level of education and how households stored their waste before disposal. There is also a close relationship in the household income level (residential class) and the use of covered plastic waste bins. Most households rated waste collection after the introduction of the tricycle as good followed by very good and satisfactory whilst none were of the view that waste collection was not good. Though there has been an improvement in waste collection after the introduction of the tricycles, there is the need for an integrated approach to waste management where all aspects of waste management are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{knowledge}} economies, research is recognised as a catalyst for accelerated national growth. Many countries are therefore investing hugely in university research. However, in developing countries especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, university research is fraught with a myriad of challenges making the research activities of academics weakened and sometimes neglected. Using mainly primary data gathered through interviews, this study sought to examine the perceptions and experiences of academic staff at the University of Ghana on their research activities. The findings of the study indicate that research organisation at the University of <b>Ghana</b> is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> challenges arising out of the highly individualised research activities of the academics making coordination a big challenge which is compounded by the lack of research policy at the University. In addition to inadequate funding for research, the findings reveal that academics at the University of Ghana have little time to conduct research due to the heavy teaching load and sometimes academics engaging in extra jobs to augment their salaries. Poor research infrastructure was also found to be a major hindrance to the research activities of the academics. The study also found that attempts are being made by the University of Ghana to improve upon the research activities of academics through organisation of workshops to sharpen their research skills and the establishment of the Research and Conference Fund which offer grants to academics. On the whole, the study found that the research environment at the University of Ghana is not favourable for research and needs significant improvement. The study therefore recommends that the government as a matter of urgency should support the university’s research activities by providing budgetary support and investing in research infrastructure. Attempts should be made by the University of Ghana to lessen the heavy teaching loads of academics to give them time to conduct research...|$|R

40|$|Cultural control {{measures}} against tomato late blight (Phytophthora infestans) were evaluated in six field experiments over 3 years in Uganda. Each experiment included sanitation (removal of diseased plant tissues), fungicide (mancozeb) application, and an untreated control, as standard treatments. Late blight incidence and severity were greatly reduced by sanitation, without {{reducing the number}} of healthy leaves; however, tomato growth and production were adversely affected. Fungicide treated plants retained the highest numbers of flowers and attached fruits and gave the highest yields. Three cultural practices were evaluated in repeated experiments for their effectiveness in alleviating the adverse effects of sanitation. Tomatoes grown within plastic shelters early in the production cycle were taller, and had more healthy leaves than those grown late. The numbers of diseased leaves and disease severity were equally low in sanitation alone and plastic shelter/with sanitation treatments. Flower and fruit production were significantly higher when tomatoes were grown under early shelters <b>with</b> <b>sanitation</b> than <b>with</b> <b>sanitation</b> alone. Planting density was increased without significant effects on late blight and tomato growth and production. Intercropping tomato with soybean (Glycine max) or sesame (Sesamum indicum), <b>with</b> <b>sanitation,</b> limited late blight development, but taller intercrops suppressed tomato growth and production. Integrated treatments (combining plastic shelters, a sesame intercrop and high tomato planting density) were evaluated, <b>with</b> and without <b>sanitation,</b> against the fungicide mancozeb. The mean numbers of healthy leaves in the integrated treatments were not significantly less than with fungicide treatment. Late blight incidence and severity were higher in the integrated plots without than <b>with</b> <b>sanitation.</b> The numbers of flowers and attached fruits were not significantly less in integrated treatments than in fungicide treated plots, but tomato yield was highest with fungicide treatmen...|$|R
