500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Fairfax High School, Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends, Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman. They called their band Chain Reaction, then changed the name to Anthem after their first gig. [...] After one of the group's shows, Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis, and invited him to his house for a snack. [...] Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography Scar Tissue: [...] "Within {{a few minutes of}} hanging out with Hillel, <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> he was absolutely different from most of the people I'd spent time with...He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting." [...] Slovak, Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally.|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't want to hear about it.' He didn't want me to tell him about it, you know.

[...] Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine, and speed recreationally. Despite his frequent drug use, he excelled in school, often receiving straight A grades. In June 1980, Kiedis graduated with honors from high school. That August, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles to study writing. However, he dropped out {{at the beginning of his}} second year due to his worsening addiction to cocaine and heroin.|$|E

5000|$|One former Stasi Major recalled, [...] "We mixed inconspicuously {{with the}} demonstrators, {{accompanied}} by our IMs. Hundreds of us {{stood at the}} sides of the street in order to stop any activity before it got started. We barely got any sleep toward the end. Never did <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the people were afraid of the MfS. The Stasi was more afraid of the people than the people were of them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} lukewarm reviews.Leigh Paatsch, {{writing in}} the Melbourne Herald-Sun, felt that the film's strongest point was the banter between the characters which was funny and engaging. But Paatsch said that Lawson's central performance was marred at times by [...] "an air of self-satisfied smarm" [...] and the character's path to enlightenment was un-focused and un-convincing. He concluded, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> others who similarly fell hard for the soulful sincerity of The Castle and The Dish will feel a little quizzical about the comparative slickness of Any Questions for Ben?&thinsp;".|$|R
2500|$|By {{the age of}} 10, Theile {{was enjoying}} success at local {{swimming}} carnivals, so his father offered to arrange {{for him to be}} coached, but left Theile with the choice of coaches. Of the two coaches in the town, Theile chose Arthur Cusack, who had a reputation as a physical training instructor of whom Theile recounted as being [...] "tough and enthusiastic. All my friends avoided him....somehow <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> it was an important decision." [...] Cusack turned out to be his lifelong coach. Under the guidance of Cusack, Maryborough Swimming Club challenged the metropolitan clubs in Brisbane for statewide supremacy. Theile won Queensland junior and open titles in all four strokes. In 1954, at the age of 16, he came second in the open backstroke, and after becoming the national junior champion that year, he decided to concentrate on the given stroke. In 1955, he captured the 110yd backstroke title at the Australian Championships in Adelaide. At the same time, Theile completed his secondary education and was awarded an academic scholarship to study medicine at the University of Queensland.|$|E
60|$|When it came {{to telling}} {{what he wanted to}} do, the Ranger warmed to his subject; he talked beautifully, convincingly, with a certain strange, persuasive power that betrayed how he worked his way; and his fine face, losing its stern, hard lines, seemed to glow and give forth a spirit austere, yet noble, almost gentle, assuredly {{something}} vastly different from what might have been expected in the expression of a gun-fighting Ranger. <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> Miss Sampson felt this just as I did.|$|E
5000|$|We {{entered a}} oneness of silence; words seemed the rankest superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of master to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> my guru knew God, and would {{lead me to}} Him. The {{obscuration}} of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories. Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes. This {{was not the first}} sun to find me at these holy feet! ...|$|E
5000|$|Blitzstein's {{score was}} {{preserved}} by Columbia Records, which released the original cast album in both monaural and stereo editions. The Fynsworth Alley label re-released the recording on compact disc in 2002. Steven Suskin, {{in his review}} in Playbill, noted: [...] "Time {{and again in the}} score, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Blitzstein is reminding himself to write Irish music - and that hampers his creativity. The score ranges from exceptional to mundane; the weaker portions make it very clear to us, today, that Juno simply couldn't have worked. There have been at least three major attempts at 'fixing' the show, {{in the same way that}} Bernstein's Candide was 'fixed'." ...|$|R

It is my task to explain the pattern that this study will take in the opening modules. In this first year of study design research will take place on Wednesdays, regardless of studio projects It will constitute {{a certain number of}} lectures and tutorials, concluding with a specified brief which represents the first phase of assessment. As the routine unfolds <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> my new audience will have already made some judgments on this particular aspect of their course...|$|R
5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth <b>I,</b> <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|R

5000|$|Box said Eric Ambler {{had a very}} {{different}} approach to writing to Hammond Innes. [...] "Innes was a writer who spent as much time researching his books as he did writing them," [...] she wrote. [...] "Eric's books depend much more on characterisation, motivation and ideologies rather than realistic documentation. I remember him telling me that he hadn't even visited most of the countries he wrote about, and <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> he wasn't entirely happy working on Campbell's Kingdom." [...] Another writer, Robin Estridge, was hired {{to work on the}} script.|$|E

50|$|In {{the score}} to Halil, Bernstein writes:This work is {{dedicated}} ‘To {{the spirit of}} Yadin and to his fallen brothers…Halil (the Hebrew word for ‘flute’) is formally unlike any other work I have written, but is like much of my music in its struggle between tonal and non-tonal forces. In this case, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> struggle as involving wars {{and the threat of}} wars, the overwhelming desire to live, and the consolations of art, love and the hope for peace. It is a kind of night-music, which, from its opening 12-tone row to its ambiguously diatonic final cadence, is an ongoing conflict of nocturnal images: wish-dreams, nightmares, repose, sleeplessness, night-terrors and sleep itself, Death’s twin brother.I never knew Yadin Tannenbaum, but I know his spirit.|$|R

40|$|William is a Korean War veteran. He is {{very soft}} spoken and has wild crazy hair. He {{agreed to be}} interviewed and it {{takes place in the}} kitchen of his home. He paid more {{attention}} to the TV that was on in the living room than he did me to me or the interview in the beginning of it. After a few questions he began to get more interested in the questions. I tried to be as direct and as clear as I could be in asking the questions but still to me many of his answers didn’t sound logical or were very brief even in using the probes. Through talking to him <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> he may possibly be in the earliest stage of some sort of elderly dementia...|$|R
5000|$|Geoffrey Nyarota, who {{was then}} one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be [...] "terrorist sympathisers". Describing the Herald {{newsroom}} the night of the incident, he relates a [...] "vile collective temper" [...] among the white sub-editors: [...] "They cursed until their voices became hoarse, threatening dire consequences for all terrs and munts or kaffirs... <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears." ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{return from}} a trip to Germany 1934, which at the time was sterilizing over 5,000 {{citizens}} per month, Goethe reportedly told a fellow eugenicist, [...] "You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind Hitler in this epoch-making program.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} our dinner, {{he seemed}} more aware of {{everything}} around him. His tone was a little more serious, and there wasn't as much joking as usual. He repeated the phrase he had used before that a rolling stone gathers no moss, which told me that he {{knew he was going to}} be on the move again. I got the feeling that he was resigning himself to the fact that he wasn't coming back. Up until then, I always believed he thought there was a chance he had beat the case. However, at that point, there was something different going on with him. I didn't fully understand all the aspects of his case. It would be another six months before it became clearer. Yet at that moment, in that restaurant in New York, <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> he had moved to a new place in his mind. It was over. He'd never return to South Boston.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike such bands, as Maanam, TSA, Republika or Lombard, Brygada Kryzys {{refused to}} play at government-sponsored shows. The band {{recorded}} its first album in February - March 1982 (due {{to the color of}} the cover, it was called the Black Album or the Black Brygada), and in the summer of that year, the band left for the village of Wólki, near Lublin. The situation of the martial law, however, was not good, and in the autumn of 1982, Lipiński decided to split from the band. Brygada Kryzys ceased to exist, as Brylewski later said in his autobiography: [...] "I was expecting this to happen. <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> Tomek was feeling down, and I was not surprised. Nothing was happening with Brygada, I bore that situation better than Tomek, while it all frustrated him, he was older, he counted on something more.

5000|$|For {{the title}} character, Ploy, Pen-Ek chose Apinya Sakulcharoensuk, who was 16 {{years old at}} the time of shooting. [...] "She's a godsend," [...] the {{director}} said of the actress.

50|$|The four {{movements}} {{complement each}} other in that while they remain unique and representative of the unique person they were written for. The piece takes its form from the baroque sonata da chiesa form by alternating the movements from slow-fast-slow-fast. There are common themes and a <b>sense</b> of tonality <b>that</b> help to bring the work together. Donald Truesdell quotes James Tocco, pianist, who gets {{to the heart of}} the piece:Lenny may disagree with me but one finds much more about him in the Anniversaries than the people to whom they are dedicated. <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Lenny may have been attracted to certain characteristics of a personality that in some way reflected something in himself-aspects of his own personality that he wished to develop.Leonard Bernstein composed Four Anniversaries for the Piano to commemorate the birthdays offour important people in his life and the result is four individual movements that form one coherent piece.|$|R

5000|$|In November 1972 the Galliard Trio {{expanded}} to become The English Concert, an orchestra specialising in performances of baroque and early classical music on period instruments. The orchestra initially started with seven members but soon grew in size. The {{decision to move}} to period performance was taken {{for a number of}} reasons: What I really had in mind was a journey of discovery into the unknown. Although I felt there were excellent interpretations of baroque music performed on modern instruments, <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> we'd {{come to the end of}} the road - and yet I knew that there were still discoveries to be made. I was thinking about the interesting experiments made by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt, although I knew we'd have to experiment in our own way. It was a huge challenge; playing period instruments wasn't as easy as it is today, and finding out their secrets was a difficult process. Nowadays an extraordinarily high technical level has been achieved and the upcoming generations don't have any of the problems we pioneers faced. We cleared the way.|$|E
5000|$|After {{ten years}} of {{struggling}} as the Blue Velvets and the Golliwogs, singer/guitarist John Fogerty, his brother guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford scored a #11 hit single with [...] "Susie Q" [...] in June 1968 under the name Creedence Clearwater Revival. Their self-titled album peaked at #52 on the Billboard albums chart. Despite their new-found success, however, seeds of discontent among the four members had already been planted due to John Fogerty assuming control of the band at just about every level. [...] "There was {{a point at which}} we had done the first album. Everybody had listened to my advice. I don't think anybody thought too much about it," [...] Fogerty recalled to Michael Goldberg of Rolling Stone in 1993. [...] "But in making the second album, Bayou Country, we had a real confrontation. Everybody wanted to sing, write, make up their own arrangements, whatever, right? This was after {{ten years of}} struggling. Now we had the spotlight. Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame. 'Suzie Q' was as big as we'd ever seen. Of course, it really wasn't that big...I didn't {{want to go back to}} the carwash." [...] In 2007, the singer elaborated to Joshua Klein of Pitchfork, [...] "I determined, we're on the tiniest record label in the world, there's no money behind us, we don't have a manager, there's no publicist. We basically had none of the usual star-making machinery, so I said to myself I'm just going to have to do it with the music...Basically I wanted to do what the Beatles had done. <b>I</b> <b>sensed</b> <b>that</b> I just had to do it myself." ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, intra-European foreign direct invest-ment (FDI) has grown faster than its {{counterpart}} in any other region of the developed world. Inter alia, this is {{the direct result of}} the completion of the European Internal Market, and of a galaxy of investment incentives offered by individual European countries and/or subnational authorities within the European Union (EU). In the main, the authors of this timely and extensively researched volume tend to look upon these incentives as among the more significant location-specific determinants in a race among European countries to attract inward FDI to their borders. Indeed, they present quite persuasive evidence to support their case. At the same time, reading between the lines, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> most contributors also believe that the dominant reasons for the growing attraction of the EU to foreign investors have been, first, the implementation of more general competitive-enhancing macro...|$|R

The film is a satire of swashbuckling films made by Douglas Fairbanks and is loosely based on the plot of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers. The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin, but again failed at the box office. At the films premiere, Linder had said to director Robert Florey [...] "You see, Bob, <b>I</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> I'm no longer funny; I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character ...
