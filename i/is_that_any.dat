5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less likely it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, {{it is estimated that}} in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
5|$|The problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for {{departure from}} flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E

5|$|The {{two-fold}} cost of sex {{was first}} described by John Maynard Smith. The first cost {{is that in}} sexually dimorphic species {{only one of the}} two sexes can bear young. (This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many invertebrates.) The second cost <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes. Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms. The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever-changing environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} goal <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> citizen {{should not}} have to wait more than 12 minutes (in urban areas) or 20 minutes (in sparsely populated areas) for emergency services. This goal is not yet being achieved consistently.|$|E
40|$|It <b>is</b> shown <b>that</b> <b>any</b> {{two-dimensional}} spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces can be causally isomorphically {{imbedded into}} the two-dimensional Einstein's static universe.

50|$|One of the Henshaw Report’s {{recommendations}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> government {{strategy on}} child support should include {{as one of}} its key principles the provision of information and support to help parents meet their child maintenance responsibilities.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} general {{result of}} the theory states that if G is a group with Kazhdan's property (T) then G does not admit any nontrivial splitting, that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> action of G on a tree X without edge-inversions has a global fixed vertex.|$|E
25|$|Turing proved no {{algorithm}} {{exists that}} always correctly decides whether, {{for a given}} arbitrary program and input, the program halts when run with that input. The essence of Turing's proof <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> such algorithm {{can be made to}} contradict itself and therefore cannot be correct.|$|E
25|$|The lack of many {{critical}} security {{mechanisms in}} current mainstream operating systems impedes {{the implementation of}} adequate security policies at the application abstraction level. In fact, a common misconception in computer security <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> security policy can be implemented in an application regardless of kernel support.|$|E

50|$|Loy and Williams’ {{argument}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> {{change in}} Little League regulations {{had to come}} from the League headquarters in Williamsport, PA. And if they were to come, those changes could not be implemented until the following July.|$|R
25|$|A key {{characteristic}} of the grid pattern <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. Cut-through driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents. Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of 3-way intersections to alleviate it.|$|E
25|$|Minding's theorem (1839) {{states that}} all {{surfaces}} {{with the same}} constant curvature K are locally isometric. A consequence of Minding's theorem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> surface whose curvature is identically zero can be constructed by bending some plane region. Such surfaces are called developable surfaces. Minding also raised the question whether a closed surface with constant positive curvature is necessarily rigid.|$|E
25|$|So, what Arrow's theorem really shows <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> majority-wins {{electoral system}} is a non-trivial game, and that game theory {{should be used to}} predict the outcome of most voting mechanisms. This could be seen as a {{discouraging}} result, because a game need not have efficient equilibria; e.g., a ballot could result in an alternative nobody really wanted in the first place, yet everybody voted for.|$|E
50|$|Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov {{said that}} Russia intends {{to look into}} the {{legitimacy}} of the use of force by UN peacekeepers. The position of the Russian government <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> foreign interference would only lead to increasing violence.|$|R

25|$|Less trivially, it can {{be shown}} that a uniform {{structure}} that admits a countable fundamental system of entourages (and hence in particular a uniformity defined by a countable family of pseudometrics) can be defined by a single pseudometric. A consequence <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> uniform structure {{can be defined as}} above by a (possibly uncountable) family of pseudometrics (see Bourbaki: General Topology Chapter IX §1 no. 4).|$|E
25|$|Unique {{distributions}} of compounds across one or many plates {{can be employed}} either {{to increase the number}} of assays per plate or to reduce the variance of assay results, or both. The simplifying assumption made in this approach <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> N compounds in the same well will not typically interact with each other, or the assay target, in a manner that fundamentally changes the ability of the assay to detect true hits.|$|E
25|$|Each MC firm {{independently}} {{sets the}} terms of exchange for its product. The firm gives no consideration to what effect its decision may have on competitors. The theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> action will have such a negligible effect on the overall market demand that an MC firm can act without fear of prompting heightened competition. In other words, each firm feels free to set prices {{as if it were}} a monopoly rather than an oligopoly.|$|E

50|$|Reynolds {{defended by}} demurrer, contending <b>that</b> the bond <b>was</b> void {{because it was}} on a {{restraint}} of trade. His position <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> such restraint of trade was illegal per se, since it prevented him from exercising his trade as a baker.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} limitation for HDR photography <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> movement between successive images will impede {{or prevent}} success in combining them afterwards. Also, as one must create several images (often three or five and sometimes more) {{to obtain the}} desired luminance range, such a full 'set' of images takes extra time. HDR photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, {{but the use of}} a sturdy tripod is, at least, advised.|$|E
25|$|One might inquire why {{the contact}} {{potential}} {{does not appear}} in Kirchhoff's law of voltages as one contribution to the sum of potential drops. The customary answer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> circuit involves not only a particular diode or junction, but also all the contact potentials due to wiring and so forth around the entire circuit. The sum of all the contact potentials is zero, and so they may be ignored in Kirchhoff's law.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of this method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 703 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost.|$|E
5000|$|By {{using the}} highly vague and {{subjective}} term kokutai, the law attempted to blend politics and ethics, {{but the result}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> political opposition could be branded as [...] "altering the kokutai". Thus the government had carte blanche to outlaw any form of dissent.|$|R
