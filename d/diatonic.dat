5|$|In {{his use of}} {{conventional}} <b>diatonic</b> chords, Messiaen often transcended their historically banal connotations (for example, his frequent use of the added sixth chord as a resolution).|$|E
5|$|Foundational {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally <b>diatonic)</b> scales as music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen's {{music has}} been {{described}} as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it. Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and <b>diatonic</b> harmonic resolution. This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional <b>diatonic</b> harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} {{earliest}} shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers, in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple <b>diatonic</b> descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, Slovenian {{archaeologist}} Ivan Turk {{discovered a}} bone carving {{in the northwest}} region of Slovenia. The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined {{could have been used}} to play four notes of a <b>diatonic</b> scale. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument. German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a <b>diatonic</b> (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The two-octave <b>diatonic</b> {{accordion}} (gorodo), popular across Madagascar, {{is believed}} to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, the instrument was commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra. In the 1970s, the renitra was incorporated for the performance of electrified salegy music. This accordion style was also integrated into the performance of tsapika, while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of the accordion is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, accordions continue to hold a privileged place in the performance of tromba ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players. Régis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his accordion performance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, <b>diatonic,</b> and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|I. Allegro. The sonata {{begins with}} a forte, heavily {{textured}} chordal fanfare emphasizing a low A pedal and duple-meter stepwise <b>diatonic</b> ascent in thirds in the middle voices, followed immediately by quiet descending triplet arpeggios punctuated by light chords outlining a chromatic ascent. These highly contrasting phrases provide the motivic material {{for much of the}} sonata. The second theme is a lyrical melody written in four-part harmony. The exposition follows standard classical practice by modulating from tonic (A) to dominant (E) for the second theme, even preparing the latter tonality with its own V – the only first movement {{to do so in the}} mature Schubert. Despite this traditional approach, both exposition themes are built in an innovative ternary form, and in each resulting 'B' section a highly chromatic development-like section based on the exposition's second phrase modulates through the circle of fourths, only to return to the tonic. This novel structure creates a sense of harmonic movement without actually committing to a thematic modulation, and is one of the techniques Schubert uses to achieve a sense of scale in the movement. The development proper is based on a scalar variation of the second theme heard at the end of the exposition. Here, in contrast to the striking modulatory excursions nested in the exposition, the tonal plan is static, shifting constantly between C major and B major (later B minor). After the development theme is finally stated in the tonic minor, the dramatic retransition has the unconventional role of only shifting to the major mode to prepare the recapitulation, rather than fully preparing the tonic key (which in this case has already been established). The recapitulation is traditional – staying in the tonic, and emphasizing the tonic minor and the flat submediant (F major) as subdominant tonalities. The coda restates the first theme, this time in a much more 'hesitant' manner, pianissimo and with further allusions to subdominant tonalities. The movement ends with serene arpeggios; however, for the penultimate chord, Schubert chose a striking Italian sixth on II, instead of the more usual dominant or diminished seventh chords. This choice is not arbitrary – it is a final statement of the chromatically-based ascending minor second motive that pervaded the movement, a motive that will be reversed into a descending minor second in the following movement.|$|E
25|$|The semitone {{appeared}} in the music theory of Greek antiquity {{as part of a}} <b>diatonic</b> or chromatic tetrachord, and it has always had a place in the <b>diatonic</b> scales of Western music since. The various modal scales of medieval music theory were all based upon this <b>diatonic</b> pattern of tones and semitones.|$|E
25|$|The <b>diatonic</b> {{circle of}} fifths is {{the circle of}} fifths {{encompassing}} only members of the <b>diatonic</b> scale. Therefore, it contains a diminished fifth, in C major between B and F. See structure implies multiplicity.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the names}} <b>diatonic</b> and {{chromatic}} {{are often used}} for these intervals, their musical function {{is not the same}} as the two meantone semitones. For instance, 15:14 would usually be written as an augmented unison, functioning as the chromatic counterpart to a <b>diatonic</b> 16:15. These distinctions are highly dependent on the musical context, and just intonation is not particularly well suited to chromatic usage (<b>diatonic</b> semitone function is more prevalent).|$|E
25|$|The {{chromatic}} semitone {{is usually}} {{smaller than the}} <b>diatonic.</b> In the common quarter-comma meantone, tuned as a cycle of tempered fifths from E to G, the chromatic and <b>diatonic</b> semitones are 76.0 and 117.1 cents wide respectively.|$|E
25|$|Bells {{are usually}} tuned to a <b>Diatonic</b> major scale, with the tenor bell being the tonic (or key) {{note of the}} scale. Some towers have extra bells, {{indicated}} by the + sign, which are used to allow different subsets of the full number to be rung, still to a <b>diatonic</b> scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrument}} was originally a <b>diatonic</b> instrument and, despite {{the addition of}} chromatic strings in the 1920s, it has continued to be played as a <b>diatonic</b> instrument. Most contemporary concert instruments have a mechanism that allows for rapid re-tuning of the instrument into different keys. These mechanisms were first included in concert instruments in the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The smaller {{chromatic}} and <b>diatonic</b> semitones {{differ from}} the larger by the syntonic comma (81:80 or 21.5 cents). The smaller and larger chromatic semitones {{differ from the}} respective <b>diatonic</b> semitones by the same 128:125 diesis as the above meantone semitones. Finally, while the inner semitones differ by the diaschisma (2048:2025 or 19.6 cents), the outer differ by the greater diesis (648:625 or 62.6 cents).|$|E
25|$|The <b>diatonic</b> scale {{appears in}} writing {{throughout}} history, consisting of seven tones in each octave. In just intonation the <b>diatonic</b> scale may be easily constructed using the three simplest intervals within the octave, the perfect fifth (3/2), perfect fourth (4/3), {{and the major}} third (5/4). As forms of the fifth and third are naturally present in the overtone series of harmonic resonators, {{this is a very}} simple process.|$|E
25|$|The minor second {{occurs in}} the major scale, between {{the third and fourth}} degree, (mi (E) and fa (F) in C major), and between the seventh and eighth degree (ti (B) and do (C) in C major). It is also called the <b>diatonic</b> semitone because it occurs between steps in the <b>diatonic</b> scale. The minor second is {{abbreviated}} m2 (or 2). Its inversion is the major seventh (M7, or +7).|$|E
25|$|All <b>diatonic</b> {{intervals}} can {{be expressed}} as an equivalent number of semitones. For instance a whole tone equals two semitones.|$|E
25|$|Tyrolian Drehleier (Austria). Very {{similar to}} the tekerőlant, but usually has a <b>diatonic</b> keyboard. May be the {{historical}} source for the tekerő.|$|E
25|$|Corsican musical {{instruments}} include the caramusa (cornemuse bagpipe), cetera (16-stringed lute), mandulina (mandolin), pifana (a type of gemshorn) and urganettu (<b>diatonic</b> accordion).|$|E
25|$|It can {{be thought}} of as the {{difference}} between three octaves and five just fifths, and functions as a <b>diatonic</b> semitone in a Pythagorean tuning.|$|E
25|$|In music theory, a {{distinction}} is made between a <b>diatonic</b> semitone, or minor second (an interval encompassing two staff positions, e.g. from C to D) and a chromatic semitone or augmented unison (an interval between two notes {{at the same}} staff position, e.g. from C to C). These are enharmonically equivalent when twelve-tone equal temperament is used, but {{are not the same}} thing in meantone temperament, where the <b>diatonic</b> semitone is distinguished from and larger than the chromatic semitone (augmented unison.) See Interval (music)#Number for more details about this terminology.|$|E
25|$|The Pythagorean limma and Pythagorean apotome are enharmonic {{equivalents}} (chromatic semitones) {{and only}} a Pythagorean comma apart, in contrast to <b>diatonic</b> and chromatic semitones in meantone temperament and 5-limit just intonation.|$|E
25|$|After Le Grand Macabre, Ligeti would {{abandon the}} use of pastiche, but would {{increasingly}} incorporate consonant harmonies (even major and minor triads) into his work, albeit not in a <b>diatonic</b> context.|$|E
25|$|Naturals in {{that table}} {{are not the}} {{alphabetic}} series A to G without sharps and flats: Naturals are reciprocals of terms in the Harmonic series (mathematics), which are in practice multiples of a fundamental frequency. This may be derived by proceeding with the principle that historically gives the Pythagorean <b>diatonic</b> and chromatic scales, stacking perfect fifths with 3:2 frequency proportions (C-G-D-A-E). Considering the anhemitonic scale as a subset of a just <b>diatonic</b> scale, it is tuned thus: 20:24:27:30:36 (A-C-D-E-G = 5/3-1/1-9/8-5/4-3/2). Assigning precise frequency proportions to the pentatonic scales of most cultures is problematic as tuning may be variable.|$|E
25|$|Like meantone temperament, Pythagorean tuning is {{a broken}} circle of fifths. This creates two {{distinct}} semitones, but because Pythagorean tuning {{is also a}} form of 3-limit just intonation, these semitones are rational. Also, unlike most meantone temperaments, the chromatic semitone {{is larger than the}} <b>diatonic.</b>|$|E
25|$|In meantone systems, {{there are}} two {{different}} semitones. This results because of the break in the circle of fifths that occurs in the tuning system: <b>diatonic</b> semitones derive from a chain of five fifths that does not cross the break, and chromatic semitones come from one that does.|$|E
25|$|Music {{instruction}} {{begins with}} singing {{in early childhood}} and choral instruction remains an important component {{through the end of}} high school. Pupils usually learn to play pentatonic flutes, recorders and/or lyres in the early elementary grades. Around age 9, <b>diatonic</b> recorders and orchestral instruments are introduced.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{keyboard}} instrument using his 31-note-to-the-octave system survives from the Renaissance: the ‘Clavemusicum Omnitonum Modulis Diatonicis Cromaticis et Enearmonicis', built by Vito Trasuntino of Venice in 1606 {{to play the}} <b>diatonic,</b> chromatic and enharmonic. It is {{on display at the}} International museum and library of music in Bologna.|$|E
25|$|Another {{construction}} works backward: It omits two pitches from a <b>diatonic</b> scale. If {{one were to}} begin with a C major scale, for example, one might omit the fourth and the seventh scale degrees, F and B. The remaining notes then makes up the major pentatonic scale: C, D, E, G, and A.|$|E
25|$|Early plainchant, {{like much}} of Western music, is {{believed}} to have been distinguished by the use of the <b>diatonic</b> scale. Modal theory, which postdates the composition of the core chant repertory, arises from a synthesis of two very different traditions: the speculative tradition of numerical ratios and species inherited from ancient Greece and a second tradition rooted in the practical art of cantus. The earliest writings that deal with both theory and practice include the Enchiriadis group of treatises, which circulated in the late ninth century and possibly have their roots in an earlier, oral tradition. In contrast to the ancient Greek system of tetrachords (a collection of four continuous notes) that descend by two tones and a semitone, the Enchiriadis writings base their tone-system on a tetrachord that corresponds to the four finals of chant, D, E, F, and G. The disjunct tetrachords in the Enchiriadis system have been the subject of much speculation, because they do not correspond to the <b>diatonic</b> framework that became the standard Medieval scale (for example, there is a high F#, a note not recognized by later Medieval writers). A <b>diatonic</b> scale with a chromatically alterable b/b-flat was first described by Hucbald, who adopted the tetrachord of the finals (D, E, F, G) and constructed the rest of the system following the model of the Greek Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems. These were the first steps in forging a theoretical tradition that corresponded to chant.|$|E
25|$|In music theory, the tritone is {{strictly}} {{defined as a}} musical interval composed of three adjacent whole tones. For instance, the interval from F up to the B above it (in short, F–B) is a tritone {{as it can be}} decomposed into the three adjacent whole tones F–G, G–A, and A–B. According to this definition, within a <b>diatonic</b> scale there is only one tritone for each octave. For instance, the above-mentioned interval F–B is the only tritone formed from the notes of the C major scale. A tritone is also commonly defined as an interval spanning six semitones. According to this definition, a <b>diatonic</b> scale contains two tritones for each octave. For instance, the above-mentioned C major scale contains the tritones F–B (from F to the B above it, also called augmented fourth) and B–F (from B to the F above it, also called diminished fifth, semidiapente, or semitritonus).|$|E
25|$|The sring (also called blul) is a {{relatively}} small, end-blown flute with a nasal tone quality found in the Caucasus region of Eastern Armenia. It is made of wood or cane, usually with seven finger holes and one thumb hole, producing a <b>diatonic</b> scale. One Armenian musicologist believes the sring {{to be the most}} characteristic of national Armenian instruments.|$|E
25|$|Although {{best known}} as a folk instrument, it has grown in {{popularity}} among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is , written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of Paris. Other composers, including the Russian Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, the Italian Umberto Giordano, and the American Charles Ives (1915), wrote works for the <b>diatonic</b> button accordion.|$|E
