Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. <b>I</b> <b>send</b> you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|Elgar {{was another}} {{composer}} who had cause {{to be grateful}} to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the Queen's Hall in March 1920 to [...] "great applause" [...] and [...] "frantic enthusiasm", the composer wrote to him: [...] "With the sounds ringing in my ears <b>I</b> <b>send</b> a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym.... I feel that my reputation {{in the future is}} safe in your hands." [...] Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought [...] "the grandeur and nobility of the work" [...] to wider public attention.|$|E

500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as {{you have been a}} father, a benefactor and a friend for me. It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, <b>I</b> <b>send</b> you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you." [...] In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth {{was the only one of}} Verdi's operas of his [...] "early period" [...] to remain regularly in the international repertoire, although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with 100PercentRock.com, Yamano explained that her process for writing and recording has not changed substantially from the band's early days: [...] "I’m lazy and I don’t start writing songs until we book recording studio , but once we booked the studio, I can write songs quickly with concentration. Then <b>I</b> <b>send</b> my demo to our members and we rehearse. At the recording studio, we start to record from basic tracks then overdub." [...] On this album, {{every member of the}} band also sings a unique song about a food item; Yamano sings [...] "Fortune Cookie", the band's bassist Ritsuko Taneda lends her vocals to [...] "Ramen Rock", and drummer Emi Morimoto can be heard on [...] "Green Tea". The first song was inspired by Yamano fondness for eating a fortune cookie after a meal of Chinese food in America; after learning that the cookies were actually invented in Japan, Yamano decided to pen the song. [...] "Ramen Rock" [...] was inspired by Taneda's habit of eating ramen after every show. Finally, Yamano asked Morimoto to sing [...] "Green Tea" [...] because she is from Kyoto, which is known for its green tea.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} {{subjects of}} Wright's paintings {{from this time}} were meant {{to appeal to the}} wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the Lunar Society: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who later commissioned paintings from him. The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like The Orrery, Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates, who already owned Wright's Gladiator. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: Pd£200 is shown in one place and £210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for £130, stating that the low price [...] "might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when <b>I</b> <b>send</b> you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum." [...] Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received £30 in part payment.|$|E

500|$|On November 18, the {{impatient}} Roosevelt directed {{that the}} second set of dies be used to strike coins, directly ordering the Mint to [...] "begin the new issue, even if it takes you all day to strike one piece!" [...] Over 12,000 of these [...] "High Relief" [...] pieces were struck and were released into circulation in 1907 and 1908. [...] Barber wrote of the High Relief pieces to Landis, [...] "Mr. Hart has put the mill into operation and <b>I</b> <b>send</b> you two pieces showing the result; these are not selected as all the coins now made are the same as these two, which gives me alarm as they are so well made that I fear the President may demand the continuance of this particular coin." [...] Barber completed work on his version of the design, with a greatly lowered relief, and the new coin went into production on a large-scale basis. [...] A total of 361,667of the revised design were produced by the Mint in 1907; the [...] "Low Relief" [...] coins were released into circulation at the end of [...] [...] Barber's modifications were denounced both by the sculptor's family and by Hering. [...] Among other alterations, Barber changed the Roman numeral MCMVII for the date to the Arabic numeral [...] "1907". [...] In spite of the modifications, according to R.S.
