40|$|Mold powders {{are mainly}} formed of such oxides as SiO 2, CaO, Al 2 O 3, Na 2 O along with F − and C. One {{of the main}} con-stitutional composes of mold powders is F−, which is {{utilized}} in chemical composition of mold powders due to its fea-tures of controlling viscosity and producing desired lubrication between solidified steel shell and mold. However, the emission of F − through such compositions as HF (g) causes health and environmental problems. The purpose {{of this research is}} to decrease, and subsequently substitute, F − in chemical composition of a lubricating high speed powder, which is used in continuous casting of steel industry. A combination of Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 compositions to substitute F − in chemical composition of a fluorine-free mold powder was used to meet the purpose of this research. In addition, nine powder samples (A-I) with laboratory scale were prepared. In order to evaluate the samples ’ viscosity behavior, <b>groove</b> <b>viscometer</b> test and image analysis software was used and to evaluate the crystalline behavior of samples C and G, XRD and SEM analyses were conducted. The results of these analyses demonstrated that the fluorine-free sample, due to its viscosity resemblance in comparison with molten reference powder and through creation of such crystalline phases as Perovskite (CaTiO 3) and Fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4), will result in viscosity control of the mold powder and therefore optimizing continuous casting conditions. Finally, it is possible to derive that this sample may be an appropriate substitution for the reference powder being utilized in steel continuous casting industry...|$|E
