40|$|The {{leaves of}} Syngonium {{podophyllum}} were examined microscopically {{to determine the}} distribution of both druse and raphide <b>idioblasts.</b> Druse crystal <b>idioblasts</b> are small spherical cells found throughout the lamina mostly in sub-epidermal areas. Two types of raphide <b>idioblasts</b> were observed in the leaves of Syngonium podophyllum: the non defensive raphide <b>idioblasts,</b> which are elongated or more or less egg shaped cells usually found embedded in tissues of the leaf margins; and the defensive raphide <b>idioblasts,</b> also elongated cells, but usually found suspended between mesophyll cells in leaf airspaces. The average densities of raphide cells were highest in young leaf than the mature leaf and average densities of druse cells were highest in mature leaf than the young leaf. The raphide and druse cells showed a bilaterally symmetrical distribution during all stages from young to mature leaves but, generally contain more druses than raphides...|$|R

(Agavaceae), which {{are similar to}} its intact roots, develop {{uninterrupted}} files of calcium oxalate crystal <b>idioblasts</b> with raphide bundles in their cortex, beginning just proximal to the terminal meristem. Each single file of <b>idioblasts</b> displays a basipetal ontogenetic sequence. [1 - 14 C]glycolic acid, [1 - 14 C]glyoxylic acid, and L-[1 - 14 C]ascorbic acid, {{all of which are}} potential precursors of oxalate, were each added to different flasks that contained a sterile liquid medium and isolated roots and were allowed to interact with the roots for 45 min. After thorough washing, the roots grew for periods that extended from 1. 6 h to 24 h postincorporation before being fixed for light microscope autoradiography. Autoradiography of root sections with the L-[1 - 14 C]ascorbic acid at the 1. 6 – 6. 0 -h incorporation times showed concentrations of silver grains over the <b>idioblasts,</b> primarily over the vacuole crystal bundles and cytoplasmic plastids. The [1 - 14 C]glyoxalic acid– and [1 - 14 C]glycolic acid–labeled root sections showed a smaller amount of silver grains distributed over the entire sections, but these grains were not concentrated over the crystal <b>idioblasts.</b> These results strongly indicate that the L-[1 - 14 C]ascorbic acid is the immediate precursor of oxalate in the crystal <b>idioblasts</b> of Y. torreyi primary roots and support more recent biochemical data regarding oxalate synthesis in higher plants. The use of roots in liquid culture containing uninterrupted files of developing crystal <b>idioblasts</b> could serve as a model system for additional biochemical, physiological, and molecular studies that seek to understand the formation and functional significance of crystal <b>idioblasts</b> in higher plant organs...|$|R
50|$|<b>Idioblast</b> is {{the first}} {{full-length}} album by multidisciplinary artist John Fekner, recorded and released in 1984 under the name John Fekner City Squad. Primarily a visual artist and pioneer of the Street Art movement, Fekner began using audio tapes and creating sound components {{as part of his}} stencil graffiti art installations and video projects in the late 70s. In addition to playing keyboards, electronic drums and vocals, Fekner wrote and composed the music and lyrics for the eight songs on the album. <b>Idioblast,</b> released on Fekner's own independent record label Vinyl Gridlock Records, is an experimental and eclectic mix of songs featuring extensive sampling and tape loops of TV, radio, Native American voices, phone and airport controller transmissions over rock, rap and hip-hop beats.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} on <b>Idioblast</b> focus on {{concepts}} that Fekner addresses in his outdoor spray-painted messages seen in New York and other cities in Canada, England, Sweden and Germany. Like the stenciled messages, most of lyrics are slanted ideologically {{to the left and}} serve as warnings about corporate media, television, toxic wastes and other social issues. [...] "Virtually every tune on the album is based on the Street Art experience. In a tune called Rapicasso Fekner raps, [...] "Musicians were painting, painters were playing/ Styles were blending like the current trends...Watch the street see the modern art/ It's present and future tied to his heart."" [...] Fekner parades a series of found sounds, approximate rap, beat poetry and quick-cut imagery against a steady, pre-fab pulse.

40|$|Abstract: The adventive {{root tip}} cells of a bulbous plant, Sternbergia lutea (L.) Ker-Gawl. ex Sprengel (Amaryllidaceae), were {{examined}} by LM (light microscope) and EM (electron microscope). At the meristematic {{area of the}} root tips, which was 1 mm in length, two types of cell were observed: meristematic cells and Ca-oxalate raphide crystal <b>idioblasts.</b> Ca-oxalate raphide crystal <b>idioblasts</b> were observed to lie in two lines between the inner and outer ground meristems. Some similarities and some differences were found between those cells in their ultrastructure. It was seen that the membrane thickness of crystal <b>idioblasts</b> and meristematic cells were the same. They were also found to be similar in cell content, both containing nuclei, cytoplasm, vacuoles, mitochondria and proplastids. However the organization of the cell contents, the numbers, the forms and sizes of vacuoles were different between these cell types. In some meristematic cells and <b>idioblasts</b> of certain roots, some degenerated changes were seen due to necrosis. Those changes were in the form of plasmolysis, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, chromatin roughness, karyopyknosis and organelle loss...|$|R

50|$|An <b>idioblast</b> is an {{isolated}} plant cell that differs from neighboring tissues. They have various {{functions such as}} storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin, tannin or pigments etc. Some can contain mineral crystals such as acrid tasting and poisonous calcium oxalate or carbonate or silica. Any of the tissue or tissue systems of plants can contain idioblasts. Idioblasts are divided into three main categories: excretory, tracheoid, and sclerenchymatous.|$|E
50|$|Idioblasts {{can contain}} biforine cells that form crystals. The {{chemicals}} are excreted by {{the plant and}} stored in liquid or crystalline form.

40|$|Currently, the Annonaceae {{family is}} characterised by the {{production}} of acetogenins (ACGs), and also by the biosynthesis of alkaloids, primarily benzylisoquinolines derived from tyrosine. The objective {{of this study was}} to confirm the presence of alkaloids and acetogenins in the <b>idioblasts</b> of the endosperm and the embryonic axis of A. macroprophyllata seeds in germination. The Dragendorff, Dittmar, Ellram, and Lugol reagents were used to test for alkaloids, and Kedde’s reagent was used to determine the presence of acetogenins in fresh sections of the endosperm and embryonic axis of seeds after twelve days of germination. A positive reaction was observed for all the reagents, and the presence of alkaloids and acetogenins was confirmed in the <b>idioblasts</b> of the endosperm and those involved in the differentiation of the embryonic axis of the developing seedling. We concluded that the <b>idioblasts</b> store both metabolites, acetogenins and alkaloids. Beginning at differentiation, the <b>idioblasts</b> of the embryonic axis simultaneously biosynthesise acetogenins and alkaloids that are characteristic of the species during the development of the seedling. The method used here can be applied to histochemically confirm the presence of acetogenins and alkaloids in tissues and structures of the plant in different stages of its life cycle. </p...|$|R
50|$|Tannins are {{classified}} as ergastic substances, i.e., non-protoplasm materials found in cells. Tannins, by definition, precipitate proteins. In this condition, they must be stored in organelles able to withstand the protein precipitation process. <b>Idioblasts</b> are isolated plant cells which differ from neighboring tissues and contain non-living substances. They have various functions such as storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin or pigments etc. They also can contain tannins. In Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki) fruits, tannin is accumulated in the vacuole of tannin cells, which are <b>idioblasts</b> of parenchyma cells in the flesh.|$|R

40|$|The species Lantana camara, {{commonly}} used as ornamental, has spread worldwide {{becoming one of}} the world's most important weeds. To develop new methods of control of this plant, it is essential to distinguish it from other species of the same genus, and this is usually accomplished through taxonomic studies of fertile samples. Considering the similarity between L. camara and L. radula, and the consequent difficulty in distinguishing one from the other when only sterile samples are available, this work aimed to investigate the use of the anatomical characteristics of the leaves of both species as tools for supporting correct classification. The leaves of L. camara and L. radula were anatomically examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The major differences were observed in the petiole, which presented secretory <b>idioblasts</b> in L. camara.

40|$|Leaf {{tissues of}} plants usually contain {{several types of}} idioblasts, defined as {{specialized}} cells whose shape and contents differ from the surrounding homogeneous cells. The spatial patterning of idioblasts, particularly of trichomes and guard cells, across the leaf epidermis has received considerable attention as it offers a useful biological model for studying the intercellular regulation of cell fate and patterning. Excretory idioblasts in {{the leaves of the}} aquatic monocotyledonous plant Egeria densa produced light blue autofluorescence when irradiated with ultraviolet light. The use of epifluorescence microscopy to detect this autofluorescence provided a simple and convenient method for detecting excretory idioblasts and allowed tracking of those cells across the leaf surfaces, enabling quantitative measurement of the clustering and spacing patterns of idioblasts at the whole leaf level. Occurrence of idioblasts was coordinated along the proximal-distal, medial-lateral, and adaxial-abaxial axes, producing a recognizable consensus spatial pattern of <b>idioblast</b> formation among fully expanded leaves. <b>Idioblast</b> clusters, which comprised up to nine cells aligned along the proximal-distal axis, showed no positional bias or regularity in idioblast-forming areas when compared with singlet idioblasts. Up to 75 % of idioblasts existed as clusters on every leaf side examined. The idioblast-forming areas varied between leaves, implying phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, in young expanding leaves, autofluorescence was occasionally detected in a single giant vesicle or else in one or more small vesicles, which eventually grew to occupy {{a large portion of the}} <b>idioblast</b> volume as a central vacuole. Differentiation of vacuoles by accumulating the fluorescence substance might be an integral part of <b>idioblast</b> differentiation. Red autofluorescence from chloroplasts was not detected in idioblasts of young expanding leaves, suggesting <b>idioblast</b> differentiation involves an arrest in chloroplast development at a very early stage, rather than transdifferentiation of chloroplast-containing epidermal cells...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{aspects of}} crystal idioblasts were studied in roots of Vanilla planifolia L. and Yucca torreyi L. In Vanilla, root crystal <b>idioblast</b> {{initials}} are first recognized by intense fluorescence of cytoplasmic RNA with acridine orange; nuclear and nucleolar enlargement gradually ensue. Feulgen microspectrophotometry showed that all <b>idioblast</b> nuclei are endopolyploid. Frequency distribution of individual DNA content measurements and nuclear structures suggest endomitosis to the 8 C level and heterochromatin underreplication in higher endopolyploid nuclei. Many ultrastructural features of Vanilla <b>idioblast</b> development {{are common to}} differentiation of similar cells observed in other plants. Excised primary roots of Yucca torreyi were cultured in various media, and development of coritical raphide crystal idioblasts observed with CTEM and HVEM. Idioblasts were consistently produced, required 24 hours to fully differentiate from initials in isolated root cultures, and developed normally relative to those cells in intact roots. These isolated root cultures are {{shown to be a}} well-suited system for physiological investigations of oxalate metabolism and control of <b>idioblast</b> cytodifferentiation. Cytochemical localization of three peroxisomal enzymes, glycolate oxidase, urate oxidase, and catalase was performed on tissues from Psychotria punctata leaves and Yucca torreyi roots which contain developing idioblasts. Reaction product deposition attributable to glycolate oxidase activity was never observed in any developing <b>idioblast</b> in either plant; pathways involving glycolate or glyoxylate intermediates are probably not involved in oxalate synthesis for crystal production. A survey of callus cultures from nineteen higher plant species showed that structural differentiation of idioblasts in culture is media dependent, species specific, and influenced by types of growth regulators. Also, crystal shape is determined by the cell during its differentiation and under general genetic control. Media modifications which favor cytodifferentiation of idioblasts include use if IAA as culture auxin, deletion of ammonium nitrate, and high calcium supplement. This study concludes that crystal idioblasts probably have multiple functions which vary with tissue and species specificity; however, it is not likely that these cells ever serve as depositories for oxalate as a metabolic waste product...|$|E

40|$|In Camptotheca acuminata, {{we studied}} the {{cellular}} sites of accumulation of the alkaloid camptothecin (CPT), in both plants {{grown in the}} field and those grown in a greenhouse, subjecting the latter to stress (i. e., draught, nutritional deficit, and pruning). Fresh sections of the leaf, stem, and root were analysed for the presence of CPT by examining the autofluorescence that the CPT molecule emits when exposed to UV radiation. In the plants grown in the field, CPT was observed only rarely. In the greenhouse plants, CPT had accumulated in crystalline form in the vacuole of specialised cells (i. e., segregator <b>idioblasts),</b> which were not morphologically distinguishable from the cells of the surrounding tissues. In the organs examined, the segregator <b>idioblasts</b> were localised in parenchymatic and epidermal tissues. CPT crystals were also detected in the glandular trichomes on both the stem and leaf...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of calcium oxalate crystal in the petioles and corms {{is associated with}} acridity. In this study, varietal difference {{in the distribution of}} calcium oxalate crystal <b>idioblasts</b> in taro (Colocasia esculenta Schott) were investigated. Crystals of two forms were found: bundles of needle-like crystals (raphides) and aggregates of sand-like crystal (druses). Generally, the density of druse was higher than that of raphide, and there were few raphide <b>idioblasts</b> in the corm. The density of oxalate crystal was low in the edible petiole of cv. Yatsugashira and the edible corms of cvs. Yatsugashira, Akame-daikichi, Takenokoimo and Malaysia No. 1. There were few oxalate crystals in the cormels of all cultivars. There was no correlation between the density of oxalate crystal and the concentration of insoluble oxalate. These results suggest that the edible quality is not related to the insoluble oxalate concentration but to the density of oxalate crystal...|$|R
40|$|Kalanchoe pinnata (Lam.) Pers. and K. crenata (Andrews) Haw., Crassulaceae, are popularly {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of many diseases. Their biological activities, such as anti-leishmaniasis and analgesic, can be useful in phytotherapy. Both species are often misidentified as the other, because of their similar popular uses and names, and the similar external morphology of the leaves. We investigated the existence of anatomical characters that will permit correct identification of the species grown in shade and in sun conditions. We also contribute with new observations on the leaf anatomy of K. pinnata and K. crenata. Fixed (FAA 70) leaves were used, and their sections were embedded in Leica historesin. Hydathodes were observed in both species, {{and for the first time}} were anatomically described in K. crenata. The species showed anatomical differences in relation to the presence of epidermal <b>idioblasts</b> only in K. crenata, the different pattern of distribution of subepidermal <b>idioblasts,</b> and the presence of leaf buds only in K. pinnata...|$|R
