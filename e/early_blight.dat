60|$|I do {{not know}} whether ladies thus {{indicate}} their interest in the occupations of their casual neighbours at the hospitable board. But if they {{do not know}} me, or do not know me well, they generally ask 'Are you writing anything now?' (as if they should ask a painter 'Are you painting anything now?' or a lawyer 'Have you any cases at present?'). Sometimes they are more definite and inquire 'What are you writing now?' as if I must be writing something--which, indeed, is the case, though I dislike being reminded of it. It is an awkward question, because the fair being does not care a bawbee what I am writing; nor would she be much enlightened if I replied 'Madam, I am engaged on a treatise intended to prove that Normal is prior to Conceptional Totemism'--though that answer would be as true in fact as obscure in significance. The best plan seems to be to answer that I have entirely abandoned mere literature, and am contemplating a book on 'The Causes of <b>Early</b> <b>Blight</b> in the Potato,' a melancholy circumstance which threatens to deprive us of our chief esculent root. The inquirer would never be undeceived. One nymph who, like the rest, could not keep off the horrid topic of my occupation, said 'You never write anything but fairy books, do you?' A French gentleman, too, an educationist and expert in portraits of Queen Mary, once sent me a newspaper article in which he had written that I was exclusively devoted to the composition of fairy books, and nothing else. He then came to England, visited me, and found that I knew rather more about portraits of Queen Mary than he did.|$|E

50|$|Pests and {{diseases}} of African nightshade {{are similar to}} those of Solanaceae family and include aphids, spider mites, and <b>early</b> <b>blight.</b> Aphids feed by sucking plant sap, causing the leaves to curl, which is unattractive to customers, as well as a chance of drying out or death of the plant. Regular monitoring and spot spraying with biopesticides, when necessary, can help reduce infestations. The feeding of spider mites may cause a decrease in plant growth, flowering, and number of berries and seeds. Avoiding particular pyrethroids may help reduce the occurrence of spider mite outbreaks. Overhead irrigation or strong jet wash plants can knock off spider mites and destroy their webs. <b>Early</b> <b>blight</b> causes brown leaf spots, up to 1 cm in diameter in a circular pattern. It often occurs under warm conditions, beginning on the oldest leaves, making its way up the plant. You can avoid <b>early</b> <b>blight</b> by rotating with other crops like amaranth, but not other vegetables of the same family, which are susceptible to the same diseases.|$|E

60|$|On {{the next}} morning Harry Clavering rode over to Stratton, {{thinking}} much of his misery as he went. It was all very well for him, {{in the presence of}} his own family to talk of his profession as the one subject which was to him of any importance; but he knew very well himself that he was only beguiling them in doing so. This question of a profession was, after all, but dead leaves to him--to him who had a canker at his heart, a perpetual thorn in his bosom, a misery within him which no profession could mitigate! Those dear ones at home guessed nothing of this, and he would take care that they should guess nothing. Why should they have the pain of knowing that he had been made wretched forever by blighted hopes? His mother, indeed, had suspected something in those sweet days of his roaming with Julia through the park. She had once or twice said a word to warn him. But of the very truth of his deep love--so he told himself--she had been happily ignorant. Let her be ignorant. Why should he make his mother unhappy? As these thoughts passed through his mind, I think that he revelled in his wretchedness, and made much to himself of his misery. He sucked in his sorrow greedily, and was somewhat proud to have had occasion to break his heart. But not the less, because he was thus <b>early</b> <b>blighted,</b> would he struggle for success in the world. He would show her that, as his wife, she might have had a worthier position than Lord Ongar could give her. He, too, might probably rise the quicker in the world, as now he would have no impediment of wife or family. Then, as he rode along, he composed a sonnet, fitting to his case, the strength and rhythm of which seemed to him, as he sat on horseback, to be almost perfect. Unfortunately, when he was back at Clavering, and sat in his room with the pen in his hand, the turn of the words had escaped him.|$|R
60|$|The true {{history of}} Lord and Lady Byron {{has long been}} {{perfectly}} understood in many circles in England; but the facts were of a nature {{that could not be}} made public. While there was a young daughter living whose future might be prejudiced by its recital, and while there were other persons on whom the disclosure of the real truth would have been crushing as an avalanche, Lady Byron's only course was the perfect silence in which she took refuge, and those sublime works of charity and mercy to which she consecrated her <b>blighted</b> <b>early</b> life.|$|R

He joined the Royal Fusiliers in 1886 but his <b>early</b> career was <b>blighted</b> by several bouts of illness and {{he spent much of}} his time in administrative and staff roles.

5000|$|Scouting: Disease {{scouting}} {{is critical}} to catch ascochyta <b>blight</b> <b>early.</b> It is recommended to begin scouting during the vegetative stage and to continue scouting into the early flowering stage. The {{reason for this is}} to observe whether disease symptoms are moving upwards and are present on tendrils and flowers. If symptoms of ascochyta blight are present in at least 50% of the bottom third of the crop canopy and are progressing into the middle third of the canopy, fungicide control may be recommended. A few other reasons to use fungicides are if the weather has been humid, if there is a forecast for rain, and if a high yield of peas would justify the cost of spraying fungicides.|$|R
5000|$|Plainview {{remained}} a farming community, famous for growing cucumbers for the huge Heinz pickle factories located in nearby Farmingdale and Hicksville. In the <b>early</b> 1900s <b>blight</b> destroyed the cucumber crop and many farmers switched to potatoes. After World War II, a potato blight {{combined with the}} desire of many returning GIs to leave New York City for the more rural Long Island, convinced many farmers to sell their property, leading to massive development in the area, giving rise to so-called suburban sprawl. Between 1950 and 1960, the hamlet grew from a population of 1,155 to more than 35,000. Most of the available land was developed during this period or otherwise designated as parkland. While overall development declined it did continue sporadically as smaller remaining parcels of land were also developed. In recent years, some of few large remaining parcels {{have given way to}} gated communities, which are in contrast to most housing in the area. Some of these developments include [...] "The Hamlet on Olde Oyster Bay" [...] and [...] "The Seasons at Plainview", a residential community focused on over age 55 residents and first time home buyers.|$|R
50|$|Because A. solani {{is one of}} {{numerous}} tomato/potato pathogens that are typically controlled with the same products, accurately estimating both the total economic loss and the total expenditure on fungicides for control of <b>early</b> <b>blight</b> is difficult. Best estimates suggest that total annual global expenditures on fungicide control of A. solani is approximately $77 million: $32 million for tomatoes and $45 million for potatoes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Early</b> <b>blight</b> {{caused by}} A. solani {{is the most}} {{destructive}} disease of tomatoes in the tropical and subtropical regions. Each 1% increase in intensity can reduce yield by 1.36%, and complete crop failure can occur when the disease is most severe. Yield losses of up to 79% {{have been reported in}} the U.S., of which 20-40% is due to seedling losses (i.e., collar rot) in the field.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the causal}} {{pathogen}} is distributed worldwide {{and can cause}} crop yield reductions, <b>early</b> <b>blight</b> has never caused widespread famine or other sudden and major detrimental effects on humanity. The disease {{is not to be}} confused with late blight, which is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Late blight disease together with the socio-economic situation at the time was responsible for the Irish potato famine.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Mayor Ray Nagin {{threatened}} {{to use his}} powers of eminent domain to seize vacant, severely damaged properties in all of New Orleans {{that had not been}} gutted or scheduled to be gutted before <b>early</b> 2007. Such <b>blighted</b> properties had been creating serious problems for returned New Orleanians, including infestations of rats and other vermin. Similar actions to seize abandoned blighted property are in effect in other Louisiana parishes, as well as in Mississippi counties affected by the storm. However, as hundreds of thousands of locals were still waiting for promised insurance or Road Home money, many of the poor lacked resources to work on their houses. The neighborhood had few stores and only a handful of schools reopened.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} of Sangret's early life, but his family was poor, his <b>early</b> years were <b>blighted</b> with illness, {{and at least one}} of his {{siblings}} died at an early age from tuberculosis. Sangret received no schooling in his childhood, and was unable to read, or to write beyond signing his own name. Nonetheless, he has been described as being modestly intelligent, and in possession of an excellent memory. In addition to English, Sangret spoke the Cree language fluently, and learned some of the traditional skills of his ancestors in his youth, some of which were honed throughout the years he worked as a farm labourer in the town of Maidstone in the 1920s. As a result of this outdoor work, Sangret developed a lithe, muscular physique.|$|R
5000|$|In {{its early}} days, {{this area of}} Darien Street housed only Italian families; however, after the Second World War (1939-1945), when the {{municipal}} government spoke of building a cross-town highway, the families moved out. Most of the houses date from 1885 (built for the artisans and craftsmen who worked and lived in the area), but, when the Italian Americans moved out, the community's low-rent houses went to poor African American families. Moreover, by the <b>early</b> 1970s, <b>blighted</b> Darien Street was at its lowest point as a community, because the houses held little property value, many were abandoned, having broken heaters and collapsed roofs, et cetera. Furthermore, the houses were very small — approximately 15 ft wide and 15 ft deep, each had three one-room stories (locally known, and still currently advertised as a [...] "Trinity" [...] style house) and the largest yard was 8 ft deep. Despite the decay, Darien Street remained charmed with European echoes, each house was architecturally different, contributing to the street's community character; children were safe, there was no car traffic. The closeness of the houses generated a closely knit community located just {{to the south of}} Center City, an inexpensive residential neighborhood a short distance from the city-life amenities of Philadelphia; the city government did not hesitate to rehabilitate it.|$|R
