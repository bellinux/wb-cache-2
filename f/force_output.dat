25|$|As the pennate {{muscle is}} activated, the fibers rotate as they shorten and pull {{at an angle}}. In pennate muscles, fibers are {{oriented}} {{at an angle to}} the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. <b>Force</b> <b>output</b> is dependent upon the angle of fiber rotation, so changes in muscle thickness and the vector of change in thickness vary; based upon the force being produced. Due to the rotational motion; pennate muscles operate at low velocities (low shortening distance). The shortening velocity of the pennate muscle as a whole is greater than that of the individual fibers. This gives rise to the property of AGR. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). Azizi and Brainerd demonstrated that the gear ratio of pennate muscle can vary; dependent on external load.|$|E

2500|$|Central fatigue is a {{reduction}} in the neural drive or nerve-based motor command to working muscles that results in a decline in the <b>force</b> <b>output..</b> [...] It has been suggested that the reduced neural drive during exercise may be a protective mechanism to prevent organ failure if the work was continued at the same intensity. There has {{been a great deal of}} interest in the role of serotonergic pathways for several years because its concentration in the brain increases with motor activity. During motor activity, serotonin released in synapses that contact motoneurons promotes muscle contraction. During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on the axon initial segment of motoneurons with the result that nerve impulse initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.|$|E

The development of one component of a biorobotic system, an artificial muscle and tendon, is reported here. The device is based on known static and dynamic properties of biological muscle and tendon that were extracted from the literature and used to mathematically describe their force, length, and velocity relationships. A flexible pneumatic actuator is proposed as the contractile element of the artificial muscle and experimental results are presented that show the force-length properties of the actuator are muscle-like, but the force-velocity properties are not.

Ten young men performed sustained grip tests with 2 grip types and 3 target forces for 6 min. Lactate and maximal grip strength were measured before, just after and 4 min and 7 min after each grip test. SMS of the forearm was measured every 30 s during and after each grip test. The relationships of average grip force in every 30 s between SIG and IRG were not good.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 Biorobotic {{research}} {{seeks to}} develop new robotic technologies based {{on the performance of}} human and animal neuromuscular systems. The development of one component of a biorobotic system, an artificial muscle and tendon, is documented here. The device is based on known static and dynamic properties of biological muscle and tendon which were extracted from the literature and used to mathematically describe the unique force, length, and velocity relationships. As biological tissue exhibits wide variation in performance, ranges are identified which encompass typical behavior for design purposes. The McKibben pneumatic actuator is proposed as the contractile element of the artificial muscle. A model is presented that includes not only the geometric properties of the actuator, but also the material properties of the actuator's inner bladder and frictional effects. Experimental evidence is presented that validates the model and shows the force-length properties to be muscle-like, while the force-velocity properties are not. The addition of a hydraulic damper is proposed to improve the actuator's velocity-dependent properties, complete with computer simulations and experimental evidence validating the design process. Furthermore, an artificial tendon is proposed to serve as connective tissue between the artificial muscle and a skeleton. A series of experimental tests verifies that the design provides suitable tendon-like performance. A complete model of the artificial musculo-tendon system is then presented which predicts the expected force-length-velocity performance of the artificial system. Based on the model predictions, an artificial muscle was assembled and subjected to numerous performance tests. The results exhibited muscle-like performance in general higher activation pressures yielded higher <b>output</b> <b>forces,</b> faster concentric contractions resulted in lower <b>force</b> <b>outputs,</b> faster eccentric contractions produced higher <b>force</b> <b>outputs,</b> and <b>output</b> <b>forces</b> were higher at longer muscle lengths than shorter lengths.

Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} rigid pneumatic cylinder, the pneumatic muscle has many outstanding advantages such as large ratio between <b>output</b> <b>force</b> and diameter, large ratio between <b>output</b> <b>force</b> and weight.

In this paper, two different diameters pneumatic muscle, combined with the parallel and synchronous toggle force-amplified mechanism, {{a new type of}} multi-point press has been innovated. The large-diameter pneumatic muscle will be used for the working stroke of the pressure travel, while the small-diameter pneumatic muscle will be used for the return travel. The tension of the pneumatic muscle will decrease with the increases of the contraction; the force-amplified coefficient of the toggle mechanism will increase with the decrease of the pressure angle, which is taken full account of this complementary relationship between them. So the <b>output</b> <b>force</b> curve of the press is improved smoothly...|$|R
