[...] The defense presentation took place from January 19-21. Clinton's defense counsel argued that Clinton's grand jury testimony had too many inconsistencies to be a clear case of perjury, that the investigation and impeachment had been tainted by partisan political bias, that the President's approval rating of more than 70 percent indicated that his ability to govern had not been impaired by the scandal, and that the managers had ultimately presented [...] "an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that {{does not meet the}} constitutional standard to remove the President from office." [...] January 22 and 23 were devoted to questions from members of the Senate to the House managers and Clinton's defense counsel.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the debate regarding {{the ethics of}} immigration based on four different theorists {{with an emphasis on}} method. The methods used are theory of argumentation by professor in critical thinking, Alec Fisher and wide reflective equilibrium by philosopher John Rawls. These methods are used to determine the best way of debating the ethics of immigration and to decide if the right immigration ethic exists. The first part of the paper is an analysis of argumentation with the purpose of identifying the different premises and thereby highlighting the intuitions and principles they are based on. This leads to a discussion of the difference between these premises in which they will be challenged by the method of wide reflective equilibrium. Furthermore these intuitions and principles are confronted with the following cases: the contemporary refugee crises along with the persecution of the Jews in the time before World War II. Hereby the ethical principles and the themes of national identity and state autonomy are discussed in relation to proven <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> knowledge. To determine which way is the most efficient in debating the ethics of immigration is difficult. Based on this paper indirect cosmopolitanism seems to be a reasonable way of thinking in terms of immigration...|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, this volume brings {{together}} {{experts in the}} fields of criminology, criminal law and criminal justice from across the Balkans, to discuss {{the state of the art}} of criminology and current crime trends in a region that has thus far largely been neglected by European criminological research. The first chapter analytically describes and defines the Balkan region, not only as a unique historical region, but also as a religious and legal territory, as well as a region of migration and violence and a criminological region sui generis. These facts are used to explore and promote the likely benefits of a coherent regional criminological research approach – with the long-term goal of creating a sustainable ‘criminological landscape’. Contributions from all members of the Balkan Criminology Network – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey – then provide an in-depth overview of <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> information about criminological education and research and data about crime, general crime trends, and current crime and criminal justice challenges. The final chapter presents selected research projects from the actual research agenda of the Max Planck Partner Group for Balkan Criminology (MPPG). This selection makes the book an essential reader for anyone interested in the current criminological setting of the Balkans and an excellent starting point for regional or country specific crime research...|$|E
40|$|This unit {{focuses on}} the {{dimension}} of habitat to teach key concepts about sustainable development appropriate for Grades K – 4. It {{is the goal of}} the unit to have students increase their understanding of habitat problems related to sustainable development, to examine new ideas and develop creative solutions. Using the Unit This unit contains three lessons with specific objectives and learning outcomes. It is the goal of this unit for students to define and provide simple examples of the basic concepts of sustainable development as they relate to habitat and carrying capacity. Although the activities can be taught as separate exercises, the content builds on previous activities and contains more mature concepts in the later activities. The culminating activity of this unit is a case-problem intended to give older students a deeper understanding of some sustainable development concepts. Students are encouraged to think creatively. Students will be asked to evaluate the consequences of the decisions made. The economic, ecological, and social/ecumenical concerns of each solution will be examined. The case begins with a presentation of the problem and includes key <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> information related to the case. A list of resources (websites, articles, and other publications) are provided to allow students to do additional research to enhance their knowledge and create more informed solutions. Working in teams, the students propose a solution that they feel best reflects a sustainable development perspective. Students analyze the likely consequences of their solution using the sustainable development choices and consequences questionnaire provided. They will examine the economic, ecological, and social/ecumenical aspects of their choices. Students present their proposed solution to the class as a debate, skit, poster, or traditional paper. Unit Content In the context of our Soft vs Hard Green Framework (see Chapter 2), the teacher can introduce the philosophical concepts of anthropocentrism (human-centered), biocentrism (nature-centered), and eco-centrism (human/nature balance).

40|$|Understanding {{the place}} is an {{important}} step in cultural heritage management. Conservation Plan of James Kerr, which was derived from the principles of Burra Charter, pointed out that in preparing conservation plan for a heritage place, we should start from understanding the place. This includes gathering both documentary and physical evidences for coordination and analysis before assessing and stating the significance of the heritage place. This information will eventually become part of the conservation plan. Understanding is a process. It first involves the identification of the landscape assets of the place. Without the background information of the place, the formulation of any conservation plan {{may not be able to}} reflect the cultural significance of the place. Thus, all conservation works should start with understanding the place. King George V Memorial Park (the Park) located between Hospital Road and High Street at Sai Ying Pun of Hong Kong Island is a very special place in the western part of Hong Kong. The place where the Park is located, evolutes with the urban development at Sai Ying Pun and eventually becomes the major cultural landscape of the district. To understanding the Park, it is important to understand the historical development of the place and how it evolves into the Park. The original setting and context of the place can still be found on site. Investigation of these traits may reveal the historical importance of the place and lead to the understanding of the changing cultural landscape there. The layout and masonry walls of the Park exhibit certain trait of military structures. Through investigation, the wall was found to be the remnant of an important medical complex in early Hong Kong. The wall may help in reconstructing the early medical history and the development in the district and also the whole territory. However, the historical background of the site was fading out and only a few character-defining elements could still be traced. With the information available, it is suggest 5 ed to re-define the heritage significance of the Park. With a clear understanding on the historical <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> of the sites, it is hoped that proper conservation programme may be formulated to address the need. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} research on informa-tion extraction and constructing RDF knowledge bases. In general, {{the goal is to}} extract all relevant information from a corpus of doc-uments, store it into an ontology, and answer future queries based only on the created knowledge base. Thus, the original documents become dispensable. On the one hand, an ontology is a conve-nient and non-redundant structured source of information, based on which specific queries can be answered efficiently. On the other hand, many users doubt the correctness of <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> ontology sub-graphs presented to them as query results without proof. Instead, users often wish to verify the obtained facts or subgraphs by read-ing about them in context, i. e., in a document relating the <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> providing <b>background</b> information. In this demo, we present ROXXI, a system operating on top of an existing knowledge base and reviving the abandoned witness documents. In doing so, it goes the opposite way of information extraction approaches – starting with ontological <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> tracing their way back to the documents they were extracted from. ROXXI offers interfaces for expert users (SPARQL) as well as for non-experts (ontology browser) and pro-vides a ranked list of documents each associated with a content snippet highlighting the queried facts in context. At the demon-stration site, we will show the advantages of this novel approach towards document retrieval and illustrate the benefits of reviving the documents that information extraction approaches neglect. 1...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{penetration}} and the Indian economy {{have grown}} significantly {{over the past}} few years, but how robust and sustainable is the adoption of wireless services and products? Several papers have discussed India as a wireless service and product market, and sometimes tried to assess quantitative attributes thereof. The present paper aims instead at looking, from a management point of view, at the unique underlying evolution processes, bottlenecks and risks. On specific facets, a comparison is given to adoption indicators in other key markets such as China. For example, just to illustrate highlights of these unique attributes, it is indeed surprising that such a major economy with its very large population has not yet achieved the wireless service usage and mobile terminal penetration ratios of neither an early European adopter,nor of a recent large scale adopter like China or Russia. India has also been characterised by a surprising regulatory development process quite different from many other contexts, both in terms of its both centralised and regional structure, of very low tariffs providing almost no ROI to investors in a stable situation, and of absence of neutrality across communications technologies. At the same time, a very large fraction of the population has not, for affordability and regional coverage reasons, been able to get the access opportunities of more developed regions, leading to a distribution unbalance which is also a significant opportunity. Also, the wireless service and product adoption pattern in India, specific to communicating services, has so far been in rather sharp contrast with the widely known software and outsourcing services industry evolutions in that country. Therefore it is important to compare the most relevant known wireless service and product adoption theories, to establish from facts whether they apply in the Indian context, and, if not, suggest new or mixed theories able to explain all such facts and cast some light into its likely future structural evolution. It is of high relevance in management to validate if indeed established models apply or not in a significant case like India, just as it is also of high relevance for the main stakeholders to identify methodology able to support their analyses. The paper first provides background information on wireless, fixed, and other operators, on wireless penetration, on telecommunications infrastructure and investments, and on Indian human capital. Thereafter is analyzed in detail the relevance, or not, of five traditional technology adoption models across the Indian user base: the absorption business model, the perceived benefits business model, consumer attitudes, the globalisation business model, and finally the brand management business model. These first analyses are followed by the identification and detailed analysis of five other business models or structural processes, some rather unique to India: the two-tier migration model, large scale imported adoption without a telecommunications infrastructure & terminals industry, unstable adoption with lack of consistent public policies, knowledge sharing and productivity enhancement adoption model, and finally late foreign capital investments into a large emerging market. From the comparison of <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>background</b> data, with these ten wireless service and product adoption models, the paper establishes which are not relevant, and which are too some degree. Furthermore the relevant business models are shown to share, further attributes of sustainability (or not) and dynamic behaviour. This allows concluding that India has had an overall quite fragile adoption and deployment path with growing tensions such as coverage, quality of service and affordability disparities. The model comparison also allows to diagnose the key three structural measures needed to reach a sustainable equilibrium from the business, economic and social points of view.
