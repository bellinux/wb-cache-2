25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>channel</b> and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events).|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{change to}} the central unit added {{a second set of}} capacitors <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>channel.</b> With each sampling of the channels in the input units, the values were read into the alternating set of capacitors in the CDE. This caused the change in position between scans to be recorded. On the display, the values of these two measurements were rapidly cycled, causing the dots to elongate into short dashes, directly indicating the direction and speed of travel. Finally, they added the AN/SSA-21 unit, which read out the values and sent them as teletype signals to other ships, where they could be converted back to analog signals for display there.|$|E
25|$|New {{digital signal}} {{processing}} functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether you have a multi-channel or stereo sound system in your home theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for your room. By placing a microphone where you plan to sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>channel</b> accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|E

2500|$|Non {{domestic}} dimmers {{are usually}} controlled remotely {{by means of}} various protocols. [...] Analogue dimmers usually require a separate wire <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>channel</b> of dimming carrying a voltage between 0 and 10 V. [...] Some analogue circuitry then derives a control signal from this and the mains supply for the switches. [...] As more channels {{are added to the}} system more wires are needed between the lighting controller and the dimmers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{channel program}} is a {{sequence}} of channel command words (CCWs) which are executed by the I/O channel subsystem in the IBM System/360 and subsequent architectures. [...] A channel program consists {{of one or more}} channel command words. [...] The operating system signals the I/O channel subsystem to begin executing the channel program with a SSCH (start sub-channel) instruction. [...] The central processor is then free to proceed with non-I/O instructions until interrupted. [...] When the channel operations are complete, the channel interrupts the central processor with an I/O interruption. [...] In earlier models of the IBM mainframe line, the channel unit was an identifiable component, one <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>channel.</b> In modern mainframes, the channels are implemented using an independent RISC processor, the channel processor, one for all channels. IBM System/370 Extended Architecture and its successors replaced the earlier SIO (start I/O) and SIOF (start I/O fast release) assembler instructions (System/360 and early System/370) with the SSCH (start sub-channel) instruction (late System/370 and successors).|$|E
2500|$|Marshall looked {{towards a}} new {{flagship}} to nail all the compromising {{of the earlier}} models, the JVM, made {{in a variety of}} models and ranges. These amps have up to four channels, each with three-foot-switchable modes, dual master volumes, reverb controls <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>channel,</b> and a foot-switchable effects loop. These features can be programmed into the standard foot-switch to be foot-switchable as [...] "patches", so now the user can switch from, say, a clean channel with a chorus in the effects loop and reverb, to a medium-gain rhythm sound with no effects, to a high-gain lead sound with boosted output volume, with one click of the foot-switch per sound. The JVM range consists of a 100-watt four-channel head, JVM 410C (2×12-inch speaker combo), a 100-watt two-channel head (JVM 210H, used by Joe Satriani for some time), JVM 210C (2×12-inch speaker combo) and 50-watt versions of these (JVM 205H (head), JVM215C (1×12-inch speaker combo) and JVM205C (2×12-inch speaker combo), respectively).|$|E
