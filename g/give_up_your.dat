You can be your own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding but demanding in a way that doesn't trample on people. And you don't have to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|E
500|$|Gates was an {{executive}} who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. He interrupted presentations with such comments as [...] "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" [...] and [...] "Why don't you just <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> options {{and join the}} Peace Corps?" [...] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced. When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, {{he was known to}} remark sarcastically, [...] "I'll do it over the weekend." ...|$|E

2500|$|You, Emperor, {{should not}} ask {{something}} like this, and Chu Liang's response was absurd and rebellious. [...] Gaozu of Han was often defeated, {{and the first}} emperor of Shu could not even protect his wife and children. [...] Winning and losing battles happened throughout history. [...] How can you be ready to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> state just based on one defeat?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Father Raffeiner was {{succeeded in}} 1840 by his assistant, a Benedictine, Nicholas Balleis. Father Balleis was succeeded in 1841 by a Franciscan, Rev. John Lewitz. Archbishop Hughes brought the Redemptorists into the city, and {{tendered}} them the church property of St. Nicholas' at this time. The trustee system still obtained; {{the word of}} the founder of the parish to his flock had been, [...] "Never <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> property." [...] True to these words, the parish retained control of its property, and thereby birth was given to the Holy Redeemer Church. Rev. Gabriel Rumpler, C.SS.R., appointed by Bishop John Hughes, was rector of St. Nicholas' until 1844. After battling church members and trustees he left to form the Most Holy Redeemer Church on East 3rd Street, which became the second German-speaking church.|$|E

2500|$|Niven had {{particular}} scorn {{for those}} newspaper columnists covering the war who typed out self-glorifying and excessively florid prose about their meagre wartime experiences. Niven stated, [...] "Anyone who says a bullet sings past, hums past, flies, pings, or whines past, has never heard one—they go crack!" [...] He gave a few {{details of his}} war experience in his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon: his private conversations with Winston Churchill, the bombing of London, {{and what it was}} like entering Germany with the occupation forces. Niven first met Churchill at a dinner party in February 1940. Churchill singled him out from the crowd and stated, [...] "Young man, you did a fine thing to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> film career to fight for your country.

2500|$|As a child, Archie {{was very}} quiet but very mischievous - {{especially}} {{when he was with}} his brother Quentin; growing up, Archie and Quentin were very close. They rarely left each other's side and had very few fights. But as for the other siblings, Archie was not close to either Kermit or Ethel, because they would gang up on him. Ted would help beat up Kermit for him and would also tell their mother, Edith, about Ethel, who would often get in trouble. Alice was ten years older than Archie, and he barely remembered her being around, since she would often go places with other family members and friends. Archie was an avid reader and very good at putting puzzles together quickly. His father remarked to him, “Archie, my smart boy, never <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> smartness; that goes for you and your brother Quentin." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The whole {{episode is}} her sort of {{rethinking}} {{her life and}} rethinking her choices, and I don't think that she's lost integrity. I don't think that her feelings for O'Neill are any less. I think she's just placed them in a different box, if you will. It was weird, I have to say, for her to hand her heart over to somebody else. But it's baby steps for her, {{and this is all}} new for her. And I think it's ultimately O'Neill who says, 'You have to move on.' And it's her father, too, who says, you know, 'Don't <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> chance of love.

So it's her opening up her heart as opposed to actually [...] it's been closed this whole time because she's, you know, been protecting it with thoughts of O'Neill, who she knows she can't have, so it opens her up.|$|E
