50|$|In fungi, a basidiocarp, basidiome or basidioma (plural: basidiomata) is the {{sporocarp}} of a basidiomycete, the multicellular {{structure on}} which the spore-producing hymenium is borne. Basidiocarps are characteristic of the hymenomycetes; rusts and smuts do not produce such structures. As with other sporocarps, <b>epigeous</b> (above-ground) basidiocarps that are {{visible to the naked}} eye (especially those with a more or less agaricoid morphology) are commonly referred to as mushrooms, while hypogeous (underground) basidiocarps are usually called false truffles.|$|E

50|$|Members of {{the family}} are diverse in ascomatal or cleistothecial form.

Also, taxa may be sub-hypogeous to hypogeous with closed, folded, or solid ascomata. Apothecia may {{range in size from}} less than 1 mm up to 12 cm diam, and may be brightly colored due to {{carotenoid}} pigments. Genera of the Pyronemataceae lack unifying macroscopic or microscopic characteristics; this lack of uniting characters has led various authors to propose a variety of classification schemes.|$|E
