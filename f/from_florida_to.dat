5|$|The {{hurricane}} chiefly {{affected the}} eastern United States, impacting a broad region <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> New York {{over the course}} of just 24 hours. It was, at the time, one of the costliest hurricanes ever to strike the country.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Beth was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone which traveled <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> Nova Scotia {{in the middle}} of August 1971. The second named storm of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Beth's genesis was impeded by a cold environment surrounding the storm. However, as it continued on its northeastward course, it achieved fully tropical characteristics and peaked as a modest Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The cyclone struck Nova Scotia on August 16 before dissipating shortly after. Beth produced substantial precipitation, and the resultant flooding inflicted severe damage to infrastructure and crops.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King.

On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E

5|$|The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezii) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, streamlined body typical of the requiem sharks, this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the dusky shark (C. obscurus) and the silky shark (C. falciformis). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and tooth shape and number.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} {{continuously}} active, with six storms forming {{during the month}} of August alone. At the time, many storms received the distinction of being the earliest nth storm to form, such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season. Most of the records were broken in later years. During the season, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm and hurricane warnings for eight storms, including coastal portions of Texas, as well as <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> Massachusetts, forcing the evacuations of thousands of people. The deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck Tampico, Mexico, killing over 184 residents. The costliest hurricane was the Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane, which caused $27 million in damage from North Carolina to New Jersey. The hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} rough surf {{along the}} coastline <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20feet (6m) of beach, leaving 70homes {{in danger of}} collapse. Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34feet (10m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. Damage was minimal, but six people drowned {{as a result of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|Waves between 5 and 13feet (1.5–4meters) were {{reported}} along the East Coast of the United States <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> Maryland. A weather buoy in Outer Banks, North Carolina reported swells up to 10feet (3meters). One death occurred by drowning in New Jersey. A 37‑year‑old man {{was reported missing}} in New York City and presumed dead after his houseboat capsized in the heavy surf. Another houseboat also capsized, drowning a 58‑year‑old woman. On shore, a large wave swept two fishermen into the sea, where they drowned. Overall, four fatalities occurred {{in the state of}} New York. In Rhode Island two teenagers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after being swept into the water by the waves.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} June15, {{although}} an unnamed storm developed {{about a week}} prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean. A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June12 alleviated drought conditions in the south-central United States. Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico. Tropical storms Carla and Ethel both formed near the Bahamas and moved northeastward until dissipating. The lone hurricane that hit the contiguous United States was Hurricane Flossy. One of the final storms of the year, Greta, was an unusually large hurricane that produced high waves <b>from</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>to</b> the Lesser Antilles. It developed in the western Caribbean and moved {{across much of the}} southeastern United States, causing $24.8million in damage and 15deaths. There were also several tropical depressions, as well as one subtropical cyclone, in the season.|$|E
