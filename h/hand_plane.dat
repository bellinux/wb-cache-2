25|$|A <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> is a {{tool for}} shaping wood using muscle power to force the cutting blade over the wood surface. Some rotary power planers are {{motorized}} power tools used for {{the same types of}} larger tasks, but are unsuitable for fine scale planing where a miniature <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> is used.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1860s, Leonard Bailey began {{producing}} {{a line of}} cast iron-bodied hand planes, the patents for which were later purchased by Stanley Rule & Level, now Stanley Works. The original Bailey designs were further evolved and added to by Justus Traut and others at Stanley Rule & Level. The Bailey and Bedrock designs {{became the basis for}} most modern metal <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> designs manufactured today. The Bailey design is still manufactured by Stanley Works.|$|E
25|$|The {{hand tool}} form of router is the {{original}} form. It is a specialized type of <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate (gaining it the nickname old woman's tooth). Today the power tool form of router, with an electric-motor-driven spindle, is the more common form, and the hand tool is now often called a router plane. Although the hand tool has a few advantages over the power tool and retains favour with some workers, it has been mostly replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. Some workers consider {{it to be the}} single most versatile woodworking power tool. Becoming more popular is the use of a CNC wood router, which implements the advantages of CNC (Computer Numerical Control).|$|E

50|$|One problem faced {{when using}} {{shooting}} boards repetitively {{is that the}} blade in the <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> becomes worn very quickly in one spot. This requires frequent sharpening to ensure smooth and accurate cutting. The ramped shooting board addresses this problem by introducing a slope to the fence. As the <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> moves along the fence, the slope causes {{the part of the}} blade in contact with the board to move along the blade's length. This even exposure of wood along the whole blade allows a longer blade life, as sharpening is less frequent.|$|E

50|$|The third {{addition}} {{was completed}} sometime around 1882, when the front roof {{was raised to}} a full story in height. The original common rafters were replaced with new vertically-sawn two inch by ten inch common rafters. The original oak roof sheathing was reused. The second floor was also partitioned into five small rooms, {{each with its own}} closet. The new batten doors were <b>hand</b> <b>planed</b> pine and the cast-iron hardware, hinges and latches were made by Eli Whitney Blake.|$|R
50|$|A card scraper is a {{woodworking}} {{shaping and}} finishing tool. It {{is used to}} manually remove small amounts of material and excels in tricky grain areas where <b>hand</b> <b>planes</b> would cause tear out. Card scrapers are most suitable for working with hardwoods, {{and can be used}} instead of sandpaper. Scraping produces a cleaner surface than sanding; it does not clog the pores of the wood with dust, and does not leave a fuzz of torn fibers, as even the finest abrasives will do.|$|R
50|$|A {{block plane}} {{is a small}} {{woodworking}} <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> which typically has the blade bedded at a lower angle than other planes, with the bevel up. It is designed to cut end grain and is typically small enough {{to be used with}} one hand.|$|E

50|$|The rebate plane (also {{known as}} the rabbet plane) is a <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> {{designed}} for cutting rabbets in wood. It's a simple tool, used in many Western countries, with hundreds of years of history. It was in use in England at least {{as early as the}} 11th century.|$|E

The analysis of the obtained electromagnetic torque-angle characteristics shows that the studied motor has significant electromagnetic torque pulsations.

50|$|High speed steels {{also found}} a market in fine hand tools where their {{relatively}} good toughness at high hardness, coupled with high abrasion resistance, made them suitable for low speed applications requiring a durable keen (sharp) edge, such as files, chisels, <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> blades, and damascus kitchen knives and pocket knives.|$|E
50|$|Parallel to {{the base}} and {{slightly}} lower is a secondary surface, the fence, which may be a separate board, or may be a rabbet cut in{{to the base}}. The difference in height between the base and the fence is {{to allow for the}} offset of the blade in the <b>hand</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The jointer derives {{its name}} from its primary {{function}} of producing flat edges on boards prior to joining them edge-to-edge to produce wider boards. The use of this term probably arises from {{the name of a}} type of <b>hand</b> <b>plane,</b> the jointer plane, which is also used primarily for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The {{main house}} was built in 1903. It sits on a gentle slope facing Mule Creek. The house is a two-story, wood-frame structure. The lumber for the house was all cut by hand from Ponderosa pine logs cut on the site. The siding was {{smoothed}} with <b>hand</b> <b>planes</b> down to one quarter inch in thickness. The window glass was shipped overland from Portland, but the window frames were handmade at the ranch. The main house {{does not have a}} fireplace. It is heated by a wood-burning stove in the living room.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>planes</b> are ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of}} years ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or with the heel of the user's <b>hand.</b> <b>Planes</b> of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. [...] A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear although furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. [...] There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of adzes to effect greater control of the cutting action.|$|R
25|$|Woodworking {{machinery}} that perform a similar function as <b>hand</b> <b>planes</b> include the jointer and the thickness planer, also called a thicknesser; the job these specialty power tools {{can still be}} done by hand planers and skilled manual labor {{as it was for}} many centuries. When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes a certain percentage of excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the cut edges.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of the card scraper is the scraper plane which consists of a <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> body in which a card scraper is mounted. There are also various styles of holder {{which can be used}} for this purpose. These simplify the use of the card scraper and alleviate the problems associated with heat.|$|E
5000|$|A {{shooting}} {{board is}} a jig for woodworking {{which is used}} in combination with a <b>hand</b> <b>plane</b> to trim and square up the edges and ends of boards.

When powered by electricity to the breadth of a board or panel, the tool may be called a thickness planer or planer which are designed to shape, flatten, and finish larger boards or surfaces. [...] Generally all planes are used to flatten, reduce the thickness of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber or timber. Planing is also used to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping, where the integrity of the whole requires the same smooth surface. Special types of planes are designed to cut joints or decorative mouldings.|$|E
