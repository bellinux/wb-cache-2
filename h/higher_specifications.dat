5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured <b>higher</b> <b>specifications</b> and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{available}} as a 4146 cc four-cylinder engine, but the engine was also {{available as a}} 5942 cc or 6218 cc six-cylinder engine. The Dover 5.9 {{is referred to as}} a 6.0 sometimes, even by Ford themselves who referred to the turbocharged 5.9 as the 660T, compared to the naturally aspirated [...] "659" [...] - while they do share dimensions, the Dover 660T was built to closer clearances which may have led to minute differences in displacement. As for the four-cylinder engines, the Dover and Dorset variations share a displacement. They can be told by the Dover's <b>higher</b> <b>specifications,</b> with an aluminium rather than a pressed steel manifold, straight-cut gears, and larger ports in the head. The engine code is also different, 2711 for the Dorset and 2722E for the Dover.|$|E

5000|$|The Toyota Kijang [...] (Toyota Kijang), {{an acronym}} of [...] "Kerjasama Indonesia-Jepang" [...] (English: Indonesian-Japan Cooperation), {{is a series}} of pickup trucks and MPVs sold mainly in Southeast Asia by Toyota. [...] "Kijang", meaning deer/muntjac in Indonesian, was first {{introduced}} in Indonesia in 1977 and it has become the most popular car in the country. The same vehicle was earlier produced in the Philippines as the Toyota Tamaraw, where it was launched in December 1976. Fourth generation models in the Philippines were sold under the Toyota Revo name. This car also sold in other countries, and is known as the Toyota Qualis in India and Nepal (third and fourth generation), Toyota Zace in Taiwan (third and fourth generation), Toyota Unser in Malaysia (fourth generation), and Toyota Stallion in Africa for the basic models (second, third and fourth generation), with <b>higher</b> <b>specifications</b> labelled Toyota Venture (third) and Toyota Condor in South Africa (fourth generation).|$|E
5000|$|The 10/22 was {{immediately}} popular upon its release. It {{was designed as}} a quality adult gun (with adult ergonomics) and not a cheap [...] "youth rifle". However, its easy handling characteristics, negligible recoil and inexpensive ammunition nonetheless make it ideal for young or inexperienced shooters. It is very popular for small-game hunters and those who want an inexpensive rifle firing inexpensive ammunition for target and plinking use. This popularity has led to many after-market modifications being available to improve performance, augment the rifle's looks, or increase its magazine capacity, leading the 10/22 {{to be one of the}} most customizable firearms made.Custom manufacturers also make [...] "clones" [...] of the 10/22, which are similar in design (most parts will interchange) but built to much <b>higher</b> <b>specifications</b> and costs. The 10/22 barrel uses a unique two-screw, V-block system to attach the barrel to the receiver, making removal and replacement of the barrel (which would require a gunsmith's work with most other rifles) very easy. This, when combined with the simple construction of the rest of the components, means that the average person can easily replace any part in the gun with nothing more than a screwdriver, a hex key and simple punches.|$|E

40|$|Re-invented in {{the early}} 1990 s, {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) in a CMOS {{technology}} are today the most sold solid-state imaging devices, overtaking the traditional technology of Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD). The slow uptake of CMOS MAPS started with low-end applications, for example web-cams, and is slowly pervading the high-end applications, for example in prosumer digital cameras. <b>Higher</b> <b>specifications</b> are required for scientific applications: very low noise, high speed, high dynamic range, large format and radiation hardness are some of these requirements.
