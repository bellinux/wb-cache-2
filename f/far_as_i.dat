5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} word geldi, the unmarked suffix -di {{indicates}} past tense. In the second word gelmiş, the suffix -miş also indicates past tense but indirectly. It may be translated into English with the added words obviously, apparently or as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> understand.

25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category.

25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

25|$|Sa Ngalan ng Ina was {{the first}} project of Aunor after her return, she starred with Christopher de Leon and Bembol Roco. It was also the last directorial job of the late Mario O'Hara. Sa Ngalan ng Ina is a movie made for {{television}} or a miniseries is a political drama about a widow that ran as a governor when her husband was assassinated. In his review, film critic Noel Vera {{point out that the}} show is rare creature in Philippine television, the political melodrama. Longer and more complex soap operas have been mounted on Philippine television before, and politics has been touched upon before, but <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can recall {{there has never been a}} series (the exact name of the genre is, I believe, the teleserye) fully driven by politics, hinging upon the election into office and subsequent administration of the main character. All of the performances were great especially Aunor which gave her a nomination from Golden Screen TV Awards and a best actress trophy from 2012 Star Awards for Television. This miniseries would be the last collaboration between Aunor and O'hara before his death from leukemia.|$|E
