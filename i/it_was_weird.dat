500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{nominated}} in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Jon Wiederhorn from MTV News, the shots of the video are [...] "evocative and artistic, resembling {{a cross between a}} foreign film and a Chanel advertisement." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News said that Lee's disconnection in the video shows a [...] "distressed and emotionally wrought heroine." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised the video saying that Lee looked like a [...] "teen-misery titan" [...] and that she [...] "tiptoed through a marble castle of pain". He also concluded that she could have borrowed the dress from Stevie Nicks. During an interview with Spin in 2011 Lee said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> for her to watch the old videos of the band including the one for [...] "My Immortal". She explained, [...] "Just watching our oldest videos, it's weird. I definitely remember watching 'My Immortal,' like, 'That was not some dream where it was really somebody else.' I've totally had a couple of those moments. It's cool." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg's initial choice for the role. Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it. You can get your teeth into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected. [...] "I had morning sickness, so all those fumes and the make-up and the rubber...it was hideous." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song's {{structure}} {{was described in}} detail by AllMusic: Simply put, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>weird</b> and creepy. A chorus of living-dead voices supports a slow and sloppy waltz beat. Lyrics make numerous references to melting plastic and chromium and repeatedly ask the question found in the song's title (answered by the brainless chorus). Halfway through, the song breaks into a fast-paced bridge; the same happens in the coda, which includes a kazoo solo.|$|R
2500|$|In a January, 2007, {{interview}} with the Boston Globe, Connor Finnegan recalled his experience as an [...] player the previous summer: [...] "At first <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> being filmed all the time. You'd be talking and suddenly {{there would be a}} camera or microphone shoved into your face. The big rule with reality TV is never to look at the camera." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "The first {{installment}} of tonight's two-part yet separate Once Upon a Time episodes addressed nearly all the questions about the whys and hows of Emma's decision. Hook was an obvious choice, but the part about him also becoming a Dark One was an unexpected move and a smart way to twist the story. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> to follow the big reveal with a barely related adventure starring Merida though." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 8.5 rating out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's {{relationship}} with mechanic Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) has {{been central to}} her narrative; their affiliation began in 1994. Palmer and Owen already knew each other before working together on the soap, as both attended the Anna Scher theatre school. Owen has said, [...] "We practically grew up together. We'd {{known each other for}} years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> when she started on the show and we began playing the 'Ricky & Bianca Get To Know Each Other' bit. I had already {{spent a lot of time}} with Patsy. I think we were both seven when we met." ...|$|E

5000|$|The NME's Jeremy Allen {{was less}} complimentary, {{awarding}} the album 4 out of 10 and considering <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> too lengthy and too experimental. [...] "(This is) an album {{that gives the}} middle finger to brevity ... really long name and record, painfully so at times. There are flashes of the old brilliance on 'Shrink' but preceding number 'Hardmenhardblokes' (sic) is as baffling as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>weird</b> ... experimentalism meanders into the bizarre and unlistenable. That said, it's sort of heartening to have him back." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Swofford {{the show}} is funded and non-profit: [...] "We're not ad-driven, so we're {{not looking at the}} Nielsens the next day and saying, 'Oh gosh, did we do okay?' We're saying 'Did it work? Is it happening? Is it {{reaching}} the audience we want?' ... It's a whole different metric, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>weird</b> {{to have the opportunity to}} play in this arena without having to obey some of those rules. It makes it possible to do independent work." [...] Each show cost $800,000, about a third of the industry standard in Hollywood.|$|R
2500|$|On a {{publicity}} tour for Past Mortem in 2004, Elton mused {{on the high}} school reunion theme and his own drama college reunion: We'd had a very happy time all together, so there were no old scores to be settled really, we'd been a pretty happy bunch. And yet one person, who'd been a bit of a golden boy – he certainly went out with a girl I was besotted and unrequitedly in love with – he came up and he said, 'Why did you come? Was it to show off?' That really surprised me, that anyone would think that ... he came kind of carrying my agenda. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird.</b> I hasten to add I didn't think my life to be more successful than anybody else's. If you're happy and honest and fulfilled in what you do, then you're having a successful life.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, {{a friend}} of Bear's from jazz-camp, joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, [...] "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just {{happened}} that I lived with Chris Taylor during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then {{after a while he}} suggested I come in with these songs. [...] When I joined, I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later we were out on the road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire thing. I was close with Chris and Chris , but I didn’t know Ed [...] at all; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born to Mexican-American {{parents in}} Ontario, California, {{better known as}} the Inland Empire, T grew up singing in her church choir during Sunday school. In high school, T Lopez did not {{participate}} in early college enrollment with her peers. Instead, Lopez, who always knew she wanted to sing, attended Chaffey High School while working two jobs at the Ontario Mills Mall. That is until a car belonging to a talent scout, Nick Martinez, broke down near her father's garage and her father told Martinez about T's beautiful voice. T Lopez called Nick Martinez and he asked her to sing to him over the phone," [...] T Lopez said she thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird,</b> but she sang to him anyway so she sung [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] from her bathroom, she said that the acoustics were better in there. After she finished singing for Nick Martinez he told her When I hear about something, I'll call you. Not thinking much of it, T Lopez returned to work at Ontario Mills until Nick Martinez did indeed call her back.|$|E
500|$|The United States media, while {{generally}} reporting negatively on Scientology {{in domestic}} news, {{has taken an}} at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany. Richard Cohen for example, writing in the Washington Post, said in 1996: [...] "Scientology might <b>be</b> one <b>weird</b> religion, but the German reaction to <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>weirder</b> still– not to mention disturbing." [...] Alan Cowell, writing in the New York Times, wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology– motivated by officials' fear that Scientology [...] "was a totalitarian movement growing, like the Nazi party, from inconsequential beginnings"– was itself redolent of [...] "the Nazi era's authoritarianism".|$|R
5000|$|We {{refused to}} orient on medieval music, which {{is played by}} a number of bands, from the very {{beginning}} and chose an ethnographic dancing music style. I have no idea where 'medieval bands' take materials from. Perhaps they visit European festivals or search for music in the libraries. We can still talk to people, hear their songs. It happened so that someone in a village showed us a dance, and {{in a couple of weeks}} we were told that this person had died. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>weird</b> to realize that the dance could have disappeared forever together with that person. Alaksiej Krukoŭski ...|$|R
5000|$|Lekeu's {{personal}} style {{was present in}} his earliest compositions. In 1887, he said [...] "Bien plus, ce sera bizarre, détraqué, horrible, tout ce qu'on voudra; mais, du moins, ce sera original" [...] ("Even more, <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> <b>weird,</b> mad, horrible, anything you like, but at least <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> original").|$|R
2500|$|During this period, Alcala {{convinced}} {{hundreds of}} young men and women that he was a professional fashion photographer, and photographed them for his [...] "portfolio." [...] A Times co-worker later recalled that Alcala shared his photos with workmates. [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird,</b> but I was young, I didn't know anything," [...] she said. [...] "When I asked why he took the photos, he said their moms asked him to. I remember the girls were naked." [...] "He said he was a professional, so in my mind I was being a model for him," [...] said a woman who allowed Alcala to photograph her in 1979. The portfolio also included [...] "... spread after spread of [...] teenage boys," [...] she said. Most of the photos are sexually explicit, and most remain unidentified. Police fear that some of the subjects may be additional cold-case victims. [...] In 1979, according to later trial testimony, Alcala knocked unconscious and raped 15-year-old Monique Hoyt while she was posing for photographs.|$|E
2500|$|... "The whole {{episode is}} her sort of {{rethinking}} {{her life and}} rethinking her choices, and I don't think that she's lost integrity. I don't think that her feelings for O'Neill are any less. I think she's just placed them in a different box, if you will. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird,</b> I have to say, for her to hand her heart over to somebody else. But it's baby steps for her, {{and this is all}} new for her. And I think it's ultimately O'Neill who says, 'You have to move on.' And it's her father, too, who says, you know, 'Don't give up your chance of love. You know, I would live my whole life over again even knowing that your mother's gonna die, I would do all that again.' So it's her opening up her heart as opposed to actually [...] it's been closed this whole time because she's, you know, been protecting it with thoughts of O'Neill, who she knows she can't have, so it opens her up.|$|E

50|$|Let's {{just say}} that parts of <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>weird,</b> but I already had a good {{friendship}} with Gershon Mosley, and of course Dave Mayhew from Maple, and Rodney Mullen was just awesome {{in so many different}} aspects. So the dynamic was fine. I think the problem was the lack of a solid direction, {{and it seemed to me}} that A-team ended up being an avenue for some of us to later do projects that felt more natural to us individually. When I called Rodney to quit, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> actually really funny, because we all quit pretty much the same week, but no one told anyone else they were going to quit.|$|R

60|$|Herr Slossenn Boschen {{accompanied}} himself. The prelude did {{not suggest}} a comic song exactly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a <b>weird,</b> soulful air. It quite made one’s flesh creep; but we murmured {{to one another}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the German method, and prepared to enjoy it.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a melody}} on long humming notes, chiefly, {{it seemed to}} me, upon two notes with the {{occasional}} interjection of a third and fourth, and, at long and rare intervals, of a fifth. It was harmonious beyond all description, just as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> and unearthly; but now that I heard it more distinctly it had much more the sound of bells--very sweet and silvery.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird,</b> strangely weird. I {{looked at}} Maud Brewster {{and knew that}} she was {{similarly}} affected. Then I looked at Wolf Larsen, but there was nothing subjective about his state of consciousness. His whole concern was with the immediate, objective present. He still held the wheel, and I felt that he was timing Time, reckoning the passage of the minutes with each forward lunge and leeward roll of the Ghost.|$|E
60|$|There is a {{familiar}} and strange illusion experienced by all who climb isolated mountains. The higher one climbs, the more of the earth's surface becomes visible, {{and the effect of}} this is that the horizon seems up-hill from the observer. This illusion is especially notable on Haleakala, for the old volcano rises directly from the sea without buttresses or connecting ranges. In consequence, as fast as we climbed up the grim slope of Haleakala, still faster did Haleakala, ourselves, and all about us, sink down into the centre of what appeared a profound abyss. Everywhere, far above us, towered the horizon. The ocean sloped down from the horizon to us. The higher we climbed, the deeper did we seem to sink down, the farther above us shone the horizon, and the steeper pitched the grade up to that horizontal line where sky and ocean met. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> and unreal, and vagrant thoughts of Simm's Hole and of the volcano through which Jules Verne journeyed to the centre of the earth flitted through one's mind.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thus Brown, {{invisible}} in the mist, goes out of Patusan elbow to elbow with Cornelius in the stern-sheets of the long-boat. [...] "Perhaps you shall get a small bullock," [...] said Cornelius. [...] "Oh yes. Bullock. Yam. You'll get it if he said so. He always speaks the truth. He stole everything I had. I suppose you like a small bullock better than the loot of many houses." [...] "I would advise you to hold your tongue, or somebody here may fling you overboard into this damned fog," [...] said Brown. The boat seemed to be standing still; nothing could be seen, not even the river alongside, only the water-dust flew and trickled, condensed, down their beards and faces. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>weird,</b> Brown told me. Every individual man of them {{felt as though he}} were adrift alone in a boat, haunted by an almost imperceptible suspicion of sighing, muttering ghosts. [...] "Throw me out, would you? But I would know where I was," [...] mumbled Cornelius surlily. [...] "I've lived many years here." [...] "Not long enough to see through a fog like this," [...] Brown said, lolling back with his arm swinging to and fro on the useless tiller. [...] "Yes. Long enough for that," [...] snarled Cornelius. [...] "That's very useful," [...] commented Brown. [...] "Am I to believe you could find that backway you spoke of blindfold, like this?" [...] Cornelius grunted. [...] "Are you too tired to row?" [...] he asked after a silence. [...] "No, by God!" [...] shouted Brown suddenly. [...] "Out with your oars there." [...] There was a great knocking in the fog, which after a while settled into a regular grind of invisible sweeps against invisible thole-pins. Otherwise nothing was changed, and but for the slight splash of a dipped blade it was like rowing a balloon car in a cloud, said Brown. Thereafter Cornelius did not open his lips except to ask querulously for somebody to bale out his canoe, which was towing behind the long-boat. Gradually the fog whitened and became luminous ahead. To the left Brown saw a darkness as though he had been looking {{at the back of the}} departing night. All at once a big bough covered with leaves appeared above his head, and ends of twigs, dripping and still, curved slenderly close alongside. Cornelius, without a word, took the tiller from his hand.' ...|$|E
