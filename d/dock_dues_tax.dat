50|$|The Tweed Dock officially {{opened in}} October 1876, {{replacing}} the older port {{on the north}} {{bank of the river}} which had become inadequate. Following improvement works in 1993 vessels with a maximum beam of 16 metres are now able to enter the <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to its geographical location the port primarily handles cargoes linked to the agricultural industry, with fertilisers, malting barley, feed barley and oilseed rape the principal commodities.|$|R

50|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the bridge in 1966, an automobile-carrying passenger ferry service had operated at this location, but the docks had rotted and silt had filled in the areas where the large ferryboats, if their service was to be restored, would need to <b>dock.</b> <b>Due</b> to a dredging restriction in place because of Kepone contamination, it was not feasible to restore the automobile-carrying ferry service, although a similar operation was still serving about 35 mi downstream at the Jamestown Ferry.|$|R

It {{was unable to}} establish a hard <b>dock</b> <b>due</b> to debris from Progress M-45 on the docking port, {{which had to be}} removed in an unscheduled extra-vehicular activity on 3 December, after which it was able to establish a hard dock.|$|R
50|$|Piglets can be {{subjected}} to castration, tail docking to prevent tail biting, teeth clipping, and earmarking and tattooing for litter identification. Treatments are usually made without any pain killers. Weak runts could be killed shortly after birth. Injections with a high availability iron solution often are given, as sow's milk is low in iron. The <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to tail biting is a common practice in intensive rearing facilities as animals in that environment {{are more prone to}} increased levels of aggression and instability.|$|R

Aleksandrov was the second Bulgarian to fly in space, the first being Georgi Ivanov, who flew on Soyuz 33. Ivanov failed to reach the Salyut 6 space station as his mission was aborted prior to <b>docking</b> <b>due</b> to an engine failure aboard his spacecraft Soyuz 33. As a result, prior to EP-2, Bulgaria was the only Eastern European Soviet ally to not have one of its citizens visit a Soviet space station.|$|R
