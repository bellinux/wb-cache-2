After obtaining a lamp from a friendly Duskull in the front lawn, the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon Gengar blocks the player's path until it is scared away by the lamp. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu <b>gets</b> <b>stuck</b> inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon Golbat. Upon being shaken free, the missing disc pops out. The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called Meowth's Party.|$|E

25|$|Observations of {{variations}} in {{animals and plants}} {{formed the basis of}} the theory of natural selection. For example, Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a close relationship that allows the pollination of the plants. He noted that orchids have a variety of structures that attract insects, so that pollen from the flowers <b>gets</b> <b>stuck</b> to the insects' bodies. In this way, insects transport the pollen from a male to a female orchid. In spite of the elaborate appearance of orchids, these specialised parts are made from the same basic structures that make up other flowers. In his book, Fertilisation of Orchids (1862), Darwin proposed that the orchid flowers were adapted from pre-existing parts, through natural selection.|$|E
25|$|The book {{opens with}} a female {{character}} named Aomame as she catches a taxi in Tokyo {{on her way to}} a work assignment. When the taxi <b>gets</b> <b>stuck</b> in a traffic jam, the driver suggests that she {{get out of the car}} and climb down an emergency escape in order to make it to her important meeting, though he warns her that doing so might change the very nature of reality. Aomame makes her way to a hotel in Shibuya, where she poses as a hotel attendant in order to kill a hotel guest. She performs the murder with a tool that leaves almost no trace on its victim, leading investigators to conclude that he died a natural death from a heart failure.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{from the}} Holzmaden {{deposits}} numerous adult fossils were found containing fetuses. In 1880, Harry Govier Seeley, heading a special British paleontological committee studying {{the problem of}} ichthyosaur reproduction, concluded that birth was given {{in the water and}} that fossils containing fetuses in the birth canal probably represented cases of premature death of the juvenile, causing the demise of the mother animal as well. A comparison has been made with dolphins and whales, whose young need to be born tail-first to prevent drowning; if the juvenile is born head-first, it dies and the mother with it if the corpse <b>gets</b> <b>stuck</b> in the birth canal. However, an alternative explanation is that such fossils actually represent females that had died for other reasons while pregnant, after which the decomposition gasses drove out the fetuses head-first. In 2014, a study reported the find of a fossilized Chaohusaurus female that had died while giving birth to three neonates. Two had already been expelled while a third was present in the birth canal. The fossil also documented that early ichthyosaurs were also born head first, perhaps opposed to later genera. As Chaohusaurus is a very basal ichthypterygian—previously, the most basal genus of which fetuses were known, had been Mixosaurus—this discovery suggests that the earliest land-dwelling ancestors of ichthyosaurs had already been viviparous.|$|E

40|$|Many {{algorithms}} for routing in sensor networks exploit greedy forwarding {{strategies to}} get packets to their destinations. In this paper we study a fundamental difficulty such strategies face: the "local minimum phenomena" {{that can cause}} packets to <b>get</b> <b>stuck.</b> We give a definition of stuck nodes where packets may <b>get</b> <b>stuck</b> in greedy multi-hop forwarding, and develop a local rule, the TENT rule, for each node in the network to test whether a packet can <b>get</b> <b>stuck</b> at that node. To help the packets <b>get</b> out of <b>stuck</b> nodes, we describe a distributed algorithm, BOUNDHOLE, to build routes around holes,whichare connected regions of the network with boundaries consisting of all the stuck nodes. We show that these hole-surrounding routes {{can be used in}} many applications such as geographic routing, path migration, information storage mechanisms and identification of regions of interest...|$|R

500|$|In the yeshiva setting, {{students}} {{prepare for}} and review the shiur (lecture) with their chavrusas during morning, afternoon, and evening study sessions known as sedarim. On average, a yeshiva student spends ten {{hours per day}} learning in chavrusa. Since having the right chavrusa {{makes all the difference}} between having a good year and a bad year, class rebbis may switch chavrusas eight or nine times in a class of 20 boys until the partnerships work for both sides. If a chavrusa <b>gets</b> <b>stuck</b> on a difficult point or needs further clarification, they can turn to the rabbis, lecturers, or a sho'el u'mashiv (literally, [...] "ask and answer", a rabbi who is intimately familiar with the Talmudic text being studied) who are available to them in the study hall during sedarim. In women's yeshiva programs, teachers are on hand to guide the chavrusas.|$|E
500|$|Zimmer {{wanted to}} avoid writing music {{that had been done}} in earlier Batman films, so the score became an {{amalgamation}} of orchestra and electronic music. The film's ninety-piece orchestra was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos. Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of the film's scenes where tragic memories of Bruce Wayne's parents are involved. [...] "He's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he <b>gets</b> <b>stuck,</b> it's like froze, arrested development," [...] said Zimmer. He also attempted to add a human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as [...] "psychotic", through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film, with Zimmer composing the action sequences and Howard focusing on the dramatic scenes.|$|E
