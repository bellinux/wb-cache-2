5|$|In 1925, Born and Heisenberg {{formulated}} {{the matrix}} mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen ("Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes {{corresponding to the}} initial and final states. When Born read the paper, <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Ford {{published}} a complete description of ankylosaurian osteoderms, in which <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> group Struthiosaurinae. Ford's description of Struthiosaurinae {{was based on}} the genus Struthiosaurus. Ford found that Struthiosaurus transylvanicus lacked any remains of the jugal, which makes a jugal scute unknown. The skull roof of T. transylvanicus is large and bulbous, preserving a large, flat scute on top, and no osteoderms behind the orbits. Another species, S. austriacus, is known from two incomplete skulls, which preserved irregular scutes parallel to the orbits along the cranium.|$|E

The Greeks made obeisance to William as their new ruler. The fall of Andravida also meant the easy occupation of Elis.

25|$|Chevreul {{was perhaps}} the most {{important}} influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French chemist who restored tapestries. During his restorations he noticed {{that the only way to}} restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colors around the missing wool; he could not produce the right hue unless <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> surrounding dyes. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neoimpressionist painters.|$|E

Although an engineer and not an aviator, Patrick had been Pershing's Chief of Air Service in France, where his primary duty had been to coordinate the activities of Foulois and Mitchell, then rivals. Patrick had also testified before Congress against Mitchell's plan for an independent air force.|$|E
