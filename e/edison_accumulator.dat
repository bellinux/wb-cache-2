50|$|The next {{batch of}} battery {{locomotives}} {{were made by}} converting existing stock. When it opened, the Central London Railway (CLR) had suffered from vibration problems, caused by the heavy locomotives, and had experimented with multiple unit operation, with motive power provided by converting four trailer cars to motor cars. Around 1910, two of these motor cars, numbered 201 and 202, were fitted with batteries, and worked {{on a number of}} lines in addition to the Central London Railway. In 1915 they were loaned to the Bakerloo line, when it was being extended to Queens Park. Car 202 had its 'Nife' battery updated to one with 263 cells made by <b>Edison</b> <b>Accumulator</b> Ltd in 1924, while the number of cells in car 201 was increased from 200 to 238 in 1932. For working on other lines, they were fitted with outside shoes, since most lines used a four-rail system, whereas the CLR only used three. The vehicles were numbered L22 and L23 in 1929, and were scrapped in 1936 and 1937.|$|E
