500|$|It is {{possible}} that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent. [...] Nennius, a ninth-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of}} the Hwicce, which was along the Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bath he likes. [...] If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot". [...] Bede also describes hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius.|$|E
500|$|Piller {{originally}} envisioned only casting actors {{between the}} ages of eighteen and twenty-five to simulate the connection between the Kazon and contemporary street gangs. He said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as [...] "young, angry people who never lived old enough to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> experience and perspective on the world that, say, the Klingons and Romulans might have". He wanted to emphasize that the Kazon were [...] "much more emotional, short fused, and therefore had fewer expectations" [...] through the actors' performances. The roles, however, were filled by actors outside this age range, with Piller explaining that the decision was reached {{on the grounds that the}} [...] "older actors gave more polished performances". He later regretted the choice of more mature actors, as he felt this conflicted with the writers' concept of the species, making them appear too much like Klingons. The Kazon also received comparisons to the Cardassians and Wood Elves by Uproxx's Donna Dickens.|$|E

[...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E
500|$|Bath {{may have}} been the site of the Battle of Badon (500 AD), in which King Arthur is said to have {{defeated}} the Anglo-Saxons. The town was captured by the West Saxons in 577 after the Battle of Deorham; the Anglo-Saxon poem The Ruin may describe the appearance of the Roman site about this time. A monastery was founded at an early date– reputedly by Saint David although more probably in 675 by Osric, King of the Hwicce, perhaps using the walled area as its precinct. Nennius, a 9th-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of the}} Hwicce along the River Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bath he likes.

2500|$|The role of Joe Scheffer was {{initially}} offered to Jim Carrey, {{but he decided}} to join the 2001 film The Majestic instead. The screenplay's balance of comedy and drama intrigued actor Tim Allen, known for the television series Home Improvement and such films as Galaxy Quest (1999) and The Santa Clause (1994). Allen was searching for a project {{that was more than}} just broad comedy, and felt Joe Somebody would allow him to exhibit his comedic and dramatic skills. Of the script, Allen noted, [...] "the story has a lot of heart to it, and an emotion that I really love." [...] Producer Brian Reilly, who partners with Allen on his films, commented that [...] "Tim's previous roles did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> emotional truth or intimacy on screen called for by Joe Somebody. Tim has now reached a time in his life when it's right for him to do a film with rich and shaded characters." [...] With Allen on board, the studio executives began to search for a director for the film. After reading the script and discussing the details with Allen, Reilly, and numerous studio execs, John Pasquin, who had worked with Allen on Home Improvement, Jungle 2 Jungle (1997), and Santa Clause, agreed to direct.|$|E
2500|$|Kant {{nominated}} {{and explored}} {{the possibility of}} a transcendental logic with which to consider the deduction of the a priori in its pure form. Space, time and causality are considered pure a priori intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure a priori intuitions are established via his transcendental aesthetic and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> experience that it has were these a priori forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties, i.e., there can be no experience in general without space, time or causality as particular determinants thereon. The claim is more formally known as Kant's transcendental deduction and it is the central argument of his major work, the Critique of Pure Reason. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal as much as real. In consideration of a possible logic of the a priori, this most famous of Kant's deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of subjectivity, [...] what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, [...] "I think {{there has to be a}} difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, [...] "you’ll see a couple of things you haven’t seen in a while".|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{also saw}} the {{potential}} political changes in the Mideast {{as an opportunity for}} an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something Newsweek magazine saw as Clinton's categorical imperative).

At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: [...] "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings." [...] She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: [...] "This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, {{but it is also a}} big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us." [...] She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying [...] "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – but because I see it as [...] to increase security to fulfill American interests. These are foreign-policy and national-security priorities for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{corporate}} {{interest in the}} film surrounding its theme of promoting understanding between different groups, and its inclusion of violence and threats of greater conflict along with the romance of Pocahontas and John Smith, Schwartz became heavily involved in the storytelling. Bannerman estimated that he spent a week {{with one of the}} screenwriters and helped work out the overall themes of tolerance and cooperation. In June 1992, Schwartz researched Jamestown, Virginia where he absorbed the atmosphere and bought tapes of Native American music and English sea shanties and other music from the early seventeenth century that helped inspire numbers in the film. Schwartz modeled his lyrical writing for people of other ethnicities on that of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick. [...] "Colors of the Wind" [...] was the first song to be written for the film. Gabriel, Goldberg, and Pentecost insisted that the song help define the film's [...] "heart and soul". Schwartz began [...] "Colors" [...] with a few draft ideas for lyrics taking inspiration from Chief Seattle's letter to the United States Congress. Then, Menken wrote the melody with Schwartz listening at the piano and making suggestions. Schwartz would add lyrics before a session together where they were refined. [...] "Just Around the Riverbend", also composed by Menken and Schwartz, was devised by Schwartz's wife Carole, with the idea that Pocahontas would have a recurring dream that suggested something coming her way, paving the way for her [...] "I want" [...] song. The song almost did not make it into the completed film when Disney executives doubted whether her song would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> impact they wanted at that point. However, Schwartz stated he and Menken [...] "believed in it very strongly. Indeed, at one point we wrote a different song for that spot, but Alan and I were never as happy with the second song and ultimately everybody at Disney came to feel that way, too." ...|$|E
