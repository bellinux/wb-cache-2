5|$|The California Highway Commission {{considered}} several easterly routes between Saugus and Gorman: Soledad Canyon (used by the Southern Pacific) had frequent washouts; Mint Canyon (used by the Midway Route) was {{too long}} and cost too much; Bouquet Canyon (used by both automobile routes) <b>had</b> <b>bad</b> drainage; and San Francisquito Canyon (used by the Tejon Pass Route) was steep and narrow. Another possible route, through Piru Canyon to the west, was rejected because of {{a proposal for a}} dam. This route was later chosen for the Ridge Route Alternate, but had to be abandoned in the 1970s due to the construction of Pyramid Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} use {{of tanks}} {{during the latter}} part of the First World War established the validity of the tank concept. After the war, many nations recognised the importance of tanks, but only a few had the industrial resources to design and build them. During and after the First World War, Britain and France were the intellectual leaders in tank design, while other countries generally followed, adopting their designs. The Australian Army, which had initially <b>had</b> <b>bad</b> experiences operating with British tanks during the early stages of their employment during the war, had come to realise their utility after the battles of 1918, and in the post-war period sought to build its own armoured force. Initially, the Australian Army procured a number of British-made Vickers tanks, and American M3 Grant and M3 Stuart tanks, but it later went on to build and design some of its own during the Second World War. Since then Australia's armoured forces have fought in a number of battles during key conflicts, such as those in the Second World War and the Vietnam War. Primarily a light infantry force for most of its history, the Australian Army has used tanks mainly in the direct support role as opposed to engaging in sweeping manoeuvre against other tanks.|$|E

25|$|The {{censorship}} in Hamburg {{was relatively}} lax but Campe {{had to worry}} about Prussia, the largest German state which had the largest market for books (it was estimated that one-third of the German readership was Prussian). Initially, any book which had passed the censor in a German state was able to be sold in any of the other states but in 1834 this loophole was closed. Campe was reluctant to publish uncensored books as he <b>had</b> <b>bad</b> experience of print runs being confiscated. Heine resisted all censorship. So this issue became a bone of contention between the two.|$|E

25|$|Other {{researchers}} believe that some individual(s) may have been behind its origins, being followed by imitators later on. Spring-heeled Jack was widely considered {{not to be a}} supernatural creature, but rather one or more persons with a macabre sense of humour. This idea matches the contents of the letter to the Lord Mayor, which accused a group of young aristocrats as the culprits, after an irresponsible wager. A popular rumour circulating as early as 1840 pointed to an Irish nobleman, the Marquess of Waterford, as the main suspect. Haining suggested this may have been due to him having previously <b>had</b> <b>bad</b> experiences with women and police officers.|$|E
25|$|Leendert Hasenbosch was a Dutch ship's officer (a bookkeeper), {{probably}} born in 1695. He was set ashore on the uninhabited Ascension Island on 5 May 1725 as {{a punishment}} for sodomy.

He ate seabirds and green turtles, but probably died of thirst after about six months. He wrote a diary that was found in January 1726 by British mariners who brought the diary back to Britain. The diary was rewritten and published a number of times.|$|E

Guðrún, daughter of Gjúki and Atli's wife, learns about the plot and sends a runic message to her brothers but the runes are corrupted {{by one of the}} messengers, Vingi. Nevertheless, Kostbera, Högni's wife, discerns from the runes that something is wrong and warns Högni. Högni dismisses her fears but she persists and describes dreadful dreams she has had, interpreting them as warnings. Högni remains unmoved and explains the dreams away. Glaumvör, Gunnarr's wife, has also <b>had</b> <b>bad</b> dreams which she describes to her husband, who also attempts to explain them away. Eventually Gunnarr admits that their lives may be short but tells Glaumvör that he cannot evade his doom. The brothers set out to Atli with only three companions. The women follow the brothers to a fjord where their ways must part. Glaumvör reminds Vingi of the sanctity due to a guest and he swears that there is no deception. Kostbera and Högni say farewell to each other and the men row away.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} NFL teams located in {{subtropical}} climates, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at {{home during the}} first half of the season – forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00p.m. Eastern games. The west sideline is in the shade. In , the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate Vinny Testaverde's color blindness. Vinny Testaverde <b>had</b> <b>bad</b> performances in the darker (orange) uniforms and persuaded head coach Ray Perkins to change the team's home uniform to white. In certain years such as 1989–1991, and in 1996 — the last year of the original uniforms, the Bucs generally wore white at home for the entire season including preseason. Since the new uniforms were adopted, the Bucs wear the red jerseys for the last few home games, and for nearly all night home games. In the preseason, the Bucs may or may not wear white for their home games. The Bucs have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match against the New York Giants, where the Bucs wore white instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Daytona, Johnson started 12th and led 35 laps before {{finishing}} {{second to}} Dale Earnhardt, Jr., in {{a repeat of}} the Talladega race. At Kentucky, Johnson started sixth and ran inside the top ten for most of the night, finishing ninth. At the second stop in Pocono, Johnson, along with two of his Hendrick teammates, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr, took advantage of several cars running out of fuel to finish in the Top 6 (Gordon finished 3rd, Dale Jr. took 4th, Johnson grabbed 6th). At Watkins Glen, despite suffering two penalties (lap 3: Overshooting the entrance to the inner loop, and caution No. 1 (lap 26-28): Speeding through pit road) Johnson rallied to finish 10th. He wasn't so lucky at Michigan; late in the race, he got loose and spun in turn 3, and damaged the splitter on his car, resulting in a 39th-place finish (10 laps down). He rebounded at Bristol by finishing 4th, but <b>had</b> <b>bad</b> luck once more at Darlington. He spun out on lap 134 in turn 4, bringing out the 7th caution, and was never a real threat. He ended up 19th. He was able to recover a bit for a 9th-place finish at Richmond, and started 1st in the Chase in a three-way-tie between him, Kyle Busch, and Matt Kenseth.|$|E
