40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in women {{in many parts of the}} world. The risk factors for breast cancer cover a broad range of conditions, from age to complex genetic alterations. Present data is showing an increase in the annual incidence rates of disease and it is ranked as the first recorded malignancies among Iranian women after 1999. To study the association of reproductive and non reproductive factors with breast cancer among women with age group 30 - 75 years residing in urban area of Yazd city, Iran, this community based case-control study was carried out. A total of 160 subjects including 80 cases and 80 community controls were studied. Age was matched for both the case and control groups. Association of various kinds of risk factors with breast cancer was studied using odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals through both the univariate and multivariate analysis. The findings based on multivariate analysis showed that being employment in outdoor jobs, positive familial history of breast cancer amongst the first grades, <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> the first <b>menstruation</b> cycle (&le; 13 ys.), delayed age of the first marriage (&ge; 19 ys.), less number of live children (&le; 3) and less duration of breastfeeding (&le; 2 ys.) were significantly associated with breast cancer. However, consumption of OCPs was found to be a protective factor for breast cancer. Our study showed that the role of reproductive factors in the causation of breast cancer was more important than in other factors like socio-economic, psychological, behavior and nutritional factors...|$|R

40|$|Women's {{basal body}} {{temperature}} (BBT) follows a periodic pattern that {{is associated with}} the events in their menstrual cycle. Although daily BBT time series contain potentially useful information for estimating the underlying menstrual phase and for predicting the length of current menstrual cycle, few models have been constructed for BBT time series. Here, we propose a state-space model that includes menstrual phase as a latent state variable to explain fluctuations in BBT and menstrual cycle length. Conditional distributions for the menstrual phase were obtained by using sequential Bayesian filtering techniques. A predictive distribution for the upcoming <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>menstruation</b> was then derived based on the conditional distributions and the model, leading to a novel statistical framework that provided a sequentially updated prediction of the day <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>menstruation.</b> We applied this framework to a real dataset comprising women's self-reported BBT and days <b>of</b> <b>menstruation,</b> comparing the prediction accuracy of our proposed method with that of conventional calendar calculation. We found that our proposed method provided a better prediction of the day <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>menstruation.</b> Potential extensions <b>of</b> this framework may provide the basis of modeling and predicting other events that are associated with the menstrual cycle.

40|$|The <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> {{disability}} (at birth through young adulthood) {{can affect}} a person's employment outcomes in myriad ways. In {{addition to the}} direct effect of disability on employment, <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability likely affects the acquisition of education and job skills (human capital). This reduced "investment" in human capital in turn may reduce the individual's employment and earnings prospects throughout their lifetime. If this is the case, people with <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability may be doubly disadvantaged {{when it comes to}} later employment prospects. This study analyzes how <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability (<b>onset</b> prior to age 22) affects employment opportunities both directly {{and as a result of}} reduced investment in human capital (education) for a younger cohort (ages 22 to 35) and older cohort (ages 44 to 54). In our young cohort, we find that people with <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability have a lower probability of completing high school and a lower probability of being employed than those without disabilities. Lower employment rates result from both lower levels of high school completion and a direct negative impact of disability on work. In the older cohort, we find the employment of those with disability is lower than those without disability, regardless <b>of</b> age <b>of</b> <b>onset.</b> However, those with <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability have significantly higher employment rates than those with later <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability (after age 22). We hypothesize that this is a result <b>of</b> people with <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability prior to age 22 either choose careers that can be more easily accommodated than the careers people with later disability onset have, or that people with <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability are more likely to be adept at seeking and using accommodations than those with later disability onset. These results suggest that policies and programs to increase employment of persons with disabilities should focus on ways to increase education levels <b>of</b> those with <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability. They also suggest that return-to-work efforts focused on older cohorts of persons with disabilities may want to separately target programs to those with <b>early</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disability...|$|R

The ceremonies and "rites" traditionally marking this experience have commonly been lost in modern societies, but the initiation process can be reworked in psychotherapy {{through the use of}} images.

The cat {{can be seen as a}} potent medium forming a bridge between good and evil with knowledge of both. The cat image also connects internal and external experiences, and supernatural forces with the internal world. As it has access to, and is at home in, both of these spheres, the image can be used as a source of wisdom and also to teach girls how to hold conflicting values in balance.
