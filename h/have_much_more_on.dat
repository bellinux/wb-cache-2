The fast Fourier transform (FFT) implements the DFT in O(n log n) arithmetic operations. There are many variants of the FFT, {{depending on the size}} n (and its prime factorization), whether recursion is implicit or explicit, whether symmetries in the data are exploited, etc. See Briggs [39] for the DFT, some history, applications, and an introduction to the FFT.
