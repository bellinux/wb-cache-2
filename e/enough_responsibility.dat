40|$|This paper {{provides}} an update and {{a reflection on}} an earlier study commissioned by the Ministry of education about the challenges posed to educational governance in Austria. It starts with three contradictory observations, first a considerable gap between high expenditure and weak results in international Assessments, second the prevailing perception in Austrian education policy discourses that despite the high expenditure resources would lack in relation to demands, and third a widespread consensus about serious deficiencies of the governance structure, being too complex and giving schools not <b>enough</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and room for manoeuvre. The paper tries to explain these contradictory issues by taking up the argument of the earlier study, and to deepen the argument by additional illustrations and analyses. A path for improvement is sketched that would need quite far reaching changes in the existing governance structures...|$|R

The {{first part of the}} article analyses eleven procedures concerning petitions for preliminary rulings, illustrating the bearings of the cases and pointing out the importance as well as consequences {{from the point of view}} of the Hungarian legal order. The essay refers to the fact that activity of Hungarian courts to apply preliminary ruling procedures is exceptionally high comparing with the other nine Member States acceded to EU in 2004 and in almost each cases concerned, the references were profoundly considered by the Hungarian court. The second category described in this paper includes cases, in which Hungarian individual persons participate as litigants (including the cases before Civil Service Tribunal). The experiences of these procedures on the basis of direct complaints indicate the conclusion that in several cases, the attorneys representing the plaintiff before ECJ involve not <b>enough</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to avoid bringing obviously inadmissible actions. In the third part of the paper the reader can get an insight into the cases in which the Republic of Hungary appears as litigant. Finally the fourth category embraces cases with indirect interest relating Hungary. These are referred but not deeply examined in the article...|$|R

He had taught himself a language down here,--if only to know it by sight, and to have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation, could be called learning it. He had also worked at fractions and decimals, and tried a little algebra; but he was, and had been as a boy, a poor hand at figures. Was it necessary for him when on duty always to remain in that channel of damp air, and could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high stone walls? Why, that depended upon times and circumstances. Under some conditions there would be less upon the Line than under others, and the same held good as to certain hours of the day and night. In bright weather, he did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower shadows; but, being at all times liable to be called by his electric bell, and at such times listening for it with redoubled anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.|$|E

Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she was satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her--because she didn't live very long after that, you see. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say 'mother,' don't you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn't any relatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she'd take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people? Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.|$|E

The planned {{variation}} aspect of Follow Through {{was thought to}} be beneficial—perhaps superior—to other forms of experimentation (e.g., selection of sites based on randomized assignment) because it would give local communities and schools an element of ownership integral to the successful implementation of the models. Despite the planned variation design, local communities in many sites were nevertheless deeply critical of the program. In some ways, criticism of Follow Through had preceded directly from Head Start. Ostensibly, the social service purpose and goals of the Head Start program were clearer than those of the Follow Through evaluation. Nevertheless, community leaders had felt that Head Start did not give <b>enough</b> decision-making <b>responsibility</b> to parents and community members. Local interests wanted to make curricular decisions, including the changing of facets of some program models Evans cautioned that [...] "educational communities and contexts vary", which can have a direct effect on the implementation of a model. More problematic, however, is Elmores and Hills assertions that the Follow Through models interfered with local teaching methods and practices.

Rhine et al. suggest {{that it is difficult to}} get teachers to modify their behavior. And if the objective of changing behavior is achieved, teachers feel little ownership on the model—a decidedly dubious investment.

Only a third of the pre-school pupils got the opportunity to enrol in the English medium kindergartens and NGO-run non-formal schools where a kind of better pre-schooling exists. Urban children, especially those had educated parents and better-off economic background {{were more likely to have}} access in pre-school education compared to the others. Lack of common curricula for pre-school education creates inequity among children at their very early age. A pro-poor policy with <b>enough</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the state and scope for current providers to contribute is an urgent need. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective – The project {{sought to}} {{understand}} the research expectations of first-year students upon beginning university study, and how they differed from the expectations of their professors, {{in order to provide}} more focused instruction and work moreeffectively with professors and student support services. Methods – A survey of 317 first-year undergraduate students and 75 professors at MountSaint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was conducted to determine what eachexpected of first-year student research. Students were surveyed {{on the first day of}} theterm in order to best understand their research expectations as they transitioned fromhigh school to university. Results – The gulf between student and professor research expectations was found to beconsiderable, especially in areas such as time required for reading and research and theresources necessary to do research. While students rated their preparedness foruniversity as high, they also had high expectations related to their ability to use nonacademicsources. The majority of professors believed that students are not prepared todo university-level research, do not take <b>enough</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their own learning,should use more academic research sources, and should read twice as much as studentsbelieve they should. Conclusions – By better understanding differing research expectations, students can beguided very early in their studies about appropriate academic research practices, andlibrarians and professors can provide students with improved research instruction. Strategies for working with students, professors, and the university community arediscussed...|$|E
40|$|Government {{policy in}} the policy issued to the {{conversion}} from kerosene to LPG Gas and PT Pertamina Persero as the executor of the conversion, bringing adverse effects to society as a consumer of gas users. The conversion of these cases caused a gas explosion, one of which occurred in DIY. From this incident, the writter then perform legal writing / skripsi aimed to determine the forms of responsibility given PT Pertamina Persero especially to consumers who are victims of gas explosion. This type of research used by the writter is a normative legal research {{on the kind of}} research that focuses on secondary data (material law) as the primary data, which consist of primary legal materials (legal norms) and secondary legal materials (legal opinions). Based on the research that has been done, the principle of responsibility that is used in the case of LPG Gas explosion is the principle of strict liability. From these principles PT Pertamina has <b>enough</b> <b>responsibility</b> to consumers who are victims of LPG Gas explosion in DIY by providing compensation in the form of compensation insurance fund, just not all consumers get it because the PT Pertamina Persero do not have complete data about consumers who become victims of gas explosion. From this incident the writer wanted to point out to the Government in issuing a regulation, must perform prior to public dissemination, so that society will accept and implement the policies of that Government. For consumers of gas users, to be more careful and be wary of buying gas canisters and accessories, as well as finding out the ways of safe use of LPG Gas and correct, so that a gas explosion will not happen again...|$|E

40|$|Until today, little {{relevance}} {{has been}} given to the main cause of alcohol consumption related morbidity in young population, the so called "the next day morning alcohol hangover". The hangover is defined by the presence of symptoms connected to excessive alcohol consumption and its total metabolism, with severity <b>enough</b> to disturb <b>responsibilities</b> and daily life activities. Numerous observations show us that generally the young populations tend to be involved in a series of behaviors to cope with the unpleasant effects of a night of immoderate alcohol consumption. Through an empirical evaluation, it will be argued in this study the circumstances implicated in alcohol hangover and which behaviors the young population normally tends to be involved in order to attenuate it. The sample comprised 134 university students (1 º year). It can be concluded that the frequency of the behaviors to cope with alcohol hangover translates the need to remove or alleviate in an accurate and symptomatic way the most reiterated effects of aversive alcohol hangover cluster. This work provides reliable information that could be employed from an educational point of view, while we profound which cognitive, behavior and physiological mechanisms occurs during an episode of alcohol hangover. Taken into account that the consumption of alcoholic beverage is a normative behavior in adolescence, we propose a realistic perspective of the phenomenon (more than ideological and utopic), that encompass the maximum delay of the beginning of alcohol consumption in young, educating them in what concerns the potential harm of its consumption, incorporated in a broad perspective of promotion of an healthy life style and of proximity with the adolescent.
