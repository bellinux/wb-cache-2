50|$|Tax <b>deductions</b> <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> {{have been}} allowed in the U.S. since the {{inception}} of the income tax. Prior to 1971, these deductions could be computed in a variety of manners over a wide range of lives, under old Bulletin F. In 1971, Congress introduced the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system in an attempt to simplify calculations and provide some uniformity. Under ADR, the IRS prescribed lives for classes of assets based on the nature or use of the asset. Such classes included general classes (such as office equipment) and industry classes (such as assets used in the manufacture of rubber goods). Taxpayers could use their choice of several methods of depreciating assets, including straight line, declining balance, and sum of years digits. Asset costs and accumulated depreciation were tracked by “vintage accounts” consisting of all assets within a class acquired in a particular tax year. All vintage accounts for the same year were assumed placed in service {{in the middle of the}} year; however, a taxpayer could elect the modified half year convention with potentially favorable results.|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "While CRA should increase investor demand for LIHTCs, quantifying the extent of any effect of CRA on LIHTC equity contributions is difficult given data and methodological challenges. In {{part because of the}} qualitative nature of the CRA investment test, regulatory ratings cannot be systematically linked to banks' LIHTC investments. Although a bank's overall rating and the associated narrative of its CRA examination are publicly available, the performance evaluation report does not individually list qualified investments and how they were considered for that examination. Furthermore, quantifying potential bank demand for LIHTCs in specific geographic areas is complicated because not every bank assessment area is considered to the same degree in a CRA examination. Although one way to assess demand for LIHTCs is by examining how much equity investors are willing to contribute, the common LIHTC price measure [...] the ratio of investors' equity contribution to the total amount of LIHTCs in nominal dollars [...] is subject to misinterpretation. Specifically, an investor's equity contribution reflects the value of not just the LIHTCs, but also any other tax and regulatory benefits [...] such as higher CRA ratings [...] plus project risks. Such other tax benefits include <b>deductions</b> <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> and interest expenses. Furthermore, complete and reliable data on LIHTC investor equity contributions are not readily available, creating a challenge to analyzing the determinants of pricing. Although no empirical analyses of the effect of CRA on LIHTCs are available, CRA is widely cited by academic researchers, federal officials, and LIHTC market participants, and HFAs surveyed as one factor that increases bank demand for LIHTC investments particularly in urban areas. LIHTC market participants interviewed and HFAs surveyed indicated other factors that influence investors' decisions to invest in LIHTCs, such as the strength of housing markets in urban areas and developer experience with LIHTC projects. ...|$|R

40|$|Productivity is an {{important}} economic factor which has {{a key role in}} evaluating the economic growth. It is identified as the foundation for economic prosperity, a prerequisite for national development and also {{an important}} indicator of organizational competitiveness (Dedrick et al., 2003). Information Technology (IT) is one of the important resources for increasing the economic growth. It causes companies to use their input resources as much as possible in an effective way. As investment in IT capital accounts for an ever-increasing share of capital investment, {{it is important to understand}} how these investments might pay off (Gilchrist et al., 2001). There has been much debate on whether or not the investment in IT provides improvements in productivity and business efficiencies. IT investment may make little direct contribution to overall performance of companies until they are combined with complementary investments in business activities, human capital, and company restructuring. Therefore, according to role of IT in Business Process Reengineering, as a facilitator and enabler, BPR is valuable for companies to increase the impact of IT on overall performance of companies. On the other word, both IT and BPR investments, together, are able to improve productivity drastically. In this research Cobb-Douglas model was used to examine the impact of Information Technology investment on productivity at Telecommunication Company of Tehran (TCT). 44 financial and economic data were collected since 1997 up to 2007 for driving the corresponding model. Weighted Least Square (WLS) was run by SPSS 15 to test hypotheses. The results have indicated that IT investment not only makes the positive contribution to output of Telecommunication Company of Tehran but also this contribution is positive after <b>deductions</b> <b>for</b> <b>depreciation</b> and labor expenses.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the impact of}} fiscal policy is {{analyzed}} {{within the context of}} an endogenous growth and cycles model. The investigation shows the different situations in which government expenditure can lead to both crowding-in and crowding-out of output and employment. With regard to the cycle, an increase in the Aure of government spending leads to an expansion of output which is given a greater stimulus with a higher degree of monetization. Expansionary monetary policies accompanying the fiscal expansion tend to make the upswing longer and the downswing more shallow, i. e. the cycle becomes more asymmetric. The medium-run dynamics of the model along its warranted growth path essentially rest on the relative movements of business retained earnings (i. e. the private savings rate since household savings are ignored) and the government spending share. With the private savings rate fixed, a rise in the government spending share leads to medium-run crowding-out. On the other hand if policies such as investment tax credits, lower rates of corporate taxation, and accelerated <b>deductions</b> <b>for</b> capital <b>depreciation</b> stimulate the growth of the business retained earnings then an increase in the govemment spending share may either not have any effect on the warranted path or may even raise it, i. e. there might be crowding-in.

40|$|Excerpt] According to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the U. S. {{economy has}} been in {{recession}} since December 2007. Congress passed and the President signed an economic stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P. L. 111 - 5), in February 2009. The $ 787 billion package included $ 286 billion in tax cuts to help stimulate the economy. Among the tax reductions, many were tax incentives directed to business. The preliminary estimate of third quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is 2. 8 %; the unemployment rate, a lagging indicator, averaged 9. 6 % {{in the third quarter}} and 10. 0 % {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2009. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke expects the economy to continue growing at a modest pace, but predicts that bank lending will remain constrained and the job market will remain weak into at least 2010. To further assist unemployed workers, help business, and stimulate housing markets, Congress passed the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (P. L. 111 - 92). The Obama Administration has advocated further business tax incentives to spur investment and employment, especially for small business. The two most common measures to provide business tax incentives for new investment are investment tax credits and accelerated <b>deductions</b> <b>for</b> <b>depreciation.</b> The evidence, however, suggests that a business tax subsidy may not necessarily be the best choice for fiscal stimulus, largely because of the uncertainty of its success in stimulating aggregate demand. If such subsidies are used, however, the most effective short-run policy is probably a temporary investment subsidy. Permanent investment subsidies may distort the allocation of investment in the long run. Employment and wage subsidies are designed to increase employment directly by reducing a firm’s wage bill. The tax system is a frequently used means for providing employment subsidies. Most of the business tax incentives for hiring currently under discussion are modeled partially on the New Jobs Tax Credit (NJTC) from 1977 and 1978. Evidence provided in various studies suggests that incremental tax credits have the potential of increasing employment, but in practice may not be as effective in increasing employment as desired. There are several reasons why this may be the case. First, jobs tax credits are often complex and many employers, especially small businesses, may not want to incur the necessary record-keeping costs. Second, since eligibility for the tax credit is determined when the firm files the annual tax return, firms do not know if they are eligible for the credit at the time hiring decisions are made. Third, many firms may not even be aware of the availability of the tax credit until it is time to file a tax return. Lastly, product demand appears to be the primary determinant of hiring...|$|R
