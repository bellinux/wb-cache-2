500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something {{you know a lot}} about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig {{was asked if}} he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make another Danzig record after Deth Red Sabaoth. His response was, [...] "I don't know, we'll see. With the way record sales are now...I won't do some stupid pro-tool record in someone's living room where all the drum beats are stolen from somebody and just mashed together...and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that if I can't do a record how I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and if it's not financially feasible, I'm <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It isn't so very strange," [...] said Bob, as {{he started}} his team along at a walk, [...] "and, as usual, it's all my fault. When we moved the other day, we left our oil behind in the stable, and I knew the wagon needed oiling when I got down to Kenniston's. I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it when you drove up, and then, like an idiot, I forgot it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was so much}} distressed, and so pitiful, {{that she}} was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} of the kind, but her husband's gesture stopped her. Billy Barton howled more loudly than his wife, and, as he could not raise {{his hands to his}} face, presented a terrible spectacle, though the captain declared there were no tears to be seen. Dan stood grim, stolid, and impassive, and if he spoke at all, it was in a muttered oath at the noise his wife was making. It was a great relief when the cart was driven off, followed by the two women, and Captain Carbonel exclaimed-- ...|$|E
60|$|When Adam {{got home}} after his walk, he found Sir Nathaniel <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed.

5000|$|AllMovie {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars and {{described}} it as a [...] "touching drama". Entertainment Weekly gave a favorable review and said: [...] "There are a few crucial twists in this TV movie that don't bear giving away. You'll probably cry, but you won't feel manipulated. A Place for Annie is the kind of melodrama that gives tear-jerking a good name." [...] People awarded the film an A- grade and stated: [...] "You'll need sponges to watch this simple, affecting film. Tissues <b>just</b> ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thereupon {{she led the}} way to {{the second}} floor, and showed them the furniture, which was mostly very costly and very bad, and at last said: [...] "The third story is pretty empty yet.

6000|$|... "Very good," [...] {{said the}} duke. And {{then it became}} Mr. Fothergill's duty to see that Mr. Sowerby and Miss Dunstable became man and wife as speedily as possible. Some of the party, who were more wide awake than others, {{declared}} {{that he had made}} the offer; others, that he was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; and one very knowing lady went so far at one time as {{to say that he was}} making it at that moment. Bets also were laid as to the lady's answer, as to the terms of the settlement, and as to the period of the marriage--of all which poor Miss Dunstable of course knew nothing. Mr. Sowerby, in spite of the publicity of his proceedings, proceeded in the matter very well. He said little about it to those who joked with him, but carried on the fight with what best knowledge he had in such matters. But so much it is given to us to declare with certainty, that he had not proposed on the evening previous to the morning fixed for the departure of Mark Robarts. During the last two days Mr. Sowerby's intimacy with Mark had grown warmer and warmer. He had talked to the vicar confidentially about the doings of these bigwigs now present at the castle, as though there were no other guest there with whom he could speak in so free a manner. He confided, it seemed, much more in Mark than in his brother-in-law, Harold Smith, or in any of his brother members of Parliament, and had altogether opened his heart to him in this affair of his anticipated marriage. Now Mr. Sowerby was a man of mark in the world, and all this flattered our young clergyman not a little. On that evening before Robarts went away Sowerby asked him to come up into his bedroom when the whole party was breaking up, and there got him into an easy chair, while he, Sowerby, walked up and down the room.|$|E
60|$|One thing troubled {{me along}} at first--the immense {{interest}} which people took in me. Apparently {{the whole nation}} wanted a look at me. It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country, {{from one end to}} the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come. Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction. Now if you consider that everybody believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me. Of course I was all the talk--all other subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety. Within twenty-four hours the delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming. The village was crowded, and all the countryside. I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe-stricken multitudes. It came to be a great burden, as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage. It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which was a great satisfaction to me. But there was one thing I couldn't understand--nobody had asked for an autograph. I spoke to Clarence about it. By George! I had to explain to him what it was. Then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests. Land! think of that.|$|E
5000|$|Per Blabbermouth.net, On March 29, 2016, {{frontman}} Corey Taylor {{told the}} [...] "Someone Who Isn't Me" [...] podcast: [...] "Originally {{we were going}} to do three EPs, and now it sounds like we're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the two and just keep the other stuff we recorded as extra content for when we make the next album." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fast Romantics won Pop Group of the Year at the Sirius XM Indies in May 2014 for [...] "Funeral Song", {{after which}} point, Angus {{began work on}} writing new material, saying in 2015: [...] "We’ve been writing songs like ‘Julia’ that are super upbeat and poppy, and then there’s these other songs that are dark and vibe-y and really rhythmic. And we’re just sort of experimenting with everything. We’ll {{probably}} come out with {{dozens and dozens of}} songs, so until it gets to a point where it’s like, yeah, we’ve got an album we want to put forward and this is our sound for the next few years, we’re <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>doing</b> that.” ...|$|R
30|$|I {{really wanted}} to live in a metropolis… that was the main reason… it wasn’t that I was {{unemployed}} or anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my career… I was kind of unhappy with my job [in Germany]; and living in that small city, it was awful… So at some point I <b>just</b> said, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, I want to go where I want to be, where I like it (Sven).|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} August, {{the lack}} of {{progress}} in negotiations in Czechoslovakia, accompanied by signs of increasing belligerence in Nazi Germany, prompted the British Government to seek direct contact with Hitler. The initial idea was for Runciman to undertake the task. He, however, resolutely refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Arguing that it would compromise the independence of his Mission (and also on account of suffering ill health {{in the late summer}} heat in Prague), he declared: “I am <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it!” Runciman’s refusal resulted in the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, developing plans for the dramatic step of himself flying to Germany to meet Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 15 September.|$|R
50|$|In October 2006, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that the band had reunited. This was later dismissed by guitarist Joey D'Amico who stated that the band was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a few shows to promote the release of The Last Dance. However, D'Amico also stated {{that there was a}} possibility that 40 Below Summer would record a new album in the future.|$|E

I was like, 'I {{think this is}} fun,' and then I was reading a lot of {{negative}} stuff. It's hard {{not to take it}} personally. Than I thought, 'You know what?

5000|$|The {{success of}} the tour {{prompted}} the band to add an additional leg of dates in the United States. In response to the additional dates, Joey Fatone stated, [...] "We’re real excited about that. But I think we’re <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a great show again. You know, {{a lot of people}} have seen some of the show. But you know, every show that we do is different. We add little things here and there to change it up and make it an original show, so hopefully everybody will enjoy it" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was trying}} to keep it quiet from the dudes in 808 State," [...] Simpson recalled, [...] "because I was still working with them but wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my own thing. It was fun just {{slipping}} out of their basement and taking the drum machine. They'd be like, 'Where are you going?' I'd say, 'Oh, I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> home <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some programming,' then nip off to another studio. I {{was trying to}} get a tribal sound and found this sample saying 'Voodoo rage'. That was originally the title but the old sampler I was using didn't have that much memory. I just about had enough for 'voodoo ra…', so that's what it became." ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2015, Krone sent {{a series}} of profane and belittling texts to a woman {{with whom he had}} a prior relationship, and who was a {{defendant}} in a case being prosecuted by the office he worked for. Krone sent the woman several taunting and threatening text messages, admonishing her for supporting a previous political opponent and asking whether she should be tested for sexually transmitted diseases. He told the Cody Enterprise that, though he had been drinking alcohol {{at the time of the}} incident, alcohol did not play a role in his texting. Krone told the Enterprise in March 2016: “I’m <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drink anymore. Period. I’m <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.” He confirmed in a March 2016 interview with the Powell Tribune that he was fired as a result of sending the texts, which his boss, Park County Attorney Bryan Skoric, described as [...] "disgusting." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "My {{recollection}} is that Rick Nielsen {{did that}} song {{as a bit}} of a joke, because at the time when we had done that song {{there was a lot of}} pop music on the radio—ABBA, and all sorts of things, disco, thought 'I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an over-the-top pop song. I just want to do one that's so silly—total pop—and then we'll do a heavy version of it.' He didn't know what was going to happen with it. The idea was to have it like a heavy metal pop song. Cheap Trick doing ABBA—except a very heavy version." ...|$|E
5000|$|On July 15, 2016, Hopsin {{broke his}} silence on an {{interview}} with HipHopDX. The interview took place during {{behind the scenes of}} his music video of his single [...] "Die This Way". There was no hard feelings in the interview as Hopsin said, [...] "It wasn't disrespectful. It was more just his point of view from the situation and him just telling his opinion. He did it in a very respectful way. I can't hate him for that. I completely get it and, like said. It is what it is. I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me and that's not going to change. I'm going to die this way.".|$|E
5000|$|... "Once we {{came away}} {{with the success of}} February Son, we kind of fell into the trap that a lot of bands do that have success with their first one, who think 'Well, we're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it again -- let's go {{platinum}} this time.' We attempted to broaden the scope of what we were putting out there. Instead of just putting out rock songs, we had other types of music that we were exploring and we tried to put out a broader plain of music. That made it a little bit more difficult for people to get their head around it -- especially if they were into the rock and roll aspect of this band." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{working on}} her then-upcoming album, Lopez {{expressed}} the interest on working with Swedish record producer and songwriter Max Martin. According to the singer, [...] "I had really {{wanted to work with}} Max for many, many years, and it just never happened," [...] she explained. She further commented: [...] "For A.K.A. I was like, 'I want to work with you.' I met with him in the summertime, and he was like, 'I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> off <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Adele's album!' or somebody he works with all the time. I was like, 'When are you back?', he was like, 'October', I was like, 'I'll wait for you'." [...] About Martin, Lopez added: [...] "He's a super producer, maker of great pop hits. I've always wanted to work with him but our paths hadn't crossed. I sought him out." [...] Later, when he got back, they started trying to find the right song to record and Martin eventually called his songwriter partner, American songwriter Savan Kotecha, to work with them on what would become [...] "First Love".|$|R
5000|$|The album's track listing was {{revealed}} on April 29, 2017 on Halsey's Instagram account, {{where it was}} first known that Halsey would collaborate with singer Lauren Jauregui on a song called [...] "Strangers". In April during several radio interviews that Halsey attended to promote the album, she further commented about the song:I was thinking to myself, if I want this song to be believable, {{it needs to be}} real, so I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put a girl on the song to sing who's straight. I'm <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. So I reached out to Lauren and she came in and she cut the vocal and it sounds awesome. Our voices sound really cool together because we both have really raspy voices, mine's a little more delicate than hers. Hers is like really powerful and big and raspy, and mine is kind of like light and raspy. But it's really cool. I just love that Lauren and I are two women who have a mainstream pop presence doing a love song for the LGBT community, it's unheard of. It's very rare to see it from a female perspective.|$|R
5000|$|After {{ten years}} of {{struggling}} as the Blue Velvets and the Golliwogs, singer/guitarist John Fogerty, his brother guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford scored a #11 hit single with [...] "Susie Q" [...] in June 1968 under the name Creedence Clearwater Revival. Their self-titled album peaked at #52 on the Billboard albums chart. Despite their new-found success, however, seeds of discontent among the four members had already been planted due to John Fogerty assuming control of the band at just about every level. [...] "There was {{a point at which}} we had done the first album. Everybody had listened to my advice. I don't think anybody thought too much about it," [...] Fogerty recalled to Michael Goldberg of Rolling Stone in 1993. [...] "But in making the second album, Bayou Country, we had a real confrontation. Everybody wanted to sing, write, make up their own arrangements, whatever, right? This was after {{ten years of}} struggling. Now we had the spotlight. Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame. 'Suzie Q' was as big as we'd ever seen. Of course, it really wasn't that big...I didn't {{want to go back to}} the carwash." [...] In 2007, the singer elaborated to Joshua Klein of Pitchfork, [...] "I determined, we're on the tiniest record label in the world, there's no money behind us, we don't have a manager, there's no publicist. We basically had none of the usual star-making machinery, so I said <b>to</b> myself I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with the music...Basically I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what the Beatles had done.

He replied, [...] "Ultimately, as long as we feel we got somewhere to go then we would create new material. We are not <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it {{just for the sake of}} it. We have to feel inspired. All I can say is I do see somewhere where we can take Carcass if we choose to do another album and personally I do want to do another album.

After hearing about their debut position in Japan, the girls stated “When we first heard {{that we were}} ranked in third, we were all surprised because {{we had no idea}} that they’d take such an interest in us. There were even some members who cried. There’s also a lot of pressure in that we have to work harder and do better. We’re still very grateful and thankful for our position on the charts. Since we’re already receiving so much love, we’re really not anticipating a rise in the weekly charts.

5000|$|On April 22, 1974, Humphrey {{said that}} he would not enter the {{upcoming}} Democratic presidential primary for the 1976 Presidential election. Humphrey said {{at the time that he}} was urging fellow Senator and Minnesotan Walter Mondale to run, despite believing that Ted Kennedy would enter the race as well. Leading up to the election cycle, Humphrey also said, [...] "Here's a time in my life when I appear to have more support than at any other time in my life. But it's too financially, politically, and physically debilitating - and I'm <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Humphrey announced his choice to not enter the New Jersey primary nor authorize any committees to work in favor of him during an April 29, 1976 appearance in the Senate Caucus Room. At the conclusion of the Democratic primary process that year, even with Jimmy Carter having the requisite number of delegates needed to secure his nomination, many still wanted Humphrey to announce his availability for a draft. However, he did not do so, and Carter easily secured the nomination on the first round of balloting. Humphrey had learned that he had terminal cancer, prompting him to sit the race out.|$|R
5000|$|Best {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dexter after he {{attended}} several workshops held by the producers of the series where they observed his improvisational skills. During one of the final workshops, Best was paired with Clare Perkins as her son, which is wear the writers {{came up with the idea}} for the storyline and the characters. Best had just booked a role in Choir Boy at the Royal Court Theatre, when he was called to audition for EastEnders and offered the role of Dexter. In September 2013 when it was announced that Cornell John and Clare Perkins would depart the series, new executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins decided to keep Best on as Dexter. Of the decision, Best said, [...] "It means the world—to do something and be recognised is a great feeling. Anyone would love that—I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>doing</b> what I am doing and as long as it's beneficial for the show I have no problem staying here." [...] In May 2014, Best was suspended from filming for three months due [...] "bad behavior backstage and outside of work." [...] Reports later surfaced that Best had allegedly assaulted a taxi driver. Best made his onscreen return on 22 September 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Before the game, Memphis reserve forward Pierre Henderson-Niles {{said about}} Maryland, [...] "We really ain't talked {{too much about}} Maryland.

[...] Greivis Vasquez, the outspoken Maryland point guard to whom Henderson-Niles referred, said in response, [...] "would have a losing record in the Coast Conference—probably win all of their games outside the league, losing record in the league. The ACC is too tough. You can't just win games night in and night out because you’re so athletic." ...|$|R
