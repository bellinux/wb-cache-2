30|$|The higher grain yields {{observed}} for hybrid rice cultivars {{are attributed to}} higher grain weight, on average, which was approximately 20  % higher for hybrid rice cultivars than for inbred rice cultivars. Similar result was also observed by Huang et al. (2012), who reported that hybrid varieties had 23  % higher grain weight than inbred cultivars. However, Zhang et al. (2009) and Bueno and Lafarge (2009) reported {{that there was no}} consistent difference in grain weight between hybrid and inbred rice cultivars. These suggest that large grain weigh is not a general trait in hybrid rice cultivars, but developing rice cultivars with high grain weight may be a feasible approach to achieve high grain yield. Grain weight is determined not only by <b>grain</b> <b>capacity</b> to receive assimilates but also by the source supplying assimilates to grains (Ntanos and Koutroubas 2002). In our present study, hybrid rice cultivars produced higher biomass than did inbred cultivars except for Haikou in 2012. This result suggests that source capacity is critical to the high grain weight of hybrid rice cultivars. In addition, although hybrid rice cultivars did not show superiority in the harvest index, panicles per m 2, spikelets per panicle and grain filling, their values were relatively high; thus, the advantage of high biomass production and high grain weight was not offset by other components or attributes of grain yield. The findings indicated that the present strategy to increase rice yield for irrigated rice increased grain weight while maintaining the other yield components.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Maize (Zea mays L.) which {{belongs to}} the Poaceae family is the third {{important}} cereal crop of the world after wheat and rice. Salinity {{is one of the}} major environmental factors limiting plant growth and productivity. Maize is sensitive to salinity. Planting method is a crucial factor for improving crop yield. Planting methods in saline and non-saline conditions are different. Kinetin is one of the cytokinins known to significantly improve the growth of crop plants grown under salinity. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is also known to play a significant role in plant tolerance to salt stress. However, little information appears to be available on the relationship between salinity tolerance and auxin or cytokinins levels in plants. In this respect, the objective of this study was to study the effects of foliar applications of cytokinin and auxin hormones on yield and yield components of grain maize under different planting patterns in saline conditions. Materials and Methods The experiment was carried out at Bushehr Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Center, Dashtestan station with 29 ° 16 ´ E latitude and 51 ° 31 ´ N, longitude and 70 m above the see surface during the 2013 growing season. Dashtestan region is a warm-arid region with 250 mm precipitation per year. The field plowed by April 2013 and then prepared and sowed by August 2013. There were five rows with 75 cm distance. The experiment was conducted as a split-plot factorial design based on complete randomized blocks with three replications. Planting pattern (ridge planting, double rows of planting on a ridge in zigzag form and furrow planting) as the main factor and time of cytokinin (0 as a control, V 5 - V 6 stage and V 8 - V 10 stage) and auxin (0 as a control, silking stage, two weeks after silking stage) foliar-applied was considered in a factorial. Cytokinin (Benzyl Adenine, Merck) and Auxin (Indole- 3 -Butiric Acid, Merck) were sprayed on the entire plant in the evening with concentration of 50 and 10 g. l- 1, respectively. All morphological and yield component traits measured on 10 randomly selected plants of each plot. Yield was measured in 9 m 2 for each treatment. Data analyzed using the SAS (Ver. 9. 1) and comparing of the means was conducted using Duncan’s multiple range test. Results and Discussion Results showed that the planting pattern had a significant effect on plant height, ear (cob) length, ear diameter, kernel row number, per ear, kernel number per row, 1000 - kernel weight, biological yield, grain yield and harvest index. The highest and the lowest yield obtained through furrow planting and conventional planting, respectively. Applying furrow planting, resulted in water use improvement and reducing side effects of saline soils Cytokinin application in V 8 - V 10 stage produced the highest plant height and row number per ear and the highest 1000 - kernel weight and harvest index was belong to the application of cytokinin in V 8 - V 10 stage. The maximum kernel number per row was obtained without cytokinin. Auxin effect on 1000 - kernel weight, biological yield, grain yield and harvest index were significant (p≤ 0. 01). The highest grain yield by a mean of 6. 57 tons. ha- 1 produced by time of auxin foliar-applied in the silking stage. It has been found that both auxin and cytokinin may have a role in mediating cell division in the endosperm during the grain-filling stage. Therefore, these hormones might regulate the <b>grain</b> <b>capacity</b> (sink size) for the accumulation of carbohydrates. It has been found that IAA actively participated in the mobilization and accumulation of carbohydrates in seeds. Auxin and cytokinins hormones are also thought to be involved in regulating the sink strength either by mediating the division and enlargement of endosperm cells or by controlling the import of assimilates to the sink. Conclusions The results indicated that the foliar application of cytokinine and auxin hormones counteracted some of the salt induced adverse effects and improved the maize yield. Due to its effect on diminishing salt aggregation in relation to ridge planting, furrow planting, prepare semi saline and saline areas for growing crops. It is concluded that furrow planting with CK application in V 8 - V 10 stage (50 g. l- 1) and IBA in silking stage (10 g. l- 1) reduced the effects of salinity on plant and produced the highest grain yield...|$|E
40|$|Fluctuating annual harvest volumes {{create a}} peak load {{problem in the}} {{provision}} of <b>grain</b> storage <b>capacity.</b> There are a number of technologies for handling and storing grain, ranging from capital intensive to labour intensive methods. Optimal provision of <b>grain</b> storage <b>capacity</b> can therefore be analysed in the framework of the conventional peak load pricing model. An investment model of grain storage is outlined and the optimal technology choices are determined according to simple investment roles. Capacity of the more capital intensive storage types should be only provided if the extra capital cost is justified by the saving in operating costs, which depends on the expected utilisation of storage. Some level of supply failure is justifiable. An examination of grain storage costs in Western Australia revealed that horizontal storage was the best technology for dealing with most grain storage demand at sites where turnover is limited In the receival period. This concurs with the general investment choices in Western Australia. However, {{there appears to be a}} high level of overcapacity at many sites, implying that the cost of supply failure is perceived to be greater than the marketable value of the grain.
