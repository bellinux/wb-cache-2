500|$|Some time later, Elphaba's {{opposition}} of the Wizard's regime has earned her the title [...] "The Wicked Witch of the West". Glinda has become the smiling public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title [...] "Glinda the Good" [...] and positioned by Morrible as the nation's defender against the Witch. A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as Captain of the Guard (a position he has accepted {{in order to find}} Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about the Witch, including an idiotic story that she will be melted by water. Fiyero is furious and not calmed by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba {{does not want to be}} found. He is further shocked when Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda. This is news to Fiyero and he storms off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but it is clear she realizes her dream life <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> a great price ("Thank Goodness").|$|E

The African Development Bank claimed that Ethiopia [...] "is registering a remarkable economic growth in recent years." [...] On top of that various social concerns exist and the Ethiopian section of VOA news on its Amharic language program has reported about problems facing farmers and growers who often get less profit due to the market exploitation of middlemen.|$|E

[...] However, [...] "Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality healthcare. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost." [...] There is [...] "no question" [...] that the lower cost <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> the cost of [...] "restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services," [...] said Bell. A new approach is targeting waiting times, which are reported on public websites.|$|E
2500|$|Proposition 65 remains {{politically}} controversial {{even after}} 25 years, {{in large part}} because, in effect, it puts {{the burden of proof}} on business instead of government to make a key scientific determination about safety levels for specific toxic chemicals that the businesses are knowingly exposing members of the public to. [...] According to the California Environmental Protection Agency, [...] "Proposition 65 has... increased public awareness about the adverse effects of exposures to listed chemicals.... provided an incentive for manufacturers to remove listed chemicals from their products.... Although Proposition 65 has benefited Californians, it <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> a cost for companies doing business in the state." [...] The law has also been criticized for the proliferation of [...] "bounty hunter" [...] lawsuits. Attorneys have collected {{more than two-thirds of the}} money paid by businesses to settle Proposition 65 lawsuits since 2000.|$|E

"This {{national}} {{characteristic of}} the English to shout: 'Help, they are killing us!' when nobody even thinks of touching them, is disgusting… But if this trait is notable even in England, how much more so is it in India? Here suspicion has become a monomania. Anglo-Indians see Russian spies even in their own shoes, and this drives them to madness… They watch every new arrival from one province to another, even should he be an Englishman. People have been deprived not only of every weapon, but of all knives and axes. The peasant can hardly chop his wood, or protect himself from a tiger. But the English are still afraid. It is true that here there are but 60,000 of them, while the native population numbers 245 million. And their system which they took over from successful animal-tamers, is good only until the animal senses his tamer is fearful in his turn… Then his hour <b>has</b> <b>come!</b> <b>At</b> all events, such a manifestation of chronic fear merely admits a recognition of one's own weakness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Western RPGs {{have also}} {{received}} criticism in recent years. They remain less popular in Japan, where, until recently, Western games in general {{had a negative}} reputation. In Japan, where {{the vast majority of}} early console role-playing video games originate, Western RPGs remain largely unknown. [...] The developer Motomu Toriyama criticized Western RPGs, stating that they [...] "dump you in a big open world, and let you do whatever you like [...] difficult to tell a compelling story." [...] Hironobu Sakaguchi noted that [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Western RPGs as [...] "a sort of different style, born from first person shooters." [...] In recent years, some have also criticized Western RPGs for becoming less RPG-like, instead with further emphasis on action Christian Nutt of GameSpy states that, in contrast to Japanese RPGs, Western RPGs' greater control over the development and customization of playable characters <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>at</b> the expense of plot and gameplay, resulting in what he felt was generic dialogue, lack of character development within the narrative and weaker battle systems. He also states that Western RPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself. Tom Battey of Edge Magazine noted that the problems often cited against Japanese RPGs (mentioned above) also often apply to many Western RPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre. BioWare games have been criticized for [...] "lack of innovation, repetitive structure and lack of real choice." [...] Western RPGs, such as Bethesda games, have also been criticized for lacking in [...] "narrative strength" [...] or [...] "mechanical intricacy" [...] due to the open-ended, sandbox structure of their games.|$|E
