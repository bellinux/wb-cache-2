Thermal treatment resulted, {{during the first}} 5 min in a decrease in {{molecular weight}} as measured by intrinsic viscosity, after which longer heating had no significant effect. Higher moisture contents and temperatures generally resulted in more breakdown, although the effect diminished at higher temperatures. The decrease in intrinsic viscosity during <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>treatment</b> at relatively low temperatures and moisture contents was shown to be only dependent on the maximal shear stress. At higher temperatures, thermomechanical breakdown could be split into a mechanical part depending on maximal shear stress and a thermal breakdown part, which was again time-dependent on the shorter time-scales only. Higher moisture content during <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in more thermal breakdown and lowered the shear stresses required for mechanical breakdown.

40|$|<b>Thermomechanical</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{aluminium}} and titanium-based light metal alloys {{is known to}} be a useful and highly effective process, which offers superior mechanical properties. In contrast {{there is a lack of}} equivalent knowledge and experience in the field of magnesium alloys. This situation forms the background of the present work, which has the aim to show the beneficial effects of thermomechanical processing on a commercial age hardenable Magnesium alloy. The main strengthening mechanisms available in the magnesium-alloy considered are work hardening and to a minor extent precipitation hardening. The work hardening capacity is only limited by dynamic recovery, which strongly depends on the starting microstructure. Dynamic recrystallization can not take place under any circumstances, even if high deformation degrees and high deformation temperature are concerned.

Optical microphotograph of the sintered Cu- 4 at% Ag alloy shows relatively homogeneous structure with spherical pores presented.
