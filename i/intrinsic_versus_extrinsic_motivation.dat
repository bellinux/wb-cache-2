50|$|Self-determination {{theory is}} a broad theory of {{motivation}} in work organizations that maintains the predictions of cognitive evaluation theory but also recognizes {{the limitations of the}} theory, such as organizational conditions under which predictions do not apply or are less relevant in real-world settings, which cognitive evaluation theory fails to recognize. The theory differentiates between various types of motivational states, distinguishes the organizational conditions where extrinsic rewards are more effective than intrinsic rewards, examines individual differences in orientation toward <b>intrinsic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> and discusses managerial behavior that can enhance intrinsic motivation. Findings from the Deci et al. (1989) study have supported self-determination theory as an approach to work motivation by showing how managers can impact the work attitudes of their employees. The study reported that managerial autonomy support which included provision of options, giving relevant information in a non-autonomous way, acknowledging subordinates' perspectives and cultivating self-initiation resulted in employees having more positive work-related attitudes such as higher level of job satisfaction and increased level of trust in corporate management.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Intrinsic {{motivation}} is an energizing {{of behavior that}} comes from within an individual, out of will and interest for the activity at hand. No external rewards are required to incite the intrinsically motivated person into action. The reward is the behavior itself. Logically, this seems like an ideal, for people to act as “origins ” of their behavior rather than “pawns ” (deCharms, 1968). However, {{it is certainly not}} the case that every real world behavior stems from an intrinsic energy. Schools are of particular interest when it comes to <b>intrinsic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation,</b> particularly because of the different outcomes that researchers have shown to result from intrinsic motivation: more interest, excitement, confidence, enhanced performance, persistence, creativity, self-esteem and genera...|$|E

40|$|Research {{on moral}} {{identity}} has not provided evidence for age-related trajectories in moral identity development. There {{has been a}} focus on a specific age range, particularly adolescence and emerging adulthood, ignoring older age groups and their development. In addition, {{research has focused on}} broad notions of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic</b> moral <b>motivation,</b> without taking into consideration the various contexts in which moral behavior is expressed. There exists no current research on age differences in moral motivation. This study investigated differences in moral motivation across four consecutive age groups; adolescence (14 - 18 years, n = 67, 41 females), emerging adulthood (19 - 25 years, n = 52, 29 females), young adulthood (26 - 45 years, n = 66, 43 females), and middle age (46 - 65 years, n = 67, 35 females). In addition, moral motivation was examined across three different contexts; family, school/work, and community. Overall, 252 participants completed a semistructured interview. Results showed that internal moral motivation increased with age between adolescence and young adulthood, plateauing at middle age; while external moral motivation decreased with age across the four age groups. In addition, external moral motivation was highest in the context of school/work, than in the context of family and community; while internal moral motivation was higher in the contexts of family and community than in the context of school/work. The implications of this study are that we now have an increased awareness of the trajectory of moral identity development across the life span; as well as increased knowledge of what motivates individuals to behave morally in various contexts of life...|$|R
40|$|Prioritizing {{intrinsic}} life goals (self-development, community involvement, relationships) {{rather than}} extrinsic ones (money, fame, image) {{is said to}} foster not only personal wellbeing, but also pro-social behavior such as protecting the environment. We explored concurrent and prospective links between <b>intrinsic</b> (<b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic)</b> life goals and self-reported environmentally responsible behavior, using correlational and longitudinal data from adult participants in a mass consumer society (UK) and a fast developing nation (Chile). In both countries, the importance of <b>intrinsic</b> (<b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic)</b> life goals was associated cross-sectionally with environmentally responsible behavior, even after controlling for possible effects of environmental worldviews and environmental identification. In longitudinal analyses, life goals prospectively predicted environmentally responsible behavior over a two-year period, whereas, rather unexpectedly, environmental worldviews and environmental identification did not. We conclude that focusing on intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, life goals may be important not just for individuals’ well-being, {{but also for the}} well-being of future generations...|$|R

Comparing levels and intercorrelations of implicit theories of intelligence, effort beliefs, academic motivation, achievement goals, learning styles and approaches, and subject attitudes learns that traditional dichotomies often postulated in learning theories, {{such as those of}} surface versus deep learning, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation,</b> self-regulation of learning versus external regulation, and mastery goals versus performance goals, do not manifest in different cultural clusters. In contrast, cluster profiles tend to be rather balanced. Cultural differences in intercorrelations are substantial and again indicate the difficulty of constructing culture-invariant learning theories. One of these differences regards the differentiation of several facets in performance goals and in different aspects of memorisation-based learning processes.

40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} the various applications of CT-virtual endoscopy, {{for the assessment}} of urinary tract abnormalities Materials and Methods: Sixty-three patients were evaluated by CT-virtual endoscopy (49 CT-cystoscopy; 14 CT-pyeloureteroscopy). CT-cystoscopy was obtained for follow-up of bladder tumor (n= 21), radiologic suspicion (n= 12) or radiologic evidence of urinary tract lesion (n= 16). CT-pyeloureteroscopy was done due to neoplasm (n= 5), calculi (n= 3) and extrinsic compressions (n= 3). Results: In 49 patients submitted to CT-cystoscopy, 27 tumors were detected intraoperatively (ranging 0. 5 - 4. 8 cm). CT-cystoscopy revealed 21 tumors (78 %); all tumors larger than 0. 6 cm were detected. Tumor within a bladder diverticulum was seen by CT-cystoscopy but not by endoscopy, in two patients. Useful additional information such as extension of tumors into the anterior portion of the bladder neck (n= 2) and adequate characterization of bladder diverticulum in a child (n= 1) was also obtained. CT-pyeloureteroscopy detected 6 of 9 tumors (67 %), and was useful in the differential diagnosis of pelvic/ureteral tumor versus calculi (n= 8) and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic</b> ureteral lesion (n= 3).

Currently only about one-fourth of both adults {{and high school students}} in the United States meet recommended physical activity levels (Rachette, Deusinger, Strub, Highstein, 2 ̆ 6 Deusinger, 2005). Research examining health behaviors in college students found undergraduates have overall low physical activity levels and poor nutritional habits (Waldron 2 ̆ 6 Dieser, 2010). The goal of this research study was to examine both undergraduate and graduate students’ beliefs about benefits and barriers to exercise, as well as to examine the role exercise plays in self-identity for students. It was hypothesized that undergraduate students would identify more benefits to exercise than barriers, and that graduate students would identify more barriers than benefits to exercise. The second hypothesis predicted that undergraduate students will identify more benefits to exercise than graduate students, and that graduate students would identify more barriers to exercise than undergraduate students. The third hypothesis predicted there would be a significant difference in EIS scores between undergraduate and graduate students. Results showed that both graduate and undergraduate students identified more barriers to exercise than benefits, and that there was a relationship between frequency of exercise and inclusion of exercise as part of one’s identity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{disentangle}} the complex relationship between gender, personality and academic performance. Previous work has shown higher levels of performance for female students. Further, a bulk of studies stressed the role of personality, conceptualized within the Big Five framework, with respect to academic achievement. The literature, however, is unclear with respect to personality as an underlying factor in the relationship between gender and academic outcomes. In this chapter, we investigate whether the gender effect on academic results can partly be explained by differences between men and women in personality and whether academic motivation could be the missing link to fully understand the gender effect on academic performance. We make a distinction between three different approaches towards academic motivation: motivation as a trait, motivation regulation and academic effort. We theoretically and empirically focus on the possible role of Self-Determination Theory and Regulatory Focus Theory in explaining gender differences in academic effort and performance. The sample consisted of 233 college freshmen in a Business Administration program at a University college in Belgium. The data for this study were collected in a survey and completed with the end-of-semester exam results. Models with academic effort and performance as dependent variables were tested. The results reveal that gender differences in academic effort and performance can be explained, both as a whole and in the particular parts, by differences in personality, especially conscientiousness as the trait component of study motivation. In explaining academic performance, effort (the state component of study motivation) as well as the dimension of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> (motivation regulation) seem to be the essential elements. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Over some 40 {{years of}} research, Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) has {{developed}} into a grand theory of human motivation and optimal functioning. The theory {{has been applied to}} various life domains including education, exercising, development, parenting and relationships. Recently, the theory was introduced in the field of occupational health psychology and several empirical contributions have now provided support for its validity (Gagné & Deci, 2005; Scheldon, Turban, Brown, Barrick, & Judge, 2003). This presentation provides a conceptual overview of SDT and reviews its empirical findings. We start with an outline of SDT’s meta-theoretical assumptions. We then describe three important themes within SDT, that is, 1) the distinction between qualitative different types of behavioural regulation (i. e. autonomous versus controlled motivation), also labelled as the ‘why’ of behaviour, 2) the differentiation between qualitative different goal orientations (i. e. <b>intrinsic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>extrinsic</b> goals), conceptualised as the ‘what’ of behaviour and 3) the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs (i. e. autonomy, belongingness and autonomy). We furthermore discuss job design and leadership style, two important organisational aspects, from the perspective of SDT. We conclude with a summary of SDT’s most important contributions for occupational health psychology. status: publishe...|$|R
