25|$|Australia won the First Test by 166 runs {{to take a}} 1–0 lead in the series, {{though a}} little more effort from England could have denied them an {{important}} victory. Worse for them Dennis Amiss, John Edrich and David Lloyd had broken hands, Keith Fletcher a badly bruised arm, Bob Willis a groin strain and Peter Lever had injured a side muscle. Before they left Brisbane the tour selectors sent back to London for a replacement batsmen and asked for the 41-year-old Colin Cowdrey. Cowdrey was highly regarded by the MCC team and in particular by Mike Denness, who had succeeded him as captain of Kent. In his 20-year Test career he had faced the fast bowling of Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith, Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Neil Adcock and even the young Dennis Lillee. Although the Australian press was aghast at such a recall – Cowdrey had not played a Test in four years – the tourists were keen to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with the technique and strength of purpose to play the fastest of bowlers. The attendance over the five days was a record 62,000, easily beating the old one of 42,000 as the facilities at the Gabba had been greatly improved over the wooden stands and barbed wire 'concentration camp' of yesteryears.|$|E

500|$|He {{signed as}} a {{professional}} footballer for Leicester City in August 1944, choosing them ahead of local club Middlesbrough primarily due to the close links between Middlesbrough Swifts and Leicester City; he also worked as an apprentice bricklayer. Leicester originally thought him {{not good enough to}} turn professional, but he was taken under the wing of Leicester player Sep Smith who mentored Revie on many of his ideas about the game. Smith instructed Revie that [...] "When not in position, get into position; never beat a man by dribbling if you can beat him more easily with a pass; it is not the man on the ball but the one running into position to take the pass who constitutes the danger; and the aim is to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> spare in a passing move. Soccer would then become easy." [...] He played in the wartime league, before making his debut in the Football League on the opening day of the 1946–47 season, a 3–0 defeat to Manchester City, who would go on to win the Second Division that season. He showed good form at Filbert Street before breaking his right ankle in three places after a tackle from Tottenham Hotspur's Ron Burgess; the injury could have ended his career, but he recovered to full fitness within 19 weeks.|$|E

The letter expressed Abdullah's desire to place Perak under British protection, and [...] "to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of sufficient abilities to show (him) a good system of government." [...] In 1874, the Straits Settlements governor Sir Andrew Clarke convened a meeting on Pulau Pangkor, at which Sultan Abdullah was installed on the throne of Perak in preference to his rival, Sultan Ismail. This Pangkor Treaty also required that the Sultan of Perak accept a British Resident, a post granted wide administrative powers.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{involved}} carefully {{studying a}} target bank for many {{hours before the}} robbery, developing a detailed floor plan, noting the location of safes, taking meticulous notes and establishing escape routes. [...] He would occasionally <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> pose as a journalist {{to better understand the}} inner workings of the bank. [...] Lamm assigned each gang member a specific job, along with a specific zone of the bank they were charged with surveying and a strict timetable to complete their stage of the robbery. Among the jobs he assigned to his fellow robbers were the lookout, the getaway driver, the lobby man and the vault man. He also put his men through a series of rehearsals, some of which involved using a full-scale mock-up of the interior of the bank. Lamm stressed the importance of timing during these practice runs, and used stopwatches to ensure the proper results were achieved. He only allowed his gang members to stay in a bank for a specific period of time, regardless of how much money they could steal.|$|E
