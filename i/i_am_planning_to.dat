5000|$|In December 1893 Balmont {{informed}} Nikolai Minsky in a letter: [...] "I've {{just written}} {{a series of}} my own verse and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> start the publishing process in January. I anticipate my liberal friends to be outraged for there's not much liberalism in this, while 'corrupting influences' are aplenty." [...] Under the Northern Sky (Под северным небом) came out in 1894 and marked the starting point in his literary career, several critics praising the young author's originality and versatility. The second collection, In Boundlessness (В безбрежности, 1895) saw Balmont starting to experiment with the Russian language's musical and rhythmical structures. Mainstream critics reacted coolly, but the Russian cultural elite of the time hailed the author as gifted innovator. Around this time Balmont met and became close friends with Sergei Poliakov, Knut Hamsun's Russian translator and an influential literary entrepreneur (who in 1899 would launch the Scorpion publishing house). He also became {{a close friend of}} Bryusov, who had a formative influence on the development of Balmont's poetic and critical voice. In 1896 Balmont married Ekaterina Alekseyevna Andreeva, and the couple went abroad that year to travel through Western Europe. All the while Balmont was engaged in an intensive self-education: he learned several languages and became an expert in various subjects like the Spanish art and the Chinese culture. In the spring of 1897 Oxford University invited Balmont to read lectures on Russian poetry. [...] "For the first time ever I've been given the opportunity to live my life totally in accord with my intellectual and aesthetic interests. I'll never get enough of this wealth of arts, poetry and philosophy treasures ," [...] he {{wrote in a letter to}} critic Akim Volynsky. These European impressions have formed the basis for Balmont's third collection Silence (Тишина, 1898).|$|E
