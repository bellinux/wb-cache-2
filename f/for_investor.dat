5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets <b>for</b> <b>investor</b> dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E

The suit also alleges that significant [...] payments were concealed.|$|E

30|$|Assuming {{that the}} central {{government}} has a strong ability to supervise and regulate local officials and has a certain policy orientation for economic growth, the local decentralization level has {{a significant impact on}} the degree of property rights protection. In particular, the resistance costs <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> are higher when decentralization is only to provincial level, making it difficult <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> to influence the behavior of provincial officials through the use of protests and complaints, resulting in a lower degree of property rights protection for private businesses. The resistance costs <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> are lower when decentralization is to the prefectural (county) level, so it is easier <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> to influence the behavior of provincial level officials through protests and complaints, leading to a higher degree of property rights protection for private businesses.|$|R
