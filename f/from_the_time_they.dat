5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental plants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> {{were first}} {{brought from the}} New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E

5|$|When the Iowa-class battleships were {{launched}} in 1943 and 1944 they carried twenty quad Bofors 40mm gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy guns were also {{employed in the}} protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II. These guns remained on the battleships Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were commissioned until they were reactivated for service in the 1980s. As each battleship arrived for modernization during the early and mid-1980s the Bofors mounts that remained aboard were removed {{due in large part}} to the ineffectiveness of such manually aimed weapons against modern day jet fighters and enemy missiles. The replacement for the Bofors guns was the US Navy's Phalanx Close-in weapon system (CIWS).|$|E
5|$|The {{decipherment}} of the Mycenaean Linear B script, {{a writing}} system adapted {{for the use}} of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age, demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period. Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the Iliad, in reference to the Trojan War. The latter was supposed to have happened in the late 13thearly 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of Troy. Homer used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers. These names appear to have passed down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his Iliad. There is an isolated reference to a-ka-wi-ja-de in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.|$|E

25|$|In {{the dispute}} with the {{established}} graziers on whose land the Kellys were encroaching, they were suspected many times of cattle or horse stealing, but never convicted. In all, eighteen charges were brought against members of Kelly's immediate family before he was declared an outlaw, while only half that number resulted in guilty verdicts. This is a highly unusual ratio for the time, and led to claims that Kelly's family was unfairly targeted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> moved to northeast Victoria. Perhaps the move was necessary because of Kelly's mother's squabbles with family members and her appearances in court over family disputes. The author Antony O'Brien has argued that Victoria's colonial police practices treated arrest as equivalent to proof of guilt.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} markets are {{considered}} historic places. The Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market {{is located in}} the historic center of Mexico City, just northeast of the main plaza, or Zocalo. It was built in 1934 as a prototype for a more modern marketplace and has a number of unusual features such as day care and an auditorium. However, the markets most distinctive feature is the approximately 1,450 square meters of wall and ceiling space covered in murals. These murals were painted by students of Diego Rivera and under his supervision. The works mostly reflect socialist themes, such as the exploitation of workers, peasants and miners, the fight against Nazism and fascism, and racial discrimination. Earthquakes, time, humidity and vandalism took their toll on the murals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were painted. Restoration of the murals began in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} year of his contract, Ilya Kovalchuk and the Thrashers could not come to an {{agreement}} on an extension. General Manager Don Waddell reportedly offered 12-year, $101 million and seven-year, $70 million contracts, both of which Kovalchuk turned down. Rather than potentially losing him to free agency in the off-season, the team traded Kovalchuk on February 4, 2010, to the New Jersey Devils. Atlanta received defenseman Johnny Oduya, rookie forward Niclas Bergfors, junior prospect Patrice Cormier and a first-round pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Kovalchuk and defenseman Anssi Salmela; the teams also traded second-round selections in 2010. The Thrashers finished tenth in the Conference, with 83 points, which would be the most points they had earned in a regular season <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> won the division title in 2006–07 to the team's eventual relocation in the summer of 2011.|$|E

Teams are responsible for being ready to leave at the correct time, and are given no time credit should they miss their departure time.

25|$|New Zealand {{grass grub}} has an annual life cycle, taking {{typically}} one year under normal climatic conditions but {{can take up}} to two years in adverse weather such as drought or significant cold periods (this also includes periods where the soil moisture is very high), or due to a food shortage. Over that one-year period the adult beetles live for 4–6 weeks emerging in spring (October – December) when the air temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius, and undertake two main flights, the first flight is to mate and the second and consecutive are to feed and lay clutches of eggs. Females are the last to emerge from the soil, this leads to localized infestations due to them being unable to reach a significant distance before being mated. Egg cluster size can range from 5-80 eggs and range from 80–250mm {{below the surface of the}} soil. Females can lay two to three clusters over a two to three week period. Costelytra zealandica larvae hatch between November and March (depending on the time they were laid).
