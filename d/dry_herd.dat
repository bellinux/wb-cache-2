Kufra did not fall under the dominion of either the Arabs or the Ottomans and was part of a Toubou Sultanate with capital in Tazirbu.

The relations of Sukhne with its steppic environment are described in two different periods: in the 1930 's when irrigation is developing while the caravan-trade is in decline; and in the 1980 's after the opening of the trans desert highway, when trade again flourishes in the city; <b>dry</b> farming and <b>herding</b> are then expanding very fast while the oases gardens are at complete abandon. This double perspective underlines the variability and the extreme sensitivity of activities and resources of those marginal settlements to the climatic, political and economic environment.

40|$|Session 2 : Forecasting {{the impact}} of global {{environmental}} changes on livestockForages, fed fresh (grazing mainly) or conserved (silages, hay) represent 70 to 90 % of the ruminants annual diet. Ruminant production systems are potentially highly sensitive to climate changes because of the great sensitivity of pastures and forages production to heat and drought periods (+- 50 % of annual production). As herd requirements are high all over the year, farmers need to be globally self-sufficient (auto-security), so to adapt their foraging systems. Ways of evolution of foraging systems will be structural (anticipation, low reversibility) and tactical (corrective actions, more reversible). Main ways are : decreased stocking rate, increased forage stock security (more than > 6 months), diversification of feed resources (winter, spring, summer and autumn growth periods), change of the annual pattern of grazing periods, increase proportion of dual purpose crops (maize, sorghum, cereals-legumes) that may be cropped young as forage or mature as grain, replacement of maize by sorghum (greater water use efficiency), summer or winter intercrops, using new crops as forage, also for grazing : beet, turnip, chicory, plantain, multispecies swards, lucerne, red clover, leguminous shrubs, trees …. To be consistent, herds characteristics and herd management should also be adapted, both structurally (long-term) and tactically (short-term) : more robust animals (change of breed, cross-breeding) with less diet energy density requirements, calving periods adapted to forage availability, <b>drying</b> duration, <b>herd</b> size and culling management, once-a-day milking, etc. These changes are to be considered {{within the context of}} prices volatility (need to control production costs) and extension of farm size that generally increases mechanisation (milking and feeding robots) and decreases area accessible per cow, both decreasing use of grazing at farm level...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{simulation}} model which explicitly captures {{the movement of}} wild animals over the landscape and the effect which herd mobility has on the temporal and spatial course of an epidemic. Using the example of classical swine fever in feral pig populations in the tropical savannas, we demonstrate that seasonal factors influencing population density and movement patterns are {{an important factor in}} the transmission of the disease. Pig population density is much greater {{at the start of the}} dry season than at the start of the wet season, with an epidemic most likely to occur if initiated at the start of the dry season. Spatial heterogeneity due to scarcity of water in the <b>dry</b> season causes <b>herds</b> to congregate around water sources. This concentration of herds, and the consequential isolation of sub-populations, reduces overall disease transmission compared with a model where the population is more evenly distributed over the landscape. The presence of adult male pig herds, which travel over greater distances than family herds, is shown to increase the overall scale of an outbreak in the dry season by connecting together otherwise isolated family herds. Eradication strategies are more likely to be successful in the dry season if they target long-range adult male herds.

40|$|The ongoing global {{decline in}} vulture populations raises major {{conservation}} concerns, but {{little is known}} about the factors that mediate scavenger habitat use, in particular the importance of abundance of live prey versus prey mortality. We test this using data from the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in East Africa. The two hypotheses that prey abundance or prey mortality are the main drivers of vulture habitat use provide alternative predictions. If vultures select areas based only on prey abundance, we expect tracked vultures to remain close to herds of migratory wildebeest regardless of season. However, if vultures select areas where mortality rates are greatest then we expect vultures to select the driest regions, where animals are more likely to die of starvation, and to be attracted to migratory wildebeest only during the dry season when wildebeest mortality is greatest. We used data from GSM-GPS transmitters to assess the relationship between three vulture species and migratory wildebeest in the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. Results indicate that vultures preferentially cluster around migratory herds only during the <b>dry</b> season, when <b>herds</b> experience their highest mortality. Additionally during the wet season, Ruppell’s and Lappet-faced vultures select relatively dry areas, based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, whereas White-backed vultures preferred wetter areas during the wet season.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 A {{simulation}} model capable of execution on a programmable calculator {{was developed to}} study voluntary intake, liveweight change, and fertility of grade Zebu cows in the Llanos of Colombia. Organic nitrogen in the diet and meta bolic weight were used to predict intake; age, liveweight, and energy concentration were the driving variables for the maintenance prediction equation. Energy concentration was calculated {{as a function of}} crude protein and digestible organic matter, and liveweight change was predicted as a function of intake, maintenance, liveweight, and energy concentration. Multiplicative correction factors were fitted from data obtained from cow-calf experiments to adjust intake and maintenance for the effects of burning the native savanna, compensatory gain, mineral deficiency, and lactation and gestation. The correction factors were. 89 for intake after burning the native savanna, 1. 05 and. 95 for intake and maintenance during compensatory gain, and. 90 for reduced intake due to mineral deficiency. Correction factors for physiological status were 1. 20 for intake during early and late lactation, and 1. 40, 1. 32, and 1. 05 for maintenance during early lactation, late lactation, and late gestation, respectively. The correction factors for burning and compensatory gain were fitted against data from <b>dry</b> cows of <b>Herds</b> 4 - 5 of the Herd Systems Experiment (HSE) and yielded a Pearsonian correlation coefficient of. 95 (p<. 001) between observed and simulated average daily gains. between March 1975 and June 1976.

40|$|We {{investigated}} space-use {{patterns of}} the West African savanna buffalo (Syncerus caffer brachyceros), a little-studied subspecies occurring at the northern limit of the African buffalo's geographical range. This buffalo generally ranges in small herds (about 45 individuals) and has a low body mass (approximately 400 kg) relative to the Cape buffalo (S. c. caffer). We monitored the movements of 7 breeding herds in W Regional Park (Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger) using global positioning system collars and activity data loggers. Habitat selection was analyzed at both large (interseasonal) and small (intraseasonal) scales in a context where resources are segregated spatially at some times of year. Both biotic (primary production and vegetation types) and abiotic (timing of rainfall and surface water) covariates, {{and the extent to}} which neighboring herds shared space, were considered. In the <b>dry</b> season buffalo <b>herds</b> ranged close (within 5. 3 +/- 2. 0 km, mean +/- SD) to segments of permanent rivers. At the onset of the monsoon all herds but 1 (which had year-round access to suitable resources) performed a large (35 +/- 10 km) directional movement in response to a large-scale gradient of primary production. Spatiotemporal dynamics of forage and water resources thus jointly stimulated interseasonal directional movements and shaped large (335 +/- 167 km(2)) annual home ranges. Furthermore, the establishment of home ranges in the wet season appears to be conditioned by a threshold (about 10 %) in the availability of perennial grasses. Habitat-selection analysis at intraseasonal scale also underlines the key role played by perennial grasses for buffaloes. The spatial arrangements of home ranges of neighboring herds also suggest that interherd behavioral avoidance is a high-level constraint on foraging processes.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of age of Lacaune breed ewes on milk performance (milk yield {{and the content of}} individual components of milk). The length of lactation was also evaluated. Data from farm Statek Horní Dvorce s. r. o. were used and entries from years 2012, 2013 and 2014, when the milk performance was monitored by method AT. With the {{view of the fact that}} the standardized lactation in 2012 was set on 240 days while since 2013 the required length was 150 days, the year 2012 was not included into the comparison due to dubiousness of the results. The influence of age of an ewe on total milk yield in the studied farm is not clear and cannot be established with significant certainty, although in the studied years the milk performance was higher than the average in the Czech republic. In the 2013 was the total milk yield 323 kg of milk and in the 2014 was 307, 4 kg of milk. The findings of basic milk parameters of individual components of milk show that the age of an ewe has an influence on the components. With growing age the content of fat was decreasing. At three-year-old ewes the content of fat was 7. 36 %, while at four-year-olds the content reached only 7. 3 %. The content of lactose also seemed to decrees with age.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to explore the relationship between <b>herd</b> <b>dry</b> period (DP) intramammary infection (IMI) incidence and elimination rates. A cohort of 91 Canadian dairy herds was recruited and followed in 2007 and 2008. Universal dry cow therapy was widely adopted among the participating herds. At the beginning of years 2007 and 2008, a sample of 15 cows was selected in each herd. A series of quarter-milk samples consisting of 2 predry and 2 postcalving samples were collected on each quarter of these 30 cows. Milk samples were analyzed using routine bacteriological milk culture, and predry and postcalving IMI statuses of these quarters were established using parallel interpretation of the 2 predry and 2 postcalving tests, respectively. Intramammary infection status was defined as IMI by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), or Corynebacterium spp. Incidence and elimination rates of DP IMI were computed for each herd. Lowess curves and linear regression were used to investigate the association between DP IMI incidence and elimination rates. Significant negative associations were found between incidence and elimination rates of Staph. aureus and CNS. The relationship between incidence and elimination rates was nonlinear for CNS, with a relatively strong negative relationship between DP IMI incidence and elimination rates for herds with relatively low DP IMI incidence (< 0. 10 new IMI/quarter-month). For herds with higher DP IMI incidence (≥ 0. 10 new IMI/quarter-month), a weaker negative relationship was observed between rates. No significant associations could be seen between DP incidence and elimination rates of streptococci other than Strep. agalactiae and of Corynebacterium spp. These results suggest that, conversely to the general belief, acquisition of new IMI and elimination of existing IMI during the DP may be driven, at least for staphylococci, by common mechanisms. The use of management strategies that would lead to the selection of pathogens less well adapted to the host could explain the associations observed between acquisition and elimination of IMI over the DP...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the predictive ability of the <b>herd</b> <b>dry</b> period (DP) intramammary infection (IMI) incidence and elimination rates derived from predry and postcalving somatic cell count (SCC) measurements [quarter-level SCC and dairy herd improvement (DHI) composite-level SCC] for monitoring the herd DP IMI incidence and elimination rates. A cohort of 91 Canadian dairy herds was followed from 2007 to 2008. In each herd, a sample of 15 cows was selected each year, and a series of 2 predry and 2 postcalving quarter milk samples were collected. Routine milk bacteriological culture was conducted to identify IMI, SCC was measured on the quarter milk samples, and composite SCC of the last predry and first postcalving DHI tests were obtained. Mastitis pathogens were grouped into 3 categories: major pathogens, minor pathogens, and any pathogens. For each herd, DP bacteriological culture-derived IMI incidence and elimination rates were computed using quarter milk culture data. Similarly, SCC-derived herd incidence and elimination rates were computed using quarter and DHI composite-level SCC measurements and using various SCC thresholds to define new and eliminated IMI. Linear regression was used to compare herd quarter-level and composite-level SCC-derived herd incidence and elimination with DP bacteriological culture-derived IMI incidence and elimination. Herd DP incidences computed by using quarter-level SCC, and with most of the SCC thresholds tested, were significant predictors of the DP major, minor, and any IMI incidences (F-test; P≤ 0. 05). The highest coefficients of determination (R(2)) were obtained with thresholds of 200, 000 (R(2) : 12 %) and 50, 000 cells/mL (R(2) : 25 %) for predicting major and minor IMI, respectively. When using composite DHI SCC measurements, however, substantial losses of predictive power were seen for minor and any IMI incidences compared with quarter-level SCC. For DP major IMI incidence, composite SCC yielded similar, but modest, predictive power when a cutoff value of 150, 000 cells/mL was chosen to define new IMI. To predict DP elimination rates, the value of quarter-level SCC seemed limited to predicting the DP major IMI elimination rate. Composite SCC, on the other hand, showed modest predictive power for major and minor IMI elimination rates, with thresholds of 200, 000 and 50, 000 cells/mL, respectively. Results from the current study suggest that quarter and composite SCC-derived rates could be used as substitutes for bacteriological culture-derived rates for some groups of mastitis pathogens.

40|$|Studies {{were made}} of the {{occurrence}} and distribution of bovine tuberculosis in the Taumarunui and Masterton veterinary districts, within which endemic wildlife tuberculosis is widespread. These districts were compared with the movement control herds of the surveillance areas of New Zealand, which are free of wildlife tuberculosis. The study covers the period from 1985 - 1990. The frequencies of tuberculosis infection for different categories of herds and different veterinary districts were examined and comparisons made of rates and risk of disease between the herd categories and districts under consideration. A comparison of incidence measures showed a strong positive correlation between cumulative, corrected and true incidence values. Cumulative and corrected cumulative incidence values calculated for calendar, financial and test years were compared. Some disparity was found between annual cumulative incidences and annual corrected cumulative incidences calculated {{on the basis of}} calendar and test years, with measures calculated on the basis of test year having the highest values. Regional comparisons showed that movement control herds in surveillance areas had higher incidences of tuberculosis than did herds in the Taumarunui and Masterton veterinary districts. Beef <b>dry</b> stock <b>herds</b> had higher incidences of tuberculosis than did dairy or beef breeding enterprises. Endemic areas had the highest incidence of all tuberculosis area classes. Simple regression analyses indicated that the risk of tuberculosis for any animal in a herd was more closely related to the level of infection in adult cows than any other age or sex group. Cumulative incidence in yearlings was a poor predictor of risk for individual animals in a herd but there was a stronger relationship for the level of infection in 2 year-old animals. Stepwise logistic regression was used to explore and quantify associations between cumulative incidence and putative risk factors. The odds of cattle testing positive in herds in endemic areas was about five times as high as in herds in surveillance and fringe areas, where the risks of tuberculosis were about the same. The likelihood of reacting to the tuberculin test was considerably lower for animals in the Masterton and Taumarunui districts than for animals from movement control herds in surveillance areas outside those districts. The overall risk of infection increased slightly from 1985 to 1990. Poisson regression was used to examine the relationships between incidence density and the same independent variables which were examined using logistic regression. The relative risks for infection were higher in beef breeding, beef dry stock and other herd types than in dairy herds. Herds in endemic areas had rates of infection about seven times those in Fringe and Surveillance area herds, where the rates were about the same. The incidence of infection in herds increased with increased herd size and was considerably less in the Masterton and Taumarunui districts than in movement control herds in the Surveillance areas. There was a good general agreement between the logistic and poisson regression models in the overall relationships between the predictor variables common to both models and their respective dependent variables. Survival analysis showed that after going on to movement control for the first time, about 75 % of herds could be expected to be still on movement control after 12 months and about 50 % after 2 years. Herds in the Masterton veterinary district tended to stay on movement control longer than herds in the Taumarunui veterinary district and Surveillance areas (Risk ratio = 0. 69). After 2 years of testing, about 60 % of infected herds in the Taumarunui veterinary district and Surveillance areas had come off movement control, compared to 40 % of infected herds in the Masterton veterinary district. The survivorship probability of infected herds in Fringe, Surveillance and non-endemic zones for coming off movement control was lower than that for infected herds in endemic zones (Risk ratio = 0. 61). The estimated median time on movement control was 3 years for herds from endemic areas and 2 years for herds in Fringe, Surveillance and non-endemic zones. The risk of coming off movement control decreased with increasing herd size. Herds with high levels of cumulative incidence were more likely to stay on movement control for longer periods than those with lower levels of incidence. Simple linear regression indicated that distance from the nearest case herd with tuberculosis, distance from the Rangitoto buffer, distance from the nearest case in year one after breakdown and total number of cattle purchased were poor predictors of cumulative incidence. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of the association between cumulative incidence and putative risk factors during the first year after a breakdown indicated that risk was lower on farms where the main activity was dairying (MAINOP) and in herds in which the proportion of adult cattle (ADULTCAT) was high. Over the whole period for which herds were under movement control, risk levels remained lower for dairy farms and increased as the proportion of beef cattle was increased. Increased rates of infection were associated with the practice of buying replacements (BUYREPLA) in the first year after breakdown and rates were higher for the whole period in herds which ran cattle on agistment (OTHERCAT). Rates were lower on farms where cattle had access to bush (BUSHACCE), but despite the higher rates, survival analysis clearly showed that herds with access to bush could be expected to stay on movement control for longer periods than farms with no bush access. The median time on movement control was 1 year for farms without access to the bush and slightly more than 2 years for farms with access to the bush. Movement control farms without bush access were free from infection by 3 years, whereas farms with bush access took more than 5 years. Both the risk and incidence of infection tended to be lower at higher stocking rates in the short and long term after first going onto movement control. The association between personal qualities of farmers and the risk and rate of infection were also examined using multivariable regression analyses...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the productive and reproductive traits of the dairy sector under different management and husbandry practices in some dairy farms in Khartoum State. The data was collected from 150 dairy farms (survey), randomly selected from different localities within Khartoum state. Information pertinent to dairy management, husbandry practices and preventive measure practices were secured through an extensive questionnaire and direct interview with the owners farms. These farms were divided into two groups in traditional rearing system to compare the two groups in productive and reproductive traits under study. A group (poorly managed farms) and B group (good managed farms) The data were collected and subjected to statistical analysis using the computer program (SPSS) Statistical Package for Social Science. A descriptive statistical analysis of the data indicated the following: - The total number of cattle in the 150 herds surveyed was 10189 heads with an overall mean of 67. 93 ± 7. 78 head / herd. The study showed that 87. 3 % of the total dairy farms surveyed own crossbred cows with varying levels of exotic blood. The exact crossing percentage however was not identified because of lack of breeding records in the majority of the farms. The herd structure was as follow: the number of milking cows was 5957 cow (34 % of the total <b>herd),</b> <b>dry</b> cows was 4227 cow (23 % of the total herd) with an overall mean of 39. 71 ± 4. 98 cows / herd and 28. 18 ± 3. 06 cows / herd respectively. The heifers comprised 13 %, and calves (suckling 19 %, weaning 11 %). The average daily milk production per cow/ day was found to be 18. 24 ± 0. 59 Ibs. xi The data showed that the overall mean of the productive and reproductive traits investigated as fallows; Milk yield per lactation 3993. 74 ± 128. 59 (Ib), daily milk yield / cow/ day 18. 24 ± 0. 59 (Ib), lactation length 7. 32 ± 0. 07 (months), dry period 2. 01 ± 0. 01 (months), age at first calving 34. 69 ± 0. 25 (months), calving interval 12. 01 0. 03 (months), gestation length 279. 90 ± 0. 1 days), number of services per conception 1. 77 ± 0. 9 Only 33. 3 % of the farmers owned cultivable lands for growing their own roughages. The study showed the great impact of poor system of feeding from poor sources of fodders, so these affect the productivity and quality of milk. Most of the pens were poorly designed from local material with minimal impact on thermal stresses. Individual calf housing was adopted in only 0. 7 % of the farms and most of farms adopted groups housing (98. 7 %) in which poor environment and non hygienic measures prevail. About (67. 3 %) practiced identification of calves by name and ear tags. The study showed that (90 %) of the total farms studied do not keep farms records, and if exist it included only services records for artificial insemination companies. The records lack accuracy in addition to that poor supervision and insecurity in the farms Furthermore, the study indicated that (35. 3 %) of the animal owners depend on AI services while (32. 7 %) natural insemination and combination (32 %), indicate that the growth of awareness among farmers about the important of AI. The study pointed to the deterioration of health and spread of diseases. These may be attributed to the lack of veterinary and extension services in the farms, (28 % and, 6 %) respectively. Comparison between the poorly and good managed farms revealed no significant effects in the main traits studied; The daily milk yield in the two group 18. 19 ± 0. 63, 18. 50 ± 1. 69 (Ib); The age at first calving 34. 69 ± 0. 27, 35. 24 ± 0. 73 (month); Calving interval 11. 99 ± 0. 01, 12. 14 ± 0. 17 (month); Gestation period length 279. 84 ± 0. 11, 280. 24 ± 0. 24 (days); Number of services per conception (N. S. C) 1. 80 ± 0. 4, 1. 57 ± 0. 5 respectively. The finding of the study highlighted most of the constraints that face the dairy sector in Khartoum state...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Science Centre for African Ecology, School of Plant Animal and Environmental Sciences, 2011. Habitat selection occurs {{across a range of}} different spatial scales and is influenced by a variety of factors, ultimately determining how animals distribute themselves across the landscape. Studying the decisions that an individual animal makes across different levels of selection, from its choice in dietary item to predator avoidance strategies, is a fundamental link in understanding the response of groups of animals and ultimately entire populations that may provide insight into population performance. The study formed part of a broader study focused on the decline of rare antelope species. Specifically this study was aimed at establishing the home range and resource use of sable antelope in a region where they were initially expected to be thriving. The levels of selection covered in this study are: the location of home ranges of an individual or social group within the landscape; the use of various habitat components within the home range; and the procurement of food items within those habitats. At the highest level, the broad objectives were (1) to determine where sable occupied home ranges within the landscape, indicating the suitability of various landscape units to sustain sable populations and (2) to determine the relative use of habitat types within those home ranges that may enable sable to avoid predation and acquire resources required to survive and reproduce. At the lowest level of selection the characteristics of forage selection and how the grass quality in the different vegetation types during different seasons affects the success of sable herds was explored. The broad objectives were (1) to determine the effect of seasonal flooding and rainfall on grass greenness in the floodplains and upland vegetation types and the consequent use of those vegetation types by sable antelope and (2) to determine how exploitation of resources in the floodplains and in the uplands contributed to the nutritional status of sable. I additionally quantified the time spent browsing and determined the composition of the browse component of the diet of sable. Adult female sable from each of three adjacent sable herds were fitted with GPS collars providing hourly GPS co-ordinates. Adaptive LoCoH was used to determine home range location and annual, seasonal and core home range extents. A vegetation map was created and the number of GPS locations within each vegetation type was counted to determine their relative use in relation to availability within the home ranges. GPS collars were used to locate herds daily so that foraging observations of browsing and characteristics of the grasses grazed could be attained. Acceptability and dietary contributions of grass species and browse were determined for each sable herd during different seasons. The availability of grass species on the floodplain grasslands and in the upland grasslands and woodlands was estimated. Water and the availability of key resources posed a constraint on where sable home ranges were established. Sable simply did not occupy the region in the north of the study area further than 7 km from permanent water and floodplain grasslands. Herds generally avoided open savanna, mopane woodlands and Kalahari apple-leaf woodlands characterised by sparse grass cover, particularly during the dry season. Home ranges were relatively small compared 4 to the range estimates from herds in Kruger National Park. There was no obvious seasonal difference in home range extent nor were there large areas of overlap between home ranges of adjacent herds. Observations during the study indicated that competitor species, including zebra and wildebeest, concentrated on the floodplain grasslands. Throughout the year H. dissoluta was the most strongly favoured grass species and contributed most to the diet of the sable herds in both the wet and dry season. During the <b>dry</b> season sable <b>herds</b> expanded their diet to include Aristida stipitata and Aristida meridionalis which are generally considered poor forage value species for cattle but that retained some greenness. Additionally, the contribution of browse, especially the leaves of Croton megalobotrys, Philenoptera nelsii and Combretum mossambicense and the flowers of Kigelia africana, constituted an important bridging resource during the extended dry season. Crude faecal protein levels remained above the suggested maintenance levels throughout the annual cycle. Crude faecal protein levels were elevated prior to calving when sable spent more time foraging on the floodplain grasslands where high value forage species such as Paspalum scrobiculatum, Panicum repens and Urochloa mossambicense and sedges were eaten. Indications are that the constraint posed by the distribution of water within the landscape, rather than resource limitations within occupied home ranges, are the primary limitation to population performance in the Kwedi concession.
