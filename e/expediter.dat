25|$|Once again a {{corporate}} version was offered as the Merlin IVC (the model name {{was chosen to}} align with the contemporaneous short-fuselage Merlin IIIC). A version with strengthened floors and the high gross weight option was offered as a cargo aircraft known as the <b>Expediter.</b> Both the <b>Expediter</b> and the Merlin IVC were designated the SA227-AT. Finally, due to reliability problems with Garrett engines {{in the second half}} of the 1980s, the Metro IIIA was offered with two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-45R turboprops in place of the Garrett units; however none were actually delivered. A special model was the SA227-BC Metro III built for Mexican airline AeroLitoral, which took delivery of 15 of the 18 of this model that were produced.|$|E
25|$|Metro {{production}} {{ended in}} 1998; however {{by this time}} Regional Jets were in vogue and turboprop types were out of favour with airlines, and several airframes remained unsold at the factory. The final aircraft, Metro 23 c/n DC-904B, was not delivered (to air charter company National Jet Aviation Services of Zelienople, Pennsylvania) until 2001. A total of 703 Metro, <b>Expediter,</b> Merlin IV series and C-26 series aircraft were built. In addition, 158 other SA226 and SA227 series aircraft were built as short-fuselage Merlin IIIs, IIIAs and IIIBs.|$|E

This design effort resulted in the SA227 CC (for Commuter Category) and SA227-DC models, initially called the Metro IV then renamed Metro 23, so named as they were designed for certification under FAR Part 23 (Amendment 34) standards. A Metro 23 EF with an external pod under the lower fuselage for greater baggage capacity was also offered {{as well as an}} <b>Expediter</b> 23 and Merlin 23.

500|$|Scholars {{and historians}} hold various {{opinions}} {{as to how}} deep Anne's commitment to the Reformation was, how much she was perhaps only personally ambitious, and how much {{she had to do}} with Henry's defiance of papal power. There is anecdotal evidence, related to biographer George Wyatt by her former lady-in-waiting Anne Gainsford, that Anne brought to Henry's attention a heretical pamphlet, perhaps Tyndale's [...] "The Obedience of a Christian Man" [...] or one by Simon Fish called [...] "Supplication for Beggars," [...] which cried out to monarchs to rein in the evil excesses of the Catholic Church. She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church, and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures. According to Maria Dowling, [...] "Anne tried to educate her waiting-women in scriptural piety” and is believed to have reproved her cousin, Mary Shelton, for “having 'idle poesies' written in her prayer book.” If Cavendish is to be believed, Anne's outrage at Wolsey may have personalised whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France. Further, the most recent edition of Ives's biography admits that Anne may very well have had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth which spurred her on, not just as catalyst but <b>expediter</b> for Henry's Reformation, though the process took a number of years.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} development, {{installation}} {{and evaluation of}} a simulation which sequences shop operations for the next shift. Simulation outputs give each foreman the priority of jobs currently in his section and those jobs which might be coming through his area during the next work period. The foreman can determine in advance what tools, raw materials, etc., are needed and obtain them, thus tending to eliminate queue time for hot jobs. In three months of operation, the simulation has been more successful than initially expected. Coordination and expediting efforts have been reduced, in-process inventory has been reduced along with worker idle time, and schedule performance has improved. An additional important result noted during this time is an enlargement of the foreman's job. He has less need for coordinators and <b>expediters</b> since he has the information needed to make rational decisions on sequencing the work. This effort illustrates the practicality and desirability of incorporating advanced concepts into operating systems if the system's demands on working personnel are made compatible with the objectives and capabilities of the workers. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} aiming {{to explore and}} examine the MRP (MRPI & MRPII) benefit-determinant {{relationships}} using the Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) technique within Egyptian manufacturing firms. To do that, the research is intended to test empirically the key hy-pothesis that the uncertainty, organisational, implementational, technological, and human variables do not correlate with the benefits obtained from MRP implementation in a linear manner. This is done by constructing a series of mathematical models for both MRP benefits measures (tangible and subjective benefits) using ACE technique as an advanced statistical modelling technique. The data analyzed in this paper were collected by a mail questionnaire to Egyptian manufacturing firms. The findings of this paper indicate that data accuracy has {{a positive effect on}} the successful implementation of MRP systems. And also, our findings indicate that as capacity uncertainty in-creases delivery lead time and the number of <b>expediters</b> increase in order to meet due dates.

40|$|In 2008 the European Commission {{presented}} {{a new plan}} for development of “sustainable industrial policy”, which includes biodiversity in the meaning of new markets and opportunities to satisfy demand with particular behavioral characteristics. The economic justification of the business activities {{in the framework of}} biodiversity goes beyond the traditional analysis of market prices and <b>expediters.</b> Traditional approaches are easier to be applied in the manufacturing sector, considering the input and output quantitative indicators and price information. Considering the characteristics of the biodiversity {{and the role of the}} local governments, it is difficult to define and apply appropriate indicators that represent the level of the market prices, the quality of the services provided and the impact achieved. The present paper aims to develop a new approach in achieving two crucial goals: balance between the economic growth and environmental priorities; and development of a system for financial stimuli for those companies, which follow the criteria for sustainable development. Against this background the general relationship between the agriculture and the biodiversity or the concept of agro-biodiversity; and the multifunctionality in agriculture will be analyzed. The paper identifies the new business opportunities offered by the biodiversity and ecosystem services. It corroborates the necessity of a range of public policy measures at national, regional and local level which will enable a viable business initiatives, cooperation, tax incentives and strict performance standards...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{it is argued}} that the {{migration}} of ideas and personnel from Britain to colonial Australia resulted in the reproduction of two distinctive medical archetypes, namely, the soldier/saviour and the generalist (family) physician and surgeon. These have been both conceptualised as ideal type carriers or <b>expediters</b> of two rival forms of medical professionalism. They each emerged in the modern era as institutional products of distinctive educational processes and work practices available for doctors in 19 th and 20 th century Britain and Australia. While Freidson (1988) asserts one of the problems of dealing with studies of professionalism is that researchers have failed to clearly define work patterns, he could be seen as being close to Foucault (1973) whose emphasis was on the different social spaces in which practitioners worked. I show firstly that the career of the imperial army medical officer was revived in the 19 th century so that in colonial contexts they could alternate between military and civilian servicing, especially as administrators and managers in public office. The soldier/saviour was also associated with the 19 th century revival of Masonic and quasi-Masonic military and religious orders, consecrated by royal sovereigns and exported to Australia. In contrast, the Scottish pedagogues and other generalist doctors coming to Australia from Britain were influenced by Edinburgh University's Medical Faculty's humanist traditions and design of the modern medical curriculum producing the generalist physician and surgeon who met community needs. Within wider imperial social relations, these generalist doctors were looked upon as dissenting or counter-hegemonic. The aim of this thesis is to examine these archetypes in terms of their characteristics of rationalisation to analyse and understand their professional differences historically {{as well as in the}} contemporary period. The significance is that one does not often come across studies which specifically look at doctors within the same society in such terms. Furthermore, by locating them within wider hegemonic and counter-hegemonic social relations, links between ideas about medical professionalism and issues of human rights become evident. This follows the World Health Organization's directives to treat health or medical issues and human rights as a cross-cutting research activity. To my knowledge, no study has been undertaken in Australia of the background and impact of these different traditions...|$|R

Although he gave me great responsibility and adequate authority to carry out his mission-type orders, he constantly meddled with my subordinates. However, to compensate for that he had a small staff, which meant that we were not subject to the usual staff-type heckling. He ruthlessly protected the overall project from other government agency interference, which made my task easier. He seldom accepted other agency cooperation and then only on his own terms.
