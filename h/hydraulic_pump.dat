The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|Trulli {{became the}} first driver to make a second pit stop on lap 28. Light rain began to fall on lap 29 and track started to become slippery. The gap between Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher fell by one second after the McLaren driver {{encountered}} lapped traffic on lap 30. Ralf Schumacher lost sixth position to teammate Button after making a mistake on the same lap, while Frentzen pulled off the track at the entry of First Curve to retire from a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> issue which caused his gearbox to fail. Michael Schumacher closed the gap to Häkkinen by 0.7 seconds by lap 31, although he made minor contact with Zonta two laps later. Further down the order, Heidfeld overtook Trulli for 13th position on lap 34. The second round of pit stops began on the same lap when Irvine made a pit stop. Häkkinen made his second stop on lap 37, and {{came out of the}} pit lane 25.8 seconds behind rival Michael Schumacher but ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull away from Häkkinen. Coulthard, Barrichello and Button remained in third, fourth and fifth positions respectively, during their second stops on lap 38 and 39. Wurz went into retirement when he spun sideways near the entry of the pit lane on lap 40. Michael Schumacher took his final pit stop on the same lap, and emerged 4.1 seconds in front of Häkkinen.|$|E

25|$|Thrust was {{provided}} {{by a pair of}} 30kN axial flow Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. These were directly mounted in the midsection of the wings using tubular trusses and links between the main mounts and the adjacent leading edge of the wing. Each engine drove a 6-kW generator for the 28-V onboard electronics, as well as a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> and a bleed air system for cabin pressurization. The wing itself was typically empty, fuel was contained within two internally-support self-sealing fuel tanks and an additional lace-support bag held within the upper fuselage. The manufacturer specified that Coffman engine starters should be used to start the engine. An improvised method of starting the engine using compressed air was heavily discouraged by Rolls-Royce, but some operators successfully operated the Canberra's engines in such a manner, the benefit being significant cost savings over the use of cartridges.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b> A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.|$|E
25|$|At the Australian Grand Prix, {{the cars}} again {{occupied}} {{the back row}} of the grid, with Senna ahead of Chandhok. The F110s were both 6.6 seconds off the polesitter's time, but only 0.34 seconds behind the Virgin of Lucas di Grassi. Senna's car only lasted four laps of the race before retiring with a hydraulic failure, but Chandhok finished 14th and last for the car's first classified finish, albeit five laps adrift of the winner and three laps behind Heikki Kovalainen's 13th-placed Lotus. This was partly due to a damaged floor caused by Chandhok coming off the track twice during the race. In Malaysia, Chandhok achieved the F110's best qualifying position without grid rearrangement in 22nd position. In the race both cars ran efficiently and achieved the F110's first double-finish, with Chandhok and Senna finishing in 15th and 16th positions respectively, ahead of the two delayed Lotus drivers. Chandhok finished three laps down, while Senna was another lap behind the leader. At the Chinese Grand Prix, Chandhok received a five-place grid penalty as the team broke the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) seal on his car's gearbox without {{a representative of the}} governing body being present; he was then further penalised for his mechanics changing a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> assembly with parts of a different specification to the originals, and was made to start from the pit lane. In the race, the F110 achieved another double finish, with Senna leading Chandhok home in 16th and 17th positions respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was {{primarily}} to promote the wider deployment of the <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump,</b> and secondarily to provide the technical input into a programme aimed at using <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump</b> technologies for third world development. Hitherto <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump</b> technologies have been restricted by poor understanding of operational parameters, poor performance prediction, and poor design of pumps and installations. In pursuit of greater understanding the work utilised a computer simulation developed by the author as part of a previous research programme. This simulation was then greatly enhanced to provide improved accuracy and functionality. The enhanced simulation was then used to provide significant insight into the operation of a <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump</b> and subsequently used to identify design improvements for the <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump.</b> The simulation was used to investigate operational restrictions on the hydraulic ram, and was ultimately use to develop a model of <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump</b> operation. The model of operation developed by the use of the simulation was computerised and used to predict the performance of <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump</b> installations. This computerised model was then used to provide the most comprehensive design charts yet created for <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump,</b> and was also used in the investigation of operational limits for the device. The study represents: the development of the first detailed simulation of the <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump</b> and the most significant insight to date into the detail of operation of a <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump.</b> The result of the study is the provision of an accurate method of pump calibration, an accurate method of pump performance prediction, and the first comprehensive design charts to be produced for the <b>hydraulic</b> ram <b>pump...</b>|$|R
