I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't {{going to make it}} back.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Zeroes", which Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{called the most}} heartening and successful track on the album, is, according to Bowie, a nostalgia trip: [...] "I wanted to put in every 60s cliche <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of! 'Stopping and preaching and letting love in,' all those things. I hope there's a humorous undertone to it. But the subtext is definitely that the trappings of rock are not what they're made out to be." ...|$|E

500|$|The use of {{live action}} was a {{stepping}} stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make John Carter of Mars his next project. Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make {{the rest of the}} film look even more realistic. Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then {{would not have been able}} to recognize how serious their devolution was. Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because [...] "e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of." [...] The CEO says [...] "stay the course", which Stanton used because he thought it was funny. Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots.|$|E
500|$|... "Now {{that that}} show is just humming and doing amazing {{business}} — it’s the #1 bestselling magic {{show in the}} world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times — I felt it was in a great place and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about television again. Obviously, “Believe” will continue to evolve until its last performance because I always want to add new magic, I’m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it." [...] Endemol purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the [...] "most-watched new original series [...] in more than 18 months" [...] according to The Hollywood Reporter.|$|E
500|$|Jackman also {{watched a}} woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken {{to see the}} woman have similar blond hair to his wife: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was my wife on that table. As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, I knew in that moment that I was so not ready for death." [...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders." [...] As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor.|$|E

500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E
500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christy Mathewson {{later said}} of {{the moment when he}} took the mound at Fenway Park, [...] "This was {{the only place in the}} world that I wanted to be.

2500|$|Goody {{initially}} {{denied that}} her comments were racist: [...] "She is Indian, thinking of an Indian name and only thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was Indian food. Wasn't racial at all. It {{was not to}} offend any Indian out there." [...] On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty {{could be seen as}} racist. In a video on the BBC News website, Goody said: ...|$|E
2500|$|The bell {{located in}} front of the camper dining hall is used by the Rangers before lunch and dinner.

Reflecting on his childhood in The Bronx, DeLillo later described how he was [...] "...always out in the street. As a little boy I whiled away most of my time pretending to be a baseball announcer on the radio. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> up games for hours at a time. There were eleven of us in a small house, but the close quarters were never a problem. I didn't know things any other way. We always spoke English and Italian all mixed up together. My grandmother, who lived in America for fifty years, never learned English." ...|$|E

2500|$|Describing his {{gameplay}} {{strategy in}} 1930, he said, [...] "My system was all offense. I believed in {{putting up a}} mental hazard for the other fellow. If we were five or six runs ahead, I'd try some wild play, such as going from first to home on a single. This helped to make the other side hurry the play in a close game later on. I worked out all the angles <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, to keep them guessing and hurrying." [...] In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase, but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies, {{he was able to}} surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.|$|E
2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun.... I was doing everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to protect my husband and keep him alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Mark Walport, the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser {{and head}} of the Government Office for Science, had this to say: [...] "My view scientifically is {{absolutely}} clear: homoeopathy is nonsense, it is non-science. My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect – it is then a political decision whether they spend money on it or not." [...] His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being [...] "fundamentally ignored" [...] by the Government, said: [...] "The only one [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points {{to the fact that it}} is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying this is wrong, but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS." ...|$|E

But now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not even <b>think</b> of him so; I had not even that consolation; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of him as lying anywhere; his body had fallen {{into the hands of the}} rebels, to be hacked and mutilated, before they left it to the jackals and wild dogs. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> of him at all, it was too horrible--Oh, Percy, Percy! ...|$|R
2500|$|Green Day: Rock Band was {{generally}} well received by video game critics. Many critics noted the game follows the previous dedication to presentation, audio, and playability that {{were seen in}} The Beatles: Rock Band, though some believed it followed the formula too well to make it indistinguishable from the previous titles. Jack DeVries of IGN {{could not think of}} any easy way to identify the game from other Rock Band titles; [...] "People kept asking me how the game was and all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> to say was 'It's Green Day: Rock Band.'" [...] Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica called the game [...] "paint by numbers rocking", commenting that the feature set is essentially the same as The Beatles. Patrick Klepek of G4TV stated the game was [...] "not as ambitious as The Beatles" [...] but still came to help him appreciate the band more.|$|E
2500|$|Reading about Grandin renewed Gerson Saines' [...] "energy, {{motivation}} and spirit" [...] {{in coping with}} her son's condition.

[...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was, 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here.

2500|$|On January 22, 2016, Anselmo {{ended the}} [...] "Dimebash" [...] Dimebag Darrell tribute show by giving a Nazi salute and {{screaming}} the words [...] "white power" [...] to the crowd. The incident {{was captured by}} an audience member's cell phone camera and the video was posted on YouTube. Anselmo later claimed he was joking about drinking [...] "white wine". Anselmo commented on the YouTube video, writing: In an interview with Eddie Trunk on Sirius XM on December 15, 2016, Anselmo claimed he was being taunted throughout the show by [...] "two or three little hecklers" [...] who were standing near the stage. He stated that the hecklers called him all sorts of names throughout the show, {{and by the end}} he said he'd lost his patience. On the show Anselmo said, [...] "When people start screaming 'racist' {{over and over and over}} and over again at me, what I did was show them exactly what [...] the ugliest possible thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of at the time was." ...|$|E
