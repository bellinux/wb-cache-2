5000|$|Since {{it is made}} of metal, wire {{has this}} same {{hardness}} property. Most modern manufacturers of jewelry wire make the wire with a defined hardness, generally a hardness of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Historically, these numbers {{were associated with the}} number of times that the wire was pulled through a draw plate, becoming harder or stiffer each time it was drawn through the drawplate. A hardness of 0 meant that the wire had been drawn through only once and was as soft and as pliable as possible. A hardness of 4 meant that the wire had been drawn through five or more times and the wire was as stiff and as hard as possible. Most jewelry wire that is sold now is designated <b>dead</b> <b>soft,</b> half-hard, or hard, where <b>dead</b> <b>soft</b> is wire that is manufactured with a hardness of 0, half-hard is wire manufactured with a hardness of 2, and fully hardened wire is wire with a hardness of 4.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{determine}} the load and deflection at failure of different lingual retainers bonded with composite to enamel in a standardized three-point bending test. The results were rationalized with finite element analysis (FEA) models. Materials and methods: Four types of multistranded wires, <b>Dead</b> <b>Soft</b> Respond, Twisted ligature, Penta-One, Gold-plated Penta-One, and two glass fibre-reinforced composite retainers, Fibre 07 and Fibre 09, were bonded to enamel with composite and submitted to a three-point bending test. The load and deflection at failure and the mode of debonding were recorded. The stiffness of the wires was determined and all experimental data were used in FEA models to rationalize the observed values and mode of debonding. Results: Significant higher load and deflection were found for the most flexible retainers Twisted ligature and <b>Dead</b> <b>Soft</b> Respond. All retainers failed between the wire and composite, which was confirmed by FEA showing the highest stress in the composite around the retainer. The FEA models showed that the amount of composite used for bonding the retainers should be 2 - 4 mm. Conclusions: Based on the in vitro results, optimal bonding of lingual retainers can be achieved by flexible retainers, bonded with intrinsically strong composites. According to the FEA models the retainer should be bonded with 2 - 4 mm composite, leaving the critical ‘free-wire’ length for the success of the retainer system...|$|R

60|$|The Seventh {{and last}} {{therefore}} that I shall prove, is, That the gradual {{heating and cooling}} of these so extended bodies does reduce {{the parts of the}} Glass to a looser and <b>softer</b> <b>temper.</b> And this I found by heating them, and keeping them for a prety while very red hot in a fire; for thereby I found them to grow a little lighter, and the small Stems to be very easily broken and snapt any where, without at all making the drop fly; whereas before they were so exceeding hard, that they could not be broken without much difficulty; and upon their breaking the whole drop would fly in pieces with very great violence. The Reason of which last seems to be, that the leisurely heating and cooling of the parts does not only wast some part of the Glass it self, but ranges all the parts into a better order, and gives each Particle an opportunity of relaxing its self, and consequently neither will the parts hold so strongly together as before, nor be so difficult to be broken: The parts now more easily yielding, nor will the other parts fly in pieces, because the parts have no bended Springs. The relaxation also in the temper of hardned Steel, and hammered Metals, by nealing them in the fire, seems to proceed from much the same cause. For both by quenching suddenly such Metals as have vitrifed parts interspers'd, as Steel has, and by hammering of other kinds that do not so much abound with them, as Silver Brass, &c. the parts are put into and detained in a bended posture, which by the agitation of Heat are shaken, and loosened, and suffered to unbend themselves.|$|R
6000|$|During {{these two}} or three months a {{considerable}} intimacy sprang up between Mr. Poppins and George Robinson. It was not that there was any similarity in their characters, for in most respects they were essentially unlike each other. But, perhaps, this very difference led to their friendship. How often may it be observed in the fields that a high-bred, quick-paced horse will choose some lowly donkey for his close companionship, although other horses of equal birth and speed be in the same pasture! Poppins was a young man of an easy nature and <b>soft</b> <b>temper,</b> who was content to let things pass by him unquestioned, so long as they passed quietly. Live and let live, were words that were often on his lips;--by which he intended to signify that he would overlook the peccadilloes of other people, as long as other people overlooked his own. When the lady who became afterwards Mrs. Poppins had once called him a rascal, he had not with loud voice asserted the injustice of the appellation, but had satisfied himself with explaining to her that, even were it so, he was still fit for her society. He possessed a practical philosophy of his own, by which he was able to steer his course in life. He was not, perhaps, prepared to give much to others, but neither did he expect that much should be given to him. There was no ardent generosity in his temperament; but then, also, there was no malice or grasping avarice. If in one respect he differed much from our Mr. Robinson, so also in another respect did he differ equally from our Mr. Jones. He was at this time a counting-house clerk in a large wharfinger's establishment, and had married on a salary of eighty pounds a year.

40|$|Abstract Experimental Osteonecrosis The authors' {{experience}} with experimentally produced femoral capital osteonecrosis in rats is reviewed: incising the periosteum {{at the base}} of the neck of the femur and cutting the ligamentum teres leads to coagulation necrosis of the epiphysis. The necrotic debris is substituted by fibrous tissue concomitantly with resorption of the <b>dead</b> <b>soft</b> and hard tissues by macrophages and osteoclasts, respectively. Progressively, the formerly necrotic epiphysis is repopulated by hematopoietic-fatty tissue, and replaced by architecturally abnormal and biomechanically weak bone. The femoral heads lose their smooth-surfaced hemispherical shape in the wake of the load transfer through the hip joint such that, together with regressive changes of the joint cartilage and inflammatory-hyperplastic changes of the articular membrane, an osteoarthritis-like disorder ensues. Therapeutic Choices Diverse therapeutic options are studied to satisfy the different opinions concerning the significance of diverse etiological and pathogenic mechanisms: 1. Exposure to hyperbaric oxygen. 2. Exposure to hyperbaric oxygen and non-weight bearing on the operated hip. 3. Medication with enoxaparin. 4. Reduction of intraosseous hypertension, putting to use a procedure aimed at core decompression, namely drilling a channel through the femoral head. 5. Medication with vascular endothelial growth factor with a view to accelerating revascularization. 6. Medication with zoledronic acid to decrease osteoclastic productivity such that the remodeling of the femoral head is slowed. Glucocorticoid-related osteonecrosis appears to be apoptosis-related, thus differing from the vessel-deprivation-induced tissue coagulation found in idiopathic osteonecrosis. The quantities of TNF-α, RANK-ligand and osteoprotegerin are raised in glucocorticoid-treated osteoblasts so that the differentiation of osteoclasts is blocked. Moreover, the osteoblasts and osteocytes of the femoral cortex mostly undergo apoptosis after a lengthy period of glucocorticoid medication. </p...|$|R
