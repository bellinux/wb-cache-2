40|$|Land <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> {{responses}} to volatile shell-investigation cues from land <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and from marine <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> are {{analogous to the}} responses of marine <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> to shell-investigation cues from marine crabs and from snails. Land <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> attracted to shell cues are in worse-fitting shells {{and are more likely}} to investigate conspecifics' shells than are crabs attracted to feeding cues. Moving land <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> from worse shells to better shells decreases the number of crabs investigating shells, while moving crabs from better shells to worse shells increases the number of crabs investigating shells. Gravid females have better-fitting shells than nongravid females or males. Crabs from two different populations in Panama have different shell fits and show different levels of {{responses to}} shell-investigation cues. Land <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> respond to volatile shell-investigation cues from both land and marine <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> but marine <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> do not respond to cues from land <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> A cue detection system for volatile cues most likely evolved in land <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> during their transition from a marine to a terrestrial existence. Thus, the cues found in land <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and marine <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> may be chemically similar. Volatile compounds collected from <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> onto Tenax columns can be eluted with ethanol and act as shell-investigation cues in field assays...|$|R

50|$|Calliactis parasitica {{can survive}} without the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> and the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> can survive without C. parasitica, but they {{associate}} {{with each other}} to their mutual benefit; this is known as mutualism. The <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> gains protection from predators by the sea anemone's stinging, and the sea anemone gains an increase in food from the material thrown up by the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab's</b> movements. The relationship is apparently instigated by the sea anemone, which begins a complex series of manoeuvres in order to mount the shell carried by the hermit crab; the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> remains passive while these manoeuvres take place.|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} in <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> assemblages among habitats {{is likely to}} result from the variety (type), availability and suitability of gastropod shells. This is because occupancy of optimum (size and shape) shells is fundamental {{for the survival of}} <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> (Elwood et al. [1995]). Complex habitats with variety of substrate types are known to support a greater variety of gastropod populations (Mantelatto and Garcia [2002]). Such habitats are likely to offer greater assortment of shells to <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> In this study, the influence of habitat heterogeneity on the shell use of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> is apparent such that the shells that were used by the <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> were more diverse at Sepangar shore (30 shell species) than Sulaman shore (two shell species). Therefore, the more diverse shells available at Sepangar shore support greater diversity of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> whereas the low diversity of available shells at Sulaman shore limits the diversity of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clibanarius digueti is {{a species}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> that lives off the western coast of Mexico, and is {{abundant}} in the Gulf of California. It is known under various common names such as the Mexican <b>hermit</b> <b>crab,</b> the blue-eyed spotted hermit or the Gulf of California <b>hermit</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clibanarius is a genus of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> in {{the family}} Diogenidae. Like other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> their abdomen is soft-shelled and {{sheltered}} in a gastropod shell. Typically marine like all their relatives, the genus includes C. fonticola, the only known <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> species that spends all its life in freshwater.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> grow, {{they must}} {{exchange}} their shell {{for a larger}} one. Since intact gastropod shells are not an unlimited resource, there is frequently strong competition for the available shells, with <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> fighting over shells. The availability of empty shells depends on the abundance of the gastropods and <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> but most importantly on the frequency of organisms that prey on gastropods but leave the shells intact. A <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> with a shell which is too tight cannot grow as fast as <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> with well-fitting shells, and {{is more likely to}} be eaten. Although <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> need to change shells regularly, they will not abandon their old shell unless they have a larger and newer one to change into and unless they feel safe.|$|R
50|$|The diet of the flat-clawed <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> {{comprises}} organic matter, algae, {{and sometimes}} other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> Fish {{are the most}} important predators of this species.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{describe}} the gastropod shell species utilized by <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> (Decapoda: Anomura) collected during investigations of the decapod fauna of the Levantine Sea coast of Turkey. Specimens were collected from July 2005 to October 2005. A total of 715 individuals belonging to 9 <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> species occupying 47 gastropod shell species were collected. The <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> Diogenes pugilator (Roux, 1829) and Cestopagurus timidus (Roux, 1830) had the highest inhabitation frequency (IF), inhabiting 23. 92 % and 23. 78 % of all the samples collected respectively. The nine <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> species captured utilizing shells fromforty-seven gastropods species. Cerithium scabridum Philippi, 1849 (100 %) was the most commonly utilized shell by all <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> pylochelid <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> are not {{markedly}} asymmetrical, with {{a straight}} body and equal numbers of appendages on both sides. This characteristic, together with the partial calcification of the abdomen (which is soft in other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs)</b> led Edward J. Miers, when describing the first species, to consider it to represent a transition between <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and [...] "Macrura" [...] (long-tailed decapods, such as lobsters and shrimp). Correspondingly, pylochelid <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> do not usually inhabit gastropod shells, but instead withdraw into decayed pieces of wood, stones, tusk shells (especially Dentaliidae), living sponges, pieces of bamboo or mangroves. Their claws are often adapted to form an operculum, which closes off the entrance to their home.|$|R

50|$|Calliactis parasitica is {{a species}} of sea anemone {{associated}} with <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> It lives in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea at depths between the intertidal zone and 60 m. It is up to 10 x 8 cm in size, with up to 700 tentacles, and is very variable in colour. The relationship between C. parasitica and the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> is mutualistic: the sea anemone protects the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> with its stings, and benefits from the food thrown up by the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab's</b> movements.|$|R
50|$|The {{halloween}} <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> is omnivorous and a scavenger, eating nearly {{anything that}} appears in its environment, including small animals. It feeds on live and dead animal material, including filamentous algae and detritus. If a halloween <b>hermit</b> <b>crab's</b> shell is too small, it may attack a snail for a larger shell. The halloween <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> can eat quickly.|$|R
5000|$|The Diogenidae are {{a family}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> {{sometimes}} known as [...] "left-handed hermit crabs" [...] because in contrast to most other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> its left chela (claw) is enlarged instead of the right. It comprises 429 extant species, and a further 46 extinct species, making it the second-largest family of marine <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> after the Paguridae.|$|R
5000|$|The Pylojacquesidae are a {{small family}} of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs,</b> {{comprising}} only two species in two genera. The family was erected in 2001, after two specimens at [...] at the [...] were recognised as being quite distinct from other described <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> The family members differ from other <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> in that their mandibles are chitinous and toothed.|$|R
50|$|P. suberitoides colonizes {{gastropod}} shells, {{especially those}} of the genus Cantharus. These shells are typically empty (dead), but P. suberitoides {{has been known to}} colonize living gastropods as well. The sponge begins as a thin crust and continues to grow around the shell until the shell is engulfed entirely. Often these shells are inhabited by <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs.</b> A <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> using the gastropod shell as shelter continues to live in the shell as it is covered by the sponge. As the shell becomes engulfed, the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> inside relocates to a chamber within the sponge itself. This chamber conforms to fit the spiral-shape of the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab's</b> abdomen and grows with the crab as needed, and the <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> shapes and maintains an opening to continue to move about and function normally. Only certain <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> species use sponge shelters. Pagurus impressus and Paguristes hummi are the most frequently occurring occupants.|$|R

30|$|Canonical {{correspondence}} analysis (CCA) {{was used to}} analyse and visualize the relationships between species of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and their shells according to stations (Ter Braak [1986]) at Sepangar rocky shore but not at Sulaman mangrove because of the low number of <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> and shell species. The species data set comprised of <b>hermit</b> <b>crab</b> species with sex. The site or sample of data set comprised of sampling stations along the transect lines. The proportion of shell species used by <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> were treated as environmental variables (co-variables) which comprised of the five most common shell types used by <b>hermit</b> <b>crabs</b> (Clypeomorus batillariaeformis, Clypeomorus bifasciata, Cerithium zonatum, Rhinoclavis sinensis and Tenguella musiva).
