25|$|Blood {{groups are}} {{inherited}} from both parents. The ABO blood type {{is controlled by}} a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The I designation stands for <b>isoagglutinogen,</b> another term for antigen. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. The gene {{is located on the}} long arm of the ninth chromosome (9q34).|$|E

The isoagglutinogens of the anthropoids were found to be identical with those of human blood. These very same factors could not be demonstrated in the blood of the lower monkeys. In the blood of the fourteen chimpanzees examined only the <b>isoagglutinogen</b> A has been found, whereas both A and B were present in the blood of the six orangs. The significance of these findings for the knowledge of the human blood groups is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Serological {{studies on}} the bloods of thirty-six species of lower monkeys have shown that there exists a {{correspondence}} between the distribution of a certain hemagglutinogen and {{the place of the}} species in the zoological system. In twelve species of seven genera of Platyrrhina (New World monkeys) and six species of the genus Lemur a factor similar to the human <b>isoagglutinogen</b> B was present; in eighteen species of four genera of Cercopithecidæ (Old World monkeys) it was absent, although the latter are more closely related to man than the former. It would seem from our findings that a genus, perhaps even a family, of animals may be characterized by a special serological factor. The factor found in the lower monkeys is not identical with the one existing in the erythrocytes of the anthropoid apes and man...|$|E
