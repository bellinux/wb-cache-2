40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{bandwidth}} aware cross-layer modification to the DSR routing protocol. We include the Access Efficiency Factor (AEF) parameter {{in addition to}} the hop-count in the routing discovery mechanism. AEF is a measure to the local availability of bandwidth at a node. Employing the AEF as a metric in the routing discovery mechanism attempts to avoid routing through a congested area in the network. In this modification, we impose a limit on the hop-count in order to <b>control</b> the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> in the network. The path selection procedure operates by finding a path with the highest minimum AEF value. We have utilized the OPNET modeler simulator to investigate the performance of the modified DSR protocol on a series of randomly generated network topologies of different hopcount limits. The simulator was run twice for each network topology. The first run implemented the standard DSR algorithm while the second implemented the modified DSR protocol.

The {{geometry of the}} cantilever was precisely measured using FESEM (S- 4700, Hitachi, Troy, MI, USA), with a length of 125  μm, width of 25  μm, and thickness of 2.1  μm. To accurately measure the tip radius, the tip was scanned on the standard AFM tip characterizer (SOCS/W 2, Bruker) and the scanned data was curve fitted using PSI-Plot (Poly Software International, Orangetown, NY, USA). The tip radius calculated to be 12  nm. For a typical indentation test, the tip was pressed onto the top surface of the sample until a predefined force of ~ 100 nN. The cantilever end remained unchanged in position during the <b>controlled</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time.</b> A series of indentations of the same predefined indentation force and different <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were performed to track the viscoelastic responses. A 10 -min time interval of the two consecutive indentations was set for the sample to fully recover prior to the next indentation. The sample drift was minimized by turning off the light bulb in the AFM controller during scanning to keep the AFM chamber temperature constant and by shrinking the scan area gradually down to 1  nm[*]×[*] 1  nm on the top surface of the sample to rid the scanner piezo of the hysteresis effect.|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effects of <b>control</b> input <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> on {{closed-loop}} transonic computational aeroelastic analysis. <b>Control</b> input <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> are becoming critical as the demand for high frequency control actions is increasing. The flow in transonic conditions exhibits strong nonlinearities which require accurate physical modeling techniques, in turn resulting in large dimensional systems that are computationally costly to solve. A unified framework is demonstrated for the robust and efficient generation of reduced order models. Once generated, the reduced order model is employed for the flutter boundary search, and excellent agreement with the large order coupled model is demonstrated. The aero-servo-elastic reduced order model is then exploited to design a feedback control law, which is implemented in the fully coupled computational fluid/structural dynamics solver. As expected, the controller effectiveness is found to degrade for increasing <b>time</b> <b>delay,</b> up to a critical value where the controller fails to suppress flutter. It is shown that a controller for a time-delay system may be designed using the same aero-servo-elastic reduced order model, incurring in no extra costs or complications. The new controller is found to achieve excellent flutter suppression characteristics. The aero-servo-elastic reduced order model may {{also be used to}} identify, for a given feedback controller, the critical value of <b>control</b> input <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> at which the closed-loop aero-servo-elastic system loses its stability.

40|$|The {{effect of}} cool flame partial {{oxidation}} on the detonation sensitivity of a hydrocarbon fuel was investigated experimentally. The detonation sensitivity was quantified {{by measuring the}} run-up distance required for a deflagration to transit to a detonation wave (DDT) in a rough tube. Fuel rich pentane-oxygen mixtures at subatmospheric initial pressures were studied. Subsequent to the injection of the mixture into the heated detonation tube, the mixture underwent cool flame oxidation after a well <b>controlled</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> as it {{was determined by the}} temperature of the tube. Typical delays ranged from 0. 7 to 2 seconds (depending on temperature) and were reproducible to within one hundred milliseconds. This permitted to spark-ignite the mixture in the detonation tube at various stages of its cool flame process. The results show that increasing mixture temperature from room temperature to values below the cool flame region (below 250 °C) resulted in an increase in run-up distance. However, as the mixture begins to undergo cool flame oxidization a significant reduction in the run-up distance was obtained (as large as 50 %). The sensitization effect was found to occur only at the initial stage of the cool flame oxidation reaction. If the mixture is ignited at times long after the onset of cool flame, the mixture was found to be desensitized and the run-up distance increased. The sensitizing effect of the cool flame partial oxidation may be attributed to the presence of peroxides and free radicals associated with the initial cool flame process. However these radical species are consumed as the cool flame reaction proceeds and the mixture becomes insensitive again...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{temporary}} broadband seismic array was {{deployed in}} the Las Vegas basin (LVB), {{home to one of}} the fastest growing communities in the United States, to investigate structure in this deep (∼ 5 km) sedimentary basin. To constrain basin velocity structure, we measured the differential travel time of teleseismic P waves by waveform cross correlation relative to a station near the basin’s edge. The range of the travel-time delays is significant (up to 0. 5 sec), and the pattern of travel-time delays is independent of the back azimuth of the incoming energy, suggesting that the near-surface structure <b>controls</b> the <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> Assuming the reported basin geometry of Langenheim et al.

The average times can be modeled with relatively fast P-wave velocities (4 : 5 km=sec) in the deepest part of the basin (below 2 km), which is in agreement with the P-wave velocities of the deep part of the basin from recent seismic refraction profiling (Snelson et al., 2004) and low velocities (1 : 5 km=sec) in the shallow basin (200 m).

40|$|The classic way {{to control}} a process, in a model based framework, is to obtain {{a model of the}} system and then use it for the design of a controller. A {{time-varying}} process can require use of a real-time indirect adaptive controller, and a process with variable <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> may also call for a delay-time predictor. This paper describes a particular structure for such a controller and demonstrates its application to a pulp bleaching process. The variable <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> predictor constitutes the novel contribution of theis work. We discuss aspects of controlling the pulp bleaching process at Irving Paper Ltd., which is an extension on the work done in Sayda and Taylor [1].
