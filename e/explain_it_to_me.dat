American physicist Philip Anderson, also a future Nobel Prize laureate, {{spent a year in}} Cambridge in 1961–1962, and recalled that having Josephson in a class was [...] "a disconcerting experience for a lecturer, I can assure you, because everything had to be right or he would come up and <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> after class." [...] It was during this period, as a PhD student in 1962, that he carried out the research that led to his discovery of the Josephson effect; Cambridge unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building dedicated to the discovery in November 2012. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1962, and obtained his PhD in 1964 for a thesis entitled Non-linear conduction in superconductors.|$|E

60|$|So I ate, {{and that}} night I told him all. Kou-en listened with respectful attention, but the tale, strange as <b>it</b> might seem <b>to</b> most people, excited no {{particular}} wonder in his mind.

When Paulvitch entered my cabin he <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> If I would obtain the information for them he promised to go no farther, otherwise Rokoff, who stood without, was to notify the purser that I was entertaining a man other than my husband behind the locked doors of my cabin.

Lady Merrifield looked in on her, and she hardened herself to endure either another probing or fresh reproaches, but all she heard was, 'My dear, I cannot talk over this sad affair now, as I have to go out. But, if you can, I think you had better write to your father about it, and let him understand exactly how it happened.

60|$|ELLIE. It {{would have}} been, this morning. Now! you can't think how little it matters. But it's quite interesting.

I asked if any advance was needed, and he said no, which is lucky, for I cannot tell how I could have raised it. For the rest, I could ask him no questions. No doubt it is the old story, and, as Arthur's friend, he could not be willing to <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I am only glad it is in such safe hands.

60|$|I {{thanked him}} as well as I could, and talk now about 'my library', as if I had a hundred books.

6000|$|I was {{naturally}} perplexed and {{amazed by}} these changes, and persecuted my aunt {{to tell me}} the reason of them. At first she tried to put me off with excuses; then she admitted that there was trouble in our house; and finally she confessed that the trouble was caused by the illness of my sister. When I inquired what that illness was, my aunt said it was useless to attempt to <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I next applied to the servants. One of them was less cautious than my aunt, and answered my question, but in terms that I could not comprehend. After much explanation, I was made to understand that [...] "something was growing on my sister's neck that would spoil her beauty forever, and perhaps kill her, if it could not be got rid of." [...] How well I remember the shudder of horror that ran through me at the vague idea of this deadly [...] "something"! A fearful, awe-struck curiosity to see what Caroline's illness was with my own eyes troubled my inmost heart, and I begged to be allowed to go home and help to nurse her. The request was, it is almost needless to say, refused.|$|E
6000|$|I {{took her}} to the sofa: we sat side by side. She put her arm round my waist, and laid her head on my shoulder. Again the faint smile flickered like a dying light on her lovely face; wan and wasted, yet still beautiful--still the Virgin's face in Raphael's picture. [...] "We are a strange pair," [...] she said, with a {{momentary}} flash of her old irresistible humour. [...] "You are my bitterest enemy, and you burst out crying over me the moment we meet. I have been shockingly treated by you--and I have got my arm round your waist and my head on your shoulder, and I wouldn't let go of you for the world!" [...] Her face saddened again; her voice suddenly altered its tone. [...] "Tell me," [...] she went on, [...] "how is it that appearances were so terribly against you? Oscar satisfied me, at Ramsgate, that I ought to give you up, that I ought never to see you again. I took his view--there is no denying it, my dear--I agreed with him in detesting you, for a little while. But, when the blindness came back, I could keep it up no longer. Little by little, as the light died out, my heart would turn to you again. When I heard your letter read, when I knew that you were near me--it was just like the old times; I was mad to see you.

40|$|Why do {{patients}} sue? Bad {{outcomes and}} errors in care are obvious factors, {{but some of}} the avail-able evidence implicates deficient communication. One attorney <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> this way: In over 25 years of representing both physicians and patients, it became apparent that a large percentage of patient dissatisfaction was generated by physician atti-tude and denial, rather than the negligence itself. In fact, my experience has been that close to half of malpractice cases could have been avoided through disclosure or apology but instead were relegated to litigation. What the majority of patients really wanted was simply an honest explanation of what happened, and if appropriate, an apology.
