50|$|The first {{engine to}} include an {{expanding}} nozzle {{appears to be the}} Pratt & Whitney XLR-129. The XLR-129 was developed in order to power a McDonnell Aircraft boost-glide aircraft design that was entered as part of the Project ISINGLASS (or RHEINBERRY) study looking at follow-on designs to replace the Lockheed A-12 that was just entering service. It was a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen design that used staged combustion and generated about 250,000 lbf (1.1 MN) thrust. An enlarged version of the XLR-129 was proposed for the Space Shuttle Main Engine contest, but this was won by an enlarged Rocketdyne HG-3 instead. Since these engines are fired from the point of liftoff into <b>extra-atmospheric</b> space flight, any sort of altitude compensation could dramatically improve their overall performance. The expanding nozzle was later abandoned in a cost-cutting phase, and today the SSME suffers a 25% loss of performance at low altitude as a result.|$|E
50|$|Under Strughold, the School of Aviation Medicine {{conducted}} pioneering {{studies on}} issues such as atmospheric control, the physical effects of weightlessness and the disruption of normal time cycles. In 1951 Strughold revolutionized existing notions concerning spaceflight when he co-authored the influential research paper Where Does Space Begin? in which he proposed that space was present in small gradations that grew as altitude levels increased, rather than existing in remote regions of the atmosphere. Between 1952 and 1954 he would oversee the building of the space cabin simulator, a sealed chamber in which human test subjects were placed for extended periods of time in order to view the potential physical and psychological effects of <b>extra-atmospheric</b> flight. Strughold obtained US citizenship in 1956 and was named chief scientist of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Aerospace Medical Division in 1962. While at NASA, Strughold {{played a central role in}} designing the pressure suit and onboard life support systems used by both the Gemini and Apollo astronauts. He also directed the specialized training of the flight surgeons and medical staff of the Apollo program in advance of the planned mission to the Moon. Strughold retired from his position at NASA in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{explanations}} {{have been}} raised. The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations {{said it was}} an on ground explosion, but the Siberian Times, a local newspaper, noted that [...] "the light was not accompanied by any sound". Regarding the meteoroid hypothesis, the Siberian Times also noted that [...] "a local observatory indicated nothing fell from the sky {{on the day of the}} flash". Another hypothesis that was raised is the high-altitude nuclear explosion. A high-altitude nuclear test usually creates a very large fireball, because the absence of air allows for a maximum expansion of the fire. Such a test would not create a strong electro magnetic impulse in a period of intense solar activity (as Autumn 2014 was). The CTBTO has independent means to watch for underwater, underground and atmospheric nuclear tests, but not for <b>extra-atmospheric</b> nuclear tests - for that it relies on information that member States such as the USA would provide. Asked about the event, Mr. Patrick Grenard of the CTBTO only noted that, regarding high altitude nuclear tests, the CTBTO relies on communication of information from Member States. The fireball happened not far from Lesnoy, Sverdlovsk Oblast, a city which houses the Elektrokhimpribor plant known for making nuclear weapons. A conference of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) was held in Yekaterinburg in mid-November 2014 its topic was air/missile defence. Thus the fireball, if it was confirmed to be a nuclear explosion, could be understood as a test of Russian capabilities for ICBM interception. The mystery, however, remains.|$|E

40|$|The salient {{features}} of the spectral composition of UV radiation at the ground are investigated. A study is made {{of the degree of}} influence of the variation of parameters of atmospheric conditions, such as TOC, atmospheric pressure, and aerosol, on the variability of ground-level UV radiation in the region 300 - 350 nm that manifests itself at Irkutsk. Of them, the most significant were determined in separate bands of the selected range at different time scales. Functions of spectral responses of direct midday UVR to variations of atmospheric parameters by 1 % of their mean values for Irkutsk were constructed. These functions can be used to assess the influence of actual changes in atmospheric conditions. It is pointed out that the aerosol and cloud state is the factor that determines the overall level of UVR. The effect of pressure fluctuations on UVR variability is insignificant; however, in conditions of optical stability of the atmosphere, which can persist for several days, the influence of pressure variations on UVR can become of predominant value. TOC and the Sun's altitude are responsible for the spectral composition. For wavelengths longer than 320 nm, {{it was found that the}} spectral structure of the UVR variation coefficient coincides with the system of Huggins bands in the ozone absorption spectrum, and for wavelengths shorter than 320 nm, it coincides with typical spectral patterns of the <b>extra-atmospheric</b> solar UV spectrum.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} first {{simultaneous}} multi-line fitting of a semi-empirical atmospheric {{model with a}} chromosphere and transition region to the H I and Ca II spectra of an RS CVn star (II Peg). The static component of the Hα emission core, the line profile of Hβ, the apparent absence of Hγ and Hδ, and the emission core profiles of Ca II K {{and two of the}} Ca II IR 3 lines are all approximately fitted by a static 1 D model with the following properties: log m {{at the onset of the}} transition region is ≈− 2. 85, and a 6000 K plateau in the upper chromosphere that spans about a decade in log m. In particular, the model is able to reproduce the unusually steep Balmer decrement (compared to the dMe stars), in which Hα is strongly in emission and Hβ is in absorption, without recourse to <b>extra-atmospheric</b> material. The Ca II IR 3 lines are best fit by a model in which Tmin is cooler by 300 K and shallower by over half a decade in log m than that which best fits the optical lines. The emergent flux in the IR 3 line cores arises from the Tmin region, whereas the other diagnostics arise from layers well above Tmin, and it is postulated that this may be the cause of the discrepancy. There has very recently been evidence from other investigators that the metallicity of II Peg may be sub-solar, and we find that models with [A H]=− 0. 4 provide a somewhat better fit to all the lines considered...|$|E
40|$|The 38. 5 m deep Lake Accesa is a {{sinkhole}} {{located in}} southern Tuscany (Italy) {{that shows a}} peculiar water composition, being characterized by relatively high total dissolved solids (TDS) values (2 g L - 1) and a Ca(Mg) -SO 4 geochemical facies. The presence of significant amounts of <b>extra-atmospheric</b> gases (CO 2 and CH 4), which increase their concentrations with depth, is also recognized. These chemical features, mimicking those commonly shown by volcanic lakes fed by hydrothermal-magmatic reservoirs, {{are consistent with those}} of mineral springs emerging in the study area whose chemistry is produced by the interaction of meteoric-derived waters with Mesozoic carbonates and Triassic evaporites. Although the lake has a pronounced thermocline, water chemistry does not show significant changes along the vertical profile. Lake water balance calculations demonstrate that Lake Accesa has > 90 % of its water supply from sublacustrine springs whose subterranean pathways are controlled by the local structural assessment that likely determined the sinking event, the resulting funnel-shape being then filled by the Accesa waters. Such a huge water inflow from the lake bottom (~ 9 · 10 6 m 3 yr - 1) feeds the lake effluent (Bruna River) and promotes the formation of water currents, which are able to prevent the establishment of a vertical density gradient. Consequently, a continuous mixing along the whole vertical water column is established. Changes of the drainage system by the deep-originated waters in the nearby former mining district have strongly affected the outflow rates of the local mineral springs; thus, future intervention associated with the ongoing remediation activities should carefully be evaluated to preserve the peculiar chemical features of Lake Accesa. </p...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{knowledge}} of water vapor absorption {{is crucial for}} accurate climate simulations. An open science question in this context concerns {{the strength of the}} water vapor continuum in the near infrared (NIR) at atmospheric temperatures, which is still to be quantified by measurements. This issue can be addressed with radiative closure experiments using solar absorption spectra. However, the spectra used for water vapor continuum quantification have to be radiometrically calibrated. We present {{for the first time a}} method that yields sufficient calibration accuracy for NIR water vapor continuum quantification in an atmospheric closure experiment. Our method combines the Langley method with spectral radiance measurements of a high-temperature blackbody calibration source (<[*]  2000  K). The calibration scheme is demonstrated in the spectral range 2500 to 7800  cm − 1, but minor modifications to the method enable calibration also throughout the remainder of the NIR spectral range. The resulting uncertainty (2 σ) excluding the contribution due to inaccuracies in the <b>extra-atmospheric</b> solar spectrum (ESS) is below 1  % in window regions and up to 1. 7  % within absorption bands. The overall radiometric accuracy of the calibration depends on the ESS uncertainty, on which at present no firm consensus has been reached in the NIR. However, as is shown in the companion publication Reichert and Sussmann (2016), ESS uncertainty is only of minor importance for the specific aim of this study, i. e., the quantification of the water vapor continuum in a closure experiment. The calibration uncertainty estimate is substantiated by the investigation of calibration self-consistency, which yields compatible results within the estimated errors for 91. 1  % of the 2500 to 7800  cm − 1 range. Additionally, a comparison of a set of calibrated spectra to radiative transfer model calculations yields consistent results within the estimated errors for 97. 7  % of the spectral range...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the use of}} high-lift, low drag vehicles which perform orbital transfers within a planet’s atmosphere to reduce propulsive requirements. For the foreseeable future, spacecraft mission design will include the objective of limiting the mass of fuel required. One means of accomplishing this is using aerodynamics as a supplemental force, with what is termed an aero-assist maneuver. Further, {{the use of a}} lifting body enables a mission designer to explore candidate trajectory types wholly unavailable to non-lifting analogs. Examples include missions to outer planets by way of an aero-gravity assist, aero-assisted plane change, aero-capture, and steady atmospheric periapsis probing missions. Engineering level models are created in order to simulate both atmospheric and <b>extra-atmospheric</b> space flight. Each mission is parameterized using discrete variables which control multiple areas of design. This work combines the areas of hypersonic aerodynamics, re-entry aerothermodynamics, spacecraft orbital mechanics, and vehicle shape optimization. In particular, emphasis is given to the parametric design of vehicles known as “waveriders” which are inversely designed from known shock flowfields. An entirely novel means of generating a class of waveriders known as “starbodies” is presented. A complete analysis is performed of asymmetric starbody forms and compared to a better understood parameterization, “osculating cone” waveriders. This analysis includes characterization of stability behavior, a critical discipline within hypersonic flight. It is shown that asymmetric starbodies have significant stability improvement with only a 10 % reduction in the lift-to-drag ratio. By combining the optimization of both the shape of the vehicle and the trajectory it flies, much is learned about the benefit that can be expected from lifting aero-assist missions. While previous studies have conceptually proven the viability, this work provides thorough quantification of the optimized outcome. In examining an aero-capture of Mars, it was found that with a lifting body, the increased maneuverability can allow completion of multiple mission objectives along with the aero-capture, such as atmospheric profiling or up to 80 degrees of orbital plane change. Completing a combined orbital plane change and aero-capture might save as much as 4. 5 km/s of velocity increment while increasing the feasible entry corridor by an order of magnitude. Analyzing a higher energy mission type, a database of maximum aero-gravity assist performance is developed at Mars, Earth and Venus. Finally, a methodology is presented for designing end-toend interplanetary missions using aero-gravity assists. As a means of demonstrating the method, promising trajectories are propagated which reduce the time of flight of an interstellar probe mission by up to 50 %...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Poster SessionsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe approximation of the actual data using theoretical models in general makes it possible to achieve additional estimates, which do not directly follow from the observations. For example, the correct mathematical modeling of meteor events in the atmosphere is necessary for further estimates of the key parameters, including the <b>extra-atmospheric</b> mass, the ablation coefficient, and the effective enthalpy of evaporation of entering bodies. In turn, this information is needed by some applications, namely, those aimed at studying the problems of asteroid and comet security, to develop measures of planetary defense, and to determine the bodies that can reach Earth's surface. In the present report, an analytical model of the atmospheric entry is calculated using the altitude and rate of the body deceleration in the atmosphere from the data of actual observations. With this purpose the strict mathematical algorithm to find basic dynamic parameters of the theoretical relationship between the height and the velocity of the body that help to fit observations along the luminous part of the trajectories in the best way is suggested. The main difference from previous studies is that the given observations are approximated using the analytical solution of the fundamental differential equations of the hypersonic flight of the body. The proposed general approach helps in understanding the extensive observational data of the deceleration of probes and natural cosmic bodies in the upper layers of the terrestrial atmosphere under conditions when the sizes, mass of a body and also aerodynamic flight regime are in advance unknown. New model presented in the report was applied to well-known real impacts. These are several famous meteorite-producing fireballs and the STARDUST Sample Return Capsule (a hypersonic phase). The estimate of mass of SRC obtained using the data of actual observations is quite close to its real value of 45. 8 kg. On the basis of new mathematical interpretation of observational data in the report also it will be noted that the major part of the luminous segment of the trajectories of large bodies corresponds to continuous medium flow, while the condition of a free molecular flow holds outside this segment. The maximum brightness altitude is smaller than that at which a strong bow shock is formed. At a flow past body in a rate of the continuous medium, the basic contribution to luminescence gives radiation of heat atmospheric gas near the body. So, luminosity of a body at its hypersonic flight in the atmosphere does not defined only by radiation of vapor of a body material, arising owing to evaporation of its surface. Therefore some of applied earlier methods for evaluating fireballs parameters from observational data are not correct. Lomonosov Moscow State Universit...|$|E
