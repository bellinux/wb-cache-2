5|$|The {{energy of}} an emitted photon is {{proportional}} to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. <b>Each</b> <b>element</b> has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.|$|E
40|$|Decentralized {{resource}} allocation {{is a key}} problem for large-scale autonomic (or self-managing) computing systems. Motivated by a data center scenario, we explore efficient techniques for resolving resource conflicts via cooperative negotiation. Rather than computing in advance the functional dependence of <b>each</b> <b>element’s</b> utility upon the amount of resource it receives, which could be prohibitively expensive, <b>each</b> <b>element’s</b> utility is elicited incrementally. Such incremental utility elicitation strategies require the evaluation of only a small set of sampled utility function points, yet they find near-optimal allocations {{with respect to a}} minimax regret criterion. We describe preliminary computational experiments that illustrate the benefit of our approach. ...|$|R

5|$|Two {{important}} {{consequences of}} the group axioms are {{the uniqueness of the}} identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and <b>each</b> <b>element</b> in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of the identity, and the inverse of an element.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} <b>each</b> <b>element</b> of main memory {{can be accessed}} with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, {{that can be achieved}} only by a shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.|$|E
5|$|Due to this {{it often}} suffices to find {{representations}} of the Lie algebra. Lie algebras are much simpler objects than Lie groups to work with. Due {{to the fact that}} the Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional vector space, in the case of the Lorentz Lie algebra the dimension is , one need only find a finite number of representative matrices of the Lie algebra, one for <b>each</b> <b>element</b> of a basis of the Lie algebra as a vector space. The rest follow from extension by linearity, and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E

30|$|However, {{analysis}} of <b>each</b> force <b>element</b> and <b>each</b> impulse <b>element</b> generated by <b>each</b> force while the robot legs push {{the water was}} not conducted. Impulse is the physical quantity that has a direct effect on the jumping height of a jumping object [10]. We aim to analyze <b>each</b> force <b>element</b> and <b>each</b> impulse <b>element</b> when hydrophobic rods have rotational motion with high speed moving into water from the water surface. In addition, we investigate the change of the impulse generated from each force by varying the rod length. In order to analyze the force and impulse acting on the rods in the water, we constrained the rotational motion of the rods in the water in this study.|$|R
5|$|For visual localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its position {{relative to the}} aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of the}} robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected in the image plane of the cameras. The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other detection method used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of <b>each</b> <b>element</b> to be detected and the actual scene experienced.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which <b>each</b> <b>element</b> is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|Python has array {{index and}} array slicing {{expressions}} on lists, denoted as a, a or a. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are {{relative to the}} end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. <b>Each</b> <b>element</b> of a slice is a shallow copy.|$|E
25|$|Nonprobability {{sampling}} methods include convenience sampling, quota sampling and purposive sampling. In addition, nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if {{the characteristics of}} nonresponse are not well understood, since nonresponse effectively modifies <b>each</b> <b>element's</b> probability of being sampled.|$|R
50|$|In a stack, the {{priority}} of <b>each</b> inserted <b>element</b> is monotonically increasing; thus, the last element inserted is always the first retrieved. In a queue, {{the priority}} of <b>each</b> inserted <b>element</b> is monotonically decreasing; thus, the first element inserted is always the first retrieved.|$|R
30|$|The third {{implemented}} distributed RPA {{with local}} network, uses 2 M/K FIFOs for <b>each</b> processor <b>element,</b> plus (K- 2)M/ 2 K memory locations {{as the local}} net memory in <b>each</b> processor <b>elements.</b> Totally <b>each</b> processor <b>elements</b> requires a total of (M/ 2 +M/K) location memory to store the particles. The overall required memory is (M+KM/ 2). In the comparison, the architecture presented in [6] needs M memory locations for <b>each</b> processor <b>elements</b> (M/K inside the processor elements plus (K- 1)M/K memory locations at the CU). Thus, the total memory locations required in [6] design is MK. Thus, our implementation has a resource reduction advantage of M(K - 2)/ 2 {{in addition to a}} speed advantage without compromising the SIRF performance.|$|R
5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. <b>Each</b> <b>element</b> or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
5|$|The shirts worn by {{players of}} Ipswich Town did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design {{featuring}} a gold lion rampant guardant {{on a red}} background on the left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half. In 1972, the crest was redesigned {{as the result of}} a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. <b>Each</b> <b>element</b> of the new design was intended to represent the region.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. <b>Each</b> <b>element</b> is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E

5|$|Iwadare {{was asked}} to create memorable melodies, but found {{creating}} suitable tracks difficult as many of his initial pieces were thrown out. For Kameoka, recording the live orchestral segments proved a time-consuming and difficult business: <b>each</b> <b>element</b> of a track was recorded separately, then mixed into a single track, then each orchestral element needed to be adjusted for speed and tone so they lined up correctly. According to Mitsuda, the live recording of music spanned seven full sessions, estimated by him as being the largest-scale musical production for a video game to that date. He was entirely dedicated to orchestration and recording for four months. Mitsuda was tasked with creating the music for the game's 2010 reveal trailer, which he knew was an important task {{as it would have}} an international audience. He estimated that around 150 people in total worked on the score throughout its creation.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{models of}} atoms were not new, but Bohr's {{treatment}} was. Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin {{on the role}} of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of <b>each</b> <b>element</b> being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for <b>each</b> <b>element</b> of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.|$|E
