5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be <b>expecting</b> <b>it,</b> {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{rent the}} film Paint Your Wagon, <b>expecting</b> <b>it</b> to be a shoot-em-up Western. Homer is dismayed {{to find out}} that it is {{actually}} a musical, and expresses his distaste for such films. Marge is baffled by this, saying that he ironically loves singing. The family starts delivering their dialogue in song form, and Marge decides to prove that Homer loves to sing by showing family videos. Several clips are shown of various songs from past episodes, but Homer is not convinced. At this moment, Snake breaks into their house and holds them hostage. However once he hears them singing, Snake decides that they would not make good hostages and leaves.|$|E

5|$|On 26March {{the brigade}} {{advanced}} further into Germany, with the 1st RUR and the 12th Devons leading. The only opposition was German rearguard actions, and they reached Rhade by that evening and Limbeck the following day. They crossed the Dortmund–Ems Canal at dawn on 2April, unopposed except for artillery fire. Later that day {{there was more}} resistance when they reached Lengerich. By 4April the brigade was moving forward as fast as possible, supported by the 4th (Armoured) Battalion, Grenadier Guards, part of the 6th Guards Tank Brigade. Steinhuder Meer was reached on 10April, then in the following days Ulzen and Lüneburg were captured. By 2May they had reached the River Elbe. <b>Expecting</b> <b>it</b> to be defended in force, the division attacked at once, trying to catch the defenders unaware. The attack was successful and the river was crossed over a pontoon bridge left intact by the retreating Germans. That afternoon the leading troops of the 3rd Parachute Brigade reached Mecklenburg and made contact with the leading men from the Russian Army advancing from the east. Later that day the brigade reached Wismar on the Baltic Sea, and remained there until 7May when news was received of the German surrender.|$|E
25|$|Under the maximizing model, {{managers}} seek {{to maximize}} the firm's long-term value and evaluate performance solely on the firm's share price. The model, like performance paradox, adheres to maximizing on performance measures, but only views one benchmark as legitimate, <b>expecting</b> <b>it</b> never to change. Economists in particular hold to this model, arguing that it holds best in the long run. Thus, to enhance firm performance, executive managers' compensation must be directly tied to stock price performance – as accomplished with year-end bonuses and stock options.|$|E
25|$|Persona Q {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. It won Slant Magazine Game of the Year award, and Samantha Nelson of The A.V. Club listed {{it as one}} of her favorite games of 2014. Prior to the Japanese launch, Atlus noted that they expected shortages of units in stores. The game topped Japanese game charts following its release, selling 186,856 units. By August 2014, the game had sold 255,597 units, becoming the fortieth best-selling game in that period. Upon its release in North America, the game sold 40,000 units, which was noted as a high sales figure given its release late in the month alongside other notable games. NIS America had high hopes for the game, <b>expecting</b> <b>it</b> to boost sales for their new online store.|$|E

25|$|Harkimo further {{converted}} the club from semi-professionalism towards his ideal of professional sports entertainment, which was unmistakably adopted from NHL. His efforts yielded Jokerit {{their own home}} venue Hartwall Arena in 1997 – first such privately owned in Europe. Ownership was reformed into Jokerit HC Oyj, a public limited company. They focused on the new European Hockey League <b>expecting</b> <b>it</b> to evolve into a competition more money-making than SM-Liiga, and sought various other ways to expand. Most of these plans did not meet with success, but the new venue {{turned out to be}} a gold-mine for the club's business. Meanwhile, Harry Harkimo tried to create an elite team to the British Ice Hockey Superleague, the Newcastle Jesters but the team was not as successful as hoped, so he sold the franchise back to the League.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between Carol II and the Iron Guard became noted {{during the election}} of December 1937, when the monarch backed the National Liberal Party (PNL) of incumbent Premier Tătărescu, <b>expecting</b> <b>it</b> to carry the vote; in effect, the result was inconclusive, {{with none of the}} parties receiving enough of a percentage to be awarded a majority bonus, and with political rivalries preventing any single coalition. Faced with this outcome, Carol chose to back the antisemitic National Christian Party (PNC) of Octavian Goga and A. C. Cuza, appointing Goga as the new Prime Minister on December 26, 1937—effectively, this led the two main traditional parties, the PNL and the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ), to become marginalized. Instead, the new regime's establishment caused a migration of politicians from the PNȚ, comprising Armand Călinescu, who chose to support the new policies and joined the Goga cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Doughty {{also wrote}} {{that the success of}} the German army could not {{adequately}} be explained without reference to French mistakes. French strategy was unusually vulnerable to an attack through the Ardennes; operationally, French commanders failed adequately to react to the breakthrough of massed panzer forces. Tactically, the Germans were often able to overcome French defences that usually were inadequate. French military intelligence failed to predict the main German attack, <b>expecting</b> <b>it</b> in central Belgium as late as 13 May. Military intelligence had made the elementary mistake of noting information that fitted with their assumptions of German intentions and paid insufficient attention to German capability or information suggesting that they were not conforming to expectations. Doughty {{wrote that the}} French failure was caused by an inadequate military system and {{had much to do with}} the success of the German invasion. The French had prepared to fight a methodical battle based on massed firepower, against an opponent that emphasised surprise and speed. French training for a centralised and slow-moving battle left the army incapable of hasty counter-attacks or bold moves. The French army lost the initiative, were overrun at important points and then deep German penetrations made the disruption of French command arrangements worse.|$|E

25|$|Richard Keith Call, who {{had led the}} Florida volunteers as a Brig. Gen. when Clinch {{marched on}} the Cove of the Withlacoochee in December, had been {{appointed}} Governor of the Territory of Florida on March 16, 1836. Governor Call proposed a summer campaign using militias and volunteers instead of regular Army troops. The War Department agreed to this proposal, but delays in preparations meant the campaign did not start {{until the end of}} September. Call also intended to attack the Cove of the Withlacoochee. He sent most of his supplies down the west coast of the peninsula and up the Withlacoochee to set up a supply base. With the main body of his men he marched to the now abandoned Fort Drane, and then on to the Withlacoochee, which they reached on October 13. The Withlacoochee was flooding and could not be forded. The army could not make rafts for a crossing because they had not brought any axes with them. In addition, Seminoles {{on the other side of}} the river were shooting at any soldier who showed himself along the river. Call then turned west along the north bank of the river to reach the supply depot. However, the steamer bringing the supplies had sunk in the lower part of the river, and the supply depot was far downstream from where Call was <b>expecting</b> <b>it.</b> Out of food, Call led his men back to Fort Drane, another failed expedition against the Cove.|$|E

[...] Oliver Robertson when writing for Rock Sound magazine gave the album a 7 out of 10 and started his review by praising the band saying [...] "deviating little from the blueprint while making some of the finest mathcore albums of the past few years".

500|$|Although Beck {{had been}} {{impressed}} with the Chess studio's history and sound, he {{had been unable to}} complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction. [...] "I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through. So we did two or three takes of my guitars and blended them all together.
