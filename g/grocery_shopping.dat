25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to <b>grocery</b> <b>shopping</b> and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E

He then returned to the kitchen and, when Maude told him not to shoot any birds, fatally shot her in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts allege that Maude Kemper additionally suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from <b>grocery</b> <b>shopping,</b> Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway.

500|$|Some restaveks do receive proper {{nutrition}} and education, {{but they are}} in the minority. [...] Restaveks' labor includes hauling water and wood, <b>grocery</b> <b>shopping,</b> laundry, house cleaning, and childcare. [...] Restaveks work long hours (commonly 10 to 14 a day) under harsh conditions, are frequently denied schooling, and are at severe risk of mal{{nutrition and}} verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. [...] Beatings are a daily occurrence for most restaveks, and most of the girls are sexually abused, [...] which puts them at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Those who are thrown out or run away from their host homes become street children, vulnerable to exploitation including forced prostitution. [...] Those who return to their families may be unwelcome as an added economic burden or shamed and stigmatized for having been a restavek. [...] The trauma of abuse and the deprivation of free time and normal childhood experiences can stunt a child's development and have long-lasting effects.|$|E

40|$|Location is {{of vital}} {{importance}} to a shop. Since 1990, {{there has been}} a significant change in the makeup of Helsinki metropolitan area shop market: the number of <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> in the Helsinki metropolitan area remarkably decreased, while the number of hypermarkets steadily increased. In order to understand and explain the phenomena, both <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> and hypermarkets in the Helsinki metropolitan area which existed from 1990 to 2005 were mapped and analyzed. The study aimed to figure out patterns. The aim of the study was firstly to find out location relationships between <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> and hypermarkets and analyze patterns among <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> and, secondly, to evaluate different visualization methods basing on their usefulness in the analysis. To achieve the research objectives, different visual methods and analysis methods were applied to the case study dataset. The visual methods employed include single static maps, a time series of static maps, 3 D visualization and animated maps. The analysis methods employed in this study included kernel density analysis, normalization, spatial join and Thiessen polygon analysis. The dataset used in the case study records locations and existences of both hypermarkets and <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> in the Helsinki metropolitan area from 1990 to 2005, but was simulated from the real shops dataset. Because of copyright and commercial protection, the real shop dataset was not allowed to be used in this thesis. However, this study documents the analysis processes and methods which could be used in and provide guidelines for the real dataset and also further research. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} in the Helsinki metropolitan area, the locations of <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> have been influenced by the locations of hypermarkets, the density of <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> and the density of population. But the development of <b>grocery</b> <b>shops</b> is a complex system more influencing factors need to be considered in the future studies. In terms of the visualization methods, in this specific case study, single static maps and time series of static maps were the most useful visual methods and normalization was an important part of the analysis method. Compared to the static visual method, 3 D visualization and animated maps were more attractive and allowed more interaction with users but are not recommended for further analysis because they are not as effective as static visual methods for analyzing patterns and relationships of the sparely spread point dataset, like the locations of <b>grocery</b> <b>shops...</b>|$|R
