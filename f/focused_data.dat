Thus, in our personalized recommender system based on collaborative filtering, we employ a user tracking system and a user modeling technique to capture and store users ’ implicit ratings. Also, we describe the effects (on community finding) of using four different types of implicit rating data. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} focusing algorithm for {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) data acquired in short bursts by a geometry with a large range spread, i. e., the case of ground-based (GB) SAR. The usual approach for focusing GB SAR data is the polar formatting algorithm, whose computational complexity, however, is quite relevant due to the nonseparability of the kernel. In this letter, we introduce a different format for the <b>focused</b> <b>data,</b> namely, the range-angular domain. Such format keeps {{the benefit of the}} polar format that samples data close to the resolution, but allows for the design of a separable kernel in the wavenumber domain. The proposed kernel exploits a modified Stolt interpolation and an efficient space-varying resampling. Results of processing on both simulated and real data are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Current {{production}} of geospatial site models is a labor intensive process. Consequently, automated/semi-automated solutions are sought {{to improve the}} production timeline. Automated image to model registration algorithms enable the identification of regions for <b>focused</b> <b>data</b> revision and the association of information for model refinement. Image to model registration is a sensor collection parameter estimation problem to optimize the spatial correspondence of information between the image and the model. This paper describes an automated algorithm based on the association of edge features to extract tie-points for sensor parameter estimation. These features are generated from the model through a predicted image of the site using the sensor model and available collection geometry. A key feature of this algorithm is the explicit incorporation of uncertainty in the registration process. Sample results using IKONOS satellite imagery are provided...|$|E
