5|$|In the 1990s, NSC {{operated}} Tromsø Satellite Station (TSS), {{which was}} used as a ground station for a limited number of satellites. After Rolf Skår was appointed director of NSC, plans were launched to try to win the ground station contract for NASA's planned <b>Earth</b> <b>Observing</b> <b>System</b> (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen.|$|E

NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite. Since 2011, NASA has been criticized for low cost efficiency, achieving little results in return for high development costs.|$|E

Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into Kongsberg Satellite Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg Satellite Services is a continuation of the operating company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll Satellite Station in 2007.|$|E

500|$|Troll was {{established}} as a research station by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1990. The station took {{its name from the}} surrounding jagged mountains, which resemble trolls of Norse mythology. Already at this time, there were proposals by the Norwegian Space Centre to establish an earth station at Troll, but the lack of all-year activity stranded the plans. Instead, SvalSat {{was established}} to serve as an earth station for NASA's <b>Earth</b> <b>Observing</b> <b>System</b> (EOS). Longyearbyen was selected because of its high latitude, which allows all satellites with an orbit above [...] to use only a single ground station—yet download from every orbit. The Svalbard facility opened on 15 April 1999 and was originally owned by the Norwegian Space Centre. Kongsberg Satellite Services was established in 2002 to jointly operate SvalSat and Tromsø Satellite Station (TSS).|$|E

40|$|The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) {{is driving}} a {{paradigm}} shift in the Earth Observation community, refocusing <b>Earth</b> <b>observing</b> <b>systems</b> on GEO Societal Benefit Areas (SBA). Over the short history of space-based <b>Earth</b> <b>observing</b> <b>systems</b> most decisions have been made based on improving our scientific understanding of the Earth with the implicit assumption that this would serve society well in the long run.
