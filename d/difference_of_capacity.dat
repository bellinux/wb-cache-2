60|$|Turning to Table 3: {{the first}} four wild rabbits have skulls of the same length, and these differ but little in capacity. The Sandon rabbit (No. 4) is interesting, as, though now wild, it {{is known to be}} descended from a domesticated breed, as is still shown by its {{peculiar}} colouring and longer body; nevertheless the skull has recovered its normal length and full capacity. The next three rabbits are wild, but of small size, and they all have skulls with slightly lessened capacities. The three Porto Santo feral rabbits (Nos. 8 to 10) offer a perplexing case; their bodies are greatly reduced in size, as in a lesser degree are their skulls in length and in actual capacity, in comparison with the skulls of wild English rabbits. But when we compare the capacities of the skull in the three Porto Santo rabbits, we observe a surprising difference, which does not stand in any relation to the slight difference in the length of their skulls, nor, as I believe, to any difference in the size of their bodies; but I neglected weighing separately their bodies. I can hardly suppose that the medullary matter of the brain in these three rabbits, living under similar conditions, can differ as much as is indicated by the proportional <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> in their skulls; nor do I know whether it is possible that one brain may contain considerably more fluid than another.

40|$|The {{production}} smoothing problem with known demands that {{are assumed to}} increase with time is treated. The production and inventory costs are concave. The cost of increasing production from one period to the next is a concave function of the increase; similarly, the cost of decreasing production is a concave function of the decrease. Backlogging is not permitted. In each period, a fixed production capacity that does not vary with time is available. The problem it similar to that discussed by Zangwill, except for the important <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint. Feasible production plans are partitioned into sets {{on the basis of}} production differences from period to period [...] those with production increases in all N periods, those with a decrease only in the final period, etc. A minimum cost plan is an extreme point of one of these sets. We show that an extreme point plan is such that in between periods with zero inventory there is at most one sequence of periods when production is neither zero nor capacity and within these periods, production does not change. An algorithm is proposed for generating extreme point production plans. It is shown that finding the minimum cost production plan is equivalent to finding the shortest route through an acyclic network of extreme point production plans. The approach put forth enables a complete solution to the problem discussed. ...|$|E

Method: This study was used a quasy experimental sampling design. The population was all the mother after childbirth which has urinary incontinence. There were 14 respondents who met to the inclusion criteria. The independent variable was keagle exercise and the dependent variable was descent of urinary incontinence postpartum. Data were taken by structured interview with questionare and observation then analyzed by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and Mann Whitney U Test with significance level of α≤ 0. 05. Result: The result showed that after the application of keagle exercise, 100 % of experimental group was had descent of urinary incontinence with Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test p= 0. 016 for capacity to urine preserve and p= 0. 020 for urine frequency in twenty four hours, then with Mann Whitney U Test p= 0. 026.

40|$|Until early 1960 's, the Japanese {{government}} controlled import {{by means}} of foreign exchange allocation system. Rents generated and allocated by the foreign exchange allocation system provided the government with {{a powerful tool for}} industrial policy, although there also existed a possibility that this system brought about unproductive rent-seeking. In this paper, we examined the functions of the foreign exchange allocation system, focusing on the case of the wool industry. Through analysis of historical documents, we made clear that MITI utilized the foreign exchange allocation system for such policy goals as export promotion, management of investment and production capacity etc [...] Also, using panel data analysis, we could reconfirm and improve the results of Okazaki and Korenaga [1997] that the foreign exchange allocation system actually promoted export and investment. This is because through the foreign exchange allocation system rents were distributed to each firm in an objective performance-based manner. Also, the export-link system had an implication to stimulate efficient use of foreign currency. By regressing foreign exchange allocation to the foreign exchange acquisition rate (FEAR) in the previous term, we found that export-link allocation correlated positively with FEAR. This result implies that the export-link system promoted those firms which used foreign exchange efficiently, through intensively distributing rent to them. On the other hand, the export-link system brought about large firms with great international competitiveness and small and medium-sized firms which was domestic market-oriented. The production capacity-link system played a role to mitigate that <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> utilization rates, which was complementary to the role of export-link system. ...|$|E

The applied resistance was 7. 5 % of body weight, and the duration was 60 seconds. Moreover, aerobic capacity (maximal oxygen uptake [VO 2 max]) was determined by an incremental test, and anaerobic capacity (maximal accumulated oxygen deficit [MAOD]) was determined by a supramaximal constant load test. The oxygen uptake during each test was recorded by a breath-by-breath method. The participants were divided into two group which was high VO 2 max group (High group; n = 11) and low VO 2 max group (Low group; n = 12). In the results, although the VO 2 max was significantly higher in the High group, the MAOD was not significantly different between two groups. The oxygen uptake during WT was significantly higher in the High group, and the accumulated oxygen deficit during WT was significantly higher in the Low group. The aerobic contribution was significantly higher in the High group than in the Low group. In contrast, the anaerobic contribution was significantly higher in the Low group than in the High group.

We investigated the <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> antioxidant <b>capacity</b> in acute stroke and stroke risk patients to elucidate whether the differences are a result of chronic low availability in arteriosclerosis and stroke risk or due to changes during acute infarction. Methods: Antioxidant enzymes were examined in 11 patients within the first hours and days after acute ischemic stroke and compared to risk- and age-matched patients with a history of stroke in the past 12 months (n = 17). Antioxidant profile was determined by measurement of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), SOD, GSHPx and minerals known to be involved in antioxidant enzyme activation like selenium, iron, copper and zinc. Results: In comparison to stroke risk patients, patients with acute ischemic stroke had significant changes of the GSH system during the first hours and days after the event: GSH was significantly elevated in the first hours (p < 0. 01) and GSHPx was elevated 1 day after the acute stroke (p < 0. 05). Selenium, a cofactor of GSHPx, was decreased (p < 0. 01). GSHPx levels were negatively correlated with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores on admission (r = - 0. 84, p < 0. 001) and NIHSS scores after 7 days (r = - 0. 63, p < 0. 05).

Method: From two different universities, total of 225 students (male= 167, female= 58) were participated in this study. In order to fetermine the criterion validity, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used. Construct validity was evaluated by factor analysis after the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Barlett test had been performed. To assess the test-retest reliability the scale was re-applied to 54 participants 6 weeks later. Results: To assess construct validity of DIS, factor analyses were performed using varimax principal components analysis with varimax rotation. The factor analysis resulted in two factors named &# 147;discomfort (in) tolerance&# 148; and &# 147;discomfort avoidance&# 148;.
