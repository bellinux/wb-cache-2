50|$|The {{most useful}} and widely {{employed}} application of magnetism {{is in the}} production of electrical energy. The mechanical power needed to assist in this production is provided by a number of different sources. These sources are called prime movers, and include <b>diesel,</b> <b>petrol</b> and natural gas engines. Coal, oil, natural gas, biomass and nuclear energy are energy sources that are used to heat water to produce super-heated steam. Non-mechanical prime movers include water, steam, wind, wave motion and tidal current. These non-mechanical prime movers engage a turbine that is coupled to a generator. Generators that employ the principle of electro-magnetic induction carry out the final conversion of these energy sources. In order to do this, three necessary conditions must exist before a voltage is created by magnetism: movement, conductors and a magnetic field.|$|E

The refining capacity of Natref to 108,500 barrels per day. Natref is one of the only inland refineries in South Africa. It was designed {{to get the most out}} of crude oil and is equipped with state-of-the-art technology. The refinery uses the bottoms upgrading refining process using medium gravity crude oil and is capable of producing 70% more white product than coastal refineries that have to rely on heavy fuel oil. Some of the products produced from the refinery are <b>diesel,</b> <b>petrol,</b> jet fuel, LPG, illuminating paraffin, bitumen and sulfur. Natref has been certified in terms of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System.|$|E
