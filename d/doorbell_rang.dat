25|$|Stout {{was one of}} many American writers {{closely watched}} by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Hoover {{considered}} him an enemy of the bureau and either a Communist or a tool of Communist-dominated groups. Stout's leadership of the Authors League of America during the McCarthy era was particularly irksome to the FBI. About a third of Stout's FBI file is devoted to his 1965 novel The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Paramount Television filmed Nero Wolfe, an {{adaptation}} of Stout's novel The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang.</b> Thayer David and Tom Mason starred as Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin; Anne Baxter costarred as Mrs. Rachel Bruner. Written and directed by Frank D. Gilroy, the made-for-TV movie was produced as a pilot for a possible upcoming series — but the film had not yet aired {{at the time of}} Thayer David's death in July 1978. Nero Wolfe was finally broadcast December 18, 1979, as an ABC-TV late show.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Vollmer — {{a medical}} doctor who is Wolfe's {{neighbor}} and friend. Wolfe calls upon Vollmer whenever a dead body is discovered, or medical attention is required, at the brownstone. In The Silent Speaker, Vollmer contrives an illness severe enough that Wolfe cannot be questioned or even seen by anyone. Vollmer examines Louis Rony's corpse for Wolfe in The Second Confession and acts as a go-between for Cramer and Archie in The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang.</b> Vollmer's motivation, aside from friendship, is that Wolfe helped him out with a would-be blackmailer years ago.|$|E

50|$|A week later, {{on the eve}} of Garry's {{departure}} on tour in Africa, he is {{once more}} alone in the flat. The <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings</b> and Daphne enters saying she has a ticket to sail with him to Africa. The <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings</b> again, and Daphne retreats to an adjoining room. The new caller is Roland, who announces that he too has a ticket for the voyage to Africa. Garry tries to get him to leave, but as the <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings</b> a third time Roland bolts into the spare room and locks the door. The third caller is Joanna, who has also bought a ticket for the Africa voyage and has written a letter to Henry and Morris telling them everything. Liz arrives and saves the tottering situation, announcing that she too is travelling to Africa.|$|R

2500|$|Lewis Hewitt — well-heeled orchid fancier, {{for whom}} Wolfe did a favor (as told in [...] "Black Orchids"). During a {{prolonged}} absence (In the Best Families), Wolfe sends his orchids to Hewitt for care. Wolfe occasionally asks professional favors of Hewitt (as in The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang),</b> and Hewitt has sent {{at least one}} friend, Millard Bynoe, to ask Wolfe's assistance ("Easter Parade").|$|E
2500|$|Despite Wolfe's rule {{never to}} leave the brownstone on business, the stories find him leaving his home on several occasions. At times, Wolfe and Archie are on a {{personal}} errand when a murder occurs, and legal authorities require that they remain in the vicinity (Too Many Cooks, Some Buried Caesar, [...] "Too Many Detectives" [...] and [...] "Immune to Murder", for example). In other instances, {{the requirements of the}} case force Wolfe from his house (In the Best Families, The Second Confession, The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang,</b> Plot It Yourself, The Silent Speaker, Death of a Dude). [...] Although he occasionally ventures by car into the suburbs of New York City, he is loath to travel, and clutches the safety strap continually on the occasions that Archie drives him somewhere. He does not trust trains to start or to stop. As Archie says of Wolfe in The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang,</b> [...] "he distrusted all machines more complicated than a wheelbarrow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe {{states that}} [...] "all {{music is a}} vestige of barbarism" [...] and denies that music can have any {{intellectual}} content. He takes {{a dim view of}} television; but TV sets did find their way into the brownstone in the later stories. [...] Archie notes in Before Midnight, [...] "It was Sunday evening, when he especially enjoyed turning the television off." [...] Wolfe's attitude toward television notwithstanding, the TV set in Fritz's basement quarters proved handy in The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang,</b> when the volume was turned up to foil potential eavesdroppers.|$|E

5000|$|When Corrado's <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings</b> and Bobby asks who it is, Junior replies, [...] "Judge Crater. How should I know?" [...] Joseph Force Crater was a New York City {{judge who}} {{vanished}} in 1930 while {{out on a}} night on the town.|$|R
2500|$|Terry Teachout, About Last Night, [...] (January 12, 2009) — Rex Stout's witty, {{fast-moving}} prose hasn't dated a day, while Wolfe {{himself is}} one of the enduringly great eccentrics of popular fiction. I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Too Many Women, Murder by the Book, Before Midnight, Plot It Yourself, Too Many Clients, The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang,</b> and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe {{appears to}} know {{his way around the}} kitchen; in Too Many Cooks (chapter 17), he tells Jerome Berin, [...] "I spend quite a little time in the kitchen myself." [...] In The <b>Doorbell</b> <b>Rang,</b> he offers to cook Yorkshire Buck and, in [...] "Immune to Murder", the State Department asks him to prepare trout Montbarry for a visiting dignitary. In The Black Mountain, Wolfe and Goodwin stay briefly in an unoccupied house in Italy on their way to Montenegro; Wolfe prepares a pasta dish using Romano cheese that, from [...] "his memory of local custom," [...] he finds in a hole in the ground. During the short story [...] "Murder Is Corny", he lectures Inspector Cramer on the right and wrong ways to cook corn on the cob, insisting that it must be roasted rather than boiled in order to achieve the best flavor. (The 1940 story [...] "Bitter End" [...] {{suggests}} the contrary view that Wolfe was unable to prepare his own meals; Fritz's illness with the flu causes a household crisis and forces Wolfe to resort to canned liver pâté for his lunch.) ...|$|E

6000|$|The <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang</b> sharply. There was a moment's {{questioning}} pause, {{for it was}} {{too early}} for visitors. The pattering feet of the little maid, Mary, approached the door and next moment a boyish voice demanded: ...|$|E
25|$|The name {{may also}} be used for a {{character}} who never delivers a line, and thus any member of the stage crew might be filling in the role. For example, a person makes a delivery to a character onstage: the <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings,</b> the delivery is made, and the delivery carrier disappears, with no words spoken.|$|R

50|$|The <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings</b> and Shelia enters. She and Jake have {{a strange}} {{conversation}} in which Jake's insanity starts to become clear. Maggie then appears {{and begins to}} mock Jake from behind Shelia's back. Jake grows angry with Maggie, frequently shouting at her, with Shelia (who cannot see Maggie) growing frightened. She eventually {{runs out of the}} house screaming.|$|R
60|$|As I {{spoke the}} word, a {{carriage}} had rumbled along the street, and stopt before the house. The <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang,</b> and steps were immediately afterwards {{heard on the}} staircase. Zenobia had thrown a shawl over her dress.|$|E
60|$|At {{four o'clock}} the <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang,</b> and shortly {{thereafter}} Ellen appeared, simpering and apologetic enough, with a card. She {{had taken the}} trouble to read it this time. Cynthia was angry, or thought she was, and her cheeks were very red.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Merrill {{went about}} her duties that {{morning with a}} heavy heart, and more than once she paused to wipe away a tear that would have fallen on the linen she was sorting. At eleven o'clock the <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang,</b> and Ellen {{appeared}} {{at the entrance to}} the linen closet with a card in her hand. Mrs. Merrill looked at it with a flurry of surprise. It read:-- ...|$|E

2500|$|Hearing Impaired {{subtitles}} (sometimes abbreviated as HI or SDH) {{are intended}} {{for people who are}} hearing impaired, providing information about music, environmental sounds and off-screen speakers (e.g. when a <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings</b> or a gunshot is heard). In other words, they indicate the kinds and the sources of the sounds coming from the movie, and usually put this information inside brackets to demarcate it from actors' dialogs. For example: , , , [...]|$|R
50|$|Once home, Stevens confronts Marie, {{who tries}} to {{convince}} him that the picture means nothing. Stevens leaves to wash his hands, and when he returns, the picture is gone.

Mark explains that he believes his uncle was murdered, and that he, Partington, and Stevens, are going to dig up the body and perform an autopsy.|$|R
60|$|A feeble {{shaft of}} {{sunlight}} stole into the room, flickered and passed away, then suddenly reappeared. Nigel turned {{and opened the}} door, and she passed out, curiously silent and absorbed. He looked after her, perplexed and worried. Suddenly a strangely commonplace, yet--in {{the silence of the}} house and the great hall--an almost dramatic sound startled him. The front <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang</b> sharply. After a moment's hesitation, he hurried to it himself. Karschoff stood upon the steps, still in his evening clothes, his face a little drawn and haggard in the bright light.|$|E

[...] The <b>doorbell</b> <b>rang</b> loudly, and Mr. Prince rose. [...] "Take your own time, and think well before you make your decision."

50|$|The <b>doorbell</b> <b>rings.</b> It's Albert Leach, {{an agent}} of the Treasury Department, wanting to know if Archie has seen or spoken with a young woman named Tammy Baxter or an older woman named Hattie Annis. Archie, not caring for Leach's approach, shoos him. Then he returns to the front room, closely {{examines}} one of the twenties, and announces that there will probably be a reward: the bills are counterfeit.|$|R
