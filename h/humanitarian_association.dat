Humanitarian assistance in the Rif was, however, undermined by diplomatic tensions between the ICRC and the French and Spanish governments.

40|$|Though a {{vast amount}} of {{empirical}} work stresses the beneficial effects of social capital, the recent literature has explicitly recognized the importance of distinguishing different types of social capital. Particularly, a distinction has been made between homogeneous (or bonding) and heterogeneous (or bridging) networks under the argument that the latter are more likely to generate positive externalities than the former. The empirical operationalization of this theoretical distinction has thus far, however, remained underdeveloped. The authors take a step to resolve this issue by assessing the diversity of (voluntary) association membership on a number of socioeconomic traits. The proposed methodology is applied to Flemish survey data on voluntary association membership. This analysis indicates that hobby clubs and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>associations</b> such as the Red Cross are among the most bridging associations, whereas women’s groups and associations for retired people are among the most bonding groups. ...|$|R

40|$|Frontier {{violence}} and past practices of Indigenous child removal are topics that cause {{some of the}} most contentious social and political arguments in contemporary Australia. These issues were also fiercely debated {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries, both within Australia and internationally. During the late eighteenth century, organisations devoted to stamping out slavery wielded increased influence in Britain. After 1833, when slavery was abolished throughout the British colonies, members of these organisations began to focus increasingly on other forms of indigenous abuse that were occurring internationally. By the 1890 s, there was a considerable degree of correspondence between humanitarians and missionaries in Australia and members of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>associations</b> in Britain. In particular, correspondence between members of the anti-slavery society and the Aboriginals Protection Society, which merged together in 1909, and Australian humanitarians provide a fascinating illustration of the way that humanitarians, within and outside of Australia, provided testimony about Indigenous abuse and exploitation. This paper particularly focuses on the correspondence that was exchanged between British and Australian humanitarians about Aboriginal exploitation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. What issues were discussed? What evidence was provided by Australian humanitarians to British organisations? Did this testimony have any effect? How revealing is this correspondence and how should we read it and how should we incorporate this material into our national history...|$|R
