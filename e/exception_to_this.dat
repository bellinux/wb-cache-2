5|$|N. tazetta and its cultivars are an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> rule, {{requiring}} no cold period. Often {{harvested in}} October, bulbs are lifted in May and dried and heated to 30°C for three weeks, then stored at 25°C for 12 weeks and planted. Flowering can be delayed by storing at 5°C–10°C.|$|E
5|$|Pest species adapt {{readily to}} a variety of environments, but prefer warm {{conditions}} found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light. An <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> is the Asian cockroach, which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces and pale colors.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{participants}} in the revived 1990s tournament were the four teams that had just been relegated from Serie A and the four teams that had finished highest but not been promoted in Serie B. The <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was Verona, who were relegated in 1991/92, but did not play in the 1992/93 cup.|$|E

5|$|An <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> rule {{occurs during}} medal {{presentation}} ceremonies at multi-sport {{events such as}} the Olympics and Asian Games. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way from}} Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The only <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, games were {{played on a}} Friday night and a doubleheader on Saturday; in each doubleheader {{one of the two}} games was {{shortened}} to seven innings. The <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was when Perth played their home games; they played on a Thursday night instead of a doubleheader on Saturday. Each postseason series was scheduled for a Friday, Saturday and Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Endpoints {{are grouped}} into {{interfaces}} and each interface {{is associated with}} a single device function. An <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite device. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.|$|E
5|$|In each of {{the cases}} above, the actual score is irrelevant; the {{projectiles}} simply have to hit the target sheet within the circles. Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test shots to familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test. The shotgun is an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> where only one round is allowed as a test shot.|$|E

5|$|Mammals are amniotes, {{and most}} are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> are the {{egg-laying}} monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.|$|E
5|$|Most 17th-century Muscovites {{received}} little education, {{and there were}} low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and {{a small amount of}} history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister Tsarevna Sophia—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of Kiev, and could speak Latin and Polish.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by {{resting on the}} breast and pushing themselves forward, often {{with the help of}} their wings. The <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Scholars today remain {{divided on}} the merits of the {{electronic}} barrier system and the efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Select {{committees}} are temporary committees, {{established by the}} Senate to deal with particular issues. This may occur when a particular group of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or {{where there is no}} existing committee suited to addressing a particular topic. Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed for a decade.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Claxton Shield was contested {{between five}} teams from around Australia. In {{previous}} years, {{many of the}} teams had played their home games at multiple venues. This season each team held their home games at only one venue. There was one scheduled <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{at the start of}} the season: the New South Wales Patriots' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Oval, whereas all of their other home games were held at Blacktown Baseball Stadium.|$|E

5|$|The O-Bahn {{had more}} than 4million {{passenger}} trips in the year after completion of Stage 1 in 1986, with a 30% increase the following year. When the completed O-Bahn was opened on 20 August 1989, passenger numbers rose another 17%. The Adelaide public transport system was privatised in the 1990s and overall patronage across all systems (bus, rail and tram) dropped 25%. The <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was the O-Bahn with no decrease, and there were 19,500 passenger trips daily in 1996 (7.13million a year). , the busway carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.|$|E
5|$|The only <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{arrangement}} was Operation Commando Bolt, a real-time, LORAN-based technique which utilized sensor strike zones derived from predicted target locations. These missions were coordinated by Task Force Alpha's Sycamore control center against targets that passed through strike modules (four strings {{of three to}} six sensors each). Air controllers at Sycamore then directly delivered the correct course, altitude, and speed necessary for the strike aircraft to deliver their ordnance to the correct coordinates.|$|E
5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> rule. Bruno Heim says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops {{have the right to}} bear, cardinals who are not bishops do not use it. Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do display a cross.|$|E
