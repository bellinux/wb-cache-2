A warmer (i.e., a lower color temperature) light is often used in public areas to promote relaxation, while a cooler (higher color temperature) light is used to enhance concentration, for example in schools and offices.|$|E
25|$|Some memory {{issues are}} due to stress, anxiety, or depression. A {{traumatic}} life event, such as {{the death of a}} spouse, can lead to changes in lifestyle and can leave an elderly person feeling unsure of themselves, sad, and lonely. Dealing with such drastic life changes can therefore leave some people confused or forgetful. While in some cases these feelings may fade, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> these emotional problems seriously. By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from a doctor or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E
25|$|While {{cultivating}} D. discoidium in a laboratory, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{into account}} its behavioral responses. For example, {{it has an}} affinity toward light, higher temperatures, high humidity, low ionic concentrations, and the acidic side of the pH gradient. Experiments are often done to see how manipulations of these parameters hinder, stop, or accelerate development. Variations of these parameters can alter the rate and viability of culture growth. Also, the fruiting bodies, being {{that this is the}} tallest stage of development, are very responsive to air currents and physical stimuli. It is unknown if there is a stimulus involved with spore release.|$|E

25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of this pathogen is it <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests that can be done on these samples to see if a person is infected. Viral antigen can be detected by performing an assay. A serological assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, green monkey kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} poly{{histidine}} tags are formed of six histidine (6xHis tag) residues - which are added at the N-terminus preceded by Methionine or C-terminus before a stop codon, in the coding {{sequence of the}} protein of interest. The choice of the end where His-tag is added will depend mainly {{on the characteristics of}} the protein and the methods chosen to remove the tag. Some ends are buried inside the protein core and others are important for the protein function or structure. In those cases the choice is limited to the other end. On the other hand, most available exopeptidases can only remove the His-tag from the N-terminus; removing the tag from the C-terminus will require the use of other techniques. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account that the computer simulation (by molecular dynamic) will help you to choose between options, for example, whether the His-tag must be digested or engineered to the N- or C-terminal.|$|E
25|$|Social constructivisms or socioculturalism {{encourage}} the learner or learners {{to arrive at}} his or her version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded worldview. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, logic, and mathematical systems, are inherited by the learner {{as a member of a}} particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's social interaction with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account the background and culture of the learner throughout the learning process, as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that the learner creates, discovers and attains in the learning process (Wertsch 1997).|$|E

500|$|A loose story arc that {{informed}} the Doctor's characterisation during the 2005 series is his feelings regarding {{the destruction of}} his own race, the Time Lords, which occurred offscreen before episode one. Eccleston felt that the episode [...] "Dalek" [...] showed the audience why his Doctor {{is the way he}} is and [...] "how he feels about his past". Russell T Davies remarked that the Ninth Doctor carries a lot of survival guilt; this is why he [...] "strides through the universe wearing a dark leather jacket saying [...] "Don't touch me"". Davies felt that [...] "Dalek" [...] provided a [...] "bit of therapy" [...] and after this he [...] "starts to rebuild himself". In the episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] the Doctor sacrifices his ninth life to save Rose. Davies felt it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Doctor away from mythological off stage concepts such as the Time War and provide a conclusion that focused on the relationship between the character and Rose. John Barrowman, who played Captain Jack, felt that the Doctor's decision to save Rose enabled a catharsis; as he sacrifices himself to save her he is [...] "letting go of the burden of the Time Lords being destroyed".|$|E

500|$|Goldstone was {{approached}} by Cassese and {{expressed an interest in}} the position. President Mandela supported his wish to take up the position at The Hague, as Goldstone later recalled: [...] "He certainly encouraged me. He thought it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> what was the first offer of a major international position after South Africa ceased to be a pariah." [...] However, the offer put Mandela in a difficult spot. He wanted Goldstone, {{who was one of the}} few South African jurists to have earned the respect of both blacks and whites, for South Africa's newly established Constitutional Court. Mandela struck a deal with the UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that Goldstone would serve only half of his four-year term as prosecutor and would then return to take up his post in South Africa. The president rushed through a constitutional amendment that would allow Goldstone to be named, take an immediate period of leave to serve at the tribunal and then return to his spot on the Constitutional Court. He proved to be an ideal candidate, as he had been suggested by the French, was not too hot-headed for the British, was strong enough to satisfy the Americans and his credentials as a white South African who had opposed apartheid satisfied the Russians and Chinese. The UN Security Council unanimously approved his appointment to the rôle of prosecutor.|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly {{to the people who}} weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, {{in terms of what we}} wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E
2500|$|During assessment, {{individuals}} may exhibit activation responses in which {{reminders of the}} traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., distress, anxiety, anger), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because {{individuals may}} not yet be capable of managing this distress, {{it is necessary to}} determine how the event can be discussed {{in such a way that}} will not [...] "retraumatize" [...] the individual. It is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible posttraumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).|$|E

2500|$|Good {{progress}} {{can be made}} {{in treating}} CRPS if treatment is begun early, ideally within three months of the first symptoms. If treatment is delayed, however, the disorder can quickly spread to the entire limb, and changes in bone, nerve, and muscle may become irreversible. The prognosis is not always good. Johns Hopkins Hospital reports that 77% of sufferers have spreads from the original site or flares {{in other parts of the}} body. The limb, or limbs, can experience muscle atrophy, loss of use, and functionally useless parameters that require amputation. RSD/CRPS will not [...] "burn itself out", but if treated early, it is likely to go into remission. Once one is diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, the likelihood of it resurfacing after going into remission is significant. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> precautions and seek immediate treatment upon any injury.|$|E
2500|$|Many drugs may {{increase}} or decrease the activity of various CYP isozymes either by inducing the biosynthesis of an isozyme [...] (enzyme induction) or by directly inhibiting {{the activity of the}} CYP (enzyme inhibition). This is a major source of adverse drug interactions, since changes in CYP enzyme activity may affect the metabolism and clearance of various drugs. For example, if one drug inhibits the CYP-mediated metabolism of another drug, the second drug may accumulate within the body to toxic levels. Hence, these drug interactions may necessitate dosage adjustments or choosing drugs that do not interact with the CYP system. Such drug interactions are especially <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account when using drugs of vital importance to the patient, drugs with important side-effects and drugs with small therapeutic windows, but any drug may be subject to an altered plasma concentration due to altered drug metabolism.|$|E
2500|$|It is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> losses due to fuel production, transportation, {{and storage}} into account. Fuel cell {{vehicles}} running on compressed hydrogen {{may have a}} power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22% if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas, and 17% if it is stored as liquid hydrogen. Fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery, except as hydrogen, but in some applications, such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as solar or wind power, they are combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an energy storage system. Most hydrogen, however, is produced by steam methane reforming, and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide. The overall efficiency (electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity) of such plants (known as round-trip efficiency), using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be [...] "from 35 up to 50 percent", depending on gas density and other conditions. While a much cheaper lead–acid battery might return about 90%, the electrolyzer/fuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen, and is therefore better suited for long-term storage.|$|E

2500|$|Reverend Mothers {{may also}} pass their own ego/memory {{combination}} to other Reverend Mothers at will, merely by touching foreheads. When a Reverend Mother dies {{in the presence}} of another Reverend Mother, the second will accept the ego/memory of the first to prevent the loss of the dying Reverend Mother's experience and ancestral memories. Especially when the Mother Superior perishes, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her ego/memory so that her plans and strategies may continue uninterrupted. This is first explored in Dune, when Jessica accepts the life experience of the dying Fremen Reverend Mother Ramallo. In Chapterhouse Dune, Darwi Odrade is Mother Superior, a contentious choice ratified by {{the fact that she was}} present at the previous Mother Superior's death, and has her in Other Memory; she represents the most continuous line of leadership. Under extreme conditions, a large community of Bene Gesserit will practice Extremis Progressiva, a mass sharing of ego/memories with each other to spread all the ego/memories amongst everyone; thus, if one survives, they all survive.
