40|$|Background: In September 2007, the UK {{government}} announced a £ 57. 5 m programme of `deep cleaning' for every NHS hospital in England. The programme {{was met with}} some scepticism and this paper provides an outline economic evaluation of the programme. Methods: We use information on costs of the programme, the opportunity cost of closing wards for cleaning and cost savings and health gains resulting from cleaning to model {{the reduction in the}} annual hospital acquired infection (HAI) rate required for the programme to be cost-effective. We compare our results with the potential <b>headroom</b> <b>available,</b> based on the available evidence and the beliefs of 15 experts. Findings: If wards are closed for two days for cleaning, an annual HAI reduction of 7. 8 % (21, 000 fewer non-fatal infections and 355 fewer deaths nationwide) would be required at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £ 30, 000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year. This figure does not compare favourably with the effectiveness estimates of < 1 % obtained from the available evidence on cleaning and the pooled prior beliefs of 15 experts. Interpretation: Our analysis shows that as it is very unlikely the deep cleaning programme would have been cost-effective, a full evaluation would not have been a good use of public funds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAt {{the concept}} stage, many {{uncertainties}} surround the commercial viability {{of a new}} medical device. These include the ultimate functionality of the device, the cost of producing it and whether, and at what price, it can be sold to a health-care provider (HCP). Simple assessments of value {{can be made by}} estimating such unknowns, but the levels of uncertainty may mean that their operational value for investment decisions is unclear. However, many decisions taken at the concept stage are reversible and will be reconsidered later before the product is brought to market. This flexibility can be exploited to enhance early-stage valuations. ObjectivesTo develop a framework for valuing a new medical device at the concept stage that balances benefit to the HCP against commercial costs. This is done within a simplified stage-gated model of the development cycle for new products. The approach is intended to complement existing proposals for the evaluation of the commercial <b>headroom</b> <b>available</b> to new medical products. ConclusionsA model based on two decision gates can lead to lower bounds (underestimates) for product value that can serve to support a decision to develop the product. Quantifiable uncertainty that can be resolved before the device is brought to market will generally enhance early-stage valuations of the device, and this remains true even when some components of uncertainty cannot be fully described. Clinical trials and other evidence-gathering activities undertaken as part of the development process can contribute to early-stage estimates of value...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Achieving high-efficiency {{solar cells}} {{and at the}} same time driving down the cell cost has been among the key {{objectives}} for photovoltaic researchers to attain a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE). While the per-formance of silicon (Si) based solar cells have almost saturated at an efficiency of ~ 25 %, III–V compound semi-conductor based solar cells have steadily shown perfor-mance improvement at ~ 1 % (absolute) increase per year, with a recent record efficiency of 44. 7 %. Integration of such high-efficiency III–V multijunction solar cells on significantly cheaper and large area Si substrate has recently attracted immense interest to address the future LCOE roadmaps by unifying the high-efficiency merits of III–V materials with low-cost and abundance of Si. This review article will discuss the current progress in the development of III–V multijunction solar cell integration onto Si substrate. The current state-of-the-art for III–V-on-Si solar cells along with their theoretical performance projections is presented. Next, the key design criteria and the technical challenges associated with the integration of III–V multijunction solar cells on Si are reviewed. Different technological routes for integrating III–V solar cells on Si substrate through heteroepitaxial integration and via mechanical stacking approach are presented. The key merits and technical challenges for all of the till-date available technologies are summarized. Finally, the pro-spects, opportunities and future outlook toward further advancing the performance of III–V-on-Si multijunction solar cells are discussed. With the plummeting price of Si solar cells accompanied with the tremendous <b>headroom</b> <b>available</b> for improving the III–V solar cell efficiencies, the future prospects for successful integration of III–V solar cell technology onto Si substrate look very promis-ing to unlock an era of next generation of high-efficiency and low-cost photovoltaics...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} High Assurance SPIRAL {{to solve the}} last mile problem for the synthesis of high assurance implementations of controllers for vehicular systems that are executed in today’s and future embedded and high performance embedded system processors. High Assurance SPIRAL is a scalable methodology to translate a high level specification of a high assurance controller into a highly resource-efficient, platform-adapted, verified control software implementation for a given platform in a language like C or C++. High Assurance SPIRAL proves that the implementation is equivalent to the specification written in the control engineer’s domain language. Our approach scales to problems involving floating-point calculations and provides highly optimized synthesized code. It is possible to estimate the <b>available</b> <b>headroom</b> to enable assurance/performance trade-offs under real-time constraints, and enables the synthesis of multiple implementation variants to make attacks harder. At the core of High Assurance SPIRAL is the Hybrid Control Operator Language (HCOL) that leverages advanced mathematical constructs expressing the controller specification to provide high quality translation capabilities. Combined with a verified/certified compiler, High Assurance SPIRAL provides a comprehensive complete solution to the efficient synthesis of verifiable high assurance controllers. We demonstrate High Assurance SPIRALs capability by co-synthesizing proofs and implementations for attack detection and sensor spoofing algorithms and deploy the code as ROS nodes on the Landshark unmanned ground vehicle and on a Synthetic Car in a real-time simulator...|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{alignment}} {{level is}} commonly 0 dBu (Equal to 0.775 Volts RMS) in broadcast chains and in professional audio what is {{commonly known as}} [...] "0VU", which is +4dBu (Equal to 1.227 Volts RMS) in places where the signal exists as analogue voltage. Under normal situations the [...] "0VU" [...] reference allowed for a headroom of 18dB or more above the reference level without significant distortion. This is largely due to the use of slow responding VU meters in almost all analog professional audio equipment which, by their design, and by specification responded to an average level, not peak levels. It most commonly is at −18 dB FS (18 dB below full scale digital) on digital recordings for programme exchange, in accordance with EBU recommendations. Digital equipment must use peak reading metering systems to avoid severe digital distortion caused by the signal going beyond 'full scale' or maximum digital levels. 24-bit original or master recordings commonly have alignment level at −24 dB FS to allow extra headroom, which can then be reduced to match the <b>available</b> <b>headroom</b> of the final medium by audio level compression. FM broadcasts usually have only 9 dB of headroom as recommended by the EBU, but digital broadcasts, which could operate with 18dB of headroom, given their low noise floor even in difficult reception areas, currently operate in a state of confusion, with some transmitting at maximum level while others operate at much lower level even though they carry material that has been compressed for compatibility with the lower dynamic range of FM transmissions.|$|R
30|$|An agent based {{model was}} {{outlined}} that considered social factors {{to predict the}} uptake of low-carbon technologies. The data used was taken from real-life, with real substation and feeder assignment. This allowed us to sort the 1841 properties into 44 realistic neighbourhoods. Then neighbour influence was imposed to determine uptake. The model also applied sets of EV and PV profiles that were representative of spring, summer and winter usage. To assess the model response, a probabilistic approach was proposed that provided feeder confidence bounds, which were an upper and lower limit for the expected load at every neighbourhood. These were a result of 500 consecutive simulations and therefore, the bounds measured the variation in LCT load. Next, another aspect of social influence was introduced with socio-demographic information also guiding LCT selection. More specifically, we ensured that bigger households {{were more likely to}} acquire a LCT. Confidence bounds were then utilised to quantify the effect of implementing this change. In particular, the potential peaks/troughs at select feeders were amplified as these neighbourhoods comprised of clusters of larger homes. The modelling undertaken focussed on EV adoption and then the combination of EV and PV uptake. To investigate these different scenarios and their possible model outcomes, computing confidence bounds was extremely effective. Moreover, the upper bound {{can also be used to}} determine the <b>available</b> <b>headroom</b> at each feeder for some specified uptake percentage. Identifying headroom is essential for network planning since negative headroom indicates transmission is greater than the maximum available power, causing issues for the electricity provider. Hence, subsequent to the upper bound calculation, certain feeders can be highlighted as likely sites for network malfunction when subjected to LCT demand. Furthermore, when analysing PV uptake as well, the lower bound becomes an equally important measure since negative power at the feeder level is also problematic for the electricity provider. As well, future voltage and thermal issues can be examined with these bounds if used as input to a voltage and thermal constraints simulator. Confidence bounds therefore will be an important tool to inform new policies and planning so that the future impact of LCTs on the LV network can be mitigated.|$|R

40|$|Building Information Modeling (BIM) model {{contains}} {{information about}} structural, architectural, MEP (Mechanical Electrical and Plumbing) and other numerous {{components of a}} building. Among these components, MEP constitutes about 50 % of the project cost, and its design is relatively more complex because of the limited <b>headroom</b> <b>available</b> to locate these components. The coordination of these systems involves locating and routing several subcomponents {{in a manner that}} satisfies different types of constraints. The earlier version of BIM Computer Aided Virtual Environment (CAVE) did not have provisions to show the overhead components of a BIM model. Conventionally, models had to be tilted to visualize the overhead components. The process of tilting the models to look up is considered counterintuitive. Some of the popular CAVEs developed by leading Universities have a screen on top to show the overhead components but they have a major shortcoming with them. The BIM models had to be converted to a specific format before they can be visualized in the CAVE environments. This study is an attempt to address the shortcomings of the previous version of the BIM CAVE by suggesting a prototype setup with a 55 " LCD screen on top of the existing three vertically placed LCD screens. The addition of one more screen on top increases the vertical field of view, that is, {{the extent to which the}} user can see vertically in a BIM model. The new BIM CAVE setup is run by a custom built application that makes use of the. Net API (Application Programming Interface) of the commercially available BIM application, Autodesk Navisworks 2012, to control the camera views for achieving an almost seamless semi-immersive virtual environment. The main objective of this research is to validate the effectiveness of the new setup suggested by using a qualitative research methodology called phenomenological study. Semi-structured informal interviews were conducted with the subject matter experts (SMEs) who are experienced in the field of BIM to know about the differences in the user experience after adding a screen on top of the earlier BIM CAVE setup. The main idea behind this qualitative research technique is to develop an understanding of how the SMEs perceived the idea of looking up to see the overhead components of the BIM model.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The primary aim of the thesis is to contribute to demonstrating how established and emerging science in the regenerative medicine (RM) domain can be translated into profitable commercial practice, and generate clinically- and cost-effective therapies. It achieves this by exploring and assessing underlying economics, including investment readiness and economic assessment, exploring regulatory and reimbursement frameworks, developing stem cell culture systems and assessing fit with clinical practice. The thesis is the first public domain wide-ranging analysis of business trends in the production, manufacturing and supply segments of the RM industry. It analyses the clinical potential of the domain {{as well as the}} translational and commercial challenges facing the industry. The industry is at a turning point as big pharmaceutical companies engage with RM in order to explore technologies as potential therapeutics and discovery tools. This unlocks the industry by confirming an exit path for RM based small- and medium-sized enterprises. Translation has come to be recognised as a core issue in the overall space and translation of regenerative therapies into the clinic is presently challenging, high-risk and expensive. This research addresses the question what are the mechanisms required to enable translation of emerging scientific knowledge into commercially viable clinical RM products? These mechanisms are particularly important as their creation involves and requires major investment decisions, which can determine {{the success or failure of}} RM developments and indeed of the companies concerned. The lack of well-established business models and the complexity of the domain suggested a conceptual approach drawing upon relevant literature from product and process development, applied business and revenue models, technological evolution and capital market ingenuity. The research was carried out in two phases. The first phase was concerned with identification of key challenges and mapping the overall industry emergence including emergence of related regulations to provide a context and framework for understanding the domain. Based on the emergence mapping a timeline of key parallel factors was identified, and their inherent connections explored to identify transforming events affecting and influencing multiple factors on the journey to clinical success within a business environment. This creates the reference model. The second phase was concerned with manufacturing a stem cell based therapeutic and applying health economic principles to determine <b>available</b> <b>headroom</b> for investment, cost of goods and return on investment, taking hearing disorders as a case exemplar, and exploring the behaviour of the net present value curve to identify key parameters affecting the economic positioning of this novel regime. A key output of the research is the investment readiness reference model. It integrates key RM business issues against reducing uncertainty and increasing value. The model argues that the complex nature of RM products means that the issues affecting industry emergence and development go well beyond the primarily scientific and technological concerns on which much current research focuses. The performance of RM firms ultimately hinges upon the successful clinical application of their developed products, the key step for creating and realising value, and their ability to deal with the fundamental business issues specific to the area. The framework deals with these business issues, which are investment & technology readiness, business models, organisational challenges, public policy and industry emergence. This thesis explores ideas that may bridge the chasm between the promise and reality of RM i. e. mechanisms to enable late stage translation of RM products. It links technological capability and business models for firms in the domain. Furthermore, it offers a unique perspective on the nature and characteristics of investment readiness and financial assessment, specifically identifying key parameters affecting economic positioning. The key contributions are therefore: 	New insights into the key challenges involved in realising the commercial potential of cell based therapeutics. 	Technology road mapping to link fundamental enabling technological capability for developing RM products with robust business plans integrating strategy, technology development and the regulatory and reimbursement framework. 	A generic investment readiness reference model generated from the enabling technology, value and supply chain structures to identify key indicators and characteristics of industry readiness.

This thesis contributes to this area by extending traditional load profiling to a big-data context, where refined load profiles (smart data) can be extracted by two novel load profiling techniques for LV networks and individual consumers. The refined load profiles aim to: i) economically visualise LV networks with limited smart-grid monitoring data; ii) transform the smart metering data into a high-detail granular representation of the customers’ daily demand. For the LV networks, this thesis develops a novel concept, LV network templates, which aim to visualise the LV networks in a cost-effective manner. A novel three-stage load profiling method is proposed as: clustering, classification and scaling. By using statistical time-series analysis, three steps are undertaken: i) cluster a vast amount of load data according to their load shapes; ii) classify un-monitored substations to the most similar cluster without sample metering; iii) and also scale them to the right magnitude without sample metering. Through this method, limited representative monitoring data can be used to develop a library of typical load profiles for un-monitored networks, thus saving the cost of extensive monitoring for every single substation. In addition, it is the first load profiling method that can accurately express both load shapes and magnitudes for LV networks. Regarding the customer’s demand representation, the developed time-series analysis needs to be updated due to the volatile and uncertain nature of smart metering data, including inter-related factors such as overall load shapes, sudden spikes and magnitudes. Therefore, an innovative spectral load profiling is proposed to decompose these factors into different spectral levels, characterised by spectral features. By analysing the extracted features on each spectral level separately through multi-resolution analysis, the interference among different factors can effectively be prevented. The proposed method, for the first time, is able to fully capture the energy characteristics at the household level. The developed LV network load templates provide an economical but straightforward way to quantify the <b>available</b> <b>headroom</b> of unmonitored substations over time, providing quantitative information for distribution network operators to integrate LTCs at the minimal costs. The spectral load profiling gives an insight into customer’s energy behaviours with high granularity and accuracy. It can support the customer-specified DSR, tariff design, smart metering validation and load forecasting...|$|R
