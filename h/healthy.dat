5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} <b>healthy</b> and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and <b>healthy</b> hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that <b>healthy</b> honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E

5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a <b>healthy</b> quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick <b>healthy</b> soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} species of Siricidae, the Sirex {{woodwasp}} can damage relatively <b>healthy</b> trees so heavily, they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and <b>healthy</b> trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need <b>healthy</b> wood, the Sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested.|$|E
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other <b>healthy</b> colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those <b>healthy</b> colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of <b>healthy</b> colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a <b>healthy</b> colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a <b>healthy</b> one, and this caused the <b>healthy</b> animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a <b>healthy</b> animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E

5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as <b>healthy.</b> Another threat to <b>healthy</b> riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{rumination}} in otherwise <b>healthy</b> adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in}} the 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally <b>healthy</b> patients appeared thereafter.

While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people come forward with their symptoms, awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited.|$|E
