40|$|Emotional {{intelligence}} {{is the ability}} of individuals in understanding the feelings of oneself and others, the ability to motivate themselves, the ability to express feelings appropriately in all situations, <b>endure</b> <b>frustration</b> and be able to empathize with the environment and cooperate with others. If someone possess emotional {{intelligence is}} not good, then this means that a person is not able to reduce the tension within him which could result in job stress. Job stress is a feeling of distress experienced by individuals in the face of his work, whether sourced from within the working environment or from outside the work environment that will eventually affect the physical and psychological state of the individual. Therefore a good emotional intelligence a person should possess in order to reduce or avoid the stress of work. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship of emotional intelligence on job stress in police members Sabhara East Java Regional Police. This study uses a quantitative approach. Its population is a police member Sabhara East Java Regional Police, amounting to 490 people. Sampling using a random sampling, with the subject as much as 98. Data collection method used is the scale. Where there are two scales used, the scale The intelligence of emotions and work stress scale. Analysis technique used is the product mement, with the result r = - 0. 410 and p value = 0. 000 (p < 0. 010), which has very significant meaning. Thus the hypothesis which says "there is a negative relationship between kecedasan emotions with work stress on police members of the East Java Regional Police Sabhara" acceptable. This means that the higher the emotional intelligence to the police members of the East Java Regional Police Sabhara the lower the stress work and conversely the lower the intelligence of emotions that have the higher the stress of work. Based on analysis of data that has been done, it can be concluded that there was a significant negative relationship between emotional intelligence of work stress on police premises Sabhara members in the East Java Regional Police. But there are other influences such as motivation are given, level of education, the amount of income received, and other things that are not investigated...|$|E
50|$|The {{club has}} {{in recent years}} <b>endured</b> <b>frustration</b> in its quest to win a Major A {{championship}}, losing grand finals in 2004, 2010, 2011 and 2012. This broke in 2013 when the Major A team took home the championship with a two-game sweep of Redlands Rays. The team were minor premiers and won a record 21 straight games {{to take out the}} championship on 24 March 2013.|$|R
50|$|After losing out to Vince Lombardi for the Green Bay Packers head {{coaching}} job in January 1959, Trimble <b>endured</b> continued <b>frustration</b> {{in three of}} the succeeding four CFL campaigns when Hamilton lost in the Grey Cup, each time to Winnipeg. In early 1963, Trimble left Hamilton to take the reins of the Montreal Alouettes, but after three losing seasons, he was unable to recapture the magic and was fired on November 18, 1965. Shortly after his dismissal, Trimble allegedly assaulted Montreal Gazette sportswriter Ian McDonald, but was able to avoid any trouble by apologizing to the journalist.|$|R
50|$|Following {{eight more}} years {{back in the}} Second Division, Wolves finally {{achieved}} a return to top division football in 1932, claiming the Second Division title and another promotion. In the {{years leading up to}} the Second World War, the team became established as one of the leading club sides in England. In 1938, Wolves needed only to win the last game of the season to be champions for the first time, but were beaten 1-0 at Sunderland and Arsenal claimed the title. They again finished as runners-up in 1939, this time behind Everton, and <b>endured</b> more <b>frustration</b> with defeat in the last pre-War FA Cup Final, losing 4-1 to underdogs Portsmouth.|$|R
2500|$|The day {{his term}} expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese {{authorities}} {{to be made}} docent of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein's opposition, Semmelweis's petition was denied. He reapplied, but {{had to wait until}} 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of 'theoretical' obstetrics. The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated mannequins only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left without so much as saying good-bye to his former friends and colleagues, a move that may have offended them. According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was [...] "unable to <b>endure</b> further <b>frustrations</b> in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment".|$|R
50|$|His cars {{became a}} {{significant}} {{presence at the}} Indianapolis 500. While he first gained notoriety by re-introducing the legendary Novi, his most famous entries were his turbine-powered cars in 1967 and 1968. In both years, he <b>endured</b> the excruciating <b>frustration</b> of seeing probable race-winners fail near the end; Joe Leonard's breakdown in the Lotus 56 with 10 laps remaining in 1968 had been topped the previous year when Parnelli Jones, leading comfortably with just three laps to go, suffered {{the failure of a}} six dollar transmission bearing in the STP-Paxton Turbocar and retired, handing a sure victory to A. J. Foyt.|$|R
40|$|While nongovernmental {{organizations}} (NGOs) can potentially strengthen valuable citizen political engagement, NGOs that are increasingly oriented towards donor and government contracts may instead contribute to depoliticizing development. Amidst competing pressures, NGO experiences and agency in managing multiple roles require examination. We present a qualitative {{case study of}} an NGO implementing a government‐designed intervention to strengthen Village Health, Sanitation, and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs) in rural north India. Despite a challenging context of community scepticism and poor government services, the NGO did successfully form VHSNCs by harnessing its respected interlocutor status, preexisting relationships, and ability to “sell” the VHSNC as a mechanism for improving local well‐being. While the VHSNC enabled community members to voice concerns to government officials, improvements often failed to meet community expectations. NGO staff <b>endured</b> community <b>frustration</b> {{on one hand and}} rebuffs from lower‐level officials on the other, while feeling undersupported by the government contract. Consequently, although contracted to strengthen a community institution, the NGO increasingly worked alongside VHSNC members to try to strengthen the public sector. Contrary to assumptions that NGOs become “tamed” through taking government contracts, being contracted to deliver inputs for community participation was intertwined with microlevel political action, though this came at a cost to the NGO...|$|R

50|$|Those {{who thought}} that Joe Kinnear was too inexperienced to keep Wimbledon, the Premiership's {{smallest}} side in terms of financial resources and fan base (and without even their own home), in the top flight, were quickly proved wrong. The consistent goalscoring of striker Dean Holdsworth returned Wimbledon to their winning ways after two mediocre seasons and they quickly re-established themselves {{as one of the}} hardest-to-beat sides in England. They finished sixth in the table - equalling their highest-ever finish - and, of all the London clubs, only Arsenal finished above them. They finished higher than much more fancied sides, including Sheffield Wednesday, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur. The only <b>frustration</b> <b>endured</b> by Dons supporters was what could have been achieved with a higher transfer budget and perhaps even their own home.|$|R

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Joseph Atkinson for his {{participation}} in my academic career at UB as both an advisor and a friend. I {{would also like to thank}} Jim Jensen for his insights into the complexities of water chemistry and Ling Bian for her reminders to focus on being an engineer rather than a computer scientist. In addition to my committee members and student colleagues at the University at Buffalo (UB), I {{would like to}} acknowledge all my friends and colleagues at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Specifically, John R. Schott for being my professional mentor and a second father. Adam Goodenough was my sounding board for the bi-directional particle tracking concepts introduced here. Matt Montanaro and Carl Salvaggio were my personal support group and document proofreaders. I obviously could not have completed this journey without the immense support of my friends and family. Special thanks to Sue Michel for generally being a fantastic friend and specifically for her late night “inspirational poems”. My wife Melissa is the most important person in my life and the person that <b>endured</b> my <b>frustration</b> and exhaustion while I worked full-time and completed this degree. During these past years, she kept me well fed and took care of our young daughter Abigail so that I could concentrate on this degree at night and on weekends. The only thing tha...|$|R
40|$|Initiative (OSGi) and Smart card {{technologies}} in embedded devices {{have made the}} two technologies suitable for developing middleware applications for home appliances. In this paper, we describe an electronic-prescription (eRx) system currently under development for home-based telemedicine. The eRx system is intended to support a home cared patient {{who would like to}} order a refill of prescription by sending a request to the doctor via a home gateway without making direct phone call to the office. The design of the eRx system is based on the OSGi environment, which serves as the service framework between the home gateway (a set-top box) and the external wide area network that provides services to the home. The set-top box allows the patient to communicate to the doctor at the hospital or the pharmacist at the pharmacy stores. The system, if successfully deployed, will eliminate the waiting and <b>frustration</b> <b>endured</b> by home-cared patients, in particular those who are bed-ridden or not dexterous, for Rx order and refilling. The paper describes aspects or bundles in OSGi, which we are using, XML as a means of data storage format, smart card technology for storing and accessing patient prescription and personal information, and a wireless PDA interface for remote access to the home gateway (set-top box) ...|$|R
40|$|Throughout history, {{the great}} {{achievements}} of civilizations and cultures {{have been recorded}} in lists of dates and events. But to look only at the machinery, discoveries, or milestones is to miss {{the value of these}} achievements. Each goal achieved or discovery or made represents a supreme {{effort on the part of}} individual people who came and worked together for a purpose greater than themselves. Driven by an innate curiosity of the spirit, we have built civilizations and discovered new worlds, always reaching out beyond what we knew or thought was possible. These efforts may have used ships or machinery, but the achievement was that of the humans who made those machines possible- remarkable people willing to <b>endure</b> discomfort, <b>frustration,</b> fatigue, and the risk of failure in the hope of finding out something new. This is the case with the history of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This publication traces the legacy of successes, risks, disappointments and internationally recognized triumphs of the Center's first 40 years. It is a story of technological achievement and scientific discovery; of reaching back to the dawn of time and opening up a new set of eyes on our own planet Earth. In the end, it is not a story about machinery or discoveries, but a story about ourselves. If we were able to step off our planet, and if we continue to discover new mysteries and better technology, it is because the people who work at Goddard always had a passion for exploration and the dedication to make it happen. The text that follows is a testimony to the challenges people at the Goddard Space Flight Center have faced and overcome over almost half a century. Today, we stand on the threshold of a new and equally challenging era. It will once again test our ingenuity, skills, and flexibility as we find new ways of working with our colleagues in industry, government, and academia. Doing more with less is every bit as ambitious as designing the first science instrument to study the heavens. But if we are to continue exploring our world and our universe, it is every bit as important. Robert H. Goddard once said, "The dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow. " This is our heritage. Our challenge is to keep our spirit of dedication, vision, and innovative thinking alive, so we can turn today's dreams into a new century of possibility and progress. Our journeys into space are the greatest ongoing adventure the human race has ever undertaken, and everyone here has played an important role in that endeavor. This book is about everyone who has worked at the Goddard Space Flight Center...|$|R
