Later, during the operational phases, regular <b>instrument</b> <b>checks</b> will be executed, i. e., on-board characterization, frequent laboratory characterization and vicarious calibration. The APEX instrument will achieve its challenging measurement accuracy by regular calibration of the instrument between flight cycles and secondly guarantee an excellent performance by using its “In-Flight Characterisation unit ” (IFC) during flight operation. For on-ground characterisation, a dedicated characterisation and calibration facility is in preparation to enable a comprehensive and accurate calibration of the instrument. The so-called "Calibration Home Base " (CHB) is located at DLR Oberpfaffenhofen and will be operational from 2006. The CHB provides all hard- and software tools required for radiometric, spectral and geometric on-ground characterisation and calibration of the instrument and its internal references and to perform measurements on polarisation and stray light sensitivity and comprises a test bed and the provision of the infrastructure. In view of the high relevance to scientific objectives of its Living Planet Programme, ESA decided to contribute to the realisation of APEX by providing and funding among others the CHB.

40|$|The {{study of}} probe event related {{potentials}} (probe ERPs) is reviewed. Several recent experiments are described {{which seem to}} leave in doubt the usefulness of applying ERP to simulation and field conditions as well as laboratory situations. Relatively minor changes in the experimental paradigm can produce major shifts in ERP findings, {{for reasons that are}} not clear. However, task-elicited ERPs might be used on a flight simulator if the experimenter takes time of arrival of the eyes on a particular instrument as one variable of concern and dwell time on the instrument as a second variable. One can then look at ERPs triggered by saccade termination for fixation pauses of specified durations. It may well be that ERP to a momentarily important display will differ from that elicited by routine <b>instrument</b> <b>check...</b>|$|R
