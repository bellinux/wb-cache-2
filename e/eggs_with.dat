5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of 2 to 5 light green-grey <b>eggs</b> <b>with</b> darker spots. The mean clutch sizes of grey jays in Algonquin Provincial Park and La Verendrye Provincial Park were 3.03 and 3.18 eggs, respectively. Incubation is performed {{only by the}} female and lasts an average of 18.5 days. The female is fed on the nest by her partner, rarely moving from the nest during incubation and for several days after hatching.|$|E
5|$|All birds lay amniotic <b>eggs</b> <b>with</b> hard shells made {{mostly of}} calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E

It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E

50|$|The extra {{chromosome}} is retained {{because of}} a nondisjunction event during paternal or maternal meiosis I (gametogenesis). Nondisjunction occurs when homologous chromosomes, {{in this case the}} X and Y or two X sex chromosomes, fail to separate, producing a sperm with an X and a Y chromosome or an <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two X chromosomes. Fertilizing a normal (X) <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> this sperm produces an XXY offspring (Klinefelter).

40|$|Chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks is {{a product}} marketed by company with {{expectation}} as the primary needs price increases, the product could be alternative to get more protein than one yolk in general. Challenge for the company which marketed the product is the difficulty to make consumer’s sure that the product gave benefit for them. So there needed an effective marketing strategy to sell the chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks latest innovation product. The most effective strategy shall be formulated according to systematic analysis steps to internal and external conditions of the company. Internal environment analysis consisted of product strengths and weakness sourced from company’s internal determination and to be more valid, there should be determination by consumer’s product. Consumer could assess the strengths and weakness of 4 P (product, promotion, place, price) in neutral. External environment analysis sourced from management determination to the general external condition about opportunity and threats to the chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks marketing development. External and internal analysis consisted of SWOT frame analysis. SWOT frame analysis sharpen the marketing strategy formulation. Because {{of the importance of}} management and marketing strategy for chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks which was latest innovation product, there needed research titled: “Marketing Strategy of Chicken’s <b>Egg</b> <b>with</b> Two yolks in PT Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk”. The research purpose were: (1) finding out people respond to chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks; (2) finding out strength, weakness, threat, and opportunity in chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks marketing; (3) formulating marketing strategy which applied by company to sell chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks as latest innovation product. Location stated was done by purposive, PT. Multi Breeder Indonesia Tbk in Sidoarjo. In this research, which became respondents was PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk and people who consume the chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks also people who lived in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Tbk. Respondents from PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia was taken by purposive, that was the main owner or vice director who represent the owner. From the consumer, there were 30 people taken by accidental sampling method. Data collection method was done by interview, observation, and library study. Analysis method used was descriptive analysis, quantitative consisted of: (1) external strategy factor matrix; (2) Internal strategy factor matrix, SWOT (strengths, weakness, opportunity, treaths). Chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks consumer in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk in average were male, 30 - 39 year old, located in Malang, working in private institution, and had income between Rp 1. 500. 001 -Rp 2. 500. 000. Strength owed by chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks marketing in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk was delicious, cheap price, good service, strategic location. The weakness owed by PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk was big egg size, white colored shell, thin shell. Opportunity owed by chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk were lack of market demand, people nutrition, minimization of household fund. Threat owed in chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks marketing PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk was people respond to the chicken <b>egg</b> <b>with</b> two yolks and lack of stock. Ideal marketing strategy after SWOT analysis fit with internal external strategy factor matrix analysis was S-O (strength-opportunities) by defending and increasing service in central depo, increasing quality product.

5|$|Unlike {{the workers}} of more {{advanced}} social insects such as honeybees, bumblebee workers are fertile, and can lay unfertilised haploid <b>eggs</b> (<b>with</b> {{only a single}} set of chromosomes) that develop into viable male bumblebees.

5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white <b>eggs</b> <b>with</b> small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the <b>eggs</b> <b>with</b> his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E

5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by flicking his tongue over her entire body. As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs of the males are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay clutches of <b>eggs</b> <b>with</b> an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future <b>eggs</b> <b>with</b> the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E

Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus eggs were laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath a mound of plant matter. Tanaka et al.
