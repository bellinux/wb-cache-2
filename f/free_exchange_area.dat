40|$|The {{digital era}} is {{witnessing}} a remarkable evolution of digital services. While the prospects are countless, the e-marketplaces of digital services are encountering inherent game-theoretic and computational challenges that restrict the rational choices of bidders. Our work examines the limited bidding scope and the inefficiencies of present exchange e-marketplaces. To meet challenges, a <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> e-marketplace is proposed {{that follows the}} free market economy. The <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> model includes a new bidding language and a double auction mechanism. The rule-based bidding language enables the flexible expression of preferences and strategic conduct. The bidding message holds the attribute-valuations and bidding rules of the selected services. The <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> deliberates on attributes and logical bidding rules for automatic deduction and formation of elicited services and bids that result in a more rapid self-managed multiple exchange trades. The double auction uses forward and reverse generalized second price auctions for the symmetric matching of multiple digital services of identical attributes and different quality levels. The proposed double auction uses tractable heuristics that secure exchange profitability, improve truthful bidding and deliver stable social efficiency. While the strongest properties of symmetric exchanges are unfeasible game-theoretically, the <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> converges rapidly to the social efficiency, Nash truthful stability, and weak budget balance by multiple quality-levels cross-matching, constant learning and informs at repetitive thick trades. The empirical findings validate the soundness and viability of the <b>free</b> <b>exchange...</b>|$|R

The options considered. are <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> rates, fixed exchange rates, and a U.

They conclude that a currency union is superior to fixed exchange rates and fixed exchange rates are superior to <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> rates in a world of consistency in nominal environments. However, if we are unwilling to surrender our autonomy over the aggregate price level to our principal trading partner, then a <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> rate regime is the only feasible choice...|$|R

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} {{dominates the}} heat transfer in many high-temperature systems like fossil fuel fired furnaces and boilers. Accurate simulation of radiative transfer is then of crucial importance for prediction of the thermal performances. In {{the last fifty}} years, several radiative heat transfer methods have been developed: discrete transfer radiation model [1], spherical harmonic P 1 approximation [2], discrete ordinates method [3], [4], non-equilibrium diffusion model [5], [6], effective-emissivity approximation [7], Monte Carlo method [8] and various zonal methods [9], [10], [11]. The Hottel zonal method is intended as a realistic scheme for calculation of radiant heat exchange with respect to spatially distributed heat release. Direct interchange areas are calculated using well known procedure [11]. Direct <b>exchange</b> <b>areas</b> of close zones are obtained by numerical integrations. Yamauti principle is used in calculation of direct <b>exchange</b> <b>areas,</b> [12]. Total <b>exchange</b> <b>areas</b> are obtained using reflected fluxes, when original emitter is surface or volume zones. Matrix equations of reflected fluxes, nedeed for total <b>exchange</b> <b>areas,</b> are solved by Crout algorithm.

50|$|It was {{determined}} that DFHBI only binds Spinach in the phenolate form. At pH < 6.0, both the phenolic and phenolate forms are detected. At pH = 6.0, only the phenolate peak is detected. DFHBI is also incredibly robust and resists photobleaching {{over a long period}} of time as compared to HBI and EGFP. It is believed that the <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> of bound and unbound ligand allows for this persistence. As the fluorophore of GFP and its derivatives are covalently bound to/a part of the protein, <b>free</b> <b>exchange</b> cannot happen and thus photobleaching results.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSpraying heat {{exchanger}} and tubular radiation recuperator are common equipment of the drying hot air furnace. To study {{the way of}} reducing the investment cost for the {{heat exchanger}} of high-temperature and high-capacity hot air furnace, the heat <b>exchange</b> <b>area</b> of the two heat exchangers was calculated by LMTD method when air temperature rose from 0 °C, 100 °Cand 200 °C to different temperature points, and {{the figure of the}} relationship between the temperature difference and average heat <b>exchange</b> <b>area</b> was given. According to the analysis, the economical temperature range of the heat exchangers is narrower as the inlet air temperature rises. When the air temperature difference keeps constant, the average heat <b>exchange</b> <b>area</b> increases as the inlet air temperature rises. When the inlet air temperature keeps constant, the average heat <b>exchange</b> <b>area</b> increases gradually as the air temperature difference rises. Then the average heat <b>exchange</b> <b>area</b> exceeds the economical temperature range and approaches infinity quickly. The analytical method of economic performance can be applied to the design and model selection of two-stage heat exchanger of high-temperature and high-capacity hot air furnace...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the list update problem {{as defined in}} the seminal work on competitive analysis by Sleator and Tarjan [12]. In this problem, a sequence of requests, consisting of items to access in a linked list, is given. After an item is accessed it can be moved to any position forward in the list at no cost (<b>free</b> <b>exchange),</b> and, at any time, any two adjacent items can be swapped {{at a cost of}} 1 (paid exchange). The cost to access an item is its current position in the list. The goal is to dynamically rearrange the list so as to minimize the total cost (accrued from accesses and exchanges) over the request sequence. We show a lower bound of 12 / 11 on the worst-case ratio between the performance of an (offline) optimal algorithm that can only perform <b>free</b> <b>exchanges</b> and that of an (offline) optimal algorithm that can perform both paid and <b>free</b> <b>exchanges.</b> This answers an outstanding question that has been open since 1996 [10]...|$|R
