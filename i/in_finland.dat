5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial <b>in</b> <b>Finland.</b> The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland {{that it could have}} been created anywhere.

5|$|The only {{reference}} to Bishop Thomas during his episcopate <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> {{is a letter}} signed by him in Nousiainen in 1234, which granted certain lands around the parish to his chaplain Wilhelm.

5|$|In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate {{leaned on}} the German Empire for {{military}} and political aid, in order to defeat the Finnish Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia <b>in</b> <b>Finland,</b> and expand Finnish territory to Russian/East Karelia, which held geopolitical significance, and was home to people speaking Finno-Ugric languages (Irredentist campaigns/Heimosodat). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of Greater Finland among the expansive factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed {{on the need to}} take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention <b>in</b> <b>Finland.</b> Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the Finnish Red Guards, and he {{leaned on the}} high military skills of the Finnish Jägers.

5|$|The Russian {{revolutions}} split {{also the}} Russian army officers politically and {{their attitude toward}} the Finnish civil war varied; Mikhail Svechnikov led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and Konstantin Yeremejev the Russian forces in the Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary underlings and co-operated with the former colleague General Mannerheim, assisting the Whites in the disarmament of the Russian garrisons <b>in</b> <b>Finland.</b> On 30 January 1918 Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> that the White army did not fight against Russia: {{the goal of the}} White campaign was to beat the Finnish Red rebels and the Russian troops supporting them.|$|E

5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} <b>in</b> <b>Finland</b> and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and <b>in</b> <b>Finland,</b> Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E

Since 1935, Estonian shale oil has been supplied to the German Kriegsmarine as a ship fuel. In 1938, 45% of Estonian shale oil was exported, accounting for 8% of Estonia's total exports. Although {{the price of oil}} shale-based gasoline was at least triple that of global gasoline prices, high production and bilateral agreements with Germany facilitated its export. In 1939, Estonia produced 181,000tonnes of shale oil, including 22,500tonnes of oil that were suitable gasoline equivalents. The mining and oil industry employed 6,150 persons.|$|E
