40|$|AbstractMedian {{filtering}} is {{a corner}} stone of {{medical image processing}} and it is extensively used in smoothing and denoising of medical images. Edges {{are one of the}} important feature in biomedical imaging for the problem such as <b>hair</b> <b>crack</b> detection, tissue damage detection. Median filter removes the noise but during the noise removal phase it also remove the edges that are important feature/information for images in classification/recognition task. In this paper an enhancement in existing median filtering has been proposed that preserve more edges without much lose in Peak signal to noise ratio(PSNR) and signal to noise ratio SNR). In this paper we also proposed a new parameter for performance evaluation Edge Retrieval Index (ERI) that evaluates the edge preservation index in images. The algorithm cleans up the imagenoise in the homogeneous areas, but preserves the edges in other region...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article proposes the {{simultaneous}} {{application of the}} local electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) and the global dynamic techniques using {{the same set of}} piezo-electric ceramic (PZT) sensor patches for improved health monitoring of structures. It describes an experimental study conducted on a two-story reinforced concrete frame struc-ture using PZT patches embedded in the structure. The global dynamic technique, which is based on global frequency changes, is effective in low frequency range only, due to which an incipient damage (such as <b>hair</b> <b>crack)</b> cannot be detected by it. On the other hand, the EMI technique, which works in the kilohertz range, is very sensitive to incipient damage. The initial cracks were successfully detected by the EMI technique whereas more severe type damages were identified and suitably quantified by the global dynamic techniques. Selected inputs, chosen from the extracted equivalent parameters, namely stiffness and damping changes (EMI technique) and the damping ratio (global technique), were used to train an artificial neural network, whose outputs were the severity and the location of the damage. The simul-taneous use of the two techniques results in an improved structural health monitoring. This approach is very sensitive and cost effective to detect damages ranging from incipient to severe types in the civil structures. Key Words: damage, global dynamic technique, electro-mechanical impedance technique, piezoelectric ceramic patch, structural health monitoring...|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{structure}} {{are designed}} to be able for providing an optimum service towards influences or forces both from the outside and also from inside of the structure. These influences and forces are the caused, which the structure will result in a failure such as cracking, concrete degradation, and reinforcement corrosion. Concrete cracking are consist of <b>hair</b> <b>cracks</b> and structural <b>cracks.</b> <b>Hair</b> <b>cracks</b> are most likely caused from concrete drying process, while structure cracks are mostly caused by errors on planning and also because of poor implementation. Concrete degradation is the process of reduction in concrete strength, which is increasingly lower than its concrete capacity. Reinforcement corrosion is caused from the process of concrete weathering around the reinforcement, which directly influence the dimension of the reinforcement. To implement concrete structure refinement technology, detection, observation, evaluation, and analysis are required to be done. Wherein the first indication is emphasized on concrete cracking, whether it was a new or old cracks and the type of the cracks. Aside from that concrete weathering also needs to be checked. The instruments used are sound test, rebound hammer, and ultrasonic pulse velocity test. To determine crack width, crack compactor, brittle liquid coating and linear variable differential transformer are used. Here strength of the concrete also needs to be determining by hammer test and core drill system. Concrete structure refinement technology, aside from considering the mean of its improvement, is also highly dependent on the damage. The aims of this technology are to increase the capacity and improve the performance of the structure. Aimed at concrete weathering refinement, the damage part is removed for then replaced with new concrete mixture. The substitute concrete can be from dry packing, mortar, grouting, shot crating, and pre packed concrete. For the active cracks type, the technologies to be used are painting and concrete injection. Similarly if the analysis result is require replacing the reinforcement, replacement should be performed including the possibility of adding concrete reinforcement. ...|$|R
30|$|Unlike Gram-negative bacteria, Streptomyces {{and other}} {{filamentous}} actinobacteria possess active penetration structures that grow {{on the plant}} surface and infect intact cells [88]. The ability to attach and develop an infection point through the cell wall of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam.) has been reported for S. ipomoea. Subsequently, the tip-growth hyphae colonize the interior of parenchyma cells and establish an endophytic interaction [89]. Similarly, using short branches {{that emerged from the}} main hyphae, S. scabies was observed to penetrate the cell walls of potato plants [90]. Based on the described cell wall penetration process by these short hyphae within a short and uniform distance from the branching point, the authors suggested a specialized penetration function for this structure. Furthermore, Streptomyces might enter plant tissues by natural openings such as stomatal apertures, lenticels, hydathodes, wounds, broken trichomes, and root <b>hair</b> <b>cracks</b> formed by lateral root emergence zones [88]. A transmission electron microscope analysis demonstrated that S. galbus MBR- 5 entered the leaves of Rhododendron sp. seedlings through stomatal openings [91].|$|R

Many new houses in the town like the Shamrock Cottages and Dovers Row were built. The coming of the railway to Gowran in the 1850s {{and the construction of}} railway buildings was a significant event in the area at the time. A new Gowran Castle was built 1816-1819. The Roman Catholic Church was built during the 19c and in 1881 dedicated by Dr. Moran Bishop of Ossory who had Gowran connections. A new school was built in 1900. 1826 A new Chancel was rebuilt in St Mary’s Church to the designs of the Kilkenny architect of the period William Robertson who also designed the nearby Gowran Castle and most of the standing Kilkenny Castle we see today. 1881 Mr George Ashlin, architect modelled his plan for the Catholic Church of the Assumption Gowran on the Nave of St. Mary’s Church.1950’s/60’s The Church of Ireland community held service in the Church each Sunday at 3-00pm. 1960’s The upper floor of the tower and the wall surrounding the top of the tower were reinstated.1970’s Church of Ireland worship finishes. Use of the Church for service finished in the 1970s bringing to an end over 700 years of worship in the Church. The Church was taken over by the OPW. A bust of James Agar and a holy water font, known as the Gowran Holy Water Font, which were in the Church before it closed were taken to St. Laserian’s Church in Old Leighlin Co. Carlow Ireland.1980’s The Gowran Development Association was founded in 1988 in Gowran. One of its aims was to enhance and develop St. Mary’s Church and surrounds.1995 Restoration of the chancel roof and stabilisation of the timber structure which began in 1994 was completed. Stained glass windows were storm glazed. Representation was made by the Gowran Development Association to government ministers with a view to providing funding to the OPW for further improvements. Following these meetings the government committed a further £300 000 for improvement works on the Church.Following stabilisation work on the roof, the interior of the Chancel was renovated. The interior walls of the Chancel were replastered in the traditional style using lime mortar and goat <b>hair.</b> <b>Cracks</b> in the tower were monitored and the tower found to be stable. Some of the monuments were rearranged in the Chancel to make the building suitable for visitors. A number of monuments were brought in from the Nave and positioned in the Chancel to prevent weather erosion.1992-1995 Restoration of the boundary wall surrounding the graveyard was completed by the Gowran Development Association with support from the Fas (now Intreo) community employment scheme (CE Scheme).1996 The Upper Garden and Millennium Garden between the boundary wall {{to the front of the}} Church and the main street were built by the Gowran Development Association with support from the Fas (now Intreo) community employment scheme (CE Scheme), Barrow Nore Sure Leader, (now Kilkenny Leader Partnership KLP) and Kilkenny Co. Council under the Village Renewal Scheme.2000 Flood lighting was installed around the building.2010-2012 110m of the wall to the rear of the graveyard was restored by the OPW using traditional skills and lime mortar mix. Parts of this wall are medieval. The wall was part of a wall surrounding the walled town of Gowran.2013 Restoration work began on the nearby Gowran Castle. This castle and previous castles on this site had close links to St. Mary’s Church. Many of the Butlers and Agars who lived in the different castles built on the site of the present Gowran Castle are buried in St. Mary’s Church. When the castle grounds were landscaped in the 18th and 19th centuries, a walk from the castle to the Church was made. This can be seen on the 1840 and 1900 Ordnance survey maps of the area. This was called the [...] "Rose Walk" [...] as it was lined with different species of roses. The entrance from the castle rose walk to the Church grounds can be seen in the rear wall of the graveyard.|$|R
40|$|Sixteen test gilts {{were fed}} an egg white-fortified {{practical}} diet and four control gilts an egg white-free diet over a two-parity period {{in order to}} monitor changes in the serum biotin levels as induced biotin deficiency progressed. Gilts were individually housed in metal crates with slatted floors. Serum biotin (ng/L) of test animals declined from 1490 (initially) to 610 (month 3), remained stable (months 4 - 8) and thereafter approached 400, 135 and 30 after months 9, 13 and 15, respectively. Early clinical symptoms, i. e. lesions (on the feet, legs and skin), hoof <b>cracks,</b> <b>hair</b> loss and dry skin, were first observed after six months and became progressively more pronounced with time. After nine months, the induced symptoms resembled those characteristic of biotin deficiency. In contrast, serum biotin remained high in the control animals which did not develop symptoms. The data are interpreted to mean that serum biotin might {{be used as a}} sensitive index of biotin deficiency development in sows. On the basis of these observations, a system is proposed for evaluation of the sow's biotin status. Adequate biotin may be indicated by serum biotin level (ng/L) > 700; marginal, > 600 400 < 600; and deficient, < 400. Alternatively, several concurrent clinical symptoms (i. e. alopecia, hoof cracks and lesions on the feet, legs and skin) may aid in the diagnosis of inadequate biotin status of sow herds reared under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Over {{the past}} two decades, the study of chronic cocaine and crack cocaine {{exposure}} in the pediatric population {{has been focused on}} the potential adverse effects, especially in the prenatal period and early childhood. Non-invasive biological matrices have become an essential tool for the assessment of a long-term history of drug of abuse exposure. Case report We analyze the significance of different biomarker values in <b>hair</b> after chronic <b>crack</b> exposure in a two-year-old Caucasian girl and her parents, who are self-reported crack smokers. The level of benzoylecgonine, the principal metabolite of cocaine, was determined in segmented hair samples (0 cm to 3 cm from the scalp, and > 3 cm from the scalp) following washing to exclude external contamination. Benzoylecgonine was detectable in high concentrations in the child's hair, at 1. 9 ng/mg and 7. 04 ng/mg, respectively. Benzoylecgonine was also present in the maternal and paternal hair samples at 7. 88 ng/mg and 6. 39 ng/mg, and 13. 06 ng/mg and 12. 97 ng/mg, respectively. Conclusion Based on the data from this case and from previously published poisoning cases, {{as well as on the}} experience of our research group, we conclude that, using similar matrices for the study of chronic drug exposure, children present with a higher cocaine concentration in hair and they experience more serious deleterious acute effects, probably due to a different and slower cocaine metabolism. Consequently, children must be not exposed to secondhand crack smoke under any circumstance. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Some {{evidence}} suggests that altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning in cocaine users might {{play a role in}} the pathophysiology of substance abuse. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between exposure to negative life events and cortisol <b>hair</b> concentrations in <b>crack</b> cocaine users during the 3 months prior to admission to a detoxification program. Methods: A total of 23 treatment-seeking, crack cocaine-dependent women were selected for this study 1 week after admission to an inpatient treatment at a locked treatment facility. the Paykel Life Events Scale measured the occurrence of stressful life events 3 months before admission. Hair cortisol concentration was measured during these three previous months. Results: the partial correlations, using severity of dependence as control variable, revealed that there is a positive association between hair cortisol concentration and the number of negative life events exposure 90 days (r =. 56; p =. 007) and 30 days (r =. 42; p =. 048) prior to admission at the hospital. One-way ANOVA suggests that hair cortisol levels and stress load significantly increase over 3 months prior to hospitalization. Conclusions: the results of this study indicate that there is a positive association between measures of long-term cumulative cortisol secretion and the number of stressful events reported by women receiving inpatient treatment for crack cocaine dependence. Therefore, this study suggests that stress load can be objectively quantified and noninvasively assessed. Scientific Significance: This study is the first to investigate HPA axis functioning using hair cortisol concentrations among crack cocaine-dependent users. It is a promising strategy to assess stress load in substance abusers.

40|$|Endofungal {{bacteria}} as symbionts {{residing in}} the fungal mycelium and spores were first describes as Bacteria-Like Organisms (BLOs) in 1970 s (Mosse 1970). The bipartite relationship between fungi and terrestrial plants on the rhizosphere becomes complicated tripartite interaction as the discovery of endobacteria. In the last decade, research focussed on the endobacteria in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Bonfante and Anca 2009; Naumann et al. 2010; Salvioli et al. 2015), in ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete fungus (Bertaux et al. 2005), and in rice pathogenic fungus Rhizopus microsporus (Partida-Martinez and Hartweck 2005; Moebius et al. 2014). We extended the former work to explore and establish a model tripartite symbiosis system among the Sebacinalean fungus Piriformospora indica, the Alphaproteobacterium Rhizobium radiobacter and {{a broad spectrum of}} plants. The free-living bacterial strain R. radiobacter F 4 (RrF 4) showed similar colonization pattern as its fungal host P. indica in plant roots. RrF 4 cells heavily colonizedthe root maturation zone, embedded in dense polysaccharides biofilms and were interwoven in cellulose fiber-like structures on the root surface. Thereafter, RrF 4 cells entered into inner tissue through lateral root emergence, root <b>hair</b> protrusion and <b>cracks</b> on the root, proliferated in the intercellular space in the rhizodermal and cortical layers into the central vascular system. Nevertheless, RrF 4 only invaded and colonized the dead root cells instead of inducing plant host cell death. The systemic resistance mediated by RrF 4 is based on the jasmonate-based ISR pathway, and defense gene expression resembles that observed with P. indica (Gleaser et al. 2015). The increased amount of endobacteria R. radiobacter in plant roots inoculated with P. indica, and the significantly reduced amount of endobateria in the sub-cultured P. indica that was isolated from plant roots indicate endobacteria R. radiobacter obtain more benefit from the tripartite relationship with both fungal and plant hosts than in the bipartite relation with only the fungus. It is an open question whether the endobacteria R. radiobacter released from P. indica into root tissue during the fungal colonization on plant. It was not successful to cure P. indica from the endobacteria through antibiotics treatment and single protoplast cultivation. However, we obtained a P. indica culture with reduced amount of endobacteria R. radiobacter, and partially cured P. indica showed low beneficial activity on plants. We presume the endobacteria R. radidobacter inside P. indica are at a stationary phase, which is the reason for the low number, small size and resistance to antibiotics in axenic culture. The endobacteria R. radiobacter resuscitate from stationary phase to growth phase when there is third partner plant supplying with enough nutrition and better propagation conditions, which results in the increased amount of endobacteria R. radiobacter when P. indica colonized on plant root. Taken together, this study underlines the crucial role of endofungal bacteria in the tripartite symbiosis. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanism of R. radiobacter in the tripartite interaction, such as the regulation of mRNA on transcriptome level. Endofungale Bakterien wurden als Symbionten, die im pilzlichen Myzel residieren, zuerst in den 1970 ern als Bakterien-ähnliche Bacteria-Like Organisms (BLOs) beschrieben (Mosse 1970). Mit der Entdeckung von Endobakterien ist aus der zweiteilige Symbiose von Pilzen und terrestrischen Pflanzen eine komplizierten dreiteiligen Symbiose geworden. Im letzten Jahrzehnt konzentrierte sich die Forschung auf Endobakterien in Arbuskulären Mykorrhizapilze (Bonfante and Anca 2009; Naumann et al. 2010; Salvioli et al. 2015), in ektomykorrhizalen Basidiomyceten (Bertaux et al. 2005) und in den Reispflanzen befallenden Rhizopus microspores (Partida-Martinez and Hartweck 2005; Moebius et al. 2014). Bei Sharma et al. (2008) wurde erstemals gezeigt, dass auch der endophytische Sebacinaleen Pilz Piriformospora indica Wirt eines Endobakteriums ist. Dieses wurde als Rhizobium radiobacter (syn.
