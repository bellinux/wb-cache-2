40|$|An {{automated}} methane/total <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analyzer</b> is presented, {{which can}} produce alternate methane/total hydrocarbon measurements every 7 seconds {{to provide the}} spatial resolution required for regional hydrocarbon measurements at aircraft speeds. The construction and sampling techniques developed for the aircraft mounted system are discussed. A technique to periodically measure atmosphere oxygen is incorporated into the analyzer to ensure accurate hydrocarbon measurements, and a data collection methodology is developed to minimize errors resulting from changes in flame ionization detector sensitivity at different altitudes. Aircraft data acquired at the 1979 Southeastern Virginia Urban Plume Study are also presented, which illustrate {{the application of the}} instrument to a troposphere pollution plume...|$|E
40|$|A {{chemiluminescence}} analyzer {{has been}} constructed that {{takes advantage of}} the temperature dependence of the ozone-hydrocarbon reaction. When operated at a temperature of 170 C, the analyzer functions as a total nonmethane <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analyzer</b> with sensitivities 10 [...] 1, 000 times better than a conventional FID. However, with operation at varying temperatures, the chemiluminescent signal reflects the differences in rates of reaction of the hydrocarbons with ozone. Preliminary studies at room temperature indicated that the relative rates of reaction of isoprene, {alpha}-pinene, {beta}-pinene, and limonene with ozone correlated with the observed chemiluminescence signal. When hydrocarbons are grouped in classes of similar structure, their rates of reaction with electrophilic atmospheric oxidants (e. g., OH, O{sub 3 }, NO{sub 3 }) can be correlated with each other. By varying the temperature of the reaction chamber, the chemiluminescence analyzer can be tuned to more reactive classes of hydrocarbons. Therefore, the chemiluminescence analyzer has the ability to determine atmospheric hydrocarbon concentrations as a function of class and will also provide a measure of the atmospheric reactivity of the hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in July of 1999 the USEPA SITE Program {{began its}} {{evaluation}} of field methods for {{the determination of}} Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in soil. This was an ambitious project involving developing a working definition of TPH {{and the development of}} a reference method to measure TPH according to the definition. i One of the methods selected for inclusion in the evaluation was SW- 846 Method 9074, the commercial version of this method is the PetroFLAG <b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>Analyzer.</b> During the field trial 181 samples and 10 extract duplicates were analyzed in the field. The samples were also analyzed by a reference lab using Method 3540 C modified to use methylene chloride as the solvent followed by Method 8015 B modified to include heavier hydrocarbons up to C- 40. The samples included soil samples from four different sites, soil PE samples for weathered gasoline and diesel fuel containing different amounts of water as well as possible interferences and liquid samples of different hydrocarbon types and possible interferences. This paper analyzes the performance of the PetroFLAG system in the SITE trials. Based on the final data, the PetroFLAG System did very well. The PetroFLAG System correctly identified all of the samples contaminated above the specified action levels and was the only technology to produce no false negatives. The recovery on PE samples was better than the lab method, e. g., PetroFLAG average recovery was 104 % for the standard extraction and 82 % overall- including the high range solvent system and dilution step- the recovery for the reference lab was 67 % based on PE certified values. The PetroFLAG precision was the same as the reference lab and the correlation with the lab, for all field samples, was the highest of all the technologies tested, with an R 2 of 0. 972...|$|E
40|$|The {{project has}} {{received}} {{funding from the}} European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 636930. The availability of accurate and fast <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analyzers,</b> capable of real-time operation while enabling feedback-loops, {{would lead to a}} paradigm change in the petro-chemical industry. Primarily gas chromatographs measure the composition of hydrocarbon process streams. Due to sophisticated gas sampling, these analyzers are limited in response time. As hydrocarbons absorb in the mid-infrared spectral range, the employment of fast spectroscopic systems is highly attractive due to significantly reduced maintenance costs and the capability to setup real-time process control. New developments in mid-infrared laser systems pave the way for the development of high-performance analyzers provided that accurate spectral models are available for multi-species detection. In order to overcome current deficiencies in the availability of spectroscopic data, we developed a laser-based setup covering the 6 – 11 μm wavelength range. The presented system is designated as laboratory reference system. Its spectral accuracy is at least 6. 6 × 10 − 3 cm− 1 with a precision of 3 × 10 − 3 cm− 1. With a “per point” minimum detectable absorption of 1. 3 × 10 − 3 cm− 1 Hz− 1 / 2 it allows us to perform systematic measurements of hydrocarbon spectra of the first 7 alkanes under conditions which are not tabulated in spectroscopic database. We exemplify the system performance with measured direct absorption spectra of methane, propane, iso-butane, and a mixture of methane and propane. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a {{continuing}} effort to develop a comprehensive compartment fire database for validation of numerical fire modeling is presented. Natural gas fires were conducted inside a full-scale ISO 9705 room and are compared with previous results obtained in a 2 / 5 scale, reduced-scale enclosure. In these experiments, fires with heat release rates as large as 2. 7 MW were used in the full-scale room. Gas species and temperature measurements were made inside the room at several locations in the upper layer and the doorway. Oxygen, CO/CO 2, and total <b>hydrocarbon</b> gas <b>analyzers</b> were used in addition to gas chromatography to make gas species measurements. Temperature measurements were made in the upper layer of the room using aspirated thermocouples. Fires as large as 2. 7 MW were observed not to produce underventilated compartment fire conditions in the full-scale enclosure despite the large heat release rate and temperatures observed in excess of 1200 °C. A comparison of the gas species in the upper layer of the reduced-scale and full-scale results showed similarities in terms of the gas species volume fractions when plotted as a function of mixture fraction, but the temperature results showed that the full-scale enclosure was reaching higher temperatures than the reduced-scale enclosure...|$|R
40|$|In the South of Italy, it {{is common}} for farmers to burn pruning waste from olive trees in spring. In order to {{evaluate}} the impact of the biomass burning source on the physical and chemical characteristics of the particulate matter (PM) emitted by these fires, a PM monitoring campaign was carried out in an olive grove. Daily PM 10 samples were collected for 1 week, when there were no open fires, and when biomass was being burned, and at two different distances from the fires. Moreover, an optical particle counter and a polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> (PAH) <b>analyzer</b> were used to measure the high time-resolved dimensional distribution of particles emitted and total PAHs concentrations, respectively. Chemical analysis of PM 10 samples identified organic and inorganic components such as PAHs, ions, elements, and carbonaceous fractions (OC, EC). Analysis of the collected data showed the usefulness of organic and inorganic tracer species and of PAH diagnostic ratios for interpreting the impact of biomass fires on PM levels and on its chemical composition. Finally, high time-resolved monitoring of particle numbers and PAH concentrations was performed before, during, and after biomass burning, and these concentrations were seen to be very dependent on factors such as weather conditions, combustion efficiency, and temperature (smoldering versus flaming conditions), and moisture content of the wood burned...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, {{including}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), from broiler houses {{located in the}} southeastern United States were continuously monitored over a one-year period. The birds were grown to 52 days of age at an average stocking density of 11. 8 birds/m 2 (1. 1 birds/ft 2). Methane and CO 2 emissions were measured in two broiler houses while N 2 O emissions were measured in one house. Carbon dioxide and N 2 O concentrations were measured using a photoacoustic multi-gas analyzer and CH 4 concentrations were measured using a dual-channel methane/non-methane-hydrocarbon (NMHC) /total <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analyzer</b> with dual flame ionization detectors. Ventilation rates in each house were continuously calculated by monitoring the building static pressure and operational status of all ventilation fans in conjunction with individual fan performance curves developed and verified in situ using a Fan Assessment Numeration System (FANS) unit. Annual CO 2 emissions measured from the two broiler houses averaged 606 Mg (668 US tons) per house. On a marketed bird basis the CO 2 emissions averaged 4. 64 Mg (5. 49 US tons) per 1, 000 birds marketed. Annual CH 4 emissions averaged 445 kg (982 lbs) per house, or 3. 41 kg (7. 52 lbs) per 1, 000 birds marketed. Annual N 2 O emissions measured from one broiler house was 225 kg (496 lbs) per house, or 1. 72 kg (3. 8 lbs) per 1, 000 birds marketed. The CO 2 equivalents of the CH 4 and N 2 O emissions were, respectively, 85. 3 kg (188 lb) and 512. 6 kg (1, 128 lb) per 1, 000 birds marketed. Hence the total CO 2 equivalent GHG emissions for the broiler operations monitored {{in this study were}} 5. 238 Mg per 1, 000 birds marketed, with 88. 6 % contributed by CO 2...|$|E
40|$|A screen heater with a gas sweep was {{developed}} and applied to study the pyrolysis kinetics of low density polyethene (LDPE) and polypropene (PP) at temperatures ranging from 450 to 530 °C. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the applicability of screen heaters to measure these kinetics. On-line measurement of the rate of volatiles formation using a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analyzer</b> was applied to enable the determination of the conversion rate over the entire conversion range on the basis of a single experiment. Another important feature of the screen heater used in this study is the possibility to measure pyrolysis kinetics under nearly isothermal conditions. The influence of the mixing process in the gas phase on the measured hydrocarbon concentration versus time curve was assessed and it was demonstrated that the residence time distribution of the gas phase, which has to be accounted for to correctly interpret the experiments, becomes the limiting factor when measuring pyrolysis kinetics at high temperatures and not the heat transfer rate. With this type of apparatus, pyrolysis reactions with a first order rate constant lower than 2 s- 1 can be studied, which implies that the pyrolysis kinetics of the forementioned polymers could be determined at temperatures below 530 °C. The kinetic constants for LDPE and PP pyrolysis were determined, using a first order model to describe the conversion rate in the 70 - 90 % conversion range and the random chain dissociation model for the entire conversion range. Our experiments revealed that both LDPE and PP posses the same conversion rate, which is unexpected behavior since PP should be more sensitive to thermal degradation than LDPE. A comparison of the thermo gravimetric analyzer results with those obtained with the screen heater indicates an enhancement of the pyrolysis kinetics in the latter equipment. Several hypothesis were tested to explain this phenomenon and led to the suspicion that the discrepancy is possibly due to the effect of the electrical current passing through the screen on the pyrolysis reaction, although most of the evidence for this hypothesis is indirect. Screen heaters can therefore not be used in this configuration to measure the pyrolysis kinetics, if this hypothesis is correct. In addition to the experimental work two single particle models have been developed which both incorporate a mass and a (coupled) enthalpy balance, which were used to assess the influence of internal and external heat transfer processes on the pyrolysis process. The first model assumes a variable density and constant volume during the pyrolysis process, whereas the second model assumes a constant density and a variable volume. An important feature of these models is that they can accommodate kinetic models for which no analytical representation of the pyrolysis kinetics is available. Model calculations revealed that heat transfer limitations were not important during the pyrolysis experiments performed in the screen heater and could not explain the forementioned results...|$|E
