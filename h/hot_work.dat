The two were not charged with the felony of actually started the fire, but instead with the misdemeanor of not obtaining the proper permit for <b>hot</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
25|$|In pre-contact Tonga, {{women did}} not do the cooking (cooking in an earth oven was hard, <b>hot</b> <b>work,</b> the {{province}} of men) or work in the fields. They raised children, gathered shellfish on the reef, and made koloa, barkcloth and mats, which were a traditional form of wealth exchanged at marriages and other ceremonial occasions. An industrious woman thus raised the social status of her household. Her family also slept soundly, on the piles of mats and barkcloth that were the traditional bedding. On sunny days, these were spread on the grass to air, which prolonged their life.|$|E

2500|$|Swaging (...) is a forging {{process in}} which the {{dimensions}} of an item are altered using dies into which the item is forced. Swaging is usually a cold working process, but also may be <b>hot</b> <b>worked.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{is usually}} {{categorized}} in [...] "hot" [...] work permits and [...] "cold" [...] <b>work</b> permits. <b>Hot</b> <b>works</b> are those {{where there is}} a potential of generating fire or extreme heat, cold ones are all the others.|$|R
25|$|Pump-Type water {{consists}} of a - or 5-gallon non-pressurized metal or plastic container with a pump mounted to it, and a discharge hose and nozzle. Pump type water extinguishers are often used where freezing conditions may occur, {{as they can be}} economically freeze-protected with calcium chloride (except stainless steel models), such as barns, out buildings and unheated warehouses. They are also useful where many, frequent spot fires may occur, such as during fire watch for <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> operations. They are dependent on the user's strength to produce a decent discharge stream for firefighting. Water and antifreeze are the most common, but loaded stream and foam designs were made in the past. Backback models exist for wildland firefighting, and may be solid material such as metal or fiberglass, or collapsible vinyl or rubber bags for ease of storage.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the basis}} of witness evidence, the joint {{investigation}} team considered it unlikely that the fire {{was caused by the}} <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> (welding) that was being carried out as part of the renovation or by carelessly discarded smokers' materials. No one had visited this part of the ship since work stopped on Friday evening, and it was considered unlikely that a fire could have smouldered all weekend before finally breaking out Monday morning. [...] However, it was discovered that although all <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> was supposed to be recorded and someone was supposed to check afterwards to ensure of no fires, there was no record that such checks had ever been made, and on at least one occasion <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> had been conducted with no records made.|$|E
2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|E

50|$|Monel 404 can be welded using common welding {{techniques}} and forged but cannot be <b>hot</b> <b>worked.</b> Cold working may be done using standard tooling and soft die materials for better finish. It {{is covered by}} standards UNS N04404 and ASTM F96. This alloy {{is used in the}} following applications: capsules for transistors and ceramic to metal sealings.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{the initial}} {{workpiece}} that is <b>hot</b> <b>worked</b> was originally cast. The microstructure of cast items does not optimize the engineering properties, from a microstructure standpoint. Hot working improves the engineering {{properties of the}} workpiece because it replaces the microstructure with one that has fine spherical shaped grains. These grains increase the strength, ductility, and toughness of the material.|$|R
2500|$|Puddling {{produced}} a structural grade iron {{at a relatively}} low cost. Puddling was a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation as the iron was manually stirred using a long rod. [...] The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler. [...] When the glob was large enough the puddler would remove it. [...] Puddling was backbreaking and extremely <b>hot</b> <b>work.</b> [...] Few puddlers lived to be 40. [...] Puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, allowing coal or coke {{to be used as}} fuel. [...] The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel. [...] Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart led a {{detachment}} of his regiment at the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777. As Greene's wing advanced on the British positions, Stewart's unit covered Weedon's left flank where a gap had developed between that brigade and Alexander McDougall's Connecticut Brigade. After driving off two British light infantry companies, his men captured an earthwork near Luken's Mill. He wrote Gates, [...] "I {{took a little}} redoubt with three Pieces of Cannon from them". He noted that, [...] "It was cursed <b>Hot</b> <b>work</b> for it before they left them". He noted that his men started fighting [...] from Germantown and penetrated the British lines {{as far as the}} Market House. Another officer recalled that the Pennsylvania State Regiment had overcome all resistance in its front. When it was attacked on its left and rear, [...] "Gen. Steven [...] ordered Col. Stewart to evacuate the ground". On 12 November 1777, the regiment was renamed the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment.|$|E
