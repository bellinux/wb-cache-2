2500|$|A new and {{short-lived}} {{option for}} 1970 was the vacuum operated exhaust (VOE), which was vacuum actuated via an underdash lever marked [...] "exhaust". The VOE {{was designed to}} reduce <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> and to increase power and performance, but it also substantially increased exhaust noise. The VOE option was offered from November 1969 to January 1970. Pontiac management was ordered to cancel the VOE option by GM's upper management following a TV commercial for the GTO that aired during Super Bowl IV on CBS January 11, 1970.

That particular commercial was also cancelled by order of GM management. Approximately 233 1970 GTOs were factory built with this rare option including 212 hardtop coupes and 21 convertbiles, all were [...] "YS" [...] 400ci 350hp with either four-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions.

50|$|All 640i models get {{exclusive}} {{features as}} well. All facelifted BMW 640i models have a Sports Exhaust System, {{which features a}} switchable exhaust valve and can be adjusted via the 'Driving Experience Control Switch'. This means that whenever the car is in the SPORT or SPORT+ mode, the valve opens {{in order to reduce}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure,</b> and thus generates a 'dramatic' and aural response. The engine management system also allows further acoustic optimisations including Dynamic Load-Reversal Damping. Also, all facelifted BMW 640i models burn 0.2litres less fuel per 100km than its pre-facelift model.|$|E
5000|$|Exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR), on diesel engines, {{can be used}} to achieve a richer fuel to air mixture and a lower peak combustion temperature. Both effects reduce NOx emissions, but can negatively impact efficiency and the production of soot particles. The richer mix is achieved by displacing some of the intake air, but is still lean compared to petrol engines, which approach the stoichiometric ideal. The lower peak temperature is achieved by a heat exchanger that removes heat before re-entering the engine, and works due to the exhaust gases' higher specific heat capacity than air. With the greater soot production, EGR is often combined with a particulate matter (PM) filter in the exhaust. In turbocharged engines, EGR needs a controlled pressure differential across the exhaust manifold and intake manifold, which can be met by such engineering as use of a variable geometry turbocharger, which has inlet guide vanes on the turbine to build <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> in the exhaust manifold directing exhaust gas to the intake manifold. It also requires additional external piping and valving, and so requires additional maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Even with an {{electronic}} controller, actuator springs that are too soft can cause the wastegate to open before desired. <b>Exhaust</b> gas <b>backpressure</b> is still pushing against the wastegate valve itself. This backpressure can overcome the spring pressure {{without the aid of}} the actuator at all. Electronic control may still enable control of boost to over double gauge pressure of the spring's rated pressure.|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} {{version of}} the SL 65 AMG was unveiled in Monterey in 2008. The turbochargers are 12% larger, and the optimised wastegate ducts permit increased air throughout. Intake air ducting and exhaust system are modified to improve response and reduce the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>backpressure.</b> The Black Series is 250 kg lighter than regular SL 65 AMG {{by the use of}} light carbon fibre composites (CFRP) parts and the omission of the SL's normal foldable hardtop roof, replacing it with a fixed roof. Not only did this save weight, it also made room available for the retractable rear spoiler.|$|R
5000|$|The Callaway dual <b>exhaust</b> {{had reduced}} <b>backpressure</b> and {{was similar to}} the dual exhaust that all NAS Range Rovers got in the 2000 model year. Changes to the exhaust system were made {{rearward}} of the catalyst [...] "Y" [...] pipe. The <b>exhaust</b> system <b>backpressure</b> was reduced by 43 percent, and the interior sound level in the passenger cabin was virtually unchanged. The center silencer provides reduced backpressure and is constructed from stainless steel. A twin tail pipe system was selected to provide a performance look and sound. The straight exit twin outlets are accented by T-304 stainless steel resonator tips to visually differentiate the Callaway 4.6 HSE from other Range Rovers. The pipes are welded onto the stock mufflers, and the rear bumper has cutouts for the tailpipes like it had in 1995 and 1996 (the stock single muffler pointed down, and the rear bumper did not have any cutout on the 1997, 1998 and non-Callaway 1999 Range Rovers).<>The exterior of the Callaway 4.6 HSE Range Rover had painted body color components. The exterior components painted to match the body color are, the Entire Front Bumper cover, the Front Grill, Left and Right Headlamp trim, Left and Right Door Mirror Casings, Rear Bumper including area with Exhaust Tip Openings ...|$|R

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the end-gas condition was attempted by applying a refined method of analysis to experimental results. The results are compared with those obtained in Technical Report no. 655. The experimental technique employed afforded excellent control over the engine variables and unusual cyclic reproducibility. This, {{in conjunction with the}} new analysis, made possible the {{determination of the}} state of the end-gas at any instant to a fair degree of precision. Results showed that for any given maximum pressure the maximum permissible end-gas temperature increased as the fuel-air ratio was increased.

40|$|Turbocharged (TC) spark-ignited (SI) {{engines are}} popular as they combine high power output with good fuel economy. Furthermore, their {{emissions}} can be successfully reduced using a {{three way catalyst}} (TWC) provided that the airfuel ratio is precisely controlled. As the air-fuel ratio depends on the precision of the air charge estimate, this thesis {{is devoted to the}} systematic improvement of the cylinder air charge (CAC) estimation on TC SI engines. A second objective is to provide the design engineer with a flexible framework for CAC estimation that easily can be adapted to various engines. The CAC is not measurable and it is therefore estimated using a model. Part I concentrates on stationary conditions and examines existing air charge estimation methods using engine experiments where the wastegate is opened and closed. Measurements show that the existing methods are insufficient for TC SI engines since the CAC depends on <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> and charge cooling from evaporating fuel.

40|$|Approximately 30 % of {{the energy}} from an {{internal}} combustion engine is rejected as heat in the exhaust gases. An inverted Brayton cycle (IBC) is one potential means of recovering some of this energy, {{in order to improve}} the overall system efficiency. When a fuel is burnt, water and CO 2 are produced and expelled as part of the exhaust gases. In an IBC, in order to reduce compression work, the exhaust gases are cooled before compression up to ambient pressure. If coolant with a low enough temperature is available, it is possible to condense some of the water out of the exhaust gases, further reducing compressor work. In this study the condensation of exhaust gas water is studied. The results show that the IBC can produce about 50 kW/kg/s for the conditions investigated. The main factors that influence the power output are heat exchanger pressure drop, turbine expansion ratio and coolant temperature. A lower coolant temperature significantly increases power output, particularly when condensation occurs. Larger turbine expansion ratios produce more power and slightly lower the temperature at which condensation onset occurs. The system is very sensitive to heat exchanger pressure drop, as larger pressure drops increase the compressor pressure ratio whilst leaving the turbine expansion ratio unchanged. Higher turbine inlet pressures can also increase net power, but the higher <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressures</b> pressures may increase engine pumping losses. Finally, for conditions when condensation is possible, the water content of the exhaust gas has a significant influence on power output. The hydrogen to carbon ratio of the fuel has the most potential to vary the water content and hence the power generated by the system. If there is no condensation, water content has a small impact on performance. The effect on power in the condensing region is predominantly due to reduced mass flow in the compressor...|$|R
50|$|The 1991 512 TR had an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} engine used in the Testarossa, maintaining the same cubic capacity of 4.9 L, and had factory type reference number F113D. Changes {{were made to the}} porting, with redesigned inlet plenums and larger valves providing more efficient fuel/air mix ingress, whilst the fuel injection and ignition system were changed to a combined Bosch Motronic M2.7 system. For the 1994 F512M the engine was further upgraded with a lightened crankshaft, titanium alloy connecting rods, new pistons and a stainless steel low <b>backpressure</b> <b>exhaust</b> system.|$|R
40|$|The use of biodiesels is an {{effective}} way to limit greenhouse emissions and partly limit the dependence on fossil primary sources. Biodiesel fuels also show interesting features in terms of PM-NOx emissions trade-off that appears more favorable toward an optimized control of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). In fact, the DPF, which is the assessed aftertreatment technology to reduce PM emissions below the limits, suffers from fuel consumption penalization or excessive <b>exhaust</b> system <b>backpressure,</b> {{as a function of the}} frequency of the regeneration process. On the other side, issues such as the impact of the higher ash content of biodiesel on the DPF performance have also to be better understood. In the given scenario, an experimental study on a DEUTZ 4 L off-road Diesel engine coupled to a DOC-DPF (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst-Diesel Particulate Filter) system is proposed in this paper. Experimental data have been gathered at the engine test bench of the University of Rome Tor Vergata to validate a model of the DPF, including ash related effects, and by adding a special sampling unit to collect particles. To that final aim, collected particulate has been examined via an experimental TGA (Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis) to measure ash content of particles emitted with B 30 distilled biodiesel blend from Waste Cooking Oil (WCO), and compare it with a commercially available fossil fuel (B 06). The multiple effects, in terms of lower regeneration activation energy, lower PM emissions and higher ash content, have been analyzed under repeated equivalent Non Road Transient Cycles (NRTCs), proving that the positive effects more than counterbalance the negative ones while using the B 30 fuel...|$|R
40|$|Aftertreatment {{devices are}} {{commonly}} used in diesel engine systems for emission control. To ensure the proper function of the aftertreatment devices, it is often necessary to inject additional fuel or a reducing agent into the exhaust flow. The conditions in the exhaust flow {{are affected by the}} exhaust pressure wave, caused by the reciprocating movement of the piston and valves. Therefore, this research investigates the factors that affect the exhaust pressure wave and the consequent impacts of this wave on a liquid spray. First, the exhaust pressure wave action was studied experimentally on a single cylinder diesel engine at various engine operating conditions such as different load, EGR, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> levels. Then, the gas flow velocity in the exhaust system was estimated with the simulation tool AVL BOOST. A stand-alone shock tube was used to create a condition comparable to the exhaust flow. The impacts of the pressure wave and the gas flow on the aftertreatment spray distribution and the droplet breakup were studied via optical methods...|$|E
40|$|An {{accelerated}} {{durability test}} method determined {{the potential impact}} of biodiesel ash impurities, including engine testing with multiple diesel particulate filter substrate types, as well as diesel oxidation catalyst and selective catalyst reduction catalysts. The results showed no significant degradation in the thermo-mechanical properties of a DPF after exposure to 150, 000 -mile equivalent biodiesel ash and thermal aging. However, exposure to 435, 000 -mile equivalent aging resulted in a 69 % decrease in thermal shock resistance. A decrease in DOC activity was seen after exposure to 150, 000 -mile equivalent aging, resulting in higher hydrocarbon slip and a reduction in NO 2 formation. The SCR catalyst experienced a slight loss in activity after exposure to 435, 000 -mile equivalent aging. The SCR catalyst, placed downstream of the DPF and exposed to B 20 exhaust suffered a 5 % reduction in overall NOx conversion activity over the HDDT test cycle. It is estimated that the additional ash from 150, 000 miles of biodiesel use would also result in a moderate increases in <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> for a DPF. The {{results of this study suggest}} that long-term operation with B 20 at the current specification limits for alkali and alkaline earth metal impurities will adversely impact the performance of DOC, DPF and SCR systems...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} among young vehicle owners {{to modify the}} exhaust system of their vehicle to reduce <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> with {{the perception that the}} output power increases. In the process of backpressure reduction, the output noise (Whakapau) of the vehicle also increases correspondingly. The conflict of interest that arises from modified vehicle exhaust systems and the general public is well publicised. This prototype was designed {{to meet the demands of}} exhaust back pressure reduction while at the same time mitigate the sound output of the vehicle. The design involves lining a cylindrical pipe with common glass marbles which is normally used for playing. The marbles are made of a sustainable material as it does not erode when exposed to exhaust gases and it is easily recycled. The prototype muffler is much smaller in size when compared to conventional mufflers. All tests were done in a simulated controlled environment and data collated using approved New Zealand Transport Agency testing regime. It has to be noted that the test focus was noise mitigation and not comprehensive engine performance testing. The results of the test prove a reduction of sound levels, however more testing needs to be undertaken with varying annulus depth, marble sizes and arrangements and engine load...|$|E
40|$|Mondi Dynäs is a {{pulp and}} paper {{producer}} {{in the north of}} Sweden close to the town Kramfors. Last year Mondi Dynäs produced 231, 404 tons of Kraft paper. In order to increase their production to 300, 000 tons of paper per year this study was done in order to investigate how the increased biomass flow would affect the generation of steam along with the steam and condensate balance. This study started with a mapping of the current steam and condensate balance for one winter period January – Mars and one summer period July – September 2015. The resulting balance is used as reference period {{for the development of the}} future steam and condensate scenario where Mondi Dynäs will achieve the targeted production of 300, 000 tons of paper per year. The future model shows that the future production of paper will give an abundance of biomass since the generation of steam will be more than sufficient. For the winter period the venting of steam over roof could be derived to 11. 9 tons per hour and 34. 4 tons per hour during the summer period. This can be compared to the current situation where the winter period gave an average steam blow out of 8. 7 tons per hour and for the summer period 13. 1 tons per hour. To utilize the accumulated energy from these energy streams, three different scenarios was studied. The first scenario were a future installation of a backpressure turbine along with a condensing turbine section. The new turbine would be attached to the highest pressure level at 65. 5 bar and have a <b>backpressure</b> <b>exhaust</b> at 20 bar which will give a power of 7. 6 MWe. The second scenario included the implementation of a new condensing turbine with the current system design for the steam network and boilers. This turbine would be attached to the 3. 5 bar network and give the electricity power of 1. 9 MWe. The third scenario included the installation of a new bark dryer. This would give Mondi Dynäs the possibility to sell bark to an external actor on the energy market. From derived figures in the future scenario model it would be possible to sell 108, 144 MWh of bark while running the bark boiler. Mondi Dynäs AB is recommended to add a new condensing turbine to their steam network. The new turbine would be able to produce 1. 9 MWe and need a cooling water flow of 190 tons of water per hour.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} a Variable Geometry Turbine at low massflow rates the vaneless space of the vanes is reduced. It is researched if this modification can reduce turbo lag. A turbine with modified vane ring is installed in the exhaust of a naturally aspirated engine and wide open throttle accelerations are performed to test the turbine performance. The new (reduced vaneless space) vane configuration induced a lower <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> which allowed the engine to accelerate faster. The acceleration from 1500 to 3000 RPM was an average of 8 % faster for the new vane configuration. This in turn increased the massflow rate through the turbine which caused the power available to the turbine to be similar in compared vane rings. The initial turbine speeds was lower for the new vane configuration but it quickly {{caught up with the}} conventional configuration because the turbine acceleration was higher. The turbine efficiency was higher for the new vane configuration in most cases. The mean increase in turbine efficiency during the initial acceleration was 4 %. The turbine efficiency {{at the end of the}} acceleration was similar for both vane configurations. These experiments indicate that it is probable that decreasing the vaneless space in a variable geometry turbine will increase turbine performance during vehicle acceleration...|$|E
40|$|Gasoline {{consumption}} and pollutant emissions from transportation are costly and have serious, demonstrated environmental and health impacts. Downsized, turbocharged direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) gasoline engines consume less fuel and achieve superior performance compared with conventional port fuel injected spark ignition (PFI-SI) engines. Although more efficient, turbocharged DISI engines have new emissions challenges during cold start. DISI fuel injection delivers more liquid fuel into the combustion chamber, increasing the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons. The turbocharger slows down activation (warm-up) of the catalytic exhaust after-treatment system. The {{objective of this}} research is to find a control strategy that: 1. Accelerates warm-up of the catalyst, and 2. Maintains low emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (UBHCs) during the catalyst warm-up process. This research includes a broad experimental survey of engine behaviour and emission response for a modern turbocharged DISI engine. The study focuses on the idle period during cold-start for which DISI engine emissions are worst. Engine experiments and simulations show that late and slow combustion lead to high exhaust gas temperatures and mass flow rate for fast warm-up. However, late and slow combustion increase the risk of partial-burn misfire. At the misfire limit for each parameter, the following conclusions are drawn: 1. Late ignition timing is {{the most effective way to}} increase exhaust enthalpy flow rate for fast catalyst warm-up. 2. By creating a favourable spatial fuel-air mixture stratification, split fuel injection can simultaneously retard and stabilize combustion to improve emissions and prevent partial-burn misfire. 3. Excessive trapped residuals from long valve overlap limit the potential for valve timing to reduce cold-start emissions. 4. Despite their more challenging evaporation characteristics, fuel blends with high ethanol content showed reasonable emissions behaviour and greater tolerance to late combustion than neat gasoline. 5. Higher exhaust back-pressure leads to high exhaust temperature during the exhaust stroke, leading to significantly more post-flame oxidation. 6. Post-flame oxidation in the combustion chamber and exhaust system play a critical role in decreasing the quantity of catalyst-in emissions due to hydrocarbons that escape primary (flame) combustion. A cold start strategy combining late ignition, 15 % excess air, and high <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> yielded the lowest cumulative hydrocarbon emissions during cold start. by Kevin David Cedrone.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and sealed with bulkheads against leakage. The isolated zone was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the isolated zone for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the isolated zone, at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or exhaust end of the isolated zone. The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the exhaust end of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using raw exhaust instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel Diagnostic Link (DDDL) and from <b>exhaust</b> <b>backpressure</b> and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the DPF systems...|$|E
