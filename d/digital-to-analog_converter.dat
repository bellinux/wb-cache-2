5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often {{used in conjunction with}} a <b>digital-to-analog</b> <b>converter</b> (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E
5|$|Spurious {{products}} {{are the result}} of harmonic or non-harmonic distortion {{in the creation of the}} output waveform due to non-linear numerical effects in the signal processing chain. Only numerical errors are covered here.

5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} <b>digital-to-analog</b> <b>converter</b> or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, {{but it is important to}} distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E

For this kind of applications, the traditional static performance requirements do not apply. Dynamic performance is of the greatest importance. This paper discusses the aspects of the dynamic performance of <b>digital-to-analog</b> <b>converters</b> and models the influence of non-idealities of circuit components (such as output impedance, mismatch, circuit noise, etc.) on the dynamic performance.

25|$|In modern radio systems, {{modulated}} {{signals are}} generated via {{digital signal processing}} (DSP). With DSP many types of AM are possible with software control (including DSB with carrier, SSB suppressed-carrier and independent sideband, or ISB). Calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with a <b>digital-to-analog</b> <b>converter,</b> typically at a frequency less than the desired RF-output frequency. The analog signal must then be shifted in frequency and linearly amplified to the desired frequency and power level (linear amplification must be used to prevent modulation distortion).|$|E

In 1984, former YMO member Haruomi Hosono released an album produced entirely from Namco arcade game samples entitled Video Game Music, an early example of a chiptune record and the first video game music album. The record featured the work of Namco's chiptune composers: Toshio Kai (Pac-Man in 1980), Nobuyuki Ohnogi (Galaga, New Rally-X and Bosconian in 1981, and Pole Position in 1982), and Yuriko Keino (Dig Dug and Xevious in 1982).|$|E

25|$|Chiptune music {{began to}} appear with the video game music {{produced}} during {{the golden age of}} video arcade games. An early example was the opening tune in Tomohiro Nishikado's arcade game Gun Fight (1975). The first video game to use a continuous background soundtrack was Tomohiro Nishikado's 1978 release Space Invaders, which had four simple chromatic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and interacted with the player, increasing pace as the enemies descended on the player. The first video game to feature continuous melodic background music was Rally-X, an arcade game released by Namco in 1980, featuring a simple tune that repeats continuously during gameplay. It {{was also one of the}} earliest games to use a <b>digital-to-analog</b> <b>converter</b> to produce sampled sounds. That same year, the first video game to feature speech synthesis was also released, Sunsoft's shoot 'em up arcade game Stratovox.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of inexpensive {{digital signal processing}} electronics in the late 1970s and 1980s {{led to the development}} of the first digital delay effects. Initially, they were only available in expensive rack-mounted units but eventually as costs came down and the electronics grew smaller, they became available in the form of foot pedals. The first digital delay offered in a pedal was the Boss DD-2 in 1984. Rack-mounted delay units evolved into digital reverb units and on to digital multi-effects units capable of more sophisticated effects than pure delay, such as reverb and Audio timescale-pitch modification effects. Digital delay systems function by sampling the input signal through an analog-to-digital converter, after which the signal is passed through a series of digital signal processors that record it into a storage buffer, and then play back the stored audio based on parameters set by the user. The delayed ("wet") output may be mixed with the unmodified ("dry") signal after, or before, it is sent to a <b>digital-to-analog</b> <b>converter</b> for output.|$|E

2500|$|The first-order hold (FOH) is a {{mathematical}} model of the practical reconstruction of sampled signals {{that could be done}} by a conventional <b>digital-to-analog</b> <b>converter</b> (DAC) and an analog circuit called an integrator. [...] For the FOH, the signal is reconstructed as a piecewise linear approximation to the original signal that was sampled. [...] A mathematical model such as the FOH (or, more commonly, the zero-order hold) is necessary because, in the sampling and reconstruction theorem, a sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), representing the discrete samples, x(nT), is low-pass filtered to recover the original signal that was sampled, x(t). [...] However, outputting a sequence of Dirac impulses is impractical. Devices can be implemented, using a conventional DAC and some linear analog circuitry, to reconstruct the piecewise linear output for either the predictive or delayed FOH.|$|E
