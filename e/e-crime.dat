Police confiscated a Dell laptop and a 100-gigabyte hard drive that ran 16 different virtual machines.

40|$|<b>E-crimes</b> {{continue}} to generate grave {{challenges to the}} ICT regulatory agenda. Because <b>e-crimes</b> involve a wrongful appropriation of information online, it is enquired whether information is property which is capable of being stolen. This then requires an investigation {{to be made of}} the law of property. The basis for this scrutiny is to establish if information is property for purposes of the law. Following a study of the Roman-Dutch law approach to property, it is argued that the emergence of an information society makes real rights in information possible. This is the position because information is one of the indispensable assets of an information society. Given the fact that information can be the object of property, its position in the law of theft is investigated. This study is followed by an examination of the conventional risks that ICTs generate. For example, a risk exists that ICTs may be used as the object of <b>e-crimes.</b> Furthermore, there is a risk that ICTs may become a tool in order to appropriate information unlawfully. Accordingly, the scale and impact of <b>e-crimes</b> is more than those of the offline crimes, for example theft or fraud. The severe challenges that ICTs pose to an information society are likely to continue if clarity is not sought regarding: whether ICTs can be regulated or not, if ICTs can be regulated, how should an ICT regulatory framework be structured? A study of the law and regulation for regulatory purposes reveals that ICTs are spheres where regulations apply or should apply. However, better regulations are appropriate in dealing with the dynamics of these technologies. Smart-regulations, meta-regulations or reflexive regulations, self-regulations and co-regulations are concepts that support better regulations. Better regulations enjoin the regulatory industries, for example the state, businesses and computer users to be involved in establishing ICT regulations. These ICT regulations should specifically be in keeping with the existing e-authentication measures. Furthermore, the codes-based theory, the Danger or Artificial Immune Systems (the AIS) theory, the Systems theory and the Good Regulator Theorem ought to inform ICT regulations. The basis for all this should be to establish a holistic approach to e-authentication. This approach must conform to the Precautionary Approach to E-Authentication or PAEA. PAEA accepts the importance of legal rules in the ICT regulatory agenda. However, it argues that flexible regulations could provide a suitable framework within which ICTs and the ICT risks are controlled. In addition, PAEA submit that a state should not be the single role-player in ICT regulations. Social norms, the market and nature or architecture of the technology to be regulated are also fundamental to the ICT regulatory agenda. JurisprudenceLL. D...|$|R

This paper presents a new dynamic key generation scheme that facilitates a fraud prevention mechanism.

It also eliminates the need for storing a long-term shared key which makes the system insecure during transactions. We show that the new scheme is secure against various kinds of attacks.

40|$|Tanzania {{is among}} {{countries}} embarked upon {{the use of}} ICT for national development. One of the major challenges is cyber security, which if not dealt with; it results into undesirable adverse consequences. The research examines Tanzaniaâ€™s efforts in overcoming the challenges in a legal perspective and make necessary recommendations for drastic measures to be taken. Chapter one introduces the research work, giving the essence of personal data protection. The statement {{of the problem is}} that cyber security in Tanzania is poor to date despite the country indulging into the use of ICT as a fact of life. The background of the existing problem is identified as lack of relevant laws to match with <b>e-crimes</b> compelling law enforcers to use traditional laws. The governmentâ€™s hesitant behaviour is also a backdrop of the problem. The main objectives of the study are to critically examine the Tanzanian position on personal data protection and assessing the existing legal framework and the extent of cyber crime. The study is significant to point out the risks of failure to install a sound legal framework and recommend measures to be taken. Chapter two discusses personal data protection issues, nature of data, supply, processing, storage, its flow, control and its use. Chapter three covers research methodology which involved text books, statutes, journals, and other online materials plus personal interviews. Chapter four gives current status of cyber security in Tanzania resulting from the research. The status of cyber security in Tanzania is confirmed to be still poor for lack of the necessary legal framework. Personal data protection is absent putting privacy rights at a menace. Chapter six makes observations, recommendations and conclusions of the research work, recommending for radical measures for the Government to formulate a sound legal framework for information security and enact personal data protection law...|$|R

The Metropolitan Police is to help bridge the gap left by the disbandment of the NHTCU through an expansion of its Computer Unit and the formation of the Police Central <b>e-crime</b> Unit (PCeU), which will work closely with the new National Fraud Reporting Centre (NFRC) from 2009.|$|E
