5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E
25|$|Aged sixteen, {{he left to}} {{join the}} Portsmouth Borough Police, against his family's wishes. His mother and {{grandmother}} never approved of his career choice, seeing the police as unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> from an aspiring middle-class family; indeed, when his maternal aunt Emma Brown married Superintendent Samuel Bowles of the Hampshire Constabulary, she made him resign.|$|E
25|$|He had {{achieved}} nine victories {{by the end}} of April 1917, and took his tally to thirteen in May. On 13 May, he was promoted to acting Jasta leader, a prestigious honor <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> just turned 21. He was lightly wounded on 25 May though this did not prevent him shooting down a New Zealand air ace, Captain Alan Scott, on 28 May 1917.|$|E

50|$|Hagiwara married Ueda Ineko in 1919; {{they had}} two daughters, Yōko (1920-2005), and Akirako (b. 1922). Ineko deserted her family <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> in June 1929 and ran off to Hokkaidō and Sakutarō {{formally}} divorced her in October.|$|R
25|$|King Amlaíb {{granted the}} monks of Furness {{the right to}} elect the Bishop of the Isles, {{and it appears that}} Wimund was elected to the see during the time of Thurstan (II), Archbishop of York. Thurstan died in early 1140, so that Wimund became Bishop of the Isles in the period 1134–1140. This was a very rapid rise <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> of {{apparently}} obscure origins.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the mound was either raised for a woman or <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and a woman as {{the remains of a}} woman and boy were found. Hildebrand reburied most of the remains, so a new excavation will need to be undertaken before the controversy can be settled. What is quite certain is that the dead belonged to a royal dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Avitus {{followed}} {{a course of}} study typical <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> of his rank, including law. Before 421 {{he was sent to}} the powerful patricius Flavius Constantius (briefly Emperor in 421) to ask for a tax reduction for his own country; this embassy was successful. His relative Theodorus was hostage at the court of the King of Visigoths, Theodoric I. In 425/426 Avitus went and met him and the King, who let Avitus enter his own court. Here, around 439, Avitus met the son of Theodoric, Theodoric II, who later became King. Avitus inspired the young Theodoric to study Latin poets.|$|E
5000|$|Ichiko Sakurai, the series' main character, is a shy 30-something whose inner {{thoughts}} {{appear to}} readers {{as a board}} of five very different individuals. When she falls <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> at <b>a</b> drinking party, the board members fall into a panic.|$|R
50|$|The arcan ritual {{dance was}} <b>a</b> {{necessary}} condition <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> {{to be allowed}} to participate later on in a căluşari ritual dance. All of these requirements and means of organising the groups of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are related to the so-called Lex Antiqua Valachorum (the ancient Vlach law).|$|R
50|$|Although he {{had been}} elected only three years previously, Battley {{announced}} in June 1948 that he would stand down at the next general election to make way <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> or woman. He therefore did not contest the 1950 general election, and died two years later, after a long illness.|$|R
25|$|Palms {{represent}} additional advancement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who {{has stayed}} active in his unit after achieving {{the rank of}} Eagle Scout. A Palm is awarded when the Scout {{has been active in}} the unit for at least three months since attaining Eagle (or a previous Palm); has demonstrated Scout Spirit, leadership and ability; has earned five additional merit badges beyond those required for Eagle or the last Palm; and has taken part in a conference with his unit leader. Merit badges which the young man has earned before reaching Eagle Scout are acceptable to use towards earning Palms.|$|E
25|$|From 1965 to 1973, {{very few}} {{men in the}} US were convicted of burning their draft cards. Some 25,000 others went unpunished. Before 1965, the act of burning a draft card was already {{prohibited}} by US statute—the registrant was required to carry the card at all times, and any destruction of it was thus against the law. Also, it was entirely possible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> to destroy his draft card and still answer his country's call to service by appearing at an induction center and serving in the military. And {{it was possible for}} a registrant to faithfully keep his card on his person but fail to appear when called. The draft card was not {{an essential part of the}} government's ability to draft men into the military. Thus draft-card burning was an act of war resistance more than it was draft resistance.|$|E
25|$|Jack is {{sentenced to}} serving {{life in prison}} for the death of Peter, and Jennifer vows her eternal love for Jack every day. Jack breaks out of jail and takes Jen with him to evade police. They all are on the run for a while, until they join up with a circus. Jack becomes a laborer and Jen the {{assistant}} with Abby, their daughter. Abby strikes up a good friendship with the ringmaster's son. Eventually, Jack and Jennifer flee for Africa. While in Africa, Jennifer and Jack experience some problems with their relationship, especially when Jennifer falls <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> named Colin Murphy...whom she does not realize is Shawn Brady's nephew! She flees to Ireland with Abby, where she ends up getting herself in trouble, and then has to come back to Salem with Bo. Jack soon follows her, and the two move in together so they can look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushes Jack away and concentrates on relationships, first with Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack can't resist that certain something that has always been between them. They are remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.|$|E
5000|$|Much of Shirman's writing {{centers around}} her unrequited love <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> named Valery Marchikhin. She first met Marchikhin {{when she was}} in her late twenties, {{teaching}} creative writing to youths aged 13 to 15; he was her most promising student. She continued to correspond with him through the late 1930s.|$|R

50|$|In July 1927 he {{announced}} his decision to retire when Parliament was dissolved, stating that {{at the age of}} 75 he felt it was time to make way <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man.</b> In November 1928 month he was knocked down by a motorcycle while crossing the High Street in Birmingham, and suffered a broken ankle.|$|R
25|$|The series proper commences {{almost twenty}} years later in the Two Rivers, a near-forgotten {{district}} of the country of Andor. An Aes Sedai, Moiraine, and her Warder Lan, arrive {{in the village of}} Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths (Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, or Perrin Aybara) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend Egwene al'Vere. Nynaeve al'Meara, the village wise-woman, later joins them. Gleeman Thom Merrilin also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of Tar Valon. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the Seanchan, the descendants of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire. The Aes Sedai also become divided {{on how to deal with}} the Dragon Reborn.|$|E
500|$|In August 1914 the United Kingdom {{entered the}} First World War. Tolkien's {{relatives}} were shocked when he elected not to immediately {{volunteer for the}} British Army. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, [...] "In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> with too much imagination and little physical courage." ...|$|E
500|$|Few {{details of}} Shakespeare's {{sexuality}} are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, {{the first of}} their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love. The 26 so-called [...] "Dark Lady" [...] sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.|$|E
2500|$|At his 1895 trial, Oscar Wilde {{cited the}} example of David and Jonathan in support of [...] "the love that dare not speak its name": [...] "Such a great affection of <b>an</b> elder <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare." ...|$|R

500|$|L. Ron Hubbard was the {{inventor}} of Dianetics and founder of Scientology. Born in Tilden, Nebraska in March 1911, Hubbard grew up {{with his family in}} Helena, Montana. He was unusually well-traveled <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> of his time due to his father's frequent relocations in connection with his service in the United States Navy. He lived in a number of locations in the United States and traveled to Guam, the Philippines, China, and Japan. He enrolled at George Washington University in 1930 to study civil engineering, but dropped out in his second year. While at GWU, he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for fellow students which looms large in his official biography but was a flop according to contemporary accounts. He subsequently spent time in Puerto Rico panning for gold, before returning to the United States, marrying his pregnant girlfriend, and embarking on a career as a [...] "penny-a-word" [...] writer.|$|E
2500|$|Gladwell is a {{featured}} storyteller for the Moth Podcast. He tells a funny yet unfortunate {{story about}} how [...] "a well-intentioned wedding toast goes horribly awry <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> and his friends." [...] Gladwell has launched a new podcast, Revisionist History along with Panoply, the podcast network of The Slate Group.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, Bouazizi did {{not have}} the funds to bribe police {{officials}} to allow his street vending to continue. Similarly, two of Bouazizi's siblings accused authorities of attempting to extort money from their brother, and during an interview with Reuters, one of his sisters stated, [...] "What kind of repression do you imagine it takes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> to do this? A man who has to feed his family by buying goods on credit when they fine him...and take his goods. In Sidi Bouzid, those with no connections and no money for bribes are humiliated and insulted and not allowed to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{bought in}} the open market, with no favor shown. The firm has treated me liberally, but I may have to make room <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> by and by, and I had two boys to start. One at law, the other as surgeon; but they are only {{beginning}} to stand on their own feet, and it was a drain. What was left went into the Rain Bluff. I felt I was safe in a venture organized by us." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Wilde's definition, [...] "the {{love that}} dare not speak its name" [...] was: ....such a great affection of <b>an</b> elder <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man...</b> such as Plato made the very {{basis of his}} philosophy...It is that deep, spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect...There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it {{repeatedly}} exists between an elder and <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> when the elder man has intellect, and the <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{almost a}} {{necessity}} of existence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> healthy <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who has imagination {{and a warm}} heart. It was all--or nearly all--quite superficial.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1829, Tennyson {{was awarded}} the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge {{for one of his}} first pieces, [...] "Timbuktu". Reportedly, [...] "it was thought to be no slight honour <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> of twenty to win the chancellor's gold medal". He {{published}} his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. [...] "Claribel" [...] and [...] "Mariana", which later took their place among Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 December 2008, Shalit {{was named}} an honorary citizen of Paris, France, after Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoë and the City Council {{unanimously}} voted {{to give the}} title to Shalit. The group Collective Freedom for Gilad praised the decision, stating [...] "it is with immense joy that we have welcomed the news, which shows how well the French state is mobilized at every level {{to make it possible}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> to regain his freedom and family". The French town of Raincy also named Shalit an honorary citizen, and the Grenoble City Hall hung his photo on their building facade the week of 10 December 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Ordaining as a monk, {{even for}} a short period, is seen as having many virtues. [...] In many Southeast Asian cultures, {{it is seen as}} a means <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> to [...] "repay" [...] his parents for their work and effort in raising him, because the merit from his {{ordination}} accrues to them as well. [...] Thai men who have ordained as a monk may be seen as more fit husbands by Thai women, who refer to men who have served as monks with a colloquial term meaning [...] "ripe" [...] to indicate that they are more mature and ready for marriage. [...] Particularly in rural areas, temporary ordination of boys and young men traditionally gave peasant boys an opportunity to gain an education in temple schools without committing to a permanent monastic life.|$|E

50|$|Gurney has {{explained}} that the play was initially {{meant to be a}} modern treatment of the classical tale of Phaedra and her desire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> but turned into a summer romance, with Susan's struggling with problems of self-esteem, artistic integrity, and sexual attraction to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>young</b> enough to be her son. Reviewers tended to dismiss the play as superficial and far from Gurney's best, but it ran for six months on Broadway, {{due in part to the}} casting of the two Sues with the popular actors Mary Tyler Moore and Lynn Redgrave.|$|R
500|$|During 1941 Lang {{considered}} retirement. His {{main concern}} was that a Lambeth Conference – [...] "perhaps the most fateful Lambeth Conference ever held" [...] – {{would need to be}} called soon after the war. Lang felt that he would be too old to lead it and that he should make way <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man,</b> preferably William Temple. On 27 November he informed the prime minister, Winston Churchill, of his decision to retire on 31 March 1942. His last official act in office, on 28 March, was the confirmation of Princess Elizabeth.|$|R
