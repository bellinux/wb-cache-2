Hair length and style became a life-or-death matter in 1645 as the Manchu told them either their hair or their head would be cut.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser whistling duck, although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs or fork-crowned lemurs are strepsirrhine primates; {{the four}} species {{comprise}} the genus Phaner. Like all lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, {{where they are}} found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up from the eyes, converge {{on the top of}} the head, and run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> as a single black stripe. They were originally placed in the genus Lemur in 1839, later moved between the genera Cheirogaleus and Microcebus, and given their own genus in 1870 by John Edward Gray. Only one species (Phaner furcifer) was recognized, until three subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may yet be identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, John Rae, while {{surveying}} the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), discovered {{further evidence of}} the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk near Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, who told him of a party of 35 to 40white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae brought from the Inuit several silver forks and spoons later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a shipmate aboard Erebus. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> River to search for other signs of Franklin and his men.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large {{eyes and a}} tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. Heading <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E

5|$|The {{color pattern}} varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and tail. Usually these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E

25|$|Tendinitis usually {{involves}} {{disruption of the}} tendon fibers.

Tendinitis is uncommon in the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of a front leg or either the SDFT or DDFT in a hindleg.|$|E
25|$|One {{race was}} left in the season. A week after the San Antonio, Seabiscuit and Kayak II both took the gate for the Santa Anita Handicap and its $121,000 prize. 78,000 paying spectators crammed the racetrack, most backing Seabiscuit. Pollard found his horse blocked almost from the start. Picking his way through the field, Seabiscuit briefly led. As they thundered <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> straight, Seabiscuit became trapped in third place, behind leader Whichcee and Wedding Call on the outside.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} two-lined salamander is a small salamander, {{with adults}} ranging from 65–120mm in total length. This salamander is yellow or yellowish-brown, with two black stripes running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> which tends to break up after {{the base of the}} tail. The flanks are mottled grayish or brown. The belly is pale yellowish, nearly transparent. There are four toes on the fore feet and five toes on the hind feet.

25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small pastern bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of}} the coffin bone. The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered with rolling the fingers <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the ball on release. This means the ball has backspin on it, {{and it does not}} turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on {{in the direction of the}} arm, from which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.|$|E
