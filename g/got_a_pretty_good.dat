500|$|In a mixed review, Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz {{published}} a track-by-track review of each {{song on the}} album. He thought that the single did not {{fit in with the}} rest of Hell: The Sequel, but alone, is a good song, [...] " [...] track doesn't fit with EP, but Em's effortless confidence carries the celebratory anthem." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN gave a shared a similar opinion, calling the song odd and uncommon. Grischow did not favor the influences of [...] "gooey synthpop" [...] and soul fusion genres. However, the critic appreciated the [...] "inspirational verses" [...] from Eminem and Royce and summarized, [...] "In the end, this brief look at the duo's skills does not fully deliver what you expect, but still leaves you wanting to hear more." [...] Web magazine Plugged In Online, once a magazine that published reviews from a Conservative Christian's perspective, praised Mars' singing but harshly criticized the duo's lyricism, [...] "These two Detroit rappers use a lot more nasty words to get the job done". The reviewer, Adam Holz, went on to analyze Royce's verse, [...] "Toss in nods to toking marijuana and two allusions to oral sex, and you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> picture of what Royce's vision of 'living out our dreams' looks like in action." [...] While exploring the Billboard charts on their segment at The A.V. Club, writers Genevieve Koski and Steven Hyden, commented on [...] "Lighters". Koski said that the single shared some similarities with [...] "Nothin' on You", which also featured Mars. Despite noticing the contrast between the rap verses and the hook, she focused her attention on the various elements of the recording which [...] "are each uplifting in their own way" [...] and awarded it a B–. On the other hand, Hyden gave the song a harsh critic calling it the, [...] "absolute worst in pop music right now". He criticized Eminem for spitting in his verses, Mars for singing a [...] "melodramatic chorus" [...] and the type of music the rapper, Eminem, was embracing dubbing it, [...] "maudlin power balladry". He gave the record an F.|$|E
2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when you put the pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it any way you wanted it. I knew right from that moment it was a success. I consider it as my good solid contribution to the sport. It gives me a lot of pleasure when I see the kids drive by in [...] their cars with a fin on their board." ...|$|E
2500|$|Strom {{was born}} December 15, 1927 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania to Max and Bessie Strom. Earl's father, Max, was a foreman at a bakery, and Earl {{grew up in}} the {{household}} as the youngest of seven children comprising five boys and two girls. As a child, he became interested in athletics and competing in sports, and this interest lasted throughout his childhood and into high school. At Pottstown High School, Strom played football, baseball, and basketball. After finishing high school in 1945, he joined the United States Coast Guard towards the end of World War II. [...] Returning from service, Strom attended Pierce Junior College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he graduated in 1951. Following school, the young Strom continued participating in sports and played for a local semi-professional basketball team in his early 20s. During a basketball game, he had an argument with a referee and the referee said [...] "Look, you're not much of a player, and you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> mouth on you, so why don't you think about taking up refereeing?" [...] Following the advice of the referee, Strom decided to get into officiating. He officiated high school games for nine years as well as college games in the East Coast Athletic Conference for three years.|$|E

From about the midway, point it <b>got</b> on <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> streak of episodes. I can’t remember the exact number, but the two-part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped.

He <b>got</b> off to <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> start scoring <b>a</b> 23-yard touchdown in week one against the Packers. However, Rice suffered a knee injury that kept him out until week 9. When he returned, most of his playing time was when the Vikings were in the red zone as he would lose his starting job to Bobby Wade. Rice finished the 2008 season with 15 catches for 141 yards and 4 touchdowns (third most receiving touchdowns by a 2008 second year player).|$|R

Drooce and the seven men had come back, bringing in the people from the Signal Hill, and had worked along with us: but, I had not so much as spoken a word to Drooce, nor had Drooce so much as spoken a word to me, for we were both too busy. The breastwork was now finished, and I found Miss Maryon at my side, with a child in her arms. Her dark hair was fastened round her head with a band. She had a quantity of it, and it looked even richer and more precious, put up hastily out of her way, than I had seen it look when it was carefully arranged. She was very pale, but extraordinarily quiet and still.|$|R

She was a small vessel, and carried only three boats. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> outfit from my landlord, though most of the articles were second-hand. We parted good friends, however, and I came back to him, and played the same silly game more than once. He was not a bad landlord, as landlords then went, and I make no doubt he took better care of my money than I should have done myself. On the whole, this class of men are not as bad as they seem, though there are precious rascals among them. The respectable sailor landlord is quite as good, in his way, as one could expect, all things considered.|$|E

I couldn't tell you how much they had been to me. You seemed to think, because I lived in a large place, that I had a great many friends; but I have very few; I might say I hadn't any--such as I thought I had when I was writing to you. Most of the men I know belong to some sort of clubs; but I don't. I went to New York when I was feeling alone in the world,--it was from {{something}} that had happened to me partly through my own fault,--and I've never got over being alone there. I've never gone into society; I don't know what society is, and I suppose that's why I am acting differently from a society man now. The only change I ever had from business was reading at night: I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> library. After I began to get your letters, I went out more--to the theatre, and lectures, and concerts, and all sorts of things--so that I could have something interesting to write about; I thought you'd get tired of always hearing about me. And your letters filled up my life, so that I didn't seem alone any more. I read them all hundreds of times; I should have said that I knew them by heart, if they had not been as fresh at last as they were at first. I seemed to hear you talking in them."

One of the chaps on the cliff may make us out, but you see {{it takes a long}} time to send along the line and get enough of them {{together}} to interfere with us. Unless they have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> strong force together, they ain't such fools as to risk their lives by meddling with a hundred men or more, with a lot of valuable goods to land, and the knowledge that if they are caught it is a long term in jail. The men know well enough that if there is anything on, there will be a watch kept over them, and that if they were to fire a pistol as a signal, there would be news of it sent to the smugglers in no time. Sometimes, too, the coast-guards nearest the point where the landing is to be, are pounced on suddenly and tied up. I reckon, too, that a good many of them keep an eye shut as long as they can, and then go off pretty leisurely to pass the word along that they have heard oars or have seen signals, especially if they have got a hot-headed boatswain in charge of their station, a sort of chap who would want to go down to meddle with a hundred men, with only five or six at his back. A man with a wife and some children, perhaps, don't relish the thought of going into a bad scrimmage like that if he can keep out of it; why should he? He gets a bit of money if they make a good seizure, but he knows well enough that he ain't going to make a seizure unless he has got a pretty strong party; and you take my word for it, four times out of five when we make a clear run, it is because the coast-guard keep an eye closed as long as they dare. They know well enough that it ain't such an uncommon thing for a man to be found at the bottom of the cliff, without anything to show how he got there, and the coroner's jury finds as it was a dark night and he tumbled over, and they brings in a verdict according. But it ain't every man as cares about taking the risk of accidents of that kind, and, somehow or other, they happens to just the chaps as is wonderful sharp and active. They have all been sailors, you know, and are ready enough for a fight when they are strong enough to have a chance, but that is a very different thing from walking backwards and forwards on a dark night close to the edge of a cliff, three or four hundred feet high, without a comrade within a quarter of a mile, and the idea that an accident of this kind might occur any time." ...|$|E
