2500|$|For example, an AM {{broadcast}} {{station at}} 580nbsp&kHz is tuned on a receiver with a 455nbsp&kHz IF. The local oscillator is tuned to [...] 1035nbsp&kHz. But a signal at [...] 1490nbsp&kHz is also 455nbsp&kHz {{away from the}} local oscillator; so both the desired signal and the image, when mixed with the local oscillator, will also appear at the intermediate frequency. This <b>image</b> <b>frequency</b> is within the AM broadcast band. Practical receivers have a tuning stage before the converter, to greatly reduce the amplitude of <b>image</b> <b>frequency</b> signals; additionally, broadcasting stations {{in the same area}} have their frequencies assigned to avoid such images.|$|E
2500|$|The mixer will process {{not only}} the desired input signal at fRF, but also all signals present at its inputs. There will be many mixer {{products}} (heterodynes). Most other signals produced by the mixer (such as due to stations at nearby frequencies) can be filtered out in the IF amplifier; that gives the superheterodyne receiver its superior performance. However, if fLO is set to fRF+fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO+fIF will also produce a heterodyne at fIF; the frequency [...] fLO+fIF is called the <b>image</b> <b>frequency</b> and must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage. The <b>image</b> <b>frequency</b> is 2fIF higher (or lower) than the desired frequency fRF, so employing a higher IF frequency fIF increases the receiver's image rejection without requiring additional selectivity in the RF stage.|$|E
2500|$|Sensitivity to the <b>image</b> <b>frequency</b> can be minimised only by (1) {{a filter}} that precedes the mixer or (2) {{a more complex}} mixer circuit [...] that {{suppresses}} the image.
