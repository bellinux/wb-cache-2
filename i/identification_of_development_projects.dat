40|$|In this study, a {{innovative}} {{model was}} developed for impact assessment for urban <b>development</b> <b>project.</b> The proposed model has the capability of zoning the impacts according to integration of vulnerability for the selected environmental factors within impacts criterion in this study. The main process for this model consists <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>development</b> <b>project</b> activities, determination and zoning of impacts intensity, calculation of environmental vulnerability factor and decision making on proposed alternatives. The integration of results for the mentioned stages will determine the final assessment zoning. This model was applied to urban development plan in district- 22 of Tehran municipality (Iranian capital city) as a case study. The {{results indicate that the}} model was applicable for zoning of impacts according to the characteristics of affected environmental and ecological factors as well as determining major impacts units. Meanwhile, this model was capable to select alternatives <b>of</b> urban <b>development</b> plan for decision makers. Finally planners will find out the necessary mitigation measures which should be implemented in each impact unit...|$|R
50|$|The {{recommendations}} {{contained in}} the World Bank’s report held real significance for African political leaders, as the Bank is a major development lending agency {{with the power to}} affect the <b>identification</b> and design <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>projects.</b> Structural adjustment programs (SAPs) instituted by the World Bank made loans conditional on specific conditions, a strong inducement for countries to follow free-market policies. The report makes specific recommendations to donors, stating, “The level and pattern of donor assistance to a country must be determined in the framework of programs of action prepared by individual governments, which address the critical development policy issues outlined in this Report.” Explicitly advocating for “policy action and foreign assistance that are mutually reinforcing,” the report reinforces its own recommendations by leveraging loan and aid money. The Berg report generated criticism from some scholars <b>of</b> international <b>development</b> and African studies, particularly for the way it represents “the balance <b>of</b> responsibility for <b>development</b> failure.” The report prioritizes “domestic policy inadequacies” as a major cause for under-performing economies, and some have argued that the report downplays “the importance of external factors in shaping policy and performance in Sub-Saharan Africa.” In 1981, when the report was published, an important external factor was the instability of the global economy, particularly the stagflation of the 1970s, and the 1979 energy crisis.|$|R

30|$|In the {{remaining}} Chapters (7 and 8), the author explains how development becomes a moral discourse. Chapter 7 {{sets the stage}} for this discussion by examining a government-sponsored project in the island province. KALAHI-CIDSS (Kapit-bisig Laban sa Kahirapan [Linking arms against poverty]-Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services) is a program that promotes community participation and cooperation in the <b>identification</b> and implementation <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>projects</b> at the village level. In so doing, KALAHI-CIDSS is an exercise of transparent and accountable governance in which local residents are able to use government funds through a participatory process. Focusing on a water facility project in Balete, the author interrogates how participation and empowerment actually takes place {{in the context of the}} program. Participants of the project identified water provision as a problem but the constructed water facility failed because project volunteers overlooked the dwindling sources of water in the area. Bulloch notes that when the project was evaluated, promoters of KALAHI-CIDSS acknowledged the community’s lack of technical expertise. Residents of Balete identified corruption as one of the reasons the project failed. In making sense of the Balete experience, Bulloch points how an attempt to empower a locality through participatory processes turned out to create a moral discourse that shifts accountability to actors rather than institutional arrangements. In so doing Bulloch presents a critique of KALAHI-CIDSS as a neoliberal project in the guise <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> The next chapter furthers the notion of accountable individuals by describing how development discourse focuses on the evaluation of actions and dispositions through moral frameworks used by locals.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern from government, communities, civil society and mining {{companies}} on the sustained <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the impact of mining on communities and the benefits <b>of</b> mineral <b>development.</b> Communities are more vocal in expressing their expectations for benefits {{and on the other hand}} mines are concerned about profits and maintaining a social licence to operate. This study critically evaluates the impact mining has on socio-economic development in mining communities. The focus area of the study is the West Rand District Municipality in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The ‘impact’ refers to the mine’s contribution to infrastructure development and poverty reduction projects in areas where the mine is operating and sourcing labour from. Forecasts for better performance in the future will be assessed. Issues such as community consultation, <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> <b>development</b> forums, the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and partnerships are addressed. The literature was reviewed from existing national and international research on the topic. The study starts from two assumptions. The first is that minerals are potentially a great resource of wealth for poor countries. The second assumption is that minerals have the potential to benefit the local population through the creation of indirect employment, skills transfer, enhancing the capacity of health and education services, improved infrastructure and small and medium business opportunities. Poverty levels are viewed on a national and international scale. The study reveals problems, with existing approaches, on mine community development. It concludes that the impact of mining on infrastructure development and poverty reduction projects can be huge, but only if a variety of demanding preconditions are met. The study concludes that the reality <b>of</b> mineral led <b>development</b> in mine communities has not lived up to a roaring promise...|$|R
