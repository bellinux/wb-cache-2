5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} tunnels {{and a set of}} 1850s workshops within an <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall.</b> Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{residential}} area {{is located on}} the middle of the plain, far from the outcrops. The primary material of construction for the houses and the <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall</b> was sun-dried mudbrick. Few vestiges of the {{residential area}} remain.|$|E
25|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was closed}} in 1915 and it deteriorated since then. By 1984, it became subjected to vandalism; crypts and mausoleums were plundered. On that year, it contained {{a variety of}} mausoleums, crypts and niches partially destroyed, {{and most of the}} cemetery was covered by heavy vegetation. The <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall</b> plaster had fallen down exposing the brick and stone to weather conditions.|$|E

25|$|Two pavilions {{occupy the}} east and west ends of the cross axis, one the mirror of the other. In the classic charbargh design, gates would have been located in this location. In the Taj they provide {{punctuation}} and access to the long <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall</b> with its decorative crenellations. Built of sandstone, they are given a tripartite form and over two storeys and are capped with a white marble chhatris supported from 8 columns.|$|E
25|$|No {{traces of}} the {{superstructures}} once capping tomb S9 have survived and determining its type—mastaba or pyramid—remains difficult. Ayrton, Weigall and Petrie believed S9 was a mastaba, because of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall</b> which they thought would have held the sand packed {{on top of the}} substructures. However, the royal nature of S9 and S10 as well as their architectural similarities to pyramids of the late Middle Kingdom in the area of Memphis have led Wegner to suggest S9 might have been a pyramid too. In spite of these arguments, the Egyptologist Aidan Dodson asserts that it is still unclear whether S9 was a mastaba or a pyramid.|$|E
500|$|This former constabulary barracks {{was built}} around 1800.

50|$|In {{the attempt}} to explain the idea of gradual {{approach}} to thermodynamic equilibrium after a thermodynamic operation, with entropy increase according to the second law of thermodynamics, Boltzmann’s H-theorem used equations which assumed a system (for example, a gas) was isolated. That is, all the mechanical degrees of freedom could be specified, treating the <b>enclosing</b> <b>walls</b> simply as mirror boundary conditions. This led to Loschmidt's paradox. If, however, the stochastic behavior of the molecules and thermal radiation in real <b>enclosing</b> <b>walls</b> is considered, then the system is in effect in a heat bath. Then Boltzmann’s assumption of molecular chaos can be justified.|$|R
2500|$|The author Weston St. John Joyce, {{writing in}} The Neighbourhood of Dublin (1912), {{described}} the vista as [...] "a fine view is obtained of Bray, Howth, Dalkey, and Killiney, the vale of Shanganagh, and Bray Head and town. Between the observer {{and the sea}} will be seen Loughlinstown, looking very closely built from this point, like the towns of medieval times, which were built within as small an area as possible, so as to reduce the circuit of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall.</b> To the westward will be seen the wooded hill of Barnaslingan, forming {{the eastern side of}} the Scalp, beyond that the Two and Three Rock Mountains, and south of these the higher Wicklow hills – War Hill, Djouce, and Duff Hill".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, {{situated}} in settings like the Whitney Biennials, his paintings were easily recognized among the crowd {{due to his}} masterful use of shaped canvases. They were large, often curved, and frequently <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall</b> space. The painting itself blended elements from abstract expressionism and geometric abstraction, over time shifting further towards geometry. The surfaces were never simple. By the 1980s, {{he returned to the}} rectangular and square canvas, and eventually to the cruciform (cross) shape, which would become a focus for the next decade. [...] "Harvey Quaytman's shaped canvases are among the most impressive;" [...] and [...] "Some of the best shaped canvases of the last two decades have come from Harvey Quaytman. But in this selection of new work, the painter has, so to speak, drawn in his horns, confining himself to the right angle and in most cases to a cruciform image."

60|$|They both {{turned their}} horses into the field, {{skirting}} the low, <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall</b> {{until they reached}} the gate. The white horse was now tethered to a post and the man in the grey redingote {{was standing in the doorway}} at the rear of the cottage. The two men dismounted and in their turn led their horses into the yard: at sight of them the man in the grey redingote seemed to wake from his sleep.|$|E

6000|$|Curly {{followed}} his nose {{down the first}} tortuous street into which his irresponsible feet conducted him. At {{the lower end of}} it, {{on the bank of the}} serpentine stream, he perceived an open gate in a cemented rock wall. Inside he saw camp fires and a row of low wooden sheds built against three sides of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall.</b> He entered the enclosure. Under the sheds many horses were champing at their oats and corn. Many wagons and buckboards stood about with their teams' harness thrown carelessly upon the shafts and doubletrees. Curly recognised the place as a wagon-yard, such as is provided by merchants for their out-of- town friends and customers. No one was in sight. No doubt the drivers of those wagons were scattered about the town [...] "seeing the elephant and hearing the owl." [...] In their haste to become patrons of the town's dispensaries of mirth and good cheer the last ones to depart must have left the great wooden gate swinging open.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely {{had this}} service, as solemn {{as it was}} simple, been brought to an end when the head jailer, whose blasphemous jocosity since his reproof by Anna was {{replaced}} by a mien of sullen venom, came forward and commanded the whole band to march to the amphitheatre. Accordingly, two by two, the bishop leading the way with the sainted woman Anna, they walked to the gates. Here a guard of soldiers was waiting to receive them, and under their escort they threaded the narrow, darkling streets till they came to that door of the amphitheatre which was used by those who were {{to take part in the}} games. Now, at a word from the bishop, they began to chant a solemn hymn, and singing thus, were thrust along the passages to the place prepared for them. This was not, as they expected, a prison at the back of the amphitheatre, but, as has been said, a spot between the <b>enclosing</b> <b>wall</b> and the podium, raised a little above the level of the arena. Here, on the eastern side of the building, they were to sit till their turn came to be driven by the guards through a little wicket-gate into the arena, where the starving beasts of prey would be loosed upon them.|$|E
