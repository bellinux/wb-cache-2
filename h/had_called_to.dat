5|$|The Greek {{victories}} {{had been}} short-lived. The Sultan <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> his aid his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who had dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, later adding a further 25,000 troops. Ibrahim’s intervention proved decisive: the Peloponnese had been reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi {{had fallen in}} 1826; Athens had been taken in 1827. All that Greek nationalists still held was Nafplion, Hydra, Mani and Aegina.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. The defense was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Machias to explain what had gone wrong with his expedition.|$|E
5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in his study of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E

25|$|In his {{rebuttal}} closing argument, {{defense attorney}} Art Hanes Jr. attacked the evidence {{presented by the}} prosecution as being purely circumstantial, adding that similar circumstantial evidence had earlier seen Chambliss acquitted of the church bombing in 1963.

Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and spectacles were on a bedside table. His passport was in a drawer and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat. Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, {{she was able to}} describe what had happened to her. A police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return.

500|$|On January 13, LeVert {{was one of}} four Big Ten athletes (along with Melo Trimble, Jarrod Uthoff and Denzel Valentine) {{among the}} 25 players {{included}} in the Wooden Award Midseason Top 25 Watch List. On the eve of LeVert's sixth missed game, head coach Beilein finally clarified that LeVert's left leg injury was not related to the two previous left foot stress fractures that LeVert had endured. On February 2, LeVert was one of two Big Ten athletes (along with Malcolm Hill) named one of 10 finalists for the Jerry West Award, despite having missed the last 8 of Michigan's 22 games. On February 10, Brendan F. Quinn of MLive.com broke the story that LeVert had been cleared to play. [...] On February 13, Michigan defeated (#18/16) Purdue 61–56 with LeVert recording five rebounds and one assist in 11 minutes after missing the previous 11 games. On March 1, the team announced that the injury would end LeVert's season and collegiate career. On March 22, LeVert had a third surgical procedure in 22 months performed on his left foot in New York City by specialist Dr. Martin O'Malley. By late April, the draft stock of LeVert had slipped to the second round. According to the Michigan Basketball Twitter feed, he attended graduation in crutches at the end of April. He was invited to the May 1115 NBA Draft Combine. While still on crutches at the combine, LeVert clarified that his injury was a Jones fracture of the fifth metatarsal and that Kevin Durant who has the same agency and used the same doctor <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> offer him encouragement.|$|E

2500|$|In County Galway, 600–700 Volunteers mobilised on Tuesday under Liam Mellows. His {{plan was}} to [...] "bottle up the British {{garrison}} and divert the British from concentrating on Dublin". However, his men were poorly armed, with only 25 rifles, 60 revolvers, 300 shotguns and some homemade grenades – many of them only had pikes. Most of the action {{took place in a}} rural area to the east of Galway city. They made unsuccessful attacks on the RIC barracks at Clarinbridge and Oranmore, captured several officers, and bombed a bridge and railway line, before taking up position near Athenry. There was also a skirmish between rebels and an RIC mobile patrol at Carnmore crossroads. A constable, Patrick Whelan, was shot dead after he <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the rebels: [...] "Surrender, boys, I know ye all".|$|E

2500|$|Many {{customers}} {{complained that}} AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the New York Attorney General's office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies. The investigation {{revealed that the}} company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to retain or [...] "save" [...] subscribers who <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth {{tens of thousands of dollars}} if they could successfully dissuade or [...] "save" [...] half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or [...] "save" [...] percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum [...] "save" [...] rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{witness to}} testify at Rose's trial was Fred's {{appointed}} appropriate adult, Janet Leach, whom the prosecution <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> testify on 7 November in rebuttal to the tape recordings of Fred's confession which had been played to the court on 3 November and {{in which he had}} stressed Rose had [...] "known nothing at all" [...] about any of the murders. Leach testified that through this role, Fred had gradually begun to view her as a confidante, and had confided in her that on the evening prior to his 25 February arrest, he and Rose had formed a pact whereby he would take full responsibility for all the murders, many of which he had privately described to her as being [...] "some of Rose's mistakes". He had further divulged that Rose had indeed murdered Charmaine while he had been incarcerated, and had also murdered Shirley Robinson. Fred had also confided that although he had actually dismembered the victims, Rose had participated in the mutilation and dismemberment of Shirley Robinson, and had personally removed Robinson's unborn child from her womb after her death. In reference to the remaining eight murders for which Rose was charged, Leach testified that Fred had confided Rose had [...] "played a major part" [...] in these murders.|$|E
2500|$|While {{studying}} the trivium at Cambridge, {{he took the}} first steps toward his eventual conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1937, founded on his reading of G. K. Chesterton. In 1935, {{he wrote to his}} mother: [...] "ad I not encountered Chesterton, I would have remained agnostic for many years at least." [...] At the end of March 1937, McLuhan completed what was a slow but total conversion process, when he was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church. After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable. McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter. He had a lifelong interest in the number three (e.g., the trivium, the Trinity) and sometimes said that the Virgin Mary provided intellectual guidance for him. For the rest of his career, he taught in Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at Saint Louis University (with an interruption from 1939–40 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on Shakespeare and tutored and befriended Walter J. Ong, S.J. (1912–2003), who went on to write his Ph.D. dissertation on a topic that McLuhan <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> his attention, and who also became a well-known authority on communication and technology.|$|E

2500|$|The Tribunal {{heard from}} retired Garda Chief Superintendent Tom Curran, who {{was based in}} Monaghan {{at the time of}} the killings. He stated that in 1988 an {{informer}} told him of an IRA death threat against Buchanan. The man had allegedly said: [...] "There's a fella crossing the border there to see you and he is going to be shot." [...] Curran — who had met Buchanan many times and regarded him as a friend — was worried and duly informed Eugene Crowley, the assistant commissioner of crime and security at Garda headquarters in Dublin, about the threat. Curran never told Buchanan about the threat as he didn't want Buchanan to think that the Garda Síochána was trying to stop him coming to the Republic. In 1987, Buchanan <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Curran's office to discuss RUC concerns about the Garda detective sergeant at Dundalk station who was [...] "unnecessarily associating" [...] with the IRA. Buchanan asked Curran to convey his message to Garda headquarters, which he did in person. Assistant Commissioner Crowley (now deceased) did not, however, seem interested in what Curran had to say about the possible collusion. This detective sergeant was the same man whom Breen had discussed with Sgt Alan Mains before setting out for Dundalk. This man was also on first name terms with the then RUC Chief Constable Sir John Hermon. Breen's widow June maintained that many times before the ambush, Breen had given her instructions that in the event of his death Hermon was not to be allowed to attend his funeral.|$|E
