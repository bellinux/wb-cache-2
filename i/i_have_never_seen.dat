5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

500|$|In 1949, Grantland Rice chose him as {{the center}} for his All-Time All-American team. [...] At the time, Rice said: [...] "Schulz was 6feet 4 and he weighed 245pounds.

[...] After the game, Roper had high praise for Kipke: [...] "Kipke is the {{greatest}} punter I have ever seen... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> such deadly accuracy... It was impossible for the Minnesota quarterback to handle Kipke's kicks. [...] Most of them went out of bounds some fifty yards from the line of scrimmage." ...|$|E

500|$|The Times said of Barrington's performances, [...] "His {{strength}} {{lay in his}} quietness {{of voice}} and movement... in perfect contrast to the restlessness of George Grossmith. [...] No one could be so ridiculously pompous... he moved with effect. [...] There was a native drollery in his lightly rolling dance, a comic dignity in his rotund and placid, yet twinklingly intelligent face. [...] He always {{gave the impression of}} thoroughly enjoying whatever he did...." [...] In its review of Ruddigore, The Theatre wrote, [...] "Better comic acting than his, or more highly finished, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> and never wish to see." ...|$|E

I was lucky in having under me a team whose members possessed much natural ability and who played the game intelligently. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a team that, as a whole, was so fast in the composite." [...] For many years, it was considered [...] "the greatest football team the South had ever produced". According to a contemporary New York Sun account, [...] "Georgia Tech looms up {{as one of the}} truly great teams of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|King, who {{had been}} silent and then out of town while Bevel was {{organizing}} the children, {{was impressed by the}} success of using them in the protests. That evening he declared at a mass meeting, [...] "I have been inspired and moved by today. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything like it." [...] Although Wyatt Tee Walker was initially against the use of children in the demonstrations, he responded to criticism by saying, [...] "Negro children will get a better education in five days in jail than in five months in a segregated school." [...] The D Day campaign received front page coverage by The Washington Post and The New York Times.|$|E

500|$|Most of Calvin's {{statements}} on the Jewry {{of his era}} were polemical. For example, Calvin once wrote, [...] "I have had much conversation with many Jews: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> either a drop of piety or a grain of truth or ingenuousness – nay, I have never found common sense in any Jew." [...] In this respect, he differed little from other Protestant and Catholic theologians of his day. Among his extant writings, Calvin only dealt explicitly with issues of contemporary Jews and Judaism in one treatise, Response to Questions and Objections of a Certain Jew. In it, he argued that Jews misread their own scriptures because they miss {{the unity of the}} Old and New Testaments.|$|E
500|$|Compared {{to other}} Soviet officials, Kosygin stood {{out as a}} pragmatic and {{relatively}} independent leader. In a description given by an anonymous high-ranking GRU official, Kosygin is described as [...] "a lonely and somewhat tragic figure" [...] who [...] "understood our faults and shortcomings of our situation in general and those in our Middle East policy in particular, but, being a highly restrained man, he preferred to be cautious." [...] An anonymous old co-worker of Kosygin said [...] "He always had an opinion of his own, and defended it. He was a very alert man, and performed brilliantly during negotiations. He was able to cope quickly with the material that was totally new to him. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> people of that calibre afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{autobiography}} Tucker relates that, [...] "The play was over... and there {{appearing to be}} much delay in bringing on the afterpiece...

I was instrumental in saving several females from the flames." [...] In the process, he suffered a head injury when struck by a falling timber, and was left with a permanent scar above his eye. The tragedy took the lives of 72 people, including the sitting Governor of Virginia George William Smith. Victims also included many of the upper echelons in Richmond society.|$|E

500|$|Historian Eric Reed {{notes that}} a DuPont {{marketing}} executive characterized the initial sponsorship as [...] "a bargain", {{and that the}} company claimed that the American press clippings generated by the event weighed [...] DuPont executives also reported that they valued the global media exposure as worth close to US$70 million. Reed quotes a DuPont marketing executive as stating: [...] "In 40 years in , <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> such concentrated, sustained and positive media coverage". However, Reed argues that despite this initial enthusiasm, [...] "the Tour DuPont's chronic weaknesses hamstrung the event's growth", citing its [...] "pro-am" [...] status, which prevented professional riders {{from being able to}} win world ranking points in the event. He also states that despite having an estimated worldwide television audience of 200 million, [...] "American fan enthusiasm and roadside spectator interest in the event failed to spike significantly".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{official}} paid attendance was recorded as 40,000, newspaper accounts reported that only 20,000 actually attended, {{as the game}} was played in a heavy rainstorm on a cold afternoon. [...] The rain turned the field into a [...] "sea of mud" [...] with an inch of standing water {{on top of the}} mud. [...] In the Chicago Daily Tribune, Walter Eckersall (who also served as the game's referee) compared the field to a [...] "bog" [...] and added:"In my twenty-five years of football <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> worse conditions. [...] Pools of water stood on parts of the field and in some places the players' feet sunk into the field five or six inches. [...] It rained throughout the game and a strong wind from the north gave the team defending that goal a decided advantage." ...|$|E
500|$|......I {{went outside}} on hearing enemy planes. I counted them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could live in that barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed and disappeared into the cloud. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – they got into formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E

500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1360s, Louis {{suffered}} from a skin disease with symptoms similar to leprosy. Thereafter he became even more zealous and dedicated more time to praying and religious contemplation. After his meeting with Louis in 1372, the papal legate, John de Cardailhac, stated: [...] "I call God as my witness that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a monarch more majestic and more [...] or one who desires peace and calm as much as he." [...] He also changed the priorities of his foreign policy and began neglecting the Balkan states. Casimir III of Poland and Louis signed a treaty against Emperor Charles IV in Buda in February 1369. At their next meeting in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) in September, Albert I of Bavaria, and Rupert I of the Palatinate joined their coalition against the emperor and the Habsburgs. However, Emperor Charles IV persuaded the two Wittelsbachs (Albert I and Rupert I) to break off the coalition in September 1370.|$|E
500|$|He reached 40 in as {{many minutes}} as Australia's total reached 50. Australia reached 100 in only 79 minutes with Macartney {{contributing}} 83 of those runs. Macartney reached his century in 103 minutes with the tourists on 131. By lunch, he had scored 112 in 116 minutes and he continued until the score reached 1/235, when he hit Macaulay to Patsy Hendren and was dismissed, having amassed 151 in 170 minutes. Former English captain Sir Pelham Warner said [...] "I say without hesitation that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a greater innings... not even the immortal Victor Trumper could have played more finely". [...] Macartney's innings allowed Australia to accumulate a healthy first innings total of 494. He then took 2/51, removing Carr and Fender as England made 294 and were forced to follow on; however, the Australians could not dismiss the hosts {{for a second time}} and the match ended in a draw.|$|E

60|$|And now put {{yourself}} in my place for a moment. Walk with me a bit in my tender childhood, bed with me a night and imagine yourself dreaming such incomprehensible horrors.
