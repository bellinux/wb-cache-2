40|$|Large NF 1 deletions are {{mediated}} by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). An in-depth analysis of gene conversion {{operating in the}} breakpoint-flanking regions of large NF 1 deletions was performed to investigate whether the rate of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gene</b> conversion during NAHR with crossover is increased, as has been previously noted in NAHR-mediated rearrangements. All 20 germline type- 1 NF 1 deletions analysed were {{mediated by}} NAHR associated with continuous gene conversion within the breakpoint-flanking regions. Continuous gene conversion was also observed in 31 / 32 type- 2 NF 1 deletions investigated. In contrast to the meiotic type- 1 NF 1 deletions, type- 2 NF 1 deletions are predominantly of post-zygotic origin. Our findings therefore imply that the mitotic {{as well as the}} meiotic NAHR intermediates of large NF 1 deletions are processed by long-patch mismatch repair (MMR), thereby ensuring gene conversion tract continuity instead of the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gene</b> conversion that is characteristic of short-patch repair. However, the single type- 2 NF 1 deletion not exhibiting continuous gene conversion was processed without MMR, yielding two different deletion-bearing chromosomes which were distinguishable in terms of their breakpoint positions. Our findings indicate that MMR failure during NAHR, followed by post-meiotic/mitotic segregation, has the potential to give rise to somatic mosaicism in human genomic rearrangements by generating breakpoint heterogeneity.

40|$|The 5 S-rRNA {{from the}} ungerminated and 48 -h-germinated rice embryos {{differs from that}} of wheat, rye and maize by two {{nucleotides}}. The 48 -h-germinated embryos contain another species of 5 S-rRNA which differs by 3 nucleotides from the ungerminated embryos, thereby demonstrating the expression of two 5 S-rRNA genes during germination. The 5 S-rRNA genes are present in tandem repeats of a 0. 3 -kb sequence with some length heterogeneity in the rice genome. The 5 S-rRNA gene that was sequenced is identical to that of wheat and maize, except for two nucleotides, C and T, which are interchanged at positions 107 and 117. The insert of the continuous 5 S-rRNA gene in pBR 322 was transcribed in vitro much more efficiently than was the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gene.</b> There was no homology between the 184 -bp spacer sequence of 5 S-rRNA genes in rice and other systems except for the presence of an oligo(T) transcription terminator sequence...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of the antigen binding portion ofthe Ig molecule is generated through the recombination of multiple <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gene</b> segments (1, 2). The heavy chain variable (V) region coding sequence is formed when one of hundreds ofVN regions combines with one of 15 - 20 D regions and one of 4 J. regions to create a complete VDJ segment (3, 4). Light chain recombination proceeds {{in a similar fashion}} between V,, andJL segments (5). These events occur in a well-defined order with DJ. rearrangement precedingV. -to-DJ. recombination (6, 7), followed later by V,;to-J,, recombination. The exact site of recombination between these segments is imprecise, thus creating further diversity at the joints. Single nucleotides (N segments) may be added at the limits of the D region in heavy chain rearrangements (8, 9). These mechanisms, along with the association of different heavy and light chains, result in an expected antibody repertoire of> 1011 Ig molecules. In recent years it has become apparent that rearranged VDJ segments are capable of undergoing further somatic variation. A major mechanism of generating further diversity is somatic point mutation within the V region coding sequence (1, 10) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Discontinuous</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic nuclei, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Gene discontinuity occurs in multiple forms: the two most frequent forms result from introns that are spliced out of the RNA and the resulting exons are spliced {{together to form a}} single transcript, and fragmented gene transcripts that are not covalently attached post-transcriptionally. Within the past few years, fragmented ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes have been discovered in bilateral metazoan mitochondria, all within a group of related oysters. Results: In this study, we have characterized this fragmentation with comparative analysis and experimentation. We present secondary structures, modeled using comparative sequence analysis of the discontinuous mitochondrial large subunit rRNA genes of the cupped oysters C. virginica, C. gigas, and C. hongkongensis. Comparative structure models for the large subunit rRNA {{in each of the three}} oyster species are generally similar to those for other bilateral metazoans. We also used RT-PCR and analyzed ESTs to determine if the two fragmented LSU rRNAs are spliced together. The two segments are transcribed separately, and not spliced together although they still form functional rRNAs and ribosomes.

50|$|Analysis {{of mature}} {{eukaryotic}} messenger RNA molecules showed {{that they are}} often {{much smaller than the}} DNA sequences that encode them. The genes were shown to be discontinuous, composed of sequences that are not present in the final mature RNA (introns), located between sequences that are retained in the mature RNA (exons). Introns were shown to be removed after transcription through a process termed RNA splicing. Splicing of RNA transcripts requires a highly precise and coordinated sequence of molecular events, consisting of (a) definition of boundaries between exons and introns, (b) RNA strand cleavage at exactly those sites, and (c) covalent linking (ligation) of the RNA exons in the correct order. The discovery of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>genes</b> and RNA splicing was entirely unexpected by the community of RNA biologists, and stands {{as one of the most}} shocking findings in molecular biology research.|$|R

40|$|The two {{homologous}} {{genes for}} the P 700 chlorophyll a-apoproteins (ps 1 A 1 and ps 1 A 2) are encoded by the plastom {{in the green}} alga Chlamydomonas reinhardii. The structure and organization of the two genes were determined by comparison with the homologous genes from maize using data from heterologous hybridizations {{as well as from}} DNA and RNA sequencing. While the ps 1 A 2 (736 codons) gene shows a continuous gene organization, the ps 1 A 1 (754 codons) gene possesses some unusual features. The <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gene</b> is split into three separate exons which are scattered around the circular chloroplast genome. Exon 1 (86 bp) is separated by ∼ 50 kb from exon 2 (198 bp), which is located ∼ 90 kb apart from exon 3 (1984 bp). All exons are flanked by intronic sequences of group II. Transcription analysis reveals that the ps 1 A 2 gene hybridizes with a 2. 8 -kb transcript, while all exon regions of the ps 1 A 1 gene are homologous to a mature mRNA of 2. 7 kb. From our data we conclude that the three distantly separated exonic sequences of the ps 1 A 1 gene constitute a functional gene which probably operates by a trans-splicing mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Broadly speaking, {{there are}} two kinds of gene concepts. In this brief chapter I will offer a modest account of each. I seek to show that both are {{legitimate}} and that it is necessary to understand their interplay in order to understand the history of genetics and a number of current issues in genetics. I argue that the first kind of concept makes sense of the conceptual continuities in the history of genetics, but yields concepts that are too generic or schematic to specify adequately what is referred to by ‘the ’ gene concept and allied concepts. I will show that we cannot do without such generic or schematic concepts. Indeed, without schematic concept(s) of the gene, there would be no such discipline as genetics, but, without supplementation by more specific gene concepts the schematic concepts do not suffice for specifying the reference of the term ‘gene ’ – indeed, they do not specify what genes are well enough to ensure that the term refers successfully at all. In less philosophical language, these schematic concepts are impotent to specify exactly what we are talking about when we talk about genes. The second kind of gene concept, in contrast, yields specific gene concepts, but does so at the price of conceptual discontinuity. I shall argue that if one restricts oneself to the series of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gene</b> concepts, the findings of molecular genetics favor abandoning a univocal and specific concept of the gene altogether in favor of a pair of concepts – the concept of genetic material plus that of the expression of genetic information. I will even suggest that, without the schematic concepts, molecular genetics would be well served by abandoning specific gene concepts with a concept of the genetic material. As some other contributors to the workshop in which this chapter was originally presented have argued, 2 the information content of the genetic material is extremely dependent on the cellular or subcellular context in which it is expressed. This provides one of the rationales for suggesting that molecular biologists could abandon specific concepts of the gene, deploying, instead, concepts focusing on the continuous genetic material and the controls governing what is still called gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Mouse beta-globin in {{encoded in}} a <b>discontinuous</b> {{structural}} <b>gene</b> {{interrupted by a}} 550 -base pair intervening sequence of DNA. Correspondingly, the mature beta-globin mRNA appears to be synthesized via a 15 S precursor, the length of which roughly equals the total length of the coding and intervening sequences of the beta-globin gene. Using the electron microscope to visualize hybrid structures formed between this gene and the purified 15 S beta-globin mRNA precursor, we show that the intervening sequence is present within the larger precursor molecule. This finding suggests that the precursor mRNA is processed through the removal and rejoining of internal RNA sequences...|$|R
40|$|Homologous intrachromosomal {{recombination}} between linked genes {{can involve}} interactions {{that are either}} intramolecular (intrachromatid) or intermolecular (sister chromatid). To assess the relative proportions of chromatid interactions, we report studies of intrachromosomal recombination in mouse L cells containing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase genes in two alternative configurations of direct repeats. By comparing products of reciprocal exchanges between these two configurations, we conclude {{that the majority of}} interactions that give rise to crossover products involve unequally paired sister chromatids after DNA replication. Analyses of an additional class of crossover products that involve <b>discontinuous</b> associated <b>gene</b> conversion suggest that these recombination events involve a heteroduplex DNA intermediate...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analysed}} DNA modification in a HapII site (CCGG) {{present in}} the major intron of the <b>discontinuous</b> rabbit β-globin <b>gene.</b> In most somatic tissues, including erythroid and non-erythroid tissues, about 50 % of the DNA is resistant to cleavage at this site by HapII, though 100 % cleavage is found with the isoschizomer MspI. Since the former enzyme is unable to cleave CCGG sites if the internal C residue is 5 -methyl C (and since methylation is the only form of CpG modification documented in animal DNA), while the latter enzyme cleaves DNA irrespective of methylation at this residue, we infer that 50 % of the CCGG sites in the β-globin gene intron are methylated in these tissues...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{pathogenic}} fungi parasitize {{plants and}} cause invasive infection. With {{the development of}} next generation sequencing, a number of plant pathogenic fungi genomes are being sequenced and analyzed. The first completed genome sequence of Taphrina betulina, which is a biotrophic pathogen that causes striking twig clusters, known as witch's broom on birch, has been just finished. Genome sequencing yielded a 13 Mb assembly with 28 chromosomes. However, 10 of 28 chromosomes are considerably small. We hypothesized that these chromosomes may be dispensable chromosomes {{that are associated with}} pathogenicity. Essential gene distributions in identified Taphrina, Schizosaccharomyces species, and species identified with known dispensable chromosomes were compared. Evidence is presented that dispensable chromosomes are non-existent in T. betulina and this pipeline could find potential dispensable chromosomes. Furthermore, <b>discontinuous</b> essential <b>gene</b> distribution promotes our second hypothesis that T. betulina has some features of a “two-speed genome”. “Two-speed genome” consists of gene-dense regions and gene- sparse regions. Genes located in gene-sparse regions tend to evolve faster than the rest. Gene ontology (GO) describes the functionality of a gene and its products from three domains: cellular components, molecular functions and biological process. GO enrichment analyses of “slow-speed region” and “fast- speed region” genes were compared, facilitating the finding of candidate virulence effectors...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{designed}} to investigate the expression and regulation of interstitial collagenase (MMP- 1) during endochondral ossification in fetal bovine growth plate chondrocytes in vitro. Fetal bovine growth plate chondrocytes were separated into subpopulations representing different maturational stages by using a Percoll <b>discontinuous</b> gradient. <b>Gene</b> expression and synthesis of MMP- 1 in these chondrocyte subpopulations were followed in serum-free cultures as they matured from the prehypertrophic to hypertrophic phenotype. However, MMP- 1 mRNA expression and protein were undetectable. This expression was also undetectable in interleukin 1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha) stimulated growth plate chondrocytes. MMP- 1 mRNA and protein were however observed in IL- 1 alpha stimulated bovine fetal skin fibroblasts. Although MMP- 1 was absent in growth plate chondrocytes, a collagenolytic activity was detectable in culture medium by using 14 C labeled type II collagen. It was only seen when the chondrocytes were hypertrophic. By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), employing conserved sequences found in mammalian collagenase- 3 (MMP- 13), a novel bovine collagenase, was cloned. The cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence shared a 92 % and 90 % identity to the human MMP- 13 cDNA and amino acid sequence respectively. MMP- 13 mRNA and protein were found only when the chondrocytes became hypertrophic. The role of MMP- 13 during the maturation of these fetal growth plate chondrocytes was further investigated by using a preferential carboxylate inhibitor of collagenase- 3. This inhibitor reduced the generation of denatured type II collagen in chondrocyte cell layers and proteoglycan release into conditioned medium in a dose dependent manner. Also, types II and X collagen synthesis and matrix calcification were inhibited. These studies indicate that MMP- 13 may play {{a very important role}} during the maturation of fetal growth plate chondrocyte in vitro and during endochondral ossification and that cellu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Phytophthora infestans is {{the most}} devastating {{pathogen}} of potato and a model organism for the oomycetes. It exhibits high evolutionary potential and rapidly adapts to host plants. The P. infestans genome experienced a repeat-driven expansion relative to the genomes of Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum and shows a <b>discontinuous</b> distribution of <b>gene</b> density. Effector genes, such {{as members of the}} RXLR and Crinkler (CRN) families, localize to expanded, repeat-rich and gene-sparse regions of the genome. This distinct genomic environment is thought to contribute to genome plasticity and host adaptation. Results We used in silico approaches to predict and describe the repertoire of P. infestans secreted proteins (the secretome). We defined the "plastic secretome" as a subset of the genome that (i) encodes predicted secreted proteins, (ii) is excluded from genome segments orthologous to the P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes and (iii) is encoded by genes residing in gene sparse regions of P. infestans genome. Although including only ~ 3 % of P. infestans genes, the plastic secretome contains ~ 62 % of known effector genes and shows > 2 fold enrichment in genes induced in planta. We highlight 19 plastic secretome genes induced in planta but distinct from previously described effectors. This list includes a trypsin-like serine protease, secreted oxidoreductases, small cysteine-rich proteins and repeat containing proteins that we propose to be novel candidate virulence factors. Conclusions This work revealed a remarkably diverse plastic secretome. It illustrates the value of combining genome architecture with comparative genomics to identify novel candidate virulence factors from pathogen genomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Epigean and cave {{populations of}} A. fasciatus (Characidae, Pisces) differ {{in a series}} of {{morphological}} physiological, and ethological features. The interfertility of these populations made possible a genetic analysis of organs characteristic of interspecific divergence. The study of the regressive organs “eye” and “melanophore system” {{on the one hand and}} that of the constructively improved “gustatory equipment 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 feeding behaviour” on the other yielded identical principles of genetic manifestation: (1) All features have a polygenic basis with an at least di- to hexahybrid inheritance. (2) All polygenes have the same amount of expressivity. (3) After recombination of a minimum number of <b>genes,</b> <b>discontinuous</b> distributions (threshold effects) develop. (4) All features are independently inherited. (5) The genes responsible for a feature are unspecific. In the case of the eye this means that no “lens-” or “retinagenes” are analyzed; due to developmentally physiological interdependence within complex structures, only so-called “eye-genes” have as yet been described. Because of the developmentally physiological interdependence of complex organs, the process of reduction proceeds as a diminution in size, that of constructive evolution as enlargement. In both cases different allometric correlations of the single structures can be found. The convergent reduction of eyes in cave animals is caused by the loss of stabilizing selection which normally keeps the eye in its appropriate adapted form. It is not directional selection pressure, like f. ex. energy economy, but mutation pressure that causes eye reduction. By this, random mutations, which are mostly of deleterious character, are accumulated. The principles of regressive evolution are not restricted to the development of cave species. The absence of stabilizing selection regularly occurs during transitional evolutionary phases. These are f. ex. initial stages of speciation which may be observed when biotopes with little or no interspecific competition are colonized by an invader. Genotypic and phenotypic variability now arise and equilibria become punctuated, because stabilizing selection for a specific ecological niche which has once been acquired by the invading species is no longer acting. Examples include the evolution of species flocks in geologically young lakes or oceanic islands. Rapidly increasing variability now secondarily provides the material for directional selection which radiates such species into vacant niches. Genetic threshold effects as described above may accelerate this process. Variability will finally become lower again under the influence of inter- and intraspecific competition. A new equilibrium is attained...|$|R
