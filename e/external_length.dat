We inves-tigated the critical reflectivity at which the stable fixed output power evolves into periodic oscillation. As a result, {{we found that the}} critical reflectivity shows a periodic structure against the <b>external</b> cavity <b>length</b> and the stability is much enhanced at the periodic peak positions. The stability and dynamic behaviors of a semiconductor laser with PCF are compared with those for conventional optical feedback. It is also found that the periods of the nearby peaks correspond to the frequency of the laser relaxation oscillation frequency and the stable peaks for the PCF are located at <b>external</b> <b>lengths</b> completely out of phase from those for the conventional feedback. The linear stability analysis by using the rate equations is performed and the theoretical background for the stability is also given.

The roots of the body sclerites were significantly narrower than the sclerites, but the spines had roots about as wide as their bases; both types of root were made of fairly soft tissue. They bore protrusive, presumably structural, ribs on their upper and (seemingly) lower surfaces. The sclerites and spines were not mineralized, but made of a tough organic (carbon-based) biopolymer. Butterfield (1990) examined some sclerites under both optical and scanning electron microscopes and concluded that they were not hollow, and that the bases split and spread to form the blades, a pattern that is also seen in monocot leaves. The sclerites bear an internal fabric of longitudinal chambers, which suggest that they were secreted from their bases in the manner of Lophotrochozoan sclerites.|$|E

40|$|In optical {{lithography}} industry, mask pattern is first fractured into basic trapezoids, and then fabricated by the variable shaped beam mask writing machine. Ideally, mask fracture tools aim at suppressing the trapezoid count {{in order to}} speed up the writing time, and minimizing the <b>external</b> sliver <b>length</b> in order to improve CD uniformity.

In the proposed approach, the mask layout is first decomposed into elemental rectangles by the rays emitted from each concave corner.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the external cavity laser diode are investigated. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} short external cavity configuration. The general governing model equations which include the multiple reflection effect are derived. It is shown that the coupling coefficient becomes a complex function of the <b>external</b> cavity <b>length</b> and the near field beam size of the laser diode due to the diffraction loss of an open resonator. The validity of this open resonator model is proven experimentally by the asymmetry in optical power versus <b>external</b> cavity <b>length</b> characteristic curve. For analysis of the ultra short external cavity laser, it is necessary to include this complex coupling coefficient. As an example, the flying optical disk head is studied using this model. In some cases, especially when the <b>external</b> cavity <b>length</b> is longer than several micrometers, the external cavity may be simply regarded as a lossy resonator. With this constant loss per roundtrip approximation, the feedback operator can be reduced to the closed form. The stationary and transient solutions are investigated analytically and numerically. The single mode condition, and dynamical stability condition are derived. Also, the simple expression for the relaxation oscillation frequency of the short external cavity laser is given for the first time. With our model, it {{can not be expected to}} find the strange attractor for the constant biased autonomous operation. However, the chaotic behavior in the current modulated nonautonomous operation is investigated. It seems that the route to chaos in this system is not limited to the period-doubling route, which has been believed as the only route in the modulated solitary laser diode so far. Generally, it is suggested that the operating <b>external</b> cavity <b>length</b> should be close to the constructive interference position, as it will give superior properties.

40|$|The {{strength}} of most metals used {{in daily life}} scales with either an internal or <b>external</b> <b>length</b> scale.

Here we develop a model which gives quantitative insight into the scaling exponent using the known universal properties of a dislocation network and the leading order stress dependence of an underlying critical stress distribution.

40|$|Publisher's copy made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the publisherIt has been suggested that the appropriate length of insertion for double-lumen tubes can be estimated by external measurement. This study examined the accuracy of external measurement in estimating the actual length of insertion required in 130 patients. It also examined the relationship between the length inserted and the patient’s height in 126 patients and their weight in 125 patients. Although there was a fair correlation between the measured <b>external</b> <b>length</b> and the final inserted length (r= 0. 61), the 95 % confidence intervals of slope and intercept allowed a large variation and the prediction was too wide to be clinically useful. Height was reasonably well correlated with the final length (r= 0. 51) but an equally wide 95 % confidence interval rendered it of little clinical value. There was no correlation between weight and final tube length. It is concluded that external measurement alone is not adequate to predict a clinically acceptable position of the double-lumen tube. R.
