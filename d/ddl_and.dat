25|$|In 1949, OSAS gave {{a profit}} of SEK31,000, but all the {{national}} airlines had losses, with Aerotransport losing most at SEK10.7 million. In political circles, there was an increasing understanding that the Swedish model with an equal private and state ownership should be followed by <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL. At the time, the Danish state owned 17.6% of <b>DDL,</b> <b>and</b> the Norwegian state 20% of DNL. As both companies were in need of increased share capital, processes were started whereby both governments would purchase shares to increase their ownership to 50%. Both the Danish and the Norwegian states bought shares for NOK and DDK14 million, respectively, while in Norway private investors bought for additional NOK11 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{procurement}} of ten {{aircraft was}} more than initially needed by SILA, so negotiations were held with <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL about selling some of the aircraft to them. Because the owners of DNL {{were not able to}} hold meetings and the airline inactive, and {{in part because of the}} transfer of Norwegian negotiation power to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board, DNL did not attempt to procure any aircraft. Still, negotiations continued between the flag carriers, and DNL stated in 1944 that they were interested in procuring some aircraft. US authorities urged the Scandinavian airlines to make a common bid for the traffic rights, and the flag carriers started discussing creating a consortium. Among the issues was the distribution of ownership: DDL suggested a 40% stake for SILA and 30% for <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL, with the latter two granting Aero 10% if they should join; DNL proposed an equal ownership between the three.|$|E
25|$|The first {{discussion}} of a Scandinavian transatlantic route was in 1933, when <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> Aerotransport conducted discussions with Charles Lindbergh. However, no specific plans were made. For Denmark, part of the interest was spurred {{with the possibility of}} reaching Greenland. DDL started a partnership with British interests, creating European & American Airways, which was planned to operate transatlantic flights from Denmark via United Kingdom. The company was inaugurated on 21 October 1935 in London, with GBP5,000 in share capital. While the company remained in existence until the late 1940s, it never operated any aircraft.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, DNL had no assets or personnel, while DDL had {{a single}} {{airworthy}} aircraft. SILA, on the other hand, had a fleet of intercontinental B-17 aircraft and started flights to New York on 27 June. By 1946, the DC-4 were gradually delivered, with three sold to Aerotransport, two to <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> two to DNL. In Norway, the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board and the Royal Norwegian Air Force conducted all flights in 1945. Capital was raised during the year, including a 20% stake by the government, and a 20-year concession was granted in February 1946.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations between DNL, <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> Aerotransport to {{consolidate}} their transatlantic operations started on 2 February 1946. Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik had started services from Stockholm to New York, but a consortium was discussed whereby the three airlines would pool their operations to create economy of scale. Disagreement existed over which airport {{should be used}} as a hub. The Swedish government did not want to participate with less than a 50% share, and preferably as a majority owner. It was stated that this was because they had half the population and the only organization capable of operating intercontinental routes. On 1 August, Overseas Scandinavian Airlines System was established, where DNL received a 2/7 ownership. The consortium received its head office in Stockholm, but would also serve Copenhagen and Oslo with intercontinental flights.|$|E
25|$|When the Swedish {{delegation}} {{returned to}} Stockholm, they were instructed {{by the government}} and Aerotransport to set higher demands. The Swedish government did not want to participate with less than a 50% share, and preferably as a majority owner. It was stated that this was because they had half the population and the only organization capable of operating intercontinental routes. They also required a pool solution with employees in the national companies. When the parties met in Copenhagen on 25 June, the Swedish demands were rejected and the meeting quickly dissolved, with <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL stating that they would establish their own consortium. SILA was willing to accept the Danish–Norwegian terms, and even threatened to liquidate themselves—and thereby eliminate all private capital from the Swedish airlines—if Aerotransport did not compromise. Another meeting was held on 18 July, without any progress.|$|E

5|$|The DDL project's {{problems}} harmed the Australian shipbuilding industry. The {{cancellation of}} both the <b>DDLs</b> <b>and</b> another project to develop an Australian fast combat support ship design led to a perception that technical risks needed to be minimised when selecting new warships, and it was preferable to rely on proven foreign designs. Australian industry was also left with a bad impression as companies {{involved in the project}} had devoted considerable resources to preparing tenders for the DDL.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the issues}} of the negotiations, was the need for a {{workshop}} that met American standards. At the time, only Aerotransport had such facilities, although DDL planned to establish one at Copenhagen Airport. Initially the US had also required a single counter-party, in a consortium, but this was later withdrawn, so the airlines were free to instead establish a pool. However, the advantages of the consortium were preferred by the negotiators, because it would remove the nationality from the employees and operations. A holistic proposal was launched on 7 June, where <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL would receive two parts ownership, and SILA three parts; each partner would receive two board members. All employees would work for the consortium, while the aircraft were to be leased from the partners. The head office was to be located in Stockholm.|$|E
25|$|In August 1946, Torsten Nilsson {{suggested}} merging Aerotransport and SILA, {{but this}} had been rejected by both companies. A meeting was held on 28 May 1947 with the main owners of SILA, where Nilsson proposed a 50–50 state–private ownership in a merged company. While both parties saw the advantage of merging to rationalize operations, neither party was willing to let the other receive the chair. At the time, Aerotransport had just ordered ten DC-6 and was planning to start intercontinental flights to Africa and Asia. The minister appointed Torsten Nothin to lead a board to make a recommendation, and then negotiate with SILA's owners for a merger. One issue was that the Swedes perceived that the privately owned <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL would not agree with a nationalization of SILA. The Swedish government chose not to contact the two other social democratic Scandinavian governments about partially nationalizing their own flag carriers.|$|E
25|$|The only lack of {{permission}} {{was from}} the Scandinavian authorities, from which the delegation had not had time to receive permission before it left. However, on 5 March, Aerotransport, <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL made an agreement with Pan Am to operate a route using a Boeing 314 Clipper flying boat from New York via Botwood and Reykjavík to Bergen. It was the American authorities who wanted a landing in Iceland, and Bergen was chosen instead of Stavanger because the latter lay within the area defined by American authorities {{as part of the}} war zone. The route would commence during the summer and operate eight times, with twelve services the following year. The aircraft was chartered from Pan Am for USD15,000 per trip. All formalities with external parties were completed on 12 March, and the operations approved by the board of the three Scandinavian airlines on 6 April. Representatives from the Scandinavian delegation visited Douglas, Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney, and planned to use Douglas DC-4 land planes from 1942, with up to two weekly round trips.|$|E

25|$|The airline {{suffered}} from a general mistrust both from the German and Allied authorities. The Germans generally did not trust any shipowners, since these had their fleet organized in Nortraship and used in Allied convoys. The Norwegian authorities in exile were also distrustful of DNL, because the airline had taken initiative to operate a route, essentially helping the German forces. There was also an uncertainty {{as to whether the}} national airline of Norway should continue to be private, or if a state-owned airline should be established. To look at the issue, the Norwegian authorities-in-exile established the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board to look at all matters regarding civil aviation. It was this board which was permitted to negotiate traffic rights with other countries, make purchase rights of aircraft and participated in the foundation of the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Swedish intercontinental airline, Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik managed to purchase ten Douglas DC-4 {{at the end of the}} war; they had initially planned on selling some to <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL, but were not permitted to negotiate any agreements with DNL.|$|E

In 1946, Overseas Scandinavian Airlines System had been established between DNL, <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> the Swedish Aerotransport. The same year, shipowner Ludvig G. Braathen established Braathens South American and Far East (Braathens SAFE), which started with charter flights using DC-4s. The first civilian route was operated by KLM, who started the route Oslo–Kristiansand–Amsterdam in March 1946. From 1 April, DNL operated a route to Copenhagen, followed a week later with the route via Stavanger to London, using DC-3s. The third DNL route was to Stockholm using Ju 52s, and the fourth via Gothenburg and Copenhagen to Zurich and Marseilles. In May, DNL started routes to Trondheim and Tromsø, and later onwards to Kirkenes. It also started a direct service to Copenhagen. In October, routes were established via Kristiansand to Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris. Finally, a route was started via Copenhagen to Prague and to Stavanger. In 1946, DNL had 47,000 passengers (although not all flew through Fornebu). The company operated six DC-3s and five Ju 52s.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) {{juxtapose}} {{components of}} well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDL) and nonlipogenic sarcoma. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) {{is no longer}} considered a homogeneous entity, but rather as the common morphologic appearance of various subtypes of sarcomas. The objectives of the current retrospective study were: 1 (to analyze the relation between <b>DDLs</b> <b>and</b> tumors previously diagnosed as MFHs; 2) to trace the evolution of liposarcomas, and 3) to assess the consequences of dedifferentiation. METHODS: Between 1974 and 2001, 86 patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma (61 patients) or MFH (25 patients) underwent surgery at Institut Bergonie in Bordeaux, France. Histologic review was performed and tumors reclassified as WDL or DDL were retained for further clinicohistologic study. Subsequently, initial presentation and all recurrences were analyzed. RESULTS: The 61 liposarcomas consisted of 21 WDLs and 35 DDLs; 17 MFHs were reclassified as DDL. In all, {{approximately half of the}} retroperitoneal liposarcomas and MFHs were found to be DDLs. The DDLs presented with a smaller size (20 cm vs. 30 cm; P =. 05) but a lower rate of complete resection (72 % vs. 90 %; P =. 015) and remission (72 % vs. 100 %; P =. 0015). Dedifferentiated recurrence was evidenced in 7 WDLs. Ten DDLs presented with metastatic evolution. DDLs demonstrated a tendency toward lower rates of 5 -year overall survival (55 % vs. 82 %; P =. 075). CONCLUSIONS: Most occurrences of retroperitoneal liposarcomas and MFHs are in fact <b>DDLs</b> <b>and</b> dedifferentiated recurrence of WDLs is frequent. Retroperitoneal DDLs present a lower rate of complete remission than WDLs and a risk of metastatic recurrence. Therefore, extensive histologic analysis of WDLs is required to identify an undifferentiated component and avoid misdiagnosis of DDL...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{ontology}} querying is of a crucial importance for a practically usable semantic web. Recent research in standard Description Logics {{has produced a}} number of algorithms and implementations for reasoning with instances for answering ontological queries. In this work, we extend these techniques to enable a querying of distributed heterogeneous ontologies with heterogeneous populations. We follow a peer-to-peer paradigm that of combining local ontology query answering with answering over other semantically related ontologies. Our approach is formally grounded on Distributed Description Logics (<b>DDLs)</b> <b>and</b> limited to the instance retrieval queries. The contribution of the paper is twofold. From the theoretical perspective we extend the semantics of DDLs with instances which allows to define an instance retrieval algorithm. From the practical hand, we describe how the proposed algorithm can be implemented on top of DRAGO distributed reasoner. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{determine}} probiotic properties, 137 strains of lactic acid bacteria from the feces of Creole goats were screened, only six were resistant to pH 2. 0 and bile salts (0. 3 %). Three strains identified as Lactobacillus and two as Enterococcus showed agglutination with the treated yeast. Between them, Lactobacillus DDL 17, DDL 19, <b>DDL</b> 48 <b>and</b> Enterococcus DDE 39 demonstrated high specificity in this test because the correspondent agglutination was inhibited by one sugar, suggesting {{the presence of a}} lectin-like structure in their cell walls, which could be due to adhesion ability. Another Enterococcus strain (DDE 55) showed low affinity because five sugars inhibited the agglutination of the treated yeasts. The results of hydrophobic properties showed that the strains who were able to agglutinate yeasts presented similar hydrophobic characteristics as hexadecane, xylene and toluene, but high specificity was not related to a high hydrophobicity. Only two strains (Lactobacillus <b>DDL</b> 19 <b>and</b> <b>DDL</b> 48) showed aggregation with the lowest concentration of ammonium sulfate, complementing the hydrophobicity assay. Only one strain, Lactobacillus DDL 48, showed an inhibition against an enteric indicator strain (Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O 111).
