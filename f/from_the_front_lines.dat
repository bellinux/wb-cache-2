5|$|As {{discussion}} continued, {{the battalion}} was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> leaving Task Force Wahl on 23 January. It returned to 12th Armored Division, where three platoons {{were committed to}} combat to support the fighting in the Colmar Pocket {{in the first week}} of February. The remainder of the battalion was kept in reserve, where the disciplinary problems, including assaults on civilians, grew to the point at which the commander had to request outside assistance to restore control on 5 February. The battalion was removed from its attachment to the 12th Armored on 12 February—by request of the divisional command—and withdrawn to the rear area of XV Corps to take up guard duties.|$|E
5|$|Fences and Windows: Dispatches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Lines</b> of the Globalization Debate is a 2002 book by Canadian {{journalist}} Naomi Klein {{and editor}} Debra Ann Levy. The {{book is a}} collection of newspaper articles, mostly from The Globe and Mail, with a few magazine articles from The Nation and speech transcripts. The articles and speeches were all written by Klein in the 30 months after the publication of her first book, No Logo (1999), from December 1999 to March 2002. The articles focus upon the anti-globalization movement, including protest events and responses by law enforcement. The book was published in North America and the United Kingdom in October 2002.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry Division was an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} United States Army. It was inactivated in October 1996, it was based at Fort Stewart, Georgia and later reactivated at Fort Riley, Kansas. Formed during World War II from the disbanding Hawaiian Division, the division saw action throughout the Pacific theater, first fighting in New Guinea before landing on the Philippine islands of Leyte and Luzon, driving Japanese forces from them. Following {{the end of the}} war, the division participated in occupation duties in Japan, and was the first division to respond at the outbreak of the Korean War. For the first 18 months of the war, the division was heavily engaged on the front lines with North Korean and Chinese forces, suffering over 10,000 casualties. It was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> to the reserve force {{for the remainder of the}} war, but returned to Korea for patrol duty at the end of major combat operations.|$|E

5|$|Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam {{shortly before}} the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive {{displaced}} hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated DetachmentS, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo. As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, DetachmentS was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, DetachmentS had carried 1,100refugees and 900tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4and 17April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led Operation Babylift. In late April, two of No.37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated DetachmentN. The C-130Es began operations on 3May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91sorties for the UN. Aircraft of DetachmentS evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, {{shortly before the}}y fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. DetachmentN also evacuated the Australian embassy in Vientiane, Laos, during early June 1975.|$|E

Scott flew cargo and personnel over The Hump from in both Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commandos and C-47 aircraft. With the war over, on December 16, 1945, Scott returned to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Manchester was {{the home}} {{of one of the}} first colleges in Carroll County when, in 1858, Irving College, named after poet Washington Irving, was {{established}} by Dr. Ferdinand Dieffenbach. During the Civil War the success of the school was greatly hampered by the death of Dr. Dieffenbach and the low number of young men returning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> The school changed its name to Irving Institute in 1886 and finally ceased operation by 1893.|$|E

25|$|Together they crafted jazz-influenced {{soul and}} funk that brought new depth and {{political}} consciousness to '70s music alongside Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. In classic albums such as Winter in America and From South Africa to South Carolina, Scott-Heron took {{the news of}} the day and transformed it into social commentary, wicked satire, and proto-rap anthems. He updated his dispatches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> of the inner city on tour, improvising lyrics with an improvisational daring that matched the jazz-soul swirl of the music".|$|E
25|$|The {{medical orderly}} was {{originally}} believed, including by Moore-Jones, {{to be the}} Australian John Simpson Kirkpatrick, {{who served in the}} early stages of the Gallipoli Campaign before being killed by a sniper and who was well known for his use of donkeys to transport wounded soldiers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> However, by 1937 it became known that the man the subject of the photograph on which the painting was based on was not Simpson but Richard Alexander Henderson, a stretcher-bearer in the New Zealand Medical Corps.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, the War Department {{finally began}} to check the {{suitability}} of deputy paymasters with a physical examination, and tests to evaluate mental and moral fitness. Most paymasters in the field were political appointees and those looking for a safer job away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> When Brice took charge in 1864, the regulations were finally brought up to date, and officially included the examination of candidates. This {{took the form of}} writing a business letter, solving mathematical problems, and knowledge of accounting and pay systems.|$|E

25|$|Recognised {{for their}} value as {{observation}} platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons {{contributed to the}} development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.|$|E
25|$|When the Second World War broke out, Lee {{volunteered to}} fight for the Finnish forces during the Winter War in 1939. He and other British volunteers were kept away from actual fighting, but they were issued winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe {{distance}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> After a fortnight, they returned home. Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing. In early 1940, he joined Beecham's, at first as an office clerk, then as a switchboard operator. When Beecham's moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard. In the winter, his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941. Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force.|$|E
25|$|The {{core of the}} Assyrian army lay in its chariots. Originally these chariots {{were used}} as two-horse vehicles. The Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians used war chariots in this fashion as firing mobile {{platforms}} or as mobile command platforms; the elevated view would give the general some ability {{to see how the}} troops fared in battle. The Assyrians also used chariots in reconnaissance, carrying messages to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines,</b> ans for battle. However, the rise of cavalry in the 1st millennium BC meant that by the 7th century BC, the chariot was demoted to combat duties only; lighter chariots consisting of two to three horses were later upgraded under the reign of Ashurnasirpal II to heavy four horse chariots. Such chariots could contain up to four men. Heavier chariots also found new roles, smashing into enemy formations and dispersing the infantry in the process. The Assyrian cavalry and infantry would then be able to exploit the gap and rout the enemy, thereby taking the battlefield.|$|E
