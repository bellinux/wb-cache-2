5|$|Written {{at a time}} of {{religious}} upheaval, and {{in the wake of the}} English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy, where they present a contradiction of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.|$|E

25|$|In {{solving a}} subsonic problem, one {{decision}} {{to be made by}} the aerodynamicist <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of density in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the Mach number in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102m) per second or 228 miles (366km) per hour at 60°F (16°C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the lines}} of {{difference}} in interpretation <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> treat the regressors as random variables, or as predefined constants. In the first case (random design) the regressors xi are random and sampled together with the yis from some population, as in an observational study. This approach allows for more natural study of the asymptotic properties of the estimators. In the other interpretation (fixed design), the regressors X are treated as known constants set by a design, and y is sampled conditionally on the values of X as in an experiment. For practical purposes, this distinction is often unimportant, since estimation and inference is carried out while conditioning on X. All results stated {{in this article are}} within the random design framework.|$|E

25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, the question is what should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the writers}} {{had to work}} around the {{established}} characters and chronology from the comic series. In the first episode, for example, the player is introduced to Hershel Greene, who is established in the comics as a bitter character due to witnessing his son Shawn turn into a walker {{in the early stages}} of the outbreak. One of the first decisions the player makes <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> save Shawn or Duck; however, either choice results in Shawn being bitten, so as to maintain the comic's continuity; only the manner in which he is bitten is changed. The major consequence aspect of the choice instead involves how Kenny feels towards Lee. In other cases, Telltale designed scenes and choices knowing how the majority of players would be predisposed to certain characters. One example is the character of Larry, who is introduced in the first episode as a hard-nosed jerk. Based on the statistical feedback, Telltale recognized that most players would want to either abandon or kill Larry at the first opportunity, and as such, they created a conversation tree in episode two where Lilly goes some way to redeem Larry in the eyes of the player. The idea was that this might influence the player when they must choose whether to help Kenny kill Larry, who may, or may not, have died from a heart attack and be on the verge of turning. Telltale found that 75% of the players now wanted to save Larry, a result they had expected.|$|E
500|$|Bach did {{not give}} a direct {{indication}} of how many singers he envisaged in the choir. [...] The cantata can be performed with only four singers, as in the recording by Joshua Rifkin, who {{is well known in}} the world of Bach performance for his [...] "one voice to a part" [...] approach. However, most recordings feature a choir with multiple voices to a part. [...] Another choice to be made <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> use women singers: Bach's original singers were probably all male. [...] Most recordings of the cantata, however, feature mixed choirs: an exception is the version conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, which deploys boys' voices as the top lines of the choir.|$|E

500|$|Reading's {{municipal}} boundaries {{do not include}} all of the surrounding suburbs, some of which (Tilehurst, Calcot, Earley and Woodley) are, at least partly within West Berkshire or Wokingham Borough. This unusual configuration creates difficulties. The diminishing amount of land available and suitable for development within the borough's boundary can bring the council into conflict with its neighbours' development plans. This particularly affects education (many schools have catchment areas that cross administrative boundaries), and transport. A perennial example <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> construct a third road crossing of the Thames, which South Oxfordshire's politicians and residents oppose. On this subject, Rob Wilson, then MP for Reading East, said in a House of Commons debate in January 2006: ...|$|E

If the Misseriya Arabs are prevented from voting, the region will likely go to South Sudan. While the Dinka Ngok and Messiria tribe maintained a peaceful coexistence during the civil war, the division of Sudan has created mistrust between the two people.|$|E

2500|$|Reflexivity: A {{basic choice}} in {{defining}} a mereological system, <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> consider {{things to be}} parts of themselves. In naive set theory a similar question arises: whether a set is {{to be considered a}} [...] "subset" [...] of itself. In both cases, [...] "yes" [...] gives rise to paradoxes analogous to Russell's paradox: Let there be an object O such that every object that is not a proper part of itself is a proper part of O. Is O a proper part of itself? No, because no object is a proper part of itself; and yes, because it meets the specified requirement for inclusion as a proper part of O. In set theory, a set is often termed an improper subset of itself. Given such paradoxes, mereology requires an axiomatic formulation.|$|E
2500|$|The Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure ("TMEP") {{states the}} test for {{applying}} the doctrine of foreign equivalents is [...] "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent". With respect to descriptive or generic marks, the TMEP specifies that in determining whether a foreign term is entitled to registration, [...] "he test <b>is</b> <b>whether,</b> <b>to</b> those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would have a descriptive or generic connotation". However, [...] "foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public {{that they should not}} be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes." [...] This test is also applied by courts to determine [...] "whether that foreign word would be descriptive of the product to that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{consumer}} markets, {{another key}} strategic level decision <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> use a push or pull strategy. In a push strategy, the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, {{with the expectation}} that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a pull strategy, the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel. [...] The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer-oriented media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.|$|E

2500|$|One {{area which}} English law takes outside the {{ordinary}} law of misrepresentation {{is what is}} typically called [...] "mistakes" [...] about identity. In this group of cases, the common fact pattern is that Alice gives a valuable good to Bob thinking that Bob will pay. Bob is a fraudster and has misrepresented his identity or creditworthiness or both, and has left Alice with a dud cheque, or simply does not fulfil a promise to pay later. The valuable good is then sold by Bob to Claire. Bob disappears and cannot be charged for fraud. Alice finds that Claire has the valuable good and sues Claire to get back the good. The dilemma courts face <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> prefer one innocent party over another innocent party. Alice has {{been a victim of}} fraudulent misrepresentation. Claire is also defrauded in the sense that Bob represented to her that he had good title to the good he sold on. Claire has paid good money for the good. But because Bob cannot be found, Alice has no remedy.|$|E
