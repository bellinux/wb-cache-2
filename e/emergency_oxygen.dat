5|$|On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf Air Force Base crashed, {{killing the}} pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were {{restricted}} to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash {{was attributed to}} a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the <b>emergency</b> <b>oxygen</b> system. Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement handle of the <b>emergency</b> <b>oxygen</b> system was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis audit {{aimed to}} observe the {{management}} of acute asthma by primary and secondary care within a Health District. Asthma attacks occurring during the first 6 weeks of 1996 to patients {{between the ages of}} 3 and 74 years in Canterbury and Thanet District were notified by general practitioners, out-of-hours co-operatives and hospitals. Data were obtained retrospectively from the patient records. A total of 378 episodes was registered: 342 (90 %) to primary care. Of these 234 (76 % of patients aged 6 years or over) had a peak flow recorded; 114 (30 %) were given <b>emergency</b> bronchodilation: <b>oxygen</b> was not used in primary care; 204 (54 %) were given systemic steroids; and 43 (11 %) were referred for hospital care of whom 36 were admitted.

Twenty-eight patients presented with ‘life-threatening’ asthma: 20 (71 %) were given <b>emergency</b> bronchodilation; <b>oxygen</b> was used in only two; 24 (86 %) were given systemic steroids; and six (21 %) were referred for admission.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: The {{initiation}} of oxygen therapy for acute or chronic respiratory failure {{is a common}} medical intervention, both for hospital in-patients and in out-of-hospital <b>emergency</b> settings. <b>Oxygen</b> therapy is also frequently initiated by paramedics or nurses, without any initial medical prescription, in acutely ill patients. STATE OF THE ART/PERSPECTIVES: It {{is important to remember}} that oxygen is a pharmaceutical drug, and its prescription should therefore be considered within treatment guidelines. Two main pathological situations may be encountered: tissue hypoxia and acute/chronic hypoxemia. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the clinical signs that may indicate the presence of hypoxia and the pathological situations that may lead to hypoxemia. They must also be aware of the potential complications, in particular CO(2) retention in patients with chronic type II respiratory failure as well as the overall indications, and practical issues concerning oxygen therapy...|$|R

40|$|Self Contained Oxygen Generators (SCOGs) have {{widespread}} use in providing <b>emergency</b> breathing <b>oxygen</b> {{in a variety}} of environments including mines, submarines, spacecraft, and aircraft. These devices have definite advantages over storing of gaseous or liquid oxygen.

These devices are typically very safe to store, easy to operate, and have primarily only a thermal hazard to the operator that can be controlled by barriers or furnaces. Tens of thousands of these devices are operated worldwide every year without major incident. This report examines the rare case of a SCOG whose behavior was both abnormal and lethal. This particular type of SCOG reviewed is nearly identical to a flight qualified version of SCOG slated for use on manned space vehicles. This Investigative Report is a compilation of a NASA effort in conjunction with other interested parties including military and aerospace to understand the causes of the particular SCOG accident and what preventative measures can be taken to ensure this incident is not repeated. This report details the incident and examines the root causes of the observed SCOG behavior from forensic evidence.

40|$|Introduction. Drowning is {{a leading}} {{preventable}} cause of unintentional morbidity and mortality. The dominant pathophysiological mechanism of drowning includes the development of acute hypoxia. First aid. The rescue procedure of a drowning person includes careful pulling the victim out of the water, examination, maintenance of the airways passable and urgent transfer to hospital. Basic life support. The {{first and most important}} treatment option of a drowning victim is the provision of ventilation which increases the chances of survival. As soon as the unresponsive victim is removed from the water, the lay rescuer should immediately begin chest compressions and provide cycles of ventilations and compressions. Some recent investigations have revealed that exterior compression of the chest is a necessary measure even in a situation when by­standers cannot provide airway. It is recommended to train by­standers to provide basic life support and apply automated external defibrillator in a drowning person whenever indicated and as early as possible. Advanced life support. In drowning, the victim with cardiac arrest requires advanced life support, including an early intubation. Extended medical measures, which are primarily provided by medical professionals, include cervical spine immobilization in case a spinal injury is suspected, or, establishment of the ventilation with <b>oxygen,</b> <b>emergency</b> transport, application of reanimation and advanced vital support measures...|$|R

Methods: A retrospective medical record audit was conducted at four public and one private ED in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were 273 adult ED patients with COPD presenting with a primary complaint of shortness of breath from July 2006 to July 2007. Outcome measures were physiological data, including oxygen saturation (SpO 2), oxygen delivery devices and flow rates on ED arrival, 1 and 4 h. Results: Oxygen was used in 82. 0 % of patients. Patients who required oxygen had higher incidence of ambulance transport (P 90 % occurred in the majority of patients (87. 5 %; 96. 4 %; 95. 6 %); however, a considerable number of patients with SpO 2 < 90 % were not given oxygen (61. 8 %; 30 %; 45. 5 %).

A 12 -lead electrocardiogram should be performed within 10 minutes of <b>emergency</b> department arrival. <b>Oxygen,</b> nitroglycerin, analgesia, dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation drugs should be given immediately.
