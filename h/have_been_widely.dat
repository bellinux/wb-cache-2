5|$|Andrés Torrón of El Observador noted a {{similarity}} between Almendra and Pink Floyd's 1967 album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Almendra lyrics (primarily by Spinetta) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>widely</b> studied for their lyricism, poetic quality, precise use of language, and rich visual imagery; {{as well as}} the innovation of singing them in Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>widely</b> known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E

The rise in her personal wealth and that of her party have been criticised as indicative of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Moodu Pani was {{the third}} directorial venture of Mahendra and his second Tamil film after Azhiyatha Kolangal (1979). It also marked Mohan's debut in Tamil cinema. Moodu Pani was shot mostly in Bangalore and Ooty. The film's {{similarities}} to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and the Oedipal elements between Chandru and his mother <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>widely</b> discussed. The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, this being his 100th film, and his brother Gangai Amaran was the main lyricist.|$|E

5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>widely</b> noted.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>widely</b> worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|High {{figures for}} tanks lost {{during the battle}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>widely</b> {{attributed}} to the Germans, but these are incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of the battle stated that the Germans lost 350–400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500–10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported that the Germans lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data of the German units involved show that much lower losses were incurred during the battle.|$|E
5|$|RAF Chinooks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>widely</b> {{deployed}} {{in support of}} British military engagements, serving their first wartime role in Operation Corporate, the Falklands War, in 1982. Chinooks were used in Operation Granby in the 1991 Gulf War, attached to large peace-keeping commitments in the Balkans, the continued British presence in Afghanistan, and in Operation Telic in the 2003 Iraq War. They provide routine supply and support missions to the British military, notably in Operation Banner in Northern Ireland. The helicopter has also been of use in military humanitarian missions and the extraction of civilians from warzones, such as the evacuation of Sierra Leone in 2000, and the evacuation from Lebanon in 2006.|$|E
