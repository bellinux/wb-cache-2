50|$|In September 1940 the Air Ministry {{decided that}} certain {{stations}} would be designated as emergency airfields. These stations would give assistance to any operational aircraft returning damaged or with engine problems. The Station Commander at RAF Upper Heyford received {{one of these}} orders. RAF Brackley (Croughton) would remain open with its <b>flare</b> <b>paths</b> illuminated irrespective of enemy activity in the area. This meant that RAF Brackley along with other emergency airfields attracted additional enemy night attacks. Added to this accepted high risk {{was the fact that}} RAF Brackley was a training airfield. During the war both sides considered it worthwhile to attack and disrupt training programs. Because training fields and aircraft were lightly defended, they made for easier targets. For these reasons, it was not uncommon for the station or training crews conducting night training to receive the attention of the Luftwaffe.|$|R
50|$|Magma {{can store}} a {{different}} range of objects: files, directories, symbolic links, block and characted devices, FIFO pipes. Each object {{is bound to}} a flare and vice versa. A flare of any type in the six listed above is described by some basic properties common to all <b>flares,</b> like a <b>path</b> and a hash key. But {{each of the six}} types has also its own specific properties. For example, directory flares will have some specific information that don't apply to symbolic links. A flare with only generic information is called uncast while a complete flare is called cast.|$|R
30|$|Using LWPC simulation, McRae and Thomson (2004) {{estimated}} {{a decrease}} in H′ of 12  km {{and an increase in}} β of 0.13  km− 1 relative to their normal daytime values for an X 3.0 class flare on the NLK to Dunedin, New Zealand, path. For another class X 5 <b>flare</b> for this <b>path,</b> they estimated a 13  km decrease in H′ and the same increase in β. Recently, Kumar et al. (2015) estimated a decrease of 9.4  km in H′ and an increase of 0.126  km− 1 in β for an X 1.5 class flare on the NPM–Suva path. According to Thomson et al.

25|$|An {{additional}} raid to Italy on 8/9 November 1940 was aborted when a Junkers Ju 88 of the Luftwaffe {{dropped a}} stick of bombs {{along the length of}} the <b>flare</b> <b>path</b> as four Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys, including James's aircraft, were waiting to take off at RAF Honington, Suffolk.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of McCairns missions were successful. Perhaps his most dangerous mission {{was on the}} night of 14/15 April 1943 when an operator choose a field near Amboise that did not have a clear <b>flare</b> <b>path.</b> As he came in for his landing approach he struck a twelve-foot-tall poplar tree. McCairns asked the operator what the damage was and he was told none, only the radio aerial had been torn away. Without climbing down to inspect the damage for himself, McCairns took aboard his passengers and took off. He soon realised he had a more serious problem. The stick was shaking in his hand and his oil temperature was rising. Eventually the engine froze up. He began gliding down and decided they would all have to bail out. However, checking in with his passengers he was informed he was carrying four. Only having two parachutes in the back, he realized he would have to try a forced landing on the unknown ground below. With 3,000 feet to go he discovered the reason for the engine failure. The hot carburetor warmer had been knocked out of position. Once he corrected this he was able to restart the engine, and they resumed their rough flight back to RAF Tangmere. After landing it was discovered the spinner was stove in, and the tailplane had been nearly torn loose, held in place by the single remaining screw of a single bracket.|$|E
60|$|Then {{began the}} period of the {{greatest}} anxiety, for Trent and the boy and a handful of the others knew what would have sent half of the natives flying from their work if a whisper had got abroad. A few soldiers were drafted down from the Fort, arms were given out to all those who could be trusted to use them and by night men watched by the great red fires which <b>flared</b> along the <b>path</b> of their labours. Trent and the boy took it by turns to watch, their revolvers loaded by their side, and their eyes ever turned towards that dark line of forest whence came nothing but the singing of night birds and the calling of wild animals. Yet Trent would have no caution relaxed, the more they progressed, the more vigilant the watch they kept. At last came signs of the men of Bekwando. In the small hours of the morning a burning spear came hurtling through the darkness and fell with a hiss and a quiver in the ground, only a few feet from where Trent and the boy lay. Trent stamped on it hastily and gave no alarm. But the boy stole round with a whispered warning to those who could be trusted to fight.|$|R
40|$|The Mapper {{produces}} a compact summary of high dimensional data as a simplicial complex. We study {{the problem of}} quantifying the interestingness of subpopulations in a Mapper, which appear as long <b>paths,</b> <b>flares,</b> or loops. First, we create a weighted directed graph G using the 1 -skeleton of the Mapper. We use the average values at the vertices of a target function to direct edges (from low to high). The difference between the average values at vertices (high-low) is set as its weight. Covariation of the remaining h functions (independent variables) is captured by a h-bit binary signature assigned to the edge. An interesting path in G is a directed path whose edges {{all have the same}} signature. We define the interestingness score of such a path as a sum of its edge weights multiplied by a nonlinear function of their ranks in the path. Second, we study three optimization problems on this graph G. In the problem Max-IP, we seek an interesting path in G with the maximum interestingness score. We show that Max-IP is NP-complete. For the special case when G is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we show that Max-IP can be solved in polynomial time - in O(mnd_i) where d_i is the maximum indegree of a vertex in G. In the more general problem IP, the goal is to find a collection of interesting paths such that these paths form an exact cover of E (hence they are edge-disjoint) and the overall sum of interestingness scores of all paths is maximized. We also study a variant of IP termed k-IP, where the goal is to identify a collection of edge-disjoint interesting paths each with k edges, and the total interestingness score of all paths is maximized. While k-IP can be solved in polynomial time for k = 3. Further, we show that k-IP remains NP-complete for k >= 3 even for the case when G is a DAG. We develop polynomial time heuristics for IP and k-IP on DAGs...|$|R
40|$|SEPServer is {{a three-year}} {{collaborative}} project {{funded by the}} seventh framework programme (FP 7 -SPACE) of the European Union. The objective of the project is {{to provide access to}} state-of-the-art observations and analysis tools for the scientific community on solar energetic particle (SEP) events and related electromagnetic (EM) emissions. The project will eventually lead to better understanding of the particle acceleration and transport processes at the Sun and in the inner heliosphere. These processes lead to SEP events that form one of the key elements of space weather. In this paper we present the first results from the systematic analysis work performed on the following datasets: SOHO/ERNE, SOHO/EPHIN, ACE/EPAM, Wind/WAVES and GOES X-rays. A catalogue of SEP events at 1 AU, with complete coverage over solar cycle 23, based on high-energy (~ 68 -MeV) protons from SOHO/ERNE and electron recordings of the events by SOHO/EPHIN and ACE/EPAM are presented. A total of 115 energetic particle events have been identified and analysed using velocity dispersion analysis (VDA) for protons and time-shifting analysis (TSA) for electrons and protons in order to infer the SEP release times at the Sun. EM observations during the times of the SEP event onset have been gathered and compared to the release time estimates of particles. Data from those events that occurred during the European day-time, i. e., those that also have observations from ground-based observatories included in SEPServer, are listed and a preliminary analysis of their associations is presented. We find that VDA results for protons can be a useful tool for the analysis of proton release times, but if the derived proton path length is out of a range of 1 AU < s[3 AU, the result of the analysis may be compromised, as indicated by the anti-correlation of the derived path length and release time delay from the asso ciated X-ray <b>flare.</b> The average <b>path</b> length derived from VDA is about 1. 9 times the nominal length of the spiral magnetic field line. This implies that the path length of first-arriving MeV to deka-MeV protons is affected by interplanetary scattering. TSA of near-relativistic electrons results in a release time that shows significant scatter with respect to the EM emissions but with a trend of being delayed more with increasing distance between the flare and the nominal footpoint of the Earth-connected field line...|$|R
