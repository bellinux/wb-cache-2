40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> rule that bounds the {{worst-case}} end-to-end delay of {{a job as a}} function of per-stage execution times of higher priority jobs along its path, in a multistage distributed system where the routes of jobs form a directed acyclic graph. The <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> rule makes no assumption on scheduling policy (except that jobs are assigned the same priority on all stages), and makes no assumption on periodicity. Applying the rule to a particular job only requires knowledge of execution times of higher priority jobs along the path followed by the job, which is in contrast with traditional schedulability analysis techniques that require global knowledge of all jobs and routes in the distributed system, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain. Inspired by the resulting simple delay expression of our composition rule, a transformation of the system to an equivalent single stage system becomes apparent. The wealth of schedulability analysis techniques derived for uniprocessors can then be applied to decide schedulability of tasks in a DAG.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a new reduction-based analysis methodology {{for studying the}} worst-case end-to-end delay and schedulability of real-time jobs in distributed systems. The main result is a simple <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> rule, that computes a worst-case bound on the end-to-end delay of a job, given the computation times of all other jobs that execute concurrently {{with it in the}} system. This <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> rule is first derived for pipelined distributed systems, where all the jobs execute on the same sequence of resources before leaving the system. We then derive the <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> rule for systems where the union of task paths forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and subsequently generalize the result to non-acyclic task graphs as well, under both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling. The result makes no assumptions on periodicity and is valid for periodic and aperiodic jobs. It applies to fixed and dynamic priority scheduling, as long as all jobs have the same relative priority on all stages on which they execute. The <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> result enables a simple reduction of the distributed system to an equivalent hypothetical uniprocessor that can be analyzed using traditional uniprocessor schedulability analysis to infer the schedulability of the distributed system. Thus, the wealth of uniprocessor analysis techniques can now be used to analyze distributed task systems. Such a reduction significantly reduces the complexity of analysis and ensures that the analysis does not become exceedingly pessimistic with system scale, unlike existing analysis techniques for distributed systems such as holistic analysis and network calculus. Evaluation using simulations suggest that the new reduction-based analysis is able to significantly outperform existing analysis techniques, and the improvement is more pronounced for larger systems. We develop an algebra, called <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> algebra, based on the <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> results for systematic transformation of distributed real-time task systems into single-resource task systems such that schedulability properties of the original system are preserved. The operands of the algebra represent workloads on composed subsystems, and the operators define ways in which subsystems can be composed together. By repeatedly applying the operators on the operands representing resource stages, any distributed system can be systematically reduced to an equivalent uniprocessor that can be analyzed later to determine end-to-end delay and schedulability properties of all jobs in the original distributed system. The above reduction-based schedulability analysis techniques suffer from pessimism that results from mismatches between uniprocessor analysis assumptions and characteristics of workloads reduced from distributed systems, especially for the case of periodic tasks. To address the problem, we introduce flow-based mode changes, a uniprocessor load model tuned to the novel constraints of workloads reduced from distributed system tasks. In this model, transition of a job from one resource to another in the distributed system, is modeled as mode changes on the uniprocessor. We present a new iterative solution to compute the worst-case end-to-end delay of a job in the new uniprocessor task model. Our simulation studies suggest that the resulting schedulability analysis is able to admit over 25 % more utilization than other existing techniques, while still guaranteeing that all end-to-end deadlines of tasks are met. As systems are becoming increasingly distributed, it becomes important to understand their structural robustness with respect to timing uncertainty. Structural robustness, a concept that arises by virtue of multi-stage execution, refers to the robustness of end-to-end timing behavior of an execution graph towards unexpected timing violations in individual execution stages. A robust topology is one where such violations minimally affect end-to-end execution delay. We show that the manner in which resources are allocated to execution stages can affect the robustness. Algorithms are presented for resource allocation that improves the robustness of execution graphs. Evaluation shows that such algorithms are able to reduce deadline misses due to unpredictable timing violations by 40 - 60 %. Hence, the approach is important for soft real-time systems, systems where timing uncertainty exists, or where worst-case timing is not entirely verified. We finally show two contexts in which the above theory {{can be applied to the}} domain of wireless networks. First, we developed a bandwidth allocation scheme for elastic real-time flows in multi-hop wireless networks. The problem is cast as one of utility maximization, where each flow has a utility that is a concave function of its flow rate, subject to delay constraints. The delay constraints are obtained from our end-to-end delay bounds and adapted to only use localized information available within the neighborhood of each node. A constrained network utility maximization problem is formulated and solved, the solution to which results in a distributed algorithm that each node can independently execute to maximize global utility. Second, we study the problem of minimizing the worst-case end-to-end delay of packets of flows in a wireless network under arbitrary schedulability constraints. Using a coordinated earliest-deadline-first strategy, we show that a worst-case end-to-end delay bound that has the same form as our <b>delay</b> <b>composition</b> results for distributed systems can be obtained. We discuss several avenues for future work that build on top of the theory developed in this thesis. We hope that this thesis will provide the foundation to develop a more comprehensive and widely applicable theory for the study of delay, schedulability, and other end-to-end properties in distributed systems...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{time delay}} {{detonators}} {{are used to}} control blasting operations in mines and quarries. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic <b>delay</b> <b>compositions</b> are employed for long time delays. However, soluble barium compounds may pose environmental and health risks. Hence {{it is necessary to}} consider replacing the barium sulfate with an alternative green oxidant that has similar burn properties. Anhydrous calcium sulfate was identified as a suitable, inexpensive alternative green oxidant. The initial part of the investigation focused on characterising the burn properties of the Si-CaSO 4, as well as proposing a viable reaction mechanism for this composition. Thermochemical calculations indicated that stoichiometry corresponds to a composition that contains ca. 30 wt. % silicon (Si). Combustion was only supported in the range 30 70 wt. % Si. In this range the bomb calorimeter data and burn tests indicate that the reaction rate and energy output decrease with increasing silicon content. The compositions were filled into rigid aluminium elements and assembled into full detonators. Burn rates ranged from 6. 9 to 12. 5 mm s? 1. The reaction product was a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous calcium silicate phase. A reaction mechanism consistent with these observations is proposed. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic <b>delay</b> <b>compositions</b> are employed commercially for intermediate to long time delays. However, there is very little information on this composition available in the open literature. The reactivity of this composition was therefore characterised and compared with that of Si-CaSO 4. The Si-BaSO 4 composition supported combustion in the range of 20 to 60 wt. % Si in the bomb calorimeter. However, burning was only sustained between 20 and 40 wt. % Si in rigid aluminium tubes. The burn rates varied between 8. 4 and 16 mm s? 1. These values are comparable to those for the Si-CaSO 4 system (6. 9 12. 5 mm s? 1). However, the CaSO 4 -based formulations tended to have a higher energy output and produced a more pronounced transient pressure response than the barium sulfate compositions. Both the calcium sulfate- and barium sulfate-based formulations were insensitive to impact, friction and electrostatic discharge stimuli. The reaction products were a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous phase. Although barium sulfate is insoluble in water and decidedly non-toxic, the reaction products produced by the Si-BaSO 4 compositions were found to contain water-soluble barium compounds. This ranged from 50 to 140 mg Ba per gram of barium sulfate reacted. The burn rates of <b>delay</b> <b>compositions</b> used in detonators can be modified by varying a range of parameters in addition to the stoichiometry. With this in mind, the effect of additives and fuel particle size distribution on the burn rate of the silicon-calcium sulfate pyrotechnic <b>delay</b> <b>compositions</b> was investigated. The burn rate decreased with increase in fuel particle size, while the enthalpy remained constant. The addition of fuels to a base composition of 30 wt. % Si-CaSO 4 increased the burn rate, with an increase from 12. 5 mm s- 1 to 43 mm s- 1 being recorded on the addition of 10 wt. % Al. Ternary mixtures of silicon, calcium sulfate and an additional oxidiser generally decreased the burn rate. The exception was bismuth trioxide which increased it. The Si-CaSO 4 formulation was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of inert material as the addition of as little as 1 wt. % of fumed silica stifled combustion in the aluminium tubes.

Lead chromate and copper antimonite were found to be suitable oxidants for silicon in time <b>delay</b> <b>compositions.</b> They were ignitable by shock tubing, a relatively weak ignition source. The measured burn speeds for these systems showed a bimodal dependence on stoichiometry. Measured burn rates varied between 6 - 28 mm/s. Lead chromate is potentially a suitable alternative to the oxidant currently used in the medium burn rate commercial composition. It burns faster than copper antimonite. The latter is potentially a suitable replacement oxidant for the slow and medium compositions. Antimony trioxide-based compositions exhibited unreliable performance with respect to ignition with shock tubing. The addition of aluminium powder or fumed silica was found to reduce the burn rate. Increasing the silicon particle size (m m) also decreased the burn speed for copper antimonite and lead chromate compositions. Addition of fumed silica improved the flow properties of the lead chromate, copper antimonite and antimony trioxide powders allowing for easier mixing. The silicon powder was found to react violently with water in alkaline solutions. This makes particle dispersion in a wet-mixing process problematic.
