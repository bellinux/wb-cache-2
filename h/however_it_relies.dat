Such an algorithm was proposed in 1995 together with its proof of optimality. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on the linear time polygon triangulation algorithm by Chazelle, which is extremely complex.|$|E
5000|$|MBBS ran on {{standard}} Intel PC hardware. <b>However</b> <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> on serial ports {{the number of}} which was limited to 4 by the standard PC/MS-DOS architecture.

25|$|As of 2008, Virgin Media {{functioned as}} a single company; <b>however,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> on its three {{existing}} infrastructures: the Langley-based NTL, Bromley-based Cable and Wireless and Knowsley-based Telewest platforms. As part of the Next Generation Television network, the infrastructure was consolidated into a single super headend at Langley in 2010, with Knowsley serving as a backup.|$|R
50|$|Sabritas {{was founded}} in 1943 by Pedro Antonio Marcos Noriega as Golosinas y Productos Selectos in Mexico City. It {{produced}} and sold potato chips, corn chips and snacks, <b>however</b> <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> on a small distribution network which was mostly bicycle-based. The name is a portmanteau of Sabrosas y Fritas, which means Tasty and Fried (or Fried ones) in Spanish.|$|R
50|$|Principal {{variation}} search (sometimes {{equated with}} the practically identical NegaScout) is a negamax algorithm {{that can be}} faster than alpha-beta pruning. Like alpha-beta pruning, NegaScout is a directional search algorithm for computing the minimax value of a node in a tree. It dominates alpha-beta pruning {{in the sense that}} it will never examine a node that can be pruned by alpha-beta; <b>however,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on accurate node ordering to capitalize on this advantage.|$|E
50|$|In Formula One, the Kinetic energy {{recovery}} system (KERS) functions {{in a similar}} manner; <b>however,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on regenerative braking to store energy for later use, rather than simply increasing the engine's power, {{as is the case}} in some other systems. The Drag reduction system or DRS, by contrast, increases acceleration and top speed by moving an element of the rear wing to reduce drag rather than by boosting power; its usage in races is more restricted.|$|E
5000|$|Information Processing Language (IPL) is {{sometimes}} {{cited as the}} first computer-based functional programming language. It is an assembly-style language for manipulating lists of symbols. It does have a notion of [...] "generator", which amounts to a function accepting a function as an argument, and, since it is an assembly-level language, code {{can be used as}} data, so IPL can be regarded as having higher-order functions. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> heavily on mutating list structure and similar imperative features.|$|E

50|$|Bioregional {{democracy}} can {{appear as a}} variant of anticipatory democracy in that it anticipates (using a similar scientific process) the ecological health outcomes of any given action. <b>However</b> <b>it</b> usually <b>relies</b> more on far less fragile means, and less on compared measures and quantities.|$|R
50|$|An Eskimo rescue, bow rescue or T-rescue is a kayaking {{technique}} {{performed to}} recover a kayaker from a capsize without them {{having to leave}} their boat or perform a self-rescue such as a kayak roll. The advantages of this manoeuvre are that the kayaker {{does not have to}} get out of the kayak and the kayak does not then have to be emptied of water. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on another kayaker being able to assist quickly enough. More advanced kayakers will often prefer to rely on a kayak roll instead.|$|E
5000|$|Finsch's flycatcher-thrush usually occurs {{alone or}} in pairs. During the {{breeding}} season it is highly territorial, but at other times it may join mixed-species flocks at ant swarms. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> much less on ant swarms than two of its fellow members of the genus Neocossyphus, the white-tailed and red-tailed ant thrushes. Instead it catches insects in its beak like a flycatcher, hawking from perches or taking them from under leaves while it hovers. Favored insects include termites, grasshoppers, ants, beetles, flies, and various small species. It may sit {{for a long time}} without moving on a horizontal perch. It often flicks its outer rectrices to the side [...] "in scissor-like fashion".|$|E
5000|$|In its response, HM Government {{highlighted}} a major shortcoming of {{the current}} system:"The police are currently solely responsible for investigating criminal allegations against police officers, and the CPS is responsible for prosecutions. The CPS cannot direct the police investigation although close co-operation between the investigation and prosecution frequently cures deficiencies {{in cases where the}} CPS request the police to obtain further evidence. Once a case has been submitted to the CPS by the police, the Crown Prosecutor will {{decide whether or not to}} proceed by applying the criteria set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The review of a case is a dynamic process. Although it may not be possible to proceed on the available evidence, Crown Prosecutors will always consider, with the police, what other evidence might be obtained in order to produce the best possible case. As the CPS does not investigate, <b>however,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on the police to obtain further evidence or initiate investigations." ...|$|E
50|$|Initially, secular shows ran weekdays from 3 to 8 p.m. {{and most}} of Saturday. On Sundays, the station ran {{strictly}} Christian programming. It also ran other WGGS produced programs like Beverly Exercise, Peggy Denny, and others. Gradually as WGGS became a full-time Christian station, WGSE began running more of a secular line-up. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> mainly on barter programming. By 1991, it was airing Christian shows from 5 to 7 a.m. and from 10 a.m. to noon. During {{the rest of the}} day, the station had a traditional Independent schedule. WGSE aired secular shows after 10 a.m. on Sundays. The station ran a lot of first run barter cartoons family shows, and some talk shows.|$|R
5000|$|Musically, {{the band}} could be {{described}} as electronica with [...] "dreamy" [...] female vocals. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> also <b>relies</b> on a more organic approach to songwriting with live drums and percussion, together with guitars and samples, creating a complex layered and polyrhythmic blend of beats and diverse analogue sounds that defies simple categorization.|$|R
25|$|The simple {{effective}} three-level {{atom model}} described above {{accounts for the}} most important physical processes. <b>However</b> <b>it</b> does <b>rely</b> on approximations which lead to errors on the predicted recombination history {{at the level of}} 10% or so. Due to the importance of recombination for the precise prediction of cosmic microwave background anisotropies, several research groups have revisited the details of this picture over the last two decades.|$|R
5000|$|Video game {{art is a}} {{specialized}} form of computer art employing video games as the artistic medium. Video game art often {{involves the use of}} patched or modified video games or the repurposing of existing games or game structures, <b>however</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on a broader range of artistic techniques and outcomes than artistic modification and it may also include painting, sculpture, appropriation, in-game intervention and performance, sampling, etc. It may also include the creation of art games either from scratch or by modifying existing games. Notable examples of video game art include Cory Arcangel's [...] "Super Mario Clouds" [...] and [...] "I Shot Andy Warhol," [...] Joseph Delappe's projects including [...] "Dead in Iraq" [...] and the [...] "Salt Satyagraha Online: Gandhi's March to Dandi in Second Life," [...] the 2004-2005 Rhizome Commissions [...] "relating to the theme of games," [...] Paolo Pedercini's Molleindustria games such as [...] "Unmanned" [...] and [...] "Every Day the Same Dream", and Ian Bogost's [...] "Cowclicker." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{attempt at}} a {{detailed}} genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 [...] "Tervuren" [...] proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on lexicostatistics, which, because of its reliance on similarity rather than shared innovations, may predict spurious groups of conservative languages that are not closely related. Meanwhile, Ethnologue has added languages to the Guthrie classification which Guthrie overlooked, while removing the Mbam languages (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. This {{has been criticized for}} sowing confusion {{in one of the few}} unambiguous ways to distinguish Bantu languages. Nurse & Philippson (2006) evaluate many proposals for low-level groups of Bantu languages, but the result is not a complete portrayal of the family. Glottolog has incorporated many of these into their classification.|$|E
50|$|A wage-led growth {{strategy}} aims at {{establishing a}} full-employment growth {{model in which}} sustained wage growth drives demand growth via consumption growth and via accelerator effects of investment growth, as well as productivity growth via labor-saving-induced technological change. Due to this strategy's repeating itself in a cyclical manner, this theory {{is thought to be}} more stable in the long run than profit-led growth because a wage-led growth strategy will result in stable or rising wage shares if it follows the circular cumulative causation behavior. This theory commands slower paced growth and is more viable in the long run, <b>however,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> heavily on technological change to redistribute wages and labor in order to continue along the cumulative causation trend. A wage-led growth strategy includes measures to restrict financial speculation, encourage a more long-term view in corporate governance, strengthen the role of stakeholders, and rein in excessive pay in the financial sector. A restructuring of the financial sector is needed to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of financial crises. Such measures are likely to include restrictions on bank bonuses, financial transactions taxes, pro-cyclical credit management, regulation of the shadow banking industry, and closing of secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens), as well as the establishment of a sizable not-for-profit segment within the banking industry and a strengthening of stakeholders within corporate governance that will also lead to an improvement in labor's bargaining power and the wage share.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel navigation approach which, with minimal requirements {{in terms of}} on-board sensory, memory, and computational power, exhibits way-finding behaviors in very complex environments. The algorithm does not require any internal spatial representation, nor self-localization abilities: <b>however,</b> since <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on heuristics to find a path to the goal, completeness is not guaranteed.

25|$|Leg {{theory can}} be a {{moderately}} successful tactic when used with both fast bowling and spin bowling, particularly leg spin to right-handed batsmen or off spin to left-handed batsmen. <b>However,</b> because <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can be risky against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers Sydney Barnes and Frank Foster used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911-12.

5000|$|Leptopelis macrotis is a {{relatively}} common species. <b>However,</b> because <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on good (i.e., non-degraded) rainforest, habitat degradation caused by agricultural expansion, logging, and human settlements is a major threat.

40|$|Abstract — Differential {{phase shift}} keying (DPSK) is an {{attractive}} modulation scheme in connection with OFDM as it circumvents channel estimation. <b>However,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> on strong correlation between adjacent symbols and is thus limited to those channels which exhibit either low frequency or low time selectivity. Based on previous works for the iterative improvement of DPSK in a broadband single-carrier context we present a turbo-receiver which exploits the concatenation of convolutional code, interleaver and DPSK modulation in a multi-carrier setting. We will show that our receiver provides vast improvements over simple differential demodulation with a performance close to or even surpassing standard coherent OFDM with MMSE channel estimation.

5000|$|Although {{the term}} [...] "indochristian art" [...] was {{originally}} only {{used to describe}} Mexican monastic sculpture and murals, by definition, it applies to any art that is created by indigenous artists and contains Christian themes.

The term becomes increasingly difficult to apply to art in the late colonial and post-colonial periods, <b>however,</b> as <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> upon a clearly defined opposition between indigenous artist and Euro-Christian themes. The way that indochristian art is defined overlooks the entanglement of Native and European identities and the mixing of cultures that gradually developed throughout Latin America.|$|R
40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} by {{animals is}} a key interaction, with effects on the population ecology and evolution of many plant lineages. Despite the fact that infrequent seed dispersers can potentially provide important services to plant populations, {{little attention has been}} paid so far to scarce mutualists. We assessed different aspects of quantity and quality of seed dispersal from fruit removal to seed germination in the Iberian pear, Pyrus bourgaeana, finding that fruit consumers markedly differed in the nature of their interaction with the tree. Whereas the abundant rodents, rabbits, and deer damaged all seeds eaten, the uncommon carnivores badger and fox and the abundant boars dispersed a large fraction of ingested seeds as viable propagules, acting as legitimate seed dispersers. Despite low rates of visitation by badgers to fruiting trees, they transported more viable seeds than the abundant boars, due to better seed treatment and a higher feeding rate on pears. Seed dispersal by all 3 legitimate dispersers, especially the badger, enhanced post-dispersal P. bourgaeana seed survival, supporting the “escape” predation hypothesis. Pyrus bourgaeana showed relatively high frequencies of visits by a myriad of frugivores; <b>however,</b> <b>it</b> <b>relied</b> on the dispersal service provided by an infrequent carnivore, the badger, rather than on those provided by the abundant mammalian herbivores. Therefore, under some circumstances, uncommon animal counterparts play major roles in their mutualistic interactions with flowering plants. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an unusual element that activates {{the synthesis of}} short transcripts {{from a wide variety}} of mRNA and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) promoters, including the U 6 RNA polymerase III promoter. This inducer of short transcripts (IST) is located between positions - 5 and + 82 relative to the cap site in the HIV- 1 LTR. In the presence of IST, the total transcriptional activity of the different promoters is greatly increased, but the resulting additional RNA molecules are short, ending around position + 60. IST is not the RNA target (TAR) for Tat trans-activation; <b>however,</b> because <b>it</b> <b>relies</b> entirely on cellular factors for activity, IST may serve to provide abundant RNA targets for Tat trans-activation without a requirement for full-length viral mRNA expression...|$|R
