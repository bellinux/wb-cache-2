25|$|Chase's {{argument}} {{has also been}} criticized by Stephen Morillo for its reliance on a simple cause and <b>effect</b> <b>analysis.</b> Alternatively Morillo suggests that the major difference between Chinese and European weapon development was economic. Within Morillo's framework, European weapons were more competitive due to private manufacturing whereas Chinese weapons were manufactured according to government specifications. Although generally true, Peter Lorge points out that gun specifications were widespread in China, and ironically the true gun was first developed during the Song dynasty, when guns were the exclusive enterprise of the government, suggesting that the economics of production were less influential on gun development than assumed. In contrast, less innovation occurred during the Ming dynasty when most of production was shifted to the domain of private artisans. Andrade concludes that although the Chase hypothesis should not be discarded outright, it does not offer a full explanation for the stagnation of firearm development in China.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{framework}} of security-constrained adequacy evaluation (SCAE) based on analytical techniques is proposed {{to assess the}} ability of a bulk power system to supply electric load while satisfying security constraints. It encompasses three main steps: (a) critical contingency selection, (b) <b>effects</b> <b>analysis,</b> and (c) reliability index computation. <b>Effects</b> <b>analysis</b> is the most essential but computationally demanding procedure. It is important that <b>effects</b> <b>analysis</b> simulate contingencies in a realistic manner efficiently. However, <b>effects</b> <b>analysis</b> based on the traditional power flow technology often lacks the realistic system model and diverges when the system is severely stressed. In this paper, a non-divergent optimal quadratized power flow (NDOQPF) algorithm is proposed for <b>effects</b> <b>analysis.</b> It is implemented based on a single phase quadratized power flow (SPQPF) model that can improve solution efficiency, and a constrained optimization problem, which incorporates operational practices, security constraints, and remedial actions, is formulated to simulate contingencies realistically. The nondivergence of power flow is achieved by introducing fictitious bus injections that are driven to zero as the solution progresses. It guarantees convergence if a solution exists; if a solution does not exist, it provides a suboptimal solution that may include load shedding. The NDOQPF algorithm is capable of efficiently solving the RTO/ISO operational model as well. Such operational procedure is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective function being the bid cost function and congestion constraints. The proposed SCAE framework also includes an improved contingency selection/enumeration scheme based on SPQPF and reliability index computations. The methodology is demonstrated with the IEEE reliability test system.

Notwithstanding the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s insistence on a European terminology (2 ̆ 2 non-coordinated 2 ̆ 2 rather than 2 ̆ 2 unilateral 2 ̆ 2 effects), the EC thus embraces a concept that has gained substantial traction in the United States since its explicit recognition in the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines as one variant of a 2 ̆ 2 substantial lessening of competition 2 ̆ 2 (SLC) under s. 7 of the Clayton Act. This is an interesting development given that only a year ago, the Commission was [...] at least publicly [...] still very hesitant to recommend any departure from the traditional dominance test in order to bring the EC merger regime closer to the US SLC test.
