40|$|We {{present a}} novel, {{laser-based}} microstructuring technique for the etching and deposition of solid materials. This technique, {{which we call}} laser-induced solid etching (LISE), utilises the absorption of femtosecond duration laser pulses in a constrained metal film between two bulk substrates, {{at least one of}} which is transparent to the laser wavelength. The very rapid pressure increase in the metal film following irradiation is believed to initiate crack-propagation in one or other of the bulk substrates. By spatially shaping the laser beam, the cracking process can be controlled to etch solid chunks of material from the substrates. Using LISE we have etched smooth, micron-scale pits and trenches in silicon and silica. The results will be compared to etched features produced using conventional techniques. A unique feature of LISE is that the material etched from the bulk substrate is removed as a single solid piece and is not shattered, melted, or vaporised by the process. Hence, the <b>etched</b> <b>material</b> can be collected on the other bulk substrate used in the process. In this way, we have deposited micron-scale dots and lines of silica onto silicon and vice-versa.

Indium Phosphide (InP) is the material of choice for photonic devices {{especially when it comes}} to realization of coherent light source at 1. 55 μm wavelength. Precise engineering of the nanostructures in the PhC lattice offers novel ways to confine, guide and control light in phonic integrated circuits (PICs). Strong confinement of light in PhCs offer novel opportunities in many areas of physics and engineering. Dry etching, a necessary process step in PhC device manufacturing, is known to introduce damage in the <b>etched</b> <b>material.</b> Process induced damage and its impact on the electrical and optical properties of PhCs depends on the <b>etched</b> <b>material,</b> the etching technique and process parameters. We have demonstrated a novel post-etch process based on so-called mass-transport (MT) technology for the first time on InP-based PhCs that has significantly improved side-wall verticality of etched PhC holes. A statistical analysis performed on several devices fabricated by MT process technology shows a great deal of improvement in the reliability of optical transmission characteristics which is very promising for achieving high optical quality in PhC components. Several PhC devices were manufactured using MT technology. Broad enough PhC waveguides that operate in the mono/multi-mode regime are interesting for coarse wavelength de-multiplexing. The fundamental mode and higher order mode interaction creates mini-stop band (MSB) in the dispersion diagram where the higher order mode has a lower group velocity which can be considered as slow light regime. In this thesis work, the phenomena of MSBs and its impact on transmission properties have been evaluated. We have proposed and demonstrated a method that enables spectral tuning with sub-nanometer accuracy which is based on the transmission MSB. Along the same lines most of the thesis work relates to broad enough PhC guides that operated in the multimode regime. Temperature tuning experiments on these waveguides reveals a clear red-shift with a gradient of dλ/dT= 0. 1 nm/˚C. MSBs in these waveguides have been studied by varying the width in incremental amounts. Analogous to semiconductors heterostructures, photonic heterostructures are composed of two photonic crystals with different band-gaps obtained either by changing the air-fill factor or by the lattice constant. Juxtaposing two PhC and the use of heterostructures in waveguide geometry has been experimentally investigated in this thesis work. In particular, in multimode line defect waveguides the “internal” MSB effect brings a new dimension in single junction-type photonic crystal waveguide (JPCW) and heterostructure W 3 (HW 3) for fundamental physics and applications. We have also fabricated an ultra-compact polarization beam splitter (PBS) realized by combining a multimode waveguide with internal PhC.

Etching is performed on diamond substrates {{using a variety of}} <b>etch</b> mask <b>materials</b> including aluminum, titanium, gold, silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. The etch feed gases are combinations of oxygen, sulfur hexafluoride and argon. Aluminum masks provided the highest selectivity ratio of diamond etch rate to mask etch rate, both with and without SF 6 in the oxygen/argon feedgas. Selectivity was not found to be dependent on mask feature size. Gold masks produced the least degree of micromasking...|$|R
