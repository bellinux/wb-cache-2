5|$|The {{election}} of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate. After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court, that court voided the election, holding that enough ineligible people had been permitted to vote to affect the outcome, though the court noted {{that it was not}} the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred. The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E
5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry. She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
