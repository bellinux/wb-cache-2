The <b>feed</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> contains phosphane in concentrations which are in a close correlation to the phosphane concentrations in manure. 2. Phosphane is liberated from metallic surfaces upon contact to corrosive microbial metabolity. 3. The biogenic production of phosphane was observed under conditions of selective inhibition of methanogenesis in anaerobic mineralisation of organic compounds, exclusively. Free organophosphanes could not be detected in technical manure treatment plants. The results permit the formulation of strategies for the reduction and prevention of phosphane emissions in manure treatment plants. (orig.)

30|$|In some poultry {{processing}} systems, the poultry waste {{is converted to}} poultry feed by ensilation, dehydration, chemical treatment and fermentation to yield protein biomass (El Boushy and van der Poel 1994). In Zimbabwe, some of the waste produced during chicken slaughter is generated into animal feed in rendering plants (Bhengesa 2004). The excess waste finds its way to landfills for a price charged by environmental agencies or municipal authorities. Recent food controversies including incidence of salmonella outbreaks, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease {{and the advent of}} new variants, Creutzfeldts-Jakobs disease, prions, transmissible mink encephalopathy and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy due to <b>feeding</b> <b>animals</b> with <b>feed</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> origin, has stirred great confusion and panic in Great Britain (DEFRA 2012). This has led to the voluntary withdrawal <b>of</b> stock <b>feeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> origin from ruminants in many countries including Zimbabwe. As a result, blood demand has declined. The blood from slaughterhouses is therefore held in lagoons or holding tanks or dumped in landfills (DEFRA 2012). This results in environmental pollution problems such as the presence of pathogens, eutrophication, groundwater pollution, acid deposition and high ammonia and nitrate concentration in water and soil (Edwards and Daniel 1992). This is costly for companies as they have to pay for a disposal permit and also provide transport to disposal sites. There is a need to find alternative waste management strategies for the excess waste that is both feasible and environmentally sustainable.|$|R
