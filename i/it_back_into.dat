5|$|Apatosaurus excelsus was the {{original}} type species of Brontosaurus, first named by Marsh in 1879. Elmer Riggs reclassified Brontosaurus as a synonym of Apatosaurus in 1903, transferring the species B.excelsus to A.excelsus. In 2015 Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson argued that the species was distinct enough {{to be placed in}} its own genus, so they reclassified <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his death}} (which {{according}} to persistent but unfounded legend {{was caused by}} a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the repertoire.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} day, Australia reached 5/305 when Johnson {{came in to}} bat. He made 21 with three fours, {{including}} an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by Laker. Johnson hit the ball onto his foot, which deflected <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his stumps. This left Australia at 6/338 but the lower order continued to contribute and pushed the total to 509, giving the tourists a 344-run lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{attempted to}} exercise formal control over interest rates, {{and set the}} parameters for {{the activity of the}} guilds and corporations, in which it had a special interest. The emperor and his officials intervened at times of crisis to ensure the provisioning of the capital, and to keep down the price of cereals. Finally, the government often collected part of the surplus through taxation, and put <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> circulation, through redistribution in the form of salaries to state officials, or in the form of investment in public works.|$|E
5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down an octave for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E

5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either {{canister}} shot from the British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He {{was able to make}} <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties {{on both sides of the}} field; the French had 644 men killed or injured, while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded.|$|E

In August 2013 the council received a planning application from the Church Converts (Manchester) to repair the building and convert it into apartments; the application was granted in February 2014. The redevelopment by CZero Developments consists of 73 private apartments in both the chapel and the Sunday school, with the redevelopment due to be completed by Summer 2017. The building was used for student accommodation from September 2017, with a gym, cinema room, study areas and a lounge.|$|E
5|$|Lord Goring, who had {{proposed}} the second siege, renewed the blockade {{for a third}} time in mid-May, after engaging Weldon's departing army and forcing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Taunton. Goring's siege was lax and allowed provisions into the town, diminishing its effectiveness. The Parliamentarian defence tied up Goring and his 10–15,000 troops, who would have otherwise been available to fight for King Charles at Naseby, where historians believe they could have tipped the battle in favour of the Royalists. Instead, after securing a Parliamentarian victory at Naseby, Thomas Fairfax marched his army to relieve Taunton on 9 July 1645.|$|E

5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding {{to help them}} swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences lost {{sight of the fact that}} the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture phenomenon in the first half of the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E
5|$|After an {{extended}} period with no activity {{across much of the}} Indian Ocean, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) rebuilt toward the end of February, and spawned an area of convection on March1 in the extreme eastern portion of the basin. The next day, a circulation was noted on satellite imagery to the northeast of the convection, which indicated that a tropical disturbance had developed. The influence of the monsoon trough steered the disturbance to the southeast into the Australian basin, where moderate wind shear prevented quick development. A building ridge to the south turned the system to the southwest, bringing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the south-west Indian on March3 as a tropical depression. With decreasing wind shear, the depression slowly intensified as convection increased, becoming Tropical Storm Davina on March4. An eye developed the next day, signaling Davina had intensified into a tropical cyclone, or reaching 10-minute winds of at least 120km/h (75mph). On March7, Davina became an intense tropical cyclone, with sustained 10-minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). At around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 205km/h (125mph).|$|E

5|$|Brun soon {{sold the}} team on, {{this time to}} Swiss {{financier}} Joachim Luhti, who brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Formula One for the 1989 season. The new Brabham BT58, powered by a Judd V8 engine (originally another of Jack Brabham's companies), was produced for the 1989 season. Italian driver Stefano Modena, who had driven for the team in the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in a one off drive for the team, drove alongside the more experienced Martin Brundle who was returning to Formula One after spending 1988 winning the World Sportscar Championship for Jaguar. Modena took the team's last podium: a third place at the Monaco Grand Prix (Brundle, who had only just scraped through pre-qualifying by 0.021 seconds before qualifying a brilliant 4th, had been running third but was forced to stop to replace a flat battery, finally finishing sixth). The team also {{failed to make the}} grid sometimes: Brundle failed to prequalify at the Canadian Grand Prix and the French Grand Prix. The team finished 9th in the Constructors' Championship {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) next. Gail Kim {{accompanied}} AMW to the ring. Mid-way through the bout, Team 3D performed their signature Whassup? maneuver on Storm. Kim interfered in the bout, distracting the referee. Around this time, Devon retrieved a table {{from under the}} ring which both teams used as a weapon, however the referee did not disqualify anyone for the usage. AMW earned a near-fall after a bearhug and a lariat combination on Ray. Team 3D followed with their own near-fall on Harris, after they performed their signature Deadly Device maneuver on Storm. After this, Kim interfered trying to blow powder into Ray's eyes, only for Ray to stop her and blow <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> her and the referee's eyes. With the referee blinded, Team 3D performed their signature 3D maneuver on Harris and the referee counted the pin. Team Canada then attacked 3D, knocking out Ray in the process with a hockey stick. They placed Harris on top of Ray and left the ring. After the referee regained his vision, he declared AMW the victors at 12 minutes and 41 seconds.|$|E
