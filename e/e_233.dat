Expression of CDK 5 enhanced monoubiquitination of endogenous APE 1. Polyubiquitinated APE 1 was decreased when K 48 R ubiquitin was expressed, suggesting that polyubiquitination was mediated mainly through Lys 48 of ubiquitin. The ubiquitination activity of MDM 2, consistent in its role for APE 1 ubiquitination, was increased for T <b>233</b> <b>E</b> APE 1 compared to the wildtype APE 1. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the MDM 2 gene, ubiquitination of T <b>233</b> <b>E</b> APE 1 was still observed probably because of the decreased degradation activity for monoubiquitinated APE 1 and because of backup E 3 ligases in the cells. Monoubiquitinated APE 1 was present in the nucleus, and analyzing global gene expression profiles with or without induction of a ubiquitin-APE 1 fusion gene suggested that monoubiquitination enhanced the gene suppression activity of APE 1.

A severe neonatal type 2 variant who presented with collodion skin, ichthyosis, and a rapid neurodegenerative course had two novel acid β-glucosidase alleles: a complex, maternally derived allele, E 326 K+L 444 P, and a paternally inherited nonsense mutation, <b>E</b> <b>233</b> X. Because the only other non–pseudogene-derived complex allele, D 140 H+E 326 K, also had the E 326 K lesion and was reported in a mild type 1 patient with a D 140 H+E 326 K/K 157 Q genotype, these complex alleles and their individual mutations were expressed and characterized.

40|$|RAD 51 D is a homolog of the RAD 51 protein, {{which is}} known to be an {{important}} component of the DNA repair pathway. A rare missense variant in the RAD 51 D gene, <b>E</b> <b>233</b> G (c. A > G), has been reported to be more prevalent in breast cancer cases from specific multiple-case breast cancer families, with an odds ratio of 2. 6 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 12 - 6. 03). We assessed whether this variant was associated with breast cancer risk using two studies: a population-based case-control-family study based on 1, 110 cases and 629 controls, and a clinic-based study based on 390 cases from multiple-case breast cancer families. We conducted case-control analyses and modified segregation analyses of carrier families. The carrier frequencies (95 % CI) of the RAD 51 D variant were 4. 1 % (2. 4 - 6. 6) for clinic-based cases, 3. 9 % (2. 8 - 5. 2) for population-based cases, and 3. 7 % (2. 3 - 5. 4) for population-based controls, and were not significantly higher in case groups than controls (P = 0. 7 and P = 0. 8, respectively). After genotyping the relatives of cases who carried the variant, modified segregation analyses of these families were conducted, and the estimated hazard ratio for breast cancer corresponding to the <b>E</b> <b>233</b> G variant was 1. 30 (95 % CI: 0. 66 - 2. 58; P = 0. 4) for familial breast cancer families and 1. 28 (95 % CI: 0. 47 - 3. 43; P = 0. 6) for families unselected for family history. Therefore, despite being well powered to detect moderate risks, no evidence for an association between the <b>E</b> <b>233</b> G variant and breast cancer risk was observed in any setting.

40|$|If, encoded by the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channel family, is a {{key player}} in cardiac and {{neuronal}} pacing. Although HCN channels structurally resemble voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels, their structure-function correlation is much less clear. Here we probed the functional importance of the HCN 1 S 3 -S 4 linker by multiple substitutions of its residues. Neutralizing Glu 235, an acidic S 3 -S 4 linker residue conserved in all hyperpolarization-activated channels, by Ala substitution produced a depolarizing activation shift (V 1 / 2 = - 65. 0 ± 0. 7 versus - 70. 6 ± 0. 7 mV for wild-type HCN 1); the charge-reversed mutation E 235 R shifted activation even more positively (- 56. 2 ± 0. 5 mV). Increasing external Mg 2 + mimicked the progressive rightward shifts of E 235 A and E 235 R by gradually shifting activation (V 1 / 2 = 1 < 3 < 10 < 30 mM); ΔV 1 / 2, induced by 30 mM Mg 2 + was significantly attenuated for E 235 A (+ 7. 9 ± 1. 2 versus + 11. 3 ± 0. 9 mV for wild-type HCN 1) and E 235 R (+ 3. 3 ± 1. 4 mV) channels, as if surface charges were already shielded. Consistent with an electrostatic role, the energetic changes associated with ΔV 1 / 2 resulting from various Glu 235 substitutions (i. e. Asp, Ala, Pro, His, Lys, and Arg) displayed a strong correlation with their charges (ΔΔG = - 2. 1 ± 0. 3 kcal/mol/charge; r = 0. 94). In contrast, D <b>233</b> <b>E,</b> D <b>233</b> A, D 233 G, and D 233 R did not alter activation gating. D 233 C (in C 318 S background) was also not externally accessible when probed with methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA).

The Escherichia coli [fabG (Ts) ] mutant contains two point mutations: A 154 T and <b>E</b> <b>233</b> K. The β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase activity of this mutant was extremely thermolabile, {{and the rate of}} fatty acid synthesis measured in vivo was inhibited upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to conceptualize {{a model to}} examine the {{potential}} factors that lead youth to participate in exercise. The conceptual model was developed based on previously tested exercise commitment model (Alexandris, Zahariadis, Tsorbatzoudis, & Grouious, 2002) with additional factors of self-efficacies (i. e., coping, task, and scheduling). Structural equation modeling was performed to test the model and the findings showed that the proposed model had fair fit with the data (CFI =. 962, TLI =. 901, RMSEA =. 09). The results indicated that investment (β =. 532) and two self-efficacies [i. <b>e.,</b> scheduling (β=. <b>233)</b> and task (β =. 223) ] were the three significant determinants for exercise commitment for youth in 7 th and 8 th grade (p < 001). Further, scheduling self-efficacy (β =. 273, p<. 005) and exercise commitment (β =. 235, p<. 05) contributed significantly positively {{on the stage of}} exercise participation. ...|$|R
