5000|$|In 1908 Baluschek {{became a}} member of the board of {{directors}} of the Berlin Secession, in which capacity he became involved in increasingly contentious debate. The advent of Expressionism led to arguments among Secession members. For example, Max Beckmann complained of [...] "one brazen impudence after another" [...] by the new breed of painters, and Liebermann obstructed a Secession exhibit featuring Henri Matisse. In 1910, a more avant-garde splinter group, the New Secession, led by Georg Tappert and Max Pechstein, staged an [...] "exhibition of works rejected by the Berlin Secession." [...] Internal controversy peaked in 1913, precipitating the resignation of 42 artists from the Secession, including the entire board of directors, among them Baluschek. That same year Baluschek, then 43, married Irene <b>Drösse,</b> a 25-year-old former art student. Their marriage endured and during World War I Irene gave birth to two daughters.|$|E
5000|$|On {{his return}} to Edinburgh with Queen Mary early in 1567, Darnley took {{residence}} in the Old Provost's lodging, a two-storey house within the church quadrangle. The house was owned by Robert Balfour, whose brother Sir James Balfour was a prominent councillor of Queen Mary. Adjacent was the lodging of James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault. At first Darnley's household {{thought he would be}} accommodated in the Hamilton Lodging. Early in the morning of 10 February, the house was destroyed by a gunpowder explosion while Queen Mary was at Holyrood attending the wedding celebration of Bastian Pagez. The partially clothed bodies of Darnley and his servant were found in a nearby orchard, apparently either smothered or strangled but unharmed by the explosion. Another servant was killed in the house by the explosion, which it was said had such, [...] "a force and vehemency, that of the haill ludgeing, walles and uthir, their is na thing left unruinated and doung in <b>drosse</b> to the verie ground stane." ...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{photoperiod}} {{response is}} a major factor determining plant development and the agronomic performance of crops. The genetic control of photoperiodic flowering has been elucidated in the model plant Arabidopsis, and many of the identified genes are structurally conserved in the grasses. In this study, HvCO 1, the closest barley ortholog of the key photoperiod response gene CONSTANS in Arabidopsis, was over-expressed in the spring barley Golden Promise. Over-expression of HvCO 1 accelerated time to flowering in long- and short-day conditions and caused up-regulation of HvFT 1 mRNA under long-day conditions. However, the transgenic plants retained a response to photoperiod, suggesting the presence of photoperiod response factors acting downstream of HvCO 1 transcription. Analysis of a population segregating for HvCO 1 over-expression and natural genetic variation at Ppd-H 1 demonstrated that Ppd-H 1 acts downstream of HvCO 1 transcription on HvFT 1 expression and flowering. Furthermore, variation at Ppd-H 1 did not affect diurnal expression of HvCO 1 or HvCO 2. Over-expression of HvCO 1 increased transcription of the spring allele of Vrn-H 1 in long- and short-day conditions, while genetic variation at Ppd-H 1 did not affect Vrn-H 1 expression. Over-expression of HvCO 1 and natural genetic variation at Ppd-H 1 accelerated inflorescence development and stem elongation. Thus, HvCO 1 probably induces flowering by activating HvFT 1 whilst Ppd-H 1 regulates HvFT 1 independently of HvCO 1 mRNA, and all three genes also appear to have a strong effect in promoting inflorescence development.

40|$|The Ria of Vigo, {{one of the}} {{classical}} rias of SW Europe, is an environment of high production of organic matter naturally induced by the Galician upwelling. The organic matter is partly supplied by small rivers but mainly by sewage plants along the ria shoreline; jointly they contribute 725 t y− 1 of POC, of which 72 % is of anthropogenic origin. The freshwater flux is equivalent to a supply of 5 g m− 2 yr− 1 of allochtonous POC to the ria floor. However the rate of accumulation of POC {{is dominated by the}} order of magnitude higher supply of autochthonous material from the net primary production. The present accumulation rate of organic matter (49 – 58 gPOC m− 2 yr− 1) is lower than the average supply, estimated from the sedimentary record, to the ria since the middle of the nineteen Century (> 60 gPOC m− 2 yr− 1). This difference may be due to anthropogenic activity or changes in the upwelling pattern. The composition of the organic matter in the sediment reflects the relative importance of the various sources (terrestrial-marine). While terrestrial woody materials dominate the inner ria, phytoplankton remains dominate the remainder of the ria. Rock-Evaluation analysis indicates the inner ria is the site of deposition of gas-prone material and it is inferred that the outer ria of oil-prone organic matter. The controls on the accumulation of POC in the rias show many differences to those found in estuaries affected by anthropogenic activities e. g. agriculture and increasing human population. The writers would like to record their gratitude to members of the former Department of ‘Recursos Naturales y Medio Ambiente (Univ. of Vigo) ’ for helping in collecting the samples with the support of CICYT projects NAT 89 - 1075 and AMB 93 - 0300; to METRIA project participants and, particularly, to Dr. Santos-Echeandía and Mr. Otxotorena, for their help with the sampling; to Dr. Z. Ali and Mr. M. A. Ahmad of the former Department of Geology (Imperial College of London) for the carbon and nitrogen analyses; to Dr Ettienn <b>Drosse</b> (Institut Français du Pétrole) for the rock-evaluation values; to Mr. Portela for the gauging station measurements in the Oitavén River and to Dr. Alvarez Eijo (USC) for the gauging station calibration and river flow quantification; to Ms. Rodríguez-Riveiros for her technical assistance; and to the sewage plant companies ‘Pridesa’, ‘Aqualia’, ‘Espina y Delfín’ and ‘Fergó Galicia’ for their kindness in cooperating in the sampling and providing sewage flow and population equivalent data. This work is a contribution to the Spanish LOICZ program and was partially supported by CICYT under the project ‘Biogeochemical budget and 3 D transport model of trace metals in a Galician Ria’ (reference REN 2003 - 04106 -C 03).
