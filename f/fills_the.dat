5|$|Both {{the opening}} and ending credits {{sequences}} incorporate shots of St Michael and All Angels Church in Hughenden Valley, Buckinghamshire, which doubles as the parish church of Father Unwin. In the opening sequence, a zoom shot establishes a backdrop of fields while the series title slowly <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> screen, in a motion that draws inspiration from traditional images of angels descending from Heaven.|$|E
5|$|But from {{whichever}} it is made, {{whether from}} oats, barley or wheat, it harms {{the head and}} the stomach, it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth, it <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> stomach with bad fumes, {{and as a result}} anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly; but it does have the property of facilitating urination and makes one's flesh white and smooth.|$|E
5|$|In Macbett, Eugène Ionesco's 1972 stage adaptation, Fleance is {{merged with}} the Malcolm character. Macol (Malcolm), who {{is thought to be}} King Duncan's son, is {{revealed}} to be Banco's (Banquo's). Duncan, wanting a male heir, adopted Macol. Macol <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> role of Malcolm in taking the kingdom from Macbett (Macbeth) {{at the end of the}} play.|$|E

5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
5|$|The Clouds divide, and JUNO {{appears in}} a Machine drawn by Peacocks; while a Symphony is playing, it moves gently forward, and as it descends, it opens and discovers the Tail of the Peacock, which is so large, that it almost <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> opening of the Stage between Scene and Scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E

5|$|The {{west end}} of the nave is {{dominated}} by an eight-light window in the Perpendicular Gothic style which almost <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> {{upper part of the}} west wall. It contains stained glass designed by W.T.Carter Shapland dating from 1961 and depicts the Holy Family in the middle two lights, flanked by the northern saints Werburgh, Oswald, Aidan, Chad and Wilfrid, and QueenEthelfleda.|$|E
5|$|As in most Sonic series games, the Chaos Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser <b>fills,</b> <b>the</b> {{water at}} the top of the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E

50|$|Kia Motors {{replaced}} the Oprius/Amanti with two vehicles. The Kia Cadenza {{was designed to}} <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> executive car classes, while the Kia Quoris was designed to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> full-size luxury car class.|$|R
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
50|$|The Huns fled but the Goths pursued {{them and}} <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> rivers with bodies {{so that they}} choked and this caused a flood which <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> valleys with dead men and horses.|$|R
50|$|Their {{supporter}} {{is called}} Semeton Dewata, {{that comes from}} the word Semeton meaning brother and Dewata meaning Bali's nickname, Island of Gods. Also there is Lady Dewata for female supporters. Semeton Dewata usually <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> east stand of Kapten I Wayan Dipta Stadium. There are two more big supporter groups, Northsideboys 12 that <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> north stand and Brigaz that <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> south stand.|$|R

5|$|The 12th century Pantokrator monastic complex (1118–36) {{was built}} with {{imperial}} sponsorship as three adjoining churches. The south church, a cross-in-square, has a ribbed dome over the naos, domical vaults in the corners, and a pumpkin dome over the narthex gallery. The north church {{is also a}} cross-in-square plan. The middle church, the third to be built, <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> long space between the two earlier churches with two oval domes of the pumpkin and ribbed types over {{what appear to be}} separate functional spaces. The western space was an imperial mausoleum, whereas the eastern dome covered a liturgical space.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{occupies}} the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around {{and inside the}} brain and spinal cord. It <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, {{as well as the}} central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

25|$|Darren Matik {{was named}} in August 2012 to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> vacant at-large seat {{that had been}} held by Matthew Levinson, who {{resigned}} the previous month. Todd Gordon was appointed in January 2013 to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> seat of Alex Marino, who had resigned following his taking office on the Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Brian Heun was appointed in February 2014 to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> unexpired term of Donna Taylor.|$|R
5|$|The {{developing}} forebrain {{surrounds the}} neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within {{it becomes a}} ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF. The CSF quickly <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> neural canal. Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} semilunar valves sit at {{the exit}} {{of each of the}} ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located {{at the base of the}} pulmonary artery. This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood <b>fills</b> <b>the</b> pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} of a vacancy {{in the office of the}} {{secretary}} of state, the governor may appoint a replacement to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the term; this has occurred twice: upon the death of Fred R. Zimmerman, Louis Allis was appointed to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the term, and Glenn Wise was appointed to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> entire of the next term to which Zimmerman had been elected.|$|R
50|$|Section 9 of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840 {{provided}} for the suspension of eight of the canonries at St George's. It required that the first two vacant canonries should be suspended, <b>the</b> next <b>filled,</b> <b>the</b> next two suspended, <b>the</b> next <b>filled,</b> <b>the</b> next two suspended, <b>the</b> next <b>filled,</b> and <b>the</b> next two suspended.|$|R
