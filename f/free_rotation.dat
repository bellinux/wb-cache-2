25|$|Ethane {{forms the}} {{simplest}} case {{for studying the}} conformation of alkanes, as {{there is only one}} C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called Newman projection. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation.|$|E

The {{common form}} of solid KCN, stable at ambient pressure and temperature, has the same cubic crystal structure as sodium chloride, with each potassium ion surrounded by six cyanide ions, and vice versa. [...] Despite the cyanide ions being diatomic, and thus less symmetric than chloride, they rotate so rapidly, their time-averaged shape is spherical. [...] At low temperature and high pressure, this <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> is hindered, resulting in a less symmetric crystal structure with the cyanide ions arranged in sheets.|$|E
2500|$|Triple bonds {{could not}} be {{accounted}} for by the cubical atom model, because {{there is no way of}} having two cubes share three parallel edges. Lewis suggested that the electron pairs in atomic bonds have a special attraction, which result in a tetrahedral structure, as in the figure below (the new location of the electrons is represented by the dotted circles in the middle of the thick edges). This allows the formation of a single bond by sharing a corner, a double bond by sharing an edge, and a triple bond by sharing a face. It also accounts for the <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> around single bonds and for the tetrahedral geometry of methane.|$|E

With these parameter-free potentials we performed static structural relaxations, supercell molecular dynamics and lattice dynamical studies and predict with reasonable accuracy the temperatures for {{the onset of the}} order-disorder phase transitions in these materials. ^ Most significantly, we found that the transitions to the high-temperature disordered phases in these systems are driven by rotational disordering of the linear N 3 - and SCN- anions. In case of the azides (N 3 - anions) we observed <b>free</b> <b>rotations</b> of the anions about all three crystallographic axes, in all three systems. However, in the thiocyanates (SCN- anions) only one system, caesium thiocyanate (CsSCN), yielded <b>free</b> <b>rotations</b> about all the axes. In potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) and rubidium thiocyanate (RbSCN) the order-disorder transition appears rather to involve large amplitude librations of the SCN- ions, primarily about the c axis.

50|$|Depending on the {{substrate}} double bond, addition can have different {{effects on the}} molecule. After addition to a straight-chain alkene such as C2H4, the resulting alkane will rapidly and freely rotate around its single sigma bond under normal conditions (i.e. room temperature). Thus whether substituents {{are added to the}} same side (syn) or opposite sides (anti) of a double can usually be ignored due to <b>free</b> <b>rotation.</b> However, if chirality or the specific absolute orientation of the substituents needs to be taken into account, knowing the type of addition is significant. Unlike straight-chain alkenes, cycloalkene syn addition allows stable addition of substituents to {{the same side of the}} ring, where they remain together.
