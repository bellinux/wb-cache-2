500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] is one {{of those}} songs that's in the DNA of so much going on these days that it's hard to know where to start. Its tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use {{sampling}} really successfully. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that Brian Eno's idea of the studio-as-instrument comes from this kind of recording.|$|E
500|$|Blumenfeld has {{described}} how his character [...] "sort of evolved" [...] from being [...] "super needy [...] weird" [...] to [...] "a little crazier", but that [...] "the root of my character {{is still the}} same, the insecurity of it". Regarding his similarity to his character, {{he said he is}} [...] "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe the things that he thinks <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> but I'm able to suppress them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Daily Telegraph Madonna further explained her inspiration behind the song and stated that [...] " [...] a song most people who work can relate to. If part of your work is travelling, and the person you are with also works and travels, you find yourself separated a lot {{and it can be}} very frustrating, [...] I'm American and he [...] is British, and I have to come to America all the time. [...] Especially at the beginning of our relationship, that long-distance thing was very frustrating. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it's easier for people to say things from a distance; it's safer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kwong also {{condemned}} {{some lawmakers}} for being [...] "irrational and violent" [...] when expressing opinion in {{meetings of the}} Legislative Council, saying, [...] "I don't think he would act like a few councilors we have now, throwing everything around. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> don't <b>think</b> that if Jesus was in the streets today, he would use such humiliating words to scold government officials and other people. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> don't <b>think</b> that Jesus would express himself with such irrational violence." ...|$|R

500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some familiar faces with some new faces is {{something to look forward}} to. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> finding some new Marvel characters to pull into the universe would be cool. Fans seem to respond when there are characters from the Marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] He later explained that the series has the opportunity to explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy {{felt the}} video was unique and commented that [...] "There aren't many popstars {{who could make}} a video {{featuring}} doves, balloons, a galloping horse, a giant inflatable elephant and a mass grope-fest {{in the middle of}} LA... {{and get away with it}} [...]" [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly complimented its sexuality and said that the video could [...] "best described as either a makeout flash mob, a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade gone wild, or some serious [...] "the touch, the feel of cotton" [...] guerrilla marketing." [...] MuuMuse-editor Bradley Stern praised the concept of the video as [...] "incredible" [...] and complimented the inclusion of the horse. Popjustice called the music video a [...] "lovely pervoramic pop moment." [...] Due to its sexual content and nature, the music video was censored and banned in numerous Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In an interview with Spanish television channel Cuatro, Minogue responded to the censorship and said: [...] "I think, yes, it's sexy but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it's very touching and sensual and the message is love." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The List" [...] premiered on the Fox {{network in}} the United States on October 20, 1995. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.8, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.8 percent of all television-equipped {{households}}, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it was a very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very well. I think it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for. Mulder and Scully do not solve the case, and that is something I had been interested in doing for some time." [...] Chris Carter was nominated for an award by the Directors Guild of America for his work on this episode.|$|E

The Boston Globe {{has described}} Kagan's site as having as [...] "bucking the media tide {{with an emphasis}} on stories that illustrate the triumph of the human spirit." [...] In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kagan discussed her career reinvention, and said [...] "I think it's really important to be informed. <b>I</b> just <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it's important to be inspired." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E

5000|$|In his 2008 book On My Honor, Perry {{expressed}} {{his views on}} the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution. [...] "Let's be clear: I don't believe government, which taxes people regardless of their faith, should espouse a specific faith. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> don't <b>think</b> we should allow {{a small minority of}} atheists to sanitize our civil dialogue of religious references." ...|$|R

2500|$|This new-found Punic militarism alarmed many Romans, {{including}} Cato the Elder who, after {{a voyage}} to Carthage, ended all his speeches, {{no matter what}} the topic, by saying: [...] "Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam" [...] – [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that Carthage must be destroyed".|$|E

Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and EON, they will also be shared with the individual recipients." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Growing up in America, these Latvian diplomats {{were our}} heroes. Legends, who {{during the years}} of {{occupation}} embodied the Republic of Latvia in our minds. I learned Latvia's history from Arnold Spekke's and Anatols Dinbergs' books. We called Anatols Dinbergs our chief, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> of him as my diplomatic foster father and teacher. All that is the most important that I have learned about diplomacy, has come from Anatols Dinbergs. He has reached singular achievements in his lifetime. I would also like to emphasize that Anatols Dinbergs was not only Latvia's first ambassador to the United States, he was, in fact, the first Latvian ambassador in history (until Latvia's occupation in 1940 our country had emissaries; it was only with the restoration of state independence in 1991 that the position of ambassador was created -J.Ū.). The task of diplomats in exile was to preserve Latvia's sovereignty. [...] Our diplomatic mission today is to preserve the Latvian state, so that no Latvian ever has to flee into exile." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} This Addiction, Skiba {{expressed a}} desire to return to the band's punk rock roots: [...] "That's how we started as a band, and over the years I think we evolved into kind of more of a rock band with punk roots." [...] Elaborating on the album's sound in a November 2009 interview, he called it [...] "a rock record but our punk rock upbringing definitely shines through, more so than our last few records. The vibe is similar to our humble beginnings. It's a step forward but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it has glimmers of our past in it." [...] He also described the album as more straightforward, with a [...] "less is more" [...] approach that included reducing the number of guitar overdubs, with many of the songs including only one guitar track: [...] "We wanted a record that we could easily play live. For the most part, it's pretty bare bones while still sounding full and big." [...] The album does, however, include some synthesizer as well as a trumpet solo in the style of Neutral Milk Hotel.|$|E

2500|$|Sundaygar Dearboy {{was born}} in District 2, Grand Bassa County, Liberia. He {{is the father of}} two and the {{guardian}} of several others. Dearboy graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from AME Zion College. He is the Project Manager for Liberia Trading & Investment Company (LINTRACO), one of Liberia's newest trading groups. Dearboy has a huge following among Liberians in the diaspora, particularly in the United States. In an interview posted on Oberia.net, Sundaygar said: [...] "Outside Liberia, my music is highly appreciated and supported by those who think my music helps virtually transport and reconnect them with their homeland. I find it gratifying that they support me. However, it is very disappointing that such support is not given to my music or artists locally. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that my music comes fore front as we rebuild our lives and try to reconsolidate our culture and tradition." [...] Speaking on the challenges currently facing the Liberian Music Industry, Dearboy said: [...] "Not many local artists listen to other music and try to emulate or learn from them. Plus, the local market is not accustomed to promoting what belongs to them. They prefer something from outside. Perhaps, the generally quality of production does not meet the standard as those produced in other countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{industry}} {{has been accused of}} making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only can be treated through bio-medical procedures, but should be treated by them. Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr Sami David, a fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of {{the early days of the}} IVF treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: [...] "It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort. [...] Now it's a first resort. [...] I think that's an injustice to women. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it can harm women in the long run." [...] IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to ‘sell’ corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the ‘healthy’ or ‘normal’ body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
