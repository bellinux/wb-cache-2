25|$|Light rail, {{light rail}} transit (LRT), or fast tram is urban public {{transport}} using rolling stock similar to a tramway, but operating at a higher capacity, and often on an <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Metro system's {{rail lines}} use a {{combination}} of exclusive and shared right-of-way, depending on the circumstances. Within the two Downtown Zones, trains run on surface streets in an <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way,</b> without preemption. The Blue Line runs primarily alongside Hiawatha Avenue (Minnesota State Highway 55), along land originally acquired for expansion of that highway, except for a brief stretch in a tunnel underneath Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The Green Line runs along the median of University Avenue in an <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way,</b> except for a brief stretch of the Washington Avenue Transit Mall where its tracks are shared with buses. The Blue Line's at-grade crossings are protected by automated grade crossing gates; the Green Line's crossings move in regular traffic, with signal priority but no preemption.|$|E

25|$|The Hudson–Bergen Light Rail {{system uses}} a {{combination}} of old rail and new <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights-of-way</b> {{for most of its}} length, with some grade separation in certain areas. It shares a lane with automobiles on a portion of Essex Street in downtown Jersey City, but for the most part, does not operate with other traffic. At-grade crossings are equipped with special signals to automatically change traffic lights in favor of the light rail.|$|R
25|$|In {{parts of}} the MAX system, {{particularly}} in central Portland and Hillsboro, MAX trains run on surface streets. Except on the Portland Transit Mall, trains run in reserved lanes closed to other motorized vehicles. On the Transit Mall, trains operate on the same lanes as TriMet buses (although MAX trains have traffic priority). Elsewhere, MAX runs within its own <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way,</b> in street medians, alongside freeways, and on former freight railroad lines.|$|E
25|$|In his response, then Minister for Transport Bob Pearce {{noted the}} {{recommendation}} by the consultants {{for the implementation}} of a bus-based system using an <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way</b> in the median of the Mitchell Freeway. However, he noted that further detailed evaluation of a rail-based option was still being carried out. The report noted that while its preference was to construct a bus expressway, the extension of such a busway beyond Warwick would provide little or no benefits in terms of speed, time, and economics.|$|E
25|$|Speed and {{schedule}} performance have disappointed some transit advocates and the Silver Line routes fall {{far short of}} the minimum BRT Standard promulgated by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP). Some sections have an <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way,</b> but other sections are bogged down by street running in congested mixed traffic. , a contract has been awarded for the first phase of an extension to Chelsea, Massachusetts, largely in reserved right-of-way; other extensions of the Silver Line are being studied as well.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, [...] "light railway" [...] {{generally}} {{refers to}} an urban or interurban rail system, which historically would correspond to a streetcar network. The distinct term light rail {{was introduced in the}} 1970s to describe a form of urban rail public transportation that has a lower capacity and lower speed than a heavy rail or metro system, but which generally operates in <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights-of-way,</b> in contrast with streetcar systems which operate in shared road traffic with automobiles. Urban sprawl combined with higher fuel prices has caused an increase in popularity of these light rail systems in recent decades.|$|R
2500|$|The systems {{described}} in the paragraphs above and below are genuine streetcars or tramways, with smaller vehicles and mixed-traffic street running (i.e. no separation from other vehicles), {{such as those in}} New Orleans and San Francisco. However, a greater number of North American cities have built light rail systems in recent decades, some of which operate partially in the right-of-way of city streets, but which mostly operate in <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights-of-way.</b> A few North American 'light rail' systems date to the [...] "first" [...] streetcar era, such as Boston's Green Line, Cleveland's Blue and Green Lines, Mexico City's Xochimilco Light Rail, and the light rail system in Newark, New Jersey, and so can be considered [...] "holdovers" [...] or [...] "legacies" [...] from that era.|$|R
50|$|A {{special issue}} arises {{in the use}} of buses in metro transit structures. Since the areas where the demand for an <b>exclusive</b> bus <b>right-of-way</b> are apt to be in dense {{downtown}} areas where an above-ground structure may be unacceptable on historic, logistic, or environmental grounds, use of BRT in tunnels may not be avoidable.|$|R
25|$|Bus subways are {{uncommon}} but do exist, {{though in}} these cases the non-underground portions of route are not called subways. Seattle, Washington, has a bus subway downtown, in which light rail trains and diesel-electric hybrid buses operate in a shared tunnel, with overhead wires which power the light rail trains, and the hybrid buses running in electrical-only mode while traveling through the tunnel. Bus subways are sometimes built to provide an <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way</b> for bus rapid transit lines, such as the MBTA Silver Line in Boston. These are usually called by the term bus rapid transit.|$|E
500|$|The {{entirety}} {{of the system}} runs in <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way.</b> BART's rapid transit revenue routes cover about [...] with 45 stations. On the main lines, approximately 28 miles of lines run through underground sections with 32 miles on elevated tracks. Track segments are internally referred to by letter: the A-line from Fremont to Lake Merritt; the C-line from Pittsburg/Bay Point to Rockridge; the L-line Dublin/Pleasanton to Bay Fair; the M-, W-, and Y-lines from West Oakland to Millbrae; the R-line from Richmond to MacArthur; and the S-line from Fremont to Warm Springs.|$|E
500|$|The Manila Light Rail Transit System (...) popularly and informally {{known as}} the LRT is a {{metropolitan}} rail system serving the Metro Manila area in the Philippines. [...] Although {{referred to as a}} light rail system because it originally used light rail vehicles, it has characteristics that make it more akin to a rapid transit (metro) system, such as high passenger throughput, <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way</b> and later use of full metro rolling stock. [...] The system is operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA), a government-owned and controlled corporation under the authority of the Department of Transportation (DOTr). [...] Along with the Manila Metro Rail Transit System (MRT-3, also called the new Yellow Line), and Philippine National Railways's commuter line, the system makes up Metro Manila's rail infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|Light rail {{is defined}} in the United States (and elsewhere) {{as a mode of}} {{electrified}} (or in a few exceptional cases, diesel-powered) rail-based transit, usually urban in nature, which is distinguished by operation in routes of generally exclusive, though not necessarily grade-separated, rights-of-way. This is distinguished from 'heavy rail' systems, also known as rapid transit or 'metro' (e.g. subway and/or elevated), which are fully grade-separated from other traffic, and which are characterized by higher passenger capacities than light rail. Arguably, traditional streetcars (also known as trolleys in North America, or as trams outside of North America especially in Europe), which is rail-based transit that takes place in shared roadways with automobile traffic (i.e. with street running) and thus does not operate in <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights-of-way,</b> can be considered to be a sub-set of light rail, though the two modes of transit are often treated as distinct in the United States.|$|R
40|$|During the {{previous}} century the public transit industry {{has struggled with}} mode and technology issues. Bus and rail have alternated in primacy as operating conditions and financial necessity have pressured operators to seek more cost-effective means of moving passengers. Federal, state, and local financial resources have been outstripped by candidate rapid transit projects, traffic congestion is a growing problem, and travel patterns are becoming increasingly dispersed. In seeking {{to fill the gap}} between conventional bus service and rail projects of all kinds, the transit industry in cooperation with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has placed renewed emphasis on the development of alternatives that reflect a return to the transportation system management approach. Equipped with new tools for improving operating and management productivity of highway and transit networks, transportation agencies are working cooperatively to simulate <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights-of-way</b> operations in mixed-traffic environments as well as meld the line-haul efficiencies of rail with the distribution flexibility of bus. These efforts are known collectively as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), and as with any entity in its infancy, final appearances at maturity are far from certain. 31 Journal of Public Transportation, Vol. 5, No. 2, 200...|$|R
500|$|The network {{consists}} of two lines: the original LRT Line1 (LRT-1) or Green Line, and the more modern LRT Line2 (LRT-2), or Blue Line. [...] The LRT-1 is aligned in a general north–south direction along over 17.2kilometers (10.7mi) of fully elevated track. [...] From Monumento it runs south above {{the hustle and bustle}} of Rizal and Taft Avenues along grade-separated concrete viaducts allowing <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way</b> before ending in Baclaran. [...] A four-station east–west extension along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue that will connect Monumento to the North Avenue station was opened in 2010, although the common station is not yet constructed. [...] Including the extension's two recently opened stations, Balintawak and Roosevelt, the LRT-1 has twenty stations. [...] The LRT-2 or Line 2 {{consists of}} eleven stations in a general east–west direction over 13.8 kilometers (8.57mi) of mostly elevated track, with one station lying underground. [...] Commencing in Recto, the line follows a corridor defined by Claro M. Recto and Legarda Avenues, Ramon Magsaysay and Aurora Boulevards, and the Marikina-Infanta Highway before reaching {{the other end of the}} line at Santolan. [...] The system passes through the cities of Caloocan, Manila, Marikina, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City, and San Juan.|$|E

2500|$|The Orange Line is a bus {{rapid transit}} line in the Metro Busway network in Los Angeles County, California. It {{operates}} between Chatsworth or Warner Center (trips alternate between the two western terminals) and the North Hollywood Metro Station in the San Fernando Valley where it connects with the Metro Red Line on the Metro Rail system for Downtown Los Angeles. The other line in the Metro Busway network is the Metro Silver Line. The [...] Orange Line uses a dedicated, <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way</b> with stations located at approximately one-mile intervals; tickets (via TAP cards) are purchased from ticket machines on the platforms before boarding to improve performance. The Metro Orange Line bicycle path runs alongside part of the route. Unlike the Silver Line, which has a street-running sections within downtown Los Angeles and San Pedro, the Chatsworth branch of the Orange Line runs in a dedicated right-of-way for its entire length. The Warner Center branch includes several blocks of street running in the Warner Center area.|$|E
2500|$|George {{considered}} businesses {{relying on}} <b>exclusive</b> <b>right-of-way</b> land privilege to be [...] "natural" [...] monopolies. Examples {{of these services}} included the transportation of utilities (water, electricity, sewage), information (telecommunications), goods, and travelers. George advocated that these systems of transport along [...] "public ways" [...] should usually be managed as public utilities and provided for free or at marginal cost. In some cases, {{it might be possible}} to allow competition between private service providers along public 'rights of way', such as parcel shipping companies that operate on public roads, but wherever competition would be impossible, George supported complete municipalization. George said that these services would be provided for free because investments in beneficial public goods always tend to increase land values by more than the total cost of those investments. George used the example of urban buildings that provide free vertical transit, paid out of some of the increased value that residents derive from the addition of elevators.|$|E
