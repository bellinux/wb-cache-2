25|$|Though {{the basic}} {{concept of the}} strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to tweak the formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head {{sometimes}} succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or gnomic pronouncements irritating the mouse {{so much that he}} goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even self-referential humor is evident—in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having <b>finished</b> <b>drawing</b> the jailhouse.|$|E
500|$|McCay <b>finished</b> <b>drawing</b> {{the film}} in December 1911. [...] A {{snowstorm}} hit when he {{was to have the}} drawings taken to Vitagraph Studios for photographing, so he hired an enclosed horse-drawn taxi to have them taken there. [...] It disappeared, and a few days later the police found the abandoned taxi with the drawings unharmed inside, the horses two to three miles away. [...] The first attempt to shoot the artwork resulted in unacceptable amounts of flicker due the arc lighting the studio used, and it was re-shot. [...] The completed work came to 600 feet of film.|$|E

5000|$|Kendall's highest {{first-class}} {{score of}} 201 was achieved against Sussex in 1999 under somewhat unusual circumstances. Replying to Sussex's first innings of 375, Hampshire were bowled out for just 76 (Kendall 2) {{and asked to}} follow on. However, second time around Hampshire piled on the runs, eventually declaring at 570/6; Kendall's 201 had taken slightly more than eight hours.

6000|$|Aileen was one {{of those}} girls who possessed the rare and delectable {{capacity}} to [...] "throw on" [...] her bonnet and shawl. One glance in the mirror sufficed to convince her that these articles, although thrown on, had fallen into their appropriate places neatly. It could scarcely have been otherwise. Her bonnet and shawl took kindly to her, like all other things in nature--animate and otherwise. She reappeared before her sedate father had quite <b>finished</b> <b>drawing</b> on his gloves.|$|E
60|$|A {{considerable}} number of these larger plates were at first intended to be executed in tinted lithography; but, finding the result unsatisfactory, I have determined to prepare the principal subjects for mezzotinting,--a change of method requiring two new drawings {{to be made of}} every subject; one a carefully penned outline for the etcher, and then a <b>finished</b> <b>drawing</b> upon the etching. This work does not proceed fast, while I am also occupied with the completion of the text; but the numbers of it will appear as fast as I can prepare them.|$|E
6000|$|... [200] Stale {{crumb of}} bread is better, {{if you are}} making a {{delicate}} drawing, than India-rubber, for it disturbs {{the surface of the}} paper less: but it crumbles about the room and makes a mess; and, besides, you waste the good bread, which is wrong; and your drawing will not for a long while be worth the crumbs. So use India-rubber very lightly; or, if heavily pressing it only, not passing it over the paper, and leave what pencil marks that will not come away so, without minding them. In a <b>finished</b> <b>drawing</b> the uneffaced penciling is often serviceable, helping the general tone, and enabling you to take out little bright lights.|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy {{reached out}} for the mug. Not a drop. He put it back gently with a faint sigh--and closed his eyes. He thought:--That lunatic Belfast will bring me some water if I ask. Fool. I am very thirsty.... It was very hot in the cabin, {{and it seemed to}} turn slowly round, detach itself from the ship, and swing out {{smoothly}} into a luminous, arid space where a black sun shone, spinning very fast. A place without any water! No water! A policeman with the face of Donkin drank a glass of beer by the side of an empty well, and flew away flapping vigorously. A ship whose mastheads protruded through the sky and could not be seen, was discharging grain, and the wind whirled the dry husks in spirals along the quay of a dock with no water in it. He whirled along with the husks--very tired and light. All his inside was gone. He felt lighter than the husks--and more dry. He expanded his hollow chest. The air streamed in, carrying away in its rush a lot of strange things that resembled houses, trees, people, lamp-posts.... No more! There was no more air--and he had not <b>finished</b> <b>drawing</b> his long breath. But he was in jail! They were locking him up. A door slammed. They turned the key twice, flung a bucket of water over him--Phoo! What for? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After this {{testimony}} to the completion of Turner's work, I need not at length defend myself from the charge of hyperbole in the statement that, 'as far as I know, the galleries of Europe may be challenged to produce one sketch [footnote: A sketch, observe,--not a <b>finished</b> <b>drawing.</b> Sketches are only proper subjects of comparison with each other when they contain about the same quantity of work: the test of their merit is the quantity of truth told with a given number of touches. The assertion in the Catalogue which this letter was written to defend, was made respecting the sketch of Rome, No. 101.] that shall equal the chalk study No. 45, or the feeblest of the memoranda in the 71st and following frames;' which memoranda, however, {{it should have been}} observed, are stated at the 44th page to be in some respects 'the grandest work in grey that he did in his life.' For I believe that, as manipulators, none but the four men whom I have just named (the three Venetians and Correggio) were equal to Turner; and, as far as I know, none of those four ever put their full strength into sketches. But whether they did or not, my statement in the catalogue is limited by my own knowledge: and, as far as I can trust that knowledge, it is not an enthusiastic statement, but an entirely calm and considered one. It may be a mistake {{but it is not a}} hyperbole." ...|$|E
50|$|Ibrahim Salim Saad {{was a part}} of the Iraq {{national}} football team.

60|$|The {{blocks of}} stone which form the {{foreground}} of the Ulleswater are, I believe, the finest {{example in the}} world of the <b>finished</b> <b>drawing</b> of rocks which have been subjected to violent aqueous action. Their surfaces seem to palpitate from the fine touch of the waves, and every part of them is rising or falling in soft swell or gentle depression, though the eye can scarcely trace the fine shadows on which this chiselling of the surface depends. And with all this, every block of them has individual character, dependent on the expression of the angular lines of which its contours were first formed, and which is retained and felt through all the modulation and melting of the water-worn surface. And what is done here in the most important part of the picture, to be especially attractive to the eye, is often done by Turner with lavish and overwhelming power, in the accumulated débris of a wide foreground, strewed with the ruin of ages, as, for instance, in the Junction of the Greta and Tees, where he has choked the torrent bed with a mass of shattered rock, thrown down with the profusion and carelessness of nature herself; and yet every separate block is a study, (and has evidently been drawn from nature,) chiselled and varied in its parts, as if it were to be the chief member of a separate subject; yet without ever losing, in a single instance, its subordinate position, or occasioning, throughout the whole accumulated multitude, the repetition of a single line.|$|E
