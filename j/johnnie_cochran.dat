25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran,</b> Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} two episode [...] "Chef Aid", {{attorney}} <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran</b> uses what's {{called in the}} show the Chewbacca defense, which is a legal strategy that involves addressing plot holes related to Chewbacca in the film Return of the Jedi rather than discussing the trial at hand during a closing argument in a deliberate attempt to confuse jurors into thinking there is reasonable doubt. The term [...] "Chewbacca defense" [...] has been documented as being used by criminologists, forensic scientists, and political commentators in their various discussions of similar methods used in legal cases and public forums.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, Mehri cowrote, with <b>Johnnie</b> L. <b>Cochran</b> Jr., {{a report}} titled Black Coaches in the National Football League: Superior Performance, Inferior Opportunities. In response, the NFL adopted the Rooney Rule.

Mehri’s work with the NFL formed the basis of the book, Advancing the Ball: Race, Reformation, and the Quest for Equal Coaching Opportunity in the NFL, by N. Jeremi Duru.|$|R
2500|$|Immediate {{reaction}} to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the [...] "not guilty" [...] verdict, {{while the majority of}} whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not. O. J. Simpson's integrated defense counsel included <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran,</b> Robert Kardashian, Robert Shapiro, and F. Lee Bailey. Marcia Clark was the lead prosecutor for the State of California.|$|E
2500|$|Pagones also sued Brawley. She {{defaulted}} by not {{appearing at}} the trial, {{and the judge}} ordered her to pay Pagones damages of $185,000. [...] The $65,000 judgment levied against Al Sharpton was paid for him in 2001 by supporters, including attorney <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran</b> plus former businessman Earl G. Graves, Jr. In December 2012, the New York Post reported that Maddox had paid his judgment of $97,000 and Mason was making payments on the $188,000 which he owed. Brawley reportedly had not made any payments. The following month a court ordered her wages garnished to pay Pagones.|$|E
2500|$|Attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason joined Sharpton {{in support}} of Brawley. A grand jury was convened; after seven months of {{examining}} police and medical records, the jury found [...] "overwhelming evidence" [...] that Brawley had fabricated her story. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason had accused the Dutchess County prosecutor, Steven Pagones, of racism and {{of being one of}} the perpetrators of the alleged abduction and rape. The three were successfully sued for defamation, and were ordered to pay $345,000 in damages, with the jury finding Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two, and Mason for one. Sharpton refused to pay his share of the damages; it was later paid by a number of black business leaders including <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Five years later, Cochran {{returned}} to private practice, reinventing himself as [...] "the {{best in the}} West" [...] by opening the <b>Johnnie</b> L <b>Cochran,</b> Jr. law firm. In contrast to his early loss in the Deadwyler case, Cochran won 760,000 for the family of Ron Settles, a black college football player who, his family claimed, was murdered by the police. In 1990, Cochran joined a succeeding firm, Cochran, Mitchell & Jenna, and joined Cochran, Cherry, Givens & Smith in 1997.

2500|$|After {{serving his}} {{internship}} and residency at the University of Michigan, in 1987 {{he moved to}} the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he later became head of UCLA's Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program.

2500|$|However, {{later on}} appeal, {{the issue of}} whether OutKast {{violated}} the Lanham Act for false advertising was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court's determination that the title [...] "Rosa Parks" [...] had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks' representation hired lawyer <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran</b> to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied on First Amendment grounds. In 2003, the Supreme Court turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court's decision. The judge ruled that the song was an [...] "expressive work" [...] and that it was protected by the 1st amendment. The judge stated that there was a definite linkage between the song and Rosa Parks.|$|E
2500|$|Five elderly {{survivors}} of the riot, represented by a legal team that included <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran</b> and Charles Ogletree, filed suit against the city of Tulsa {{and the state of}} Oklahoma (Alexander, et al., v.

Ogletree said the state and city should compensate the victims and their families [...] "to honor their admitted obligations as detailed in the commission's report". [...] The federal district and appellate courts dismissed the suit, citing the statute of limitations had been exceeded on the 80-year-old case. The state requires that civil rights cases be filed within two years of the event. The court did not rule at all on the issues. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the appeal.|$|E

40|$|The National Football League (the 2 ̆ 2 NFL 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 League 2 ̆ 2), {{like the}} National Basketball Association (the 2 ̆ 2 NBA 2 ̆ 2) and Major League Baseball (2 ̆ 2 MLB 2 ̆ 2), {{has a long}} history of racial exclusion. 2 ̆ 7 And like these other long {{standing}} American professional sports leagues, desegregation among players preceded desegregation among coaches. As slowly increasing numbers of minorities assumed NBA head coaching positions and MLB managing positions toward the end of the twentieth century, however, minority NFL coaches were less likely to receive head coaching opportunities than their basketball and baseball counterparts. Indeed, as of 2002, only two of the NFL 2 ̆ 7 s thirty-two head coaches were minorities, and only five, including those two, had held head coaching positions during the League 2 ̆ 7 s modem era. Four years later, however, the NFL had more than tripled its number of minority head coaches and shone as a model for other athletic institutions seeking to provide head coaching candidates equal employment opportunities. This article seeks to explore the history of racial exclusion in the NFL, the particular barriers minority coaches seeking NFL head coaching positions have faced, and the effort to level the playing field for such coaches. Part I of this article traces the NFL 2 ̆ 7 s initial expulsion of African Americans, its eventual reintegration, and the patterns accompanying that reintegration. Part I 1 explores the travails of the NFL 2 ̆ 7 s first three post-reintegration coaches of color as well as statistical evidence revealing that, as of 2002, NFL coaches of color generally suffered inferior opportunities despite exhibiting outstanding performance. Part III examines the campaign launched by attorneys Cyrus Mehri and <b>Johnnie</b> L. <b>Cochran,</b> Jr. to alter NFL teams 2 ̆ 7 hiring practices, the creation of the Rooney Rule (the 2 ̆ 2 Rule 2 ̆ 2), and the birth of the Fritz Pollard Alliance of minority coaches, scouts, and front office personnel in the NFL.

2500|$|PCBs (manufactured {{through most}} of the 20th century until the early 2000s) {{originating}} from Monsanto Chemical Company in Anniston, Alabama [...] were dumped into Snow Creek, which then spread to Choccolocco Creek, then Logan Martin Lake. In the early 2000s, class action lawsuits were settled by local land owners, including those on Logan Martin Lake, and Lay Reservoir (downstream on the Coosa River), for the PCB pollution. Donald Stewart, former Senator from Alabama, first learned of the concerns of hundreds of west Anniston residents after representing a church which had been approached about selling its property [...] by Monsanto. Stewart went on to be the pioneer and lead attorney in the first and majority of cases against Monsanto and focused on residents in the immediate area known to be most polluted. Other attorneys later joined in to file suits for those outside the main immediate area around the plant; one of these was the late <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On June 15, 1995, defense {{attorney}} <b>Johnnie</b> <b>Cochran</b> goaded assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden into asking Simpson {{to put on}} the leather glove that was found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because (according to prosecutors) the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman, and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath. Uelmen came up with and Cochran repeated a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments, [...] "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Lance Ito of his concerns that Simpson [...] "has arthritis and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing. The prosecution presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.|$|E
