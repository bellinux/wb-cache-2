Three layout strategies with improved matching performance are reviewed and summarized. The hexagonal tessellation pattern can cancel quadratic gradient errors with only 3 units for each device and has high area-efficiency when extended. Both the Nth-order circular symmetry patterns and Nth-order central symmetry patterns can cancel up to Nth-order <b>gradient</b> <b>effects</b> between two devices using 2 N unit cells for each one. Among these three techniques, the central symmetry patterns {{have the best}}-reported matching performance for Manhattan structures; the circular-symmetry patterns have the best theoretical matching performance; and the hexagonal tessellation pattern has high density and high structural stability. The Nth-order central symmetry technique is compatible to all IC fabrication processes requiring no special design rules. Simulation results of these proposed techniques show better matching characteristics than other existing layout techniques under nonlinear <b>gradient</b> <b>effects.</b> Specifically, two pairs of P-poly resistors using 2 nd and 3 rd-order central symmetry patterns were fabricated and tested.

50|$|All of the {{processes}} of Shiina macrolactonization consist of reversible reactions, {{with the exception of}} the last cyclization step. At the first stage of the reaction, mixed anhydride (MA) is produced quickly under mild conditions; at the second stage, a faster cyclization of the MA prevents an increase in MA concentration. To maximize this concentration <b>gradient</b> <b>effect,</b> the starting material, i.e., hydroxycarboxylic acid (seco acid), is fed slowly into the system with a syringe driver. When seco acid is added into the system little by little using a syringe driver, all of the reactant is quickly converted into MA; then, the MA is immediately consumed by the cyclization reaction. As just described, MA concentration is kept low throughout the Shiina macrolactonization reaction. Therefore, the monomer production rate is very high.|$|E

5000|$|The Gradient Model is an {{alternative}} theory {{on the distribution of}} spatial attention. This model proposes that attentional resources are allocated in a gradient pattern, with concentrated resources in the centre of focus and resources decrease in a continuous fashion away from the centre. Downing conducted research using an adaptation of Posner’s cueing paradigm that supported this model. The target could appear in 12 potential locations, marked by boxes. Results showed that attentional facilitation was strongest at the cued location and gradually decreased with distance away from the cued location. However, not all research has supported the gradient model. For example, Hughes and Zimba [...] conducted a similar experiment, using a highly distributed visual array and did not use boxes to mark the potential locations of the target. There was no evidence of a <b>gradient</b> <b>effect,</b> as the faster responses were when the cue and target were in the same hemifield and slower responses when they were in different hemifields. The boxes {{played an important role in}} attention as a later experiment, used the boxes and consequently found a gradient pattern. Therefore, it is considered that the size of the gradient can adjust according to the circumstances. A broader gradient may be adopted when there is an empty display, as attention can spread and is only restricted by hemifield borders.|$|E

Elastic strain <b>gradient</b> <b>effect</b> {{has also been}} reported, but so far only theoretical work about this issue could be found.

It is shown that there exists a noticeable inconsistency between atomistic simulation and theoretical prediction. In contrary to hardening effect predicted by the strain gradient elasticity, the atomistic simulation results reveal a significant softening effect in diamond silicon nanoplate bending when the thickness is less than 10 nm. Although a hardening effect is exhibited in the atomistic simulation of FCC copper nanoplate bending, it is negligible.

An overview of previous research studies revealed that the presence of strain gradient would affect the maximum concrete stress developed in flexure.

As a continued study, the authors herein will extend the investigation of strain <b>gradient</b> <b>effect</b> on flexural strength and ductility of RC beams to higher strength concrete up to 100 [*]MPa by theoretical analysis. In this study, the flexural strength of RC beams is evaluated using nonlinear strain-gradient-dependent stress–strain curves of concrete applicable to both normal-strength and high-strength concrete. On the basis of this, a parametric study is conducted to investigate the combined effects of strain gradient and concrete strength on the flexural strength and ductility of RC beams. It was evident from the results that both the flexural strength and ductility of RC beams would be improved with strain gradient considered.

40|$|Children {{experience}} a higher poverty {{rate in the}} U.

Using Luxembourg Income Study data, we find that child poverty rates are higher in the U. S. than in 13 out of 14 other high-income nations. The poverty rate for American children living with a single female and no other adult (55 %) is the highest for any family structures in any nation. Using demographic decomposition, we isolate the contributions of several factors to the overall gap, including family-formation behaviors and living-arrangement decisions that place children in family structures with differential poverty risks (distributional effect), and differences in market earnings and transfer income between households headed by a married couple and other households with children (<b>gradient</b> <b>effects).</b> Distributional effects contribute to the U.
