Most of current work focuses mainly on two dynamic aspects of the problem, namely dynamic arrival of <b>jobs</b> and dynamic <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> The degree of dynamism, for example is defined with respect to dynamic arrival of jobs. This paper focuses on another dynamic aspect, namely the duration of tasks. This aspect becomes important when tasks durations are relatively long and, in addition, one has to respect time windows. We characterize the degree of dynamism of such problems and show that it relates with the expected cost of a static scheduler which is reapplied in light of dynamic events. Furthermore, preliminary experiments indicate that {{the performance of the}} scheduler can be improved when the expected duration of a task is overestimated...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a lively debate over using land use {{strategies}} to reduce automobile dependence over the past decade. As {{a part of the}} issue, this study investigates the spatial characteristics around workplaces and their relationships to commuting made by the employees in metropolitan Dallas-Fort Worth. The tools of geographic information systems (GIS) are utilized to measure workplace environs. Several statistical methods are applied to analyze commuting behavior. This study finds that low-density suburban workplaces are associated with shorter vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> but more drive-alone trips. While major suburban centers attain some level of compact development in terms of local activity mix and regional accessibility, employees in these centers are far more automobile dependent than employees in older centers in the central city. In the suburban locations, workplaces in residence-based centers and master planned communities with a mix of activities are associated with less drive-alone commuting and more carpooling. Workers take advantage of the abundance of activities, as larger and denser centers are associated with more non-work activity stops after work. Yet, the trip chaining is overwhelmingly driven by automobile use. This study also finds that spatial factors are significant in explaining commuting behavior. Yet, the importance of spatial factors varies with the aspect of travel. Spatial factors do a better <b>job</b> in explaining <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> than in explaining travel mode and trip chaining. The way a particular spatial factor affects commuting also varies with the aspect of travel. For instance, land use intensity factors are associated with longer <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> but less drive-alone trips. While this study suggests that concerted planning may affect travel, some socioeconomic variables, including income and automobile ownership, are strongly related to more automobile travel. The findings suggest that the land use strategies to cope with transportation and air quality problems, such as new urbanism and jobs-housing balance, would be a viable option in and around employment locations. But, such strategies should be carefully designed because of the differences in effectiveness of spatial factors with travel outcomes and the trade-offs between travel outcomes with a particular spatial factor...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> {{distribution}} {{of different types}} of urban roads, the link and path average <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> and variance estimation methods by analyzing the large-scale <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> dataset detected from automatic number plate readers installed throughout Beijing. The results show that the best-fitting <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution for different road links in 15 min time intervals differs for different traffic congestion levels. The average <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> for all links on all days can be estimated with acceptable precision by using normal distribution. However, this distribution is not suitable to estimate <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variance under some types of traffic conditions.

40|$|A {{negative}} effect of congestion {{that tends to}} be overlooked is <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty. <b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty causes scheduling costs due to early or late arrival.

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability in traffic management, control, and network design {{has received a}} lot of attention in the past decade. In this paper, a network <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution model based on the Johnson curve system is proposed.

We further investigate the network-level <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability by connecting the network reliability measures such as the weighted standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate and the weighted skewness of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate distributions with network traffic characteristics (e. g., the network density).

40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> {{reliability}} {{are important}} performance measures for assessing traffic condition {{and extent of}} congestion on a roadway. Most commonly used methods to obtain <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data either produce only estimates of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> or too few <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data points for meaningful analysis. This study focuses on using a new probe vehicle technique, the Bluetooth technology, to collect two weeks of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data on Interstate- 69 in Indianapolis. These data are then used to estimate econometric models, {{which can be used}} to predict freeway segment <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> ^ First, an autoregressive model is estimated based on the collected data. Individual vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> on a freeway segment are expressed as a function of speed, volume, time of day indicators, and previous vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> In addition to the autoregressive formulation, a duration model is estimated based on the same <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data. The duration model enables calculation of the probability of the vehicle exiting the segment of the road at any point in time. The estimated models indicate that the rate of vehicles exiting the segment as a function of their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rises initially until the inflection point and then decreases. It is hypothesized that the inflection point occurs at the onset of congestion, when longer <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> may not result in a higher probability of exiting the freeway segment. Lastly, a seemingly unrelated regression equation model to predict <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and intervehicle variability is proposed. This model predicts 15 -minute interval <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and the standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> based on speed, volume and time of day indicators.

40|$|A common way to {{determine}} values of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and schedule delay is by estimating departure time choice models using revealed preference (RP) data.

As the availability of such data is limited, most departure time choice studies only take into account <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> on trip segments rather than door-to-doortravel times, or use very rough measures of door-to-door <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> We show that ignoring the temporal and spatial variation of <b>travel</b> <b>times,</b> and in particular, the correlation of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> across links may lead to biased estimates {{of the value of}} time.

40|$|Summary The {{importance}} of mobility {{and technology in}} the current Information Age makes it interesting to investigate the interconnections between these aspects. The New Mobilities Paradigm underlines the interconnections between technology-supported virtual mobilities and corporeal mobilities, which encompasses the two important features of our current post-modern society; mobility and ICT. This vision is used to investigate the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use of Dutch travellers, the factors that can influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the role of ICT in <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the influence of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use on journey experience and the differences in these aspects between transport modes. Many policy makers {{in the field of}} transportation see <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> as a disutility and a cost to someone’s productive time, which means that they aim to minimise <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> But it is argued in the present study that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> can be used to perform activities, which can give <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> a positive utility. The developments of mobile ICT have the potential to increase the productivity of travellers, which can enhance the positive utilities of <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> Previous studies have already looked into <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and the positive utilities of <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> Several studies in the UK and a study in Japan have already investigated <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and the role of ICT, but the Dutch context was not studied in this respect before. The <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uses in cars and trains were investigated in previous studies, but more research was needed to gain more insights into <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and some associated aspects. Busses and metros were not investigated before, and the differences between transport modes in <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use and the other investigated aspects could be important to study as well. This is why <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the factors that can influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, the role of ICT, the influence of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use on journey experience and the differences in these aspects between transport modes are investigated among Dutch car, train, bus and metro travellers in the Rotterdam metropolitan area. Questionnaires and observations were used to collect empirical data, as the combination of asking questions and observing behaviour can give more complete information and can prevent problems with biased data outcomes. The results showed that travellers engaged in all sorts of activities while travelling. Many travellers were looking out of the window, using mobile phones, relaxing, talking to fellow travellers or listening to music during their journeys. Most respondents saw their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use as time-out or relaxation, and many of the activities they performed were more for personal benefit than for productivity. More than three quarters of the respondents did not see their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> as wasted or lost time, but indicated it as either productive or relaxing, which means that most travellers in the present study did seem to get some positive utilities from their <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> It was also found that available seating (in public transport), carrying equipment and using well-designed and high-quality vehicles, can positively influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. But high degrees of crowding (in public transport) and noise were found to have negative influences on <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. ICT was found to positively influence <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> productivity and journey experience, which indicates a positive role of ICT in <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. <b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> use itself also had a positive influence on the perceived journey experiences of travellers, which again shows that most travellers got some sort of positive utility from their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> by performing activities on the move. The data also showed clear differences between transport modes, as most <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uses showed higher frequencies in public transport modes when compared to cars. Especially train users showed high frequencies in many <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> activities, and the role of ICT also seemed to be the most significant and positive in the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use on trains. The respondents perceived the train to be the best transport mode option in terms of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, while the metro was perceived quite negatively. The present study resulted in valuable new insights into <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use in the Dutch context, but also found that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> is mainly used for relaxing activities. This was also concluded in previous studies on <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use, but {{it can be argued that}} these non-productive activities also have important benefits for travellers. The results also showed that people perceive their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> quite positively and that they often use their <b>time</b> invested in <b>travelling</b> in a useful way, which can lead to a more positive travel experience. And the fast developments of mobile ICT can help to increase productivity and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use. Policy makers should stop treating <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> as a disutility and should promote <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use instead, as the potentials and positive utilities of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> use are clearly shown in the present study...|$|R

From this figure it can be observed that SRSM probability distribution is uni-modal (having one maximum at 625  sec), asymmetrical and similarly follows the actual <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution. Whereas <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution obtained by MLR models are bimodal frequency curves having two peaks, one maximum at 625  s and the other maximum at 925  s. Even <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution estimated by MLR model by considering all the uncertainty parameters (Table  1) also follows bimodal frequency. From this it can be conclude that the MLR models are overestimating beyond the average actual <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> (783  s). It can also be concluded from the Fig.  5 that even if more uncertainty parameters are considered for modeling <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> MLR models are unable to follow the actual <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution. Further, from <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution it can be observed that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> obtained by SRSM model is well distributed between <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> 542  s to 2, 302  s. Whereas MLR models estimated <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution varies between 493 to 1, 363  s. From this it can be concluded that MLR models are unable to map the worst case scenarios, this we can observe from tails of the probability distribution of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> (Fig.  5).|$|R
40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> {{reliability}} {{are important}} performance measures for assessing traffic condition {{and extent of}} congestion on a roadway. This study first uses a floating car technique to assess <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability {{on a number of}} Indiana highways. Then the study goes on to describe the use of Bluetooth technology to collect real <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data on a freeway and applies it to obtain two weeks of data on Interstate 69 in Indianapolis. An autoregressive model, estimated based on the collected data, is then proposed to predict individual vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> on a freeway segment. This model includes speed, volume, time of day indicators, and previous vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> as independent variables. In addition to the autoregressive formulation, a duration model is estimated based on the same <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data. The duration model of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> provided insights into how one could predict the probability of a car’s duration of time on a roadway segment changed over time. Interestingly, the three duration models estimated (all hours, peak hour and night time models) showed that the point where the conditional probability of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> becoming longer occurs roughly at the onset of level-of-service F conditions. Finally, a seemingly unrelated regression equation model to predict <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and travel-time variability is estimated. This model predicts 15 -minute interval <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> and standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> based on speed, volume and time of day indicators. The model has a very good statistical fit and thus can be used in the field to compute real-time <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> using data available from remote traffic microwave sensors...|$|R
40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> {{estimation}} is {{of increasing}} importance as congestion worsens in major urban areas. Travel reliability {{on a given}} corridor may be more for travelers, shippers, and transport managers. This paper examines the use of measured <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability indices for improving real-time transportation management and traveler information, using archived ITS data. Several reliability measures are tested including <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> 95 th percentile <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> index, buffer index planning time index, and congestion frequency. Results are aimed at improving {{the ways in which}} <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability is communicated to users and managers through a comprehensive survey...|$|R
40|$|Most {{conventional}} {{route guidance}} systems select the optimal route {{on the basis}} of the minimum expected route <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> However, as a result of the inherent variation in driving conditions, the route <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> that drivers will experience may be longer or shorter than the expected mean <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> Drivers are likely to have a lower tolerance for experiencing <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> that exceed their expectation, and as a result, drivers may want to select routes that provide them with smaller <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variation. While this is clearly desirable, it is not clear whether the paths providing the minimum average <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> are also the optimal paths for other levels of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability. This paper examines the impact that routing strategy has on route selection. Specifically, the proportion of paths that change when drivers alter their route selection criteria from selecting the minimum travel path computed {{on the basis of}} the average <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> to that computed on the basis of say the 95 th percentile <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> is computed. The analysis, conducted using simulation results from a network of a portion of Seattle, Washington, indicates that if a routing system selects routes {{on the basis of the}} 95 th percentile <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> then approximately 15 % of all routes would be different than the minimum mean <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> routes. The results indicate that there may exist opportunities for improving the reliability of trip <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> by changing the route selection strategy to directly consider <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variability...|$|R
40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> is {{probably}} one of the most studied attributes in route choice. Recently, perception of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> received more attention as several studies have shown its importance in explaining route choice behavior. In particular, <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> estimates by travelers appear to be biased against non- chosen options even if these are faster. In this paper, the authors study <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> perception and route choice of routes with different degrees of road hierarchy and directness. In the Dutch city of Enschede, respondents were asked to choose a route and provide their estimated <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> for both the preferred and alternative routes. These <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> were then compared with actual <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> Results from previous studies were confirmed and expanded. The shortest time route was chosen in 41 % of the cases while the perceived shortest time route was chosen by almost 80 % of the respondents. Respondents overestimated <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> in general but overestimated the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> of non-chosen routes more than the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> of chosen routes. Perception of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> depends on road hierarchy and route directness, as more direct routes and routes higher up in the hierarchy were perceived as being relatively fast. In addition, there is evidence that these attributes also influence route choice independently of perceived <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> Finally, <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> perceptions appear to be most strongly biased against non-chosen options when respondents were familiar with the route or indicated a clear preference for the chosen routes. This result indicates that behavior will be more difficult to change for the regular travelers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>time,</b> <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> {{reliability}} and monetary cost have been empirically {{identified as the}} most important criteria influencing route choice behaviour. We concentrate on <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> {{reliability and}} review two prominent user equilibrium models incorporating these two factors. We discuss some shortcomings of these models and propose alternative bi-objective user equilibrium models that overcome the shortcomings. Finally, based on the observation that both models use standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> within their measure of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability, we propose a general <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability bi-objective user equilibrium model. We prove that this model encompasses those discussed previously and hence forms a general framework for the study of reliability related user equilibrium. We demonstrate and validate our concepts on a small three-link example...|$|R
40|$|Probe vehicle {{data are}} {{commonly}} used for areawide measurements of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> in road networks. In this context, <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> usually refer to fixed edges of an underlying (digital) map. That means, measured <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> have to be transformed into so-called link <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> first. This paper analyzes a common method being applied for solving this task (distance-based <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> decomposition). It is shown that, in general, its inherent imprecision must not be neglected. Instead, it might cause a serious misinterpretation of data if potential errors in context of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> decomposition are ignored. For this purpose, systematic as well as maximum deviations between "decomposed" and "true" link <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> are mathematically analyzed. Three examples ranging from pure theory to real world confirm the analytical findings and underline the problems resulting from distance-based <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> decomposition at local level, i. e. at individual intersections...|$|R
40|$|Participants of a large-scale, real-life peak {{avoidance}} experiment {{have been}} asked to provide estimates of their average in-vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> for their morning commute. Comparing these reported <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> to the corresponding actual <b>travel</b> <b>times,</b> we find that <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> are overstated by a factor of 1. 5 on average. We test to which extent driver- and link-specic characteristics explain the overstating. Subsequently, we investigate whether the driver-specic reporting errors are consistent with the drivers' scheduling behavior in reality as well as in hypothetical choice experiments. For neither case, we find robust evidence that drivers behave as if they misperceived <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> to a similar extent as they misreported them. These results imply that reported <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> are neither an appropriate measure for representing actual nor perceived <b>travel</b> <b>times,</b> and are thus a strong caveat against the uncritical use of reported <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data in research and policy...|$|R
