The worm cannot travel <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> 1 the first time it has to make a choice, <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on.

5|$|Changes <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> of {{this nature}} are most {{commonly}} observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the large}} shift, the change <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> was never {{recorded}} by magnetic declinations, fracture zone orientations or plate reconstructions; nor could a continental collision have occurred {{fast enough to}} produce such a pronounced bend in the chain. To test {{whether or not the}} bend was a result of a change <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite. While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the magnetite. Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of surface residual stresses over gear teeth {{were characterized by}} means of X-ray diffraction on case hardened gears after grinding, running-in and efficiency testing. Spur gears made of 16 MnCr 5 steel were tested in a FZG back to back test rig at 94 Nm and 302 Nm running-in loads, and efficiency tests. After grinding a non-equal biaxial stress state was found with compressive residual stresses <b>in</b> profile <b>direction</b> more than twice those <b>in</b> axial <b>direction.</b> On {{one side of the}} teeth the stresses were uniform, while the other had gradients from tip to dedendum and <b>in</b> axial <b>direction.</b> Running-in increased the compressive stresses <b>in</b> both <b>directions,</b> but the lower load gave higher stresses <b>in</b> profile <b>direction</b> and lower <b>in</b> axial <b>direction.</b> The stresses increased further <b>in</b> profile <b>direction</b> during efficiency testing, while <b>in</b> profile <b>direction</b> they tend to decrease, totally towards rather equal stresses <b>in</b> both <b>directions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Inga is {{the third}} longest-lived Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The 11th tropical cyclone and 9th named storm of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Inga developed on September 20 in the central Atlantic and tracked westward. After attaining tropical storm status, the system deteriorated into a depression, but once again intensified several days later. The storm eventually peaked in strength on October 5, with winds corresponding to Category 3 on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Throughout its path, Inga underwent several changes <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> and oscillations in strength, before dissipating on October 15, 25 days after it formed. Despite its duration, Inga caused little damage, and mostly remained over open waters.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{platform}} format was {{a departure}} from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game {{due to a lack of}} support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode.

50|$|Intuitively, as an example, {{consider}} a function ƒ whose singular support is concentrated on a smooth {{curve in the}} plane at which the function has a jump discontinuity. <b>In</b> the <b>direction</b> tangent to the curve, the function remains smooth.

To decide on whether the function is smooth <b>in</b> another <b>direction</b> v, one can try to smooth the function out by averaging <b>in</b> <b>directions</b> perpendicular to v. If the resulting function is smooth, then we regard ƒ to be smooth <b>in</b> the <b>direction</b> of v. Otherwise, v is in the wavefront set.|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite <b>in</b> <b>direction.</b> For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E

5|$|A Bosman {{transfer}} to Portsmouth followed after three successful seasons at the Berkshire-based club. Initially, Primus struggled {{to break into}} the team and had his progress hindered by injuries. But the 2002–03 season signaled a change <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> as Primus broke into the first team and won Portsmouth fan's player of the season as well as the PFA Fans' Player of the Year for his division. For the next three seasons Primus {{was in and out of}} the first team and worked under three managers: Harry Redknapp, Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. The 2006–07 season was the last injury-free season for Primus as a career-threatening knee injury meant he would not make an appearance the following season. Primus went out on loan to former club Charlton and made 10 appearances and one further appearance for Portsmouth before retiring through injury in December 2009. The Milton End stand at Fratton Park was renamed the 'Linvoy Primus Community Stand' because of his outstanding services to the club.|$|E
5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{over the}} central United States induced high wind shear over Sandy as it traversed the Bahamas, causing the hurricane to weaken to {{a tropical storm}} while turning more northeastward. The {{southern part of the}} trough detached, causing the shear to decrease late on October28 and allowing Sandy to regain strength. It attained a secondary peak of Category2 strength the following day, and later turned toward the west. During this change <b>in</b> <b>direction,</b> Sandy began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed before making landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, late on October29. The extratropical remnants weakened gradually overland, and the center of circulation was declared indistinguishable over western Pennsylvania two days later. In addition to becoming the largest Atlantic hurricane, Sandy broke records for the lowest pressures ever observed in many cities across the Northeastern United States.|$|E
