500|$|The {{crossover}} {{games with}} the BNL clubs were seen {{by many to be}} the first stage towards the amalgamation of the two organisations into one league; essentially reforming the original BHL. However, early in the season it was revealed that two teams from the BNL, Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers, were seeking to resign from the BNL and join the EIHL; preferring the standard of hockey that the EIHL had to offer. A withdrawal of these clubs would leave the BNL with only five remaining participating teams. This situation led to the resigning teams temporarily withdrawing their Elite League applications and entering into collective discussions on the entire BNL joining the EIHL instead. The Elite League offered the BNL clubs invitations to join the EIHL structure, which were declined by the remaining teams due to unfavourable terms. Subsequently, Capitals and Vipers both resubmitted <b>individual</b> <b>applications</b> to the Elite League; both of which were accepted. This ultimately led to the dissolution of the BNL, with the five remaining teams joining the next tier of British hockey (which consisted of the English Premier Ice Hockey League in England and Scottish National League in Scotland respectively).|$|E

The most sophisticated expression of the improvement and systemisation of the international protection of the human rights can be found in the European Convention on Human Rights. The significance of the Convention lies in not only the rights and freedoms it has procured but in its international judicial control mechanism which is based on <b>individual</b> <b>application.</b> This thesis aimed to review of the practical implementation of the <b>individual</b> <b>application</b> mechanism of the European Convention on Human Rights which has been regarded as the most sophisticated system ever developed, due to the fact that it has rendered the right of <b>individual</b> <b>application</b> to the international organisations and also it confers responsibility to the states violating the rights of individuals by disregarding the international law.

LarsonThe {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case {{study was to explore}} and identify the word consciousness and <b>individual</b> <b>application</b> of academic vocabulary through the use of vocabulary reader response journals, authentic discussions, and multigenre response projects from a thematic social studies unit using historical fiction and nonfiction literature that was integrated in the fifth-grade curriculum. This qualitative research study took place in a third-fifth grade school in a Midwest setting with 23 fifth-grade students over the course of 14 weeks. Data were analyzed from eight of the 23 students. Multiple data sources for each literature selection were analyzed to reveal how fifth-grade students’ written, oral, and visual response to historical fiction and nonfiction literature demonstrate word consciousness and <b>individual</b> <b>application</b> of academic vocabulary. Conclusions indicate that student participants prefer the opportunity to create a visual image or write a statement to confirm the meaning of an academic vocabulary word in their vocabulary reader response journals. While orally discussing the academic words, the participants chose the evaluation approach. This authentic discussion response option allowed the students the opportunity to share their personal understanding, opinion, or inference for each word. Written and visual response was also afforded through the multigenre response projects. These projects revealed the <b>individual</b> <b>application</b> through conventional and nonconventional usage of the academic terms from each literature selection...|$|R
