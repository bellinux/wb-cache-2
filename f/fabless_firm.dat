40|$|Site {{selection}} for a <b>fabless</b> <b>firm</b> {{has been a}} concern in high technology environment and economic development for global semiconductor companies. The process of site {{selection for}} firms {{that are involved in}} research and development is influenced by many criteria. The model developed highlights the most significant criteria that {{have an impact on the}} fabless site selection. Such important criteria are defined to be as: engineering talent, market development, policy, cost, and communication. Moreover, in this study, these criteria are fed into a Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) along with their associated sub-criteria to select the most attractive site from several potential sites including San Jose, Portland, Hsinchu, Tokyo, Haifa, and Stockholm, for a fabless semiconductor company. A brief background on fabless firms worldwide with all the criteria and sub criteria is discussed. The pairwise comparison method is utilized to have the experts’ opinions from the semiconductor industry on the fabless site selection. Additionally, due to some factual and objective data existed in the literature such as those related to the engineering talent and marketing development, the researchers of this framework extracted information from various sources and normalized accordingly to be incorporated in the HDM model. The findings using pairwise comparison indicated that San Jose, Portland and Hsinchu are the most attractive locations for fabless firms...|$|E
40|$|What {{determines the}} firm {{performance}} of technology-intensive firm? Our empirical study approached such an inquiry by testing {{whether and how}} each step of value creation – resource ownership, exploration or exploitation, impacts firm performance, when controlled by other steps. Technological competence, measured by both patent scope and scale, and product diversification, measured by both product and group counts, are identified as the proxy constructs to illustrate the degrees of exploration and exploitation respectively. To control the industry and institution effects, our sample included 69 <b>Fabless</b> <b>firms</b> listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange Markets. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), our empirical findings indicated that exploration is the key performance driver among three steps of value creation, particularly for the technology-intensive firms competing in the same industry and located in the same country. From the measure perspective, patent strategy and stock did explain the performance variance among <b>Fabless</b> <b>firms</b> in Taiwan. The estimated parameters of six hypotheses also supported technological competence as the mediator of internal resources to impact firm performance; while no corporate effect and no mediation effect of product diversification...|$|R
40|$|The Microelectromechanical sensors {{are finding}} {{increasing}} applications in everyday life. However, each MEMS sensor is generally fabricated {{on its own}} individual process. This leads to high cost per sensor. It has been suggested the MEMS should and would follow the path of integrated circuits industry, wherein <b>fabless</b> <b>firms</b> could concentrate on design leading pure-foundries to perfect the manufacturing process. With several designs being manufactured on the same process, the installation cost of fabrication would be evenly shared. Simultaneously, multiple project wafer runs are being offered for MEMS processes to encourage design activity in universities as well as startups. This paper reviews {{the present state of}} this transition through an experience of designing and manufacturing microelectromechanical resonators on different processes. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{documents}} {{a structural}} {{change in the}} production of science in the U. S. semiconductor industry over almost three decades. We observe a change in scientific productivity over time, where smaller firms publish more articles per dollar in R&D. Moreover, our results show a positive relationship between the value of intangibles and scientific publications, driven by basic research results. These effects are especially strong among <b>Fabless</b> ‘design’ <b>firms</b> and among firms in the post-PC era of semiconductor manufacturing, in line with a premium for smaller firms which invest in science in times of structural technological change...|$|R
40|$|A curious {{structural}} change {{observed in the}} American semiconductor industry (the appearance of a class of "fabless" firms) is examined within a general transaction costs framework. The framework is refined for empirical application {{with the introduction of}} the construct "unstructured technical dialog. " The necessary level of this form of interpersonal communication between engineers in the design and fabrication stages of production is hypothesized to be positively related to the efficiency of a vertically integrated structure in which both stages are organized under a single hierarchy "Fablessness" (i. e., the organizational separation of the design and fabrication stages) is argued to be efficient for only those firms whose particular product portfolios have only a minimal requirement for such unstructured technical dialog. The hypothesis is tested upon a set of relatively young semiconductor firms. Support is found for the theoretically derived relationship even after controlling for rival explanations found in the literature. transaction costs, <b>Fabless</b> semiconductor <b>firms,</b> technical dialog, vertical integration...|$|R
