Current graphite shafts weigh considerably less than their steel counterparts (sometimes weighing less than 50 g for a <b>driver</b> <b>shaft),</b> allowing for lighter clubs that can be swung at greater speed. Beginning in the late 1990s, custom shafts have been integrated into the club-making process. These shafts will, within a given flex rating, address specific criteria, such as to launch the ball higher or lower or to adjust for the timing of a player's swing to load and unload the shaft at the correct moments of the swing for maximum power. Whereas in the past each club could come with only one shaft, today's club heads can be fitted with dozens of different shafts, each with slight variation in behavior, creating the potential for a much better fit for the average golfer.|$|E

The TS universal test rig consists of three different units that are connected by a main <b>driver</b> <b>shaft</b> and a pair of constantly meshing metal spur gears, which transfer power to the bevel and worm test units. The first unit is used to test the bevel gears, the second unit is used to test the spur and helical gears, and the third unit is used to test the worm gears. The loading mechanism is similarly designed to block the brake mechanism. Hobbing and milling machines were used to machine an injection-moulded polymer flanges and produce the tested gears. All gear pairs, except the worm gear, have identical gear ratios. The experiments were performed at speed 1420 [*]rpm and the torque was 4 [*]Nm.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how shaft length affects golf driving performance. A range of drivers with lengths between 1. 168 m and 1. 270 m, representing lengths close to the 1. 219 m limit imposed by R&A Rules Limited (2008), were assembled and evaluated. Clubhead and ball launch conditions and drive distance and accuracy were determined for seven category 1 golfers (handicaps 0. 21 ^ 2. 41) who performed shots on a purpose-built practice hole. As shaft length increased from 1. 168 m to 1. 270 m, initial ball velocity increased (þ 1. 8 m/s, P, 0. 01). Ball carry (þ 4. 3 m, P ¼ 0. 152) also increased, although not significantly so. Furthermore, as shaft length increased, for all club comparisons there was no decrease in accuracy. Ball launch conditions of spin components and launch angle remained unaffected by shaft length. Launch angle increased (0. 88, F ¼ 1. 074, P ¼ 0. 362) as <b>driver</b> <b>shaft</b> length increased.

50|$|The {{space between}} stator and rotor is divided in 6 {{expansion}} chambers by pivoting dividers. These dividers follow {{the motion of}} the <b>shaft</b> <b>driver</b> as it rolls around the stator wall. The cylindrical <b>shaft</b> <b>driver,</b> forced by the air pressure on its outer wall, moves eccentrically, thereby driving the motor shaft by means of two rolling elements mounted on bearings on the shaft. The rolling motion of the <b>shaft</b> <b>driver</b> inside the stator is cushioned by a thin air film. Timing and duration of the air inlet and exhaust is governed by a slotted timer which is mounted on the output shaft and rotates with the same speed as the motor.|$|R
5000|$|Shaft torque {{is also a}} concern. Flex and torque are {{generally}} related; the more a club can flex, the more it can also twist around its axis (though {{this is not always}} the case). A shaft that can torque easily is less forgiving of off-center shots as it will allow the head to twist, causing pulls and pushes. Low-torque shafts resist twisting for more forgiving behavior, but tend to be stiffer and require more power for proper distance. The latest generation of <b>driver</b> <b>shafts</b> combine a flexible shaft with a stiff tip, giving the golfer the required flex to [...] "whip" [...] into the ball while reducing clubhead twisting.|$|R

5000|$|A {{player with}} a stronger-than-average swing (>100 mph at impact) will {{typically}} want a stiff-flex shaft {{and a lower}} loft, around 9.5°, which will respond better to the faster swing tempo and will launch the ball lower so the energy is spent sending the ball outward instead of keeping it in the air. The same player might also benefit from a [...] "Tour driver", which has a 1-2° offset to [...] "open" [...] the clubface (angle {{it away from the}} player), and a higher, further-rearward centre of mass. These changes can correct certain problems with a strong swing, such as torquing in the clubhead [...] "closing" [...] it at impact causing draws, and the normally low and forward centre of gravity causing excessive backspin which can make drives [...] "balloon"; the shot will start low but curve upwards in flight, then [...] "stall" [...] and drop onto the turf, reducing total distance.

40|$|PaperPg. 149 - 152. Compressor and <b>driver</b> <b>shafts</b> often {{prove to}} be {{overstressed}} in equipment uprate situations. This paper shows how a change from conventional gear-type couplings to the more recent diaphragm coupling design can lower the shaft stresses sufficient to avoid shaft replacement during power uprates of centrifugal compressors or compressor drivers. Equipment uprate projects involving turbomachinery often appear to require time consuming and costly shaft replacements. However, closer examination of how the equipment vendor arrived at his maximum allowable stress levels may frequently show that such shaft replacements can be avoided without undue risk if the coupling selection is optimized. This conclusion {{is based on the}} fact that gear-type coupling have the potential of inducing in a shaft both torional stresses and bending stresses, whereas diaphragm couplings tend to primarily induce torisonal stresses and insignificant bending stresses at best. The economic incentives of finding ways of salvaging major rotating equipment shafts illustrated on a steam turbine shaft originally rated to transmit 17, 600 hp maximum at 6, 400 rpm. If uprating the turbine to 19, 600 hp were being considered, the required changeout of stationary steam path components would cost around $ 60, 000, but a combined replacement cost of about $ 500, 000 would probably be quoted for the main and spare rotor shafts. A rigorous calculation of shaft stresses shows the shaft factor of safety to be greater at 19, 600 hp using a diaphragm coupling than at 17, 600 hp using a conventional gear coupling...|$|R

Their advantages and limitations are analyzed; this highlights features that are different for each design for both the ldquonormalrdquo harmonics as well as the interharmonics. It is shown that, in islanded operation, the GTGs cannot provide any electrical damping to the torsional vibration which implies that strict interharmonic limits should be applied in the design.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of golf <b>driver</b> mass and <b>shaft</b> length on initial golf ball launch conditions was investigated. A series of carefully selected player tests {{were used to}} isolate the coupled {{influence of}} club mass and shaft length on initial ball velocity, spin rates, launch angle, and dispersion of impacts across the clubface. The ranges of selected club masses and shaft lengths were typical of those found in currently available drivers. While longer, lighter clubs generally led to higher ball speeds for most test golfers, those combinations of club mass and club length that minimized spin rates resulted in the greatest estimated total shot distance. Not surprisingly, use of longer drivers led to a slightly larger dispersion of impacts over the clubface. Interestingly, individual golfers tended to miss in the same region of the clubface irrespective of the club length, i. e., they compensated for changes in club mass and length when swinging. Employing the methodology outlined here, {{it may be possible}} to tailor golf club designs in order to obtain enhanced golf ball launch characteristics for a range of golfers. Such efforts may facilitate golf club design by establishing relationships between mass and configuration parameters that lead to improved driver performance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} seed {{metering unit}} {{was designed and}} mounted on a common grain drill for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as seed metering <b>shaft</b> <b>driver,</b> (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental ground wheel (SGW) and seed metering shaft and (c) a control box to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop control system, the designed control box regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of seed metering shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated seed metering unit (FSMU). The dynamic tests were conducted to compare the performance of installed FSMU on the grain drill and equipped grain drill with common seed metering unit (CSMU) at three forward speeds of 4, 6 and 8 (Km/h) for DSW. Results of the FSMU assessment demonstrated that an increase in forward speed of grain drill (FSGD) and stubble coverage did not significantly affect the seeding rate in the grain drill for DSW.

40|$|Introduction. Computer {{simulation}} models permit {{the study of}} the complex interactions between biomechanical variables, yet their application to the scientific study of the golf swing is still in an early phase of development. Aim. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to validate a computer simulation full-body model of a golfer’s swing for driving clubs. Methods. Experimental data were collected in a laboratory for an elite male golfer (25 yrs, + 1 handicap) who hit 24 shots, comprising of 8 trials using each of three <b>drivers</b> of different <b>shaft</b> length (46 ″/ 1. 17 m, 48 ″/ 1. 22 m & 50 ″/ 1. 27 m). The subject signed an informed consent and protocols followed guidelines approved by the University of Ulster research ethics committee. A 5 -camera MAC™ system operating at 240 Hz collected kinematic data which was subsequently used to drive the model utilising ADAMS software [1]. Additional skin markers were used for model validation. A large-scale musculoskeletal human model and parametric model of a driver were constructed (figure 1). Forward dynamics simulations were repeated 8 times for each of the 24 trials. Two commercially available launch monitors recorded experimental clubhead and launch conditions. Results & Discussion. There was a very high level of agreement (r= 0. 995) between the experimental kinematic data for the redundant markers and the predicted trajectory splines of the model, providing model kinematics validation. The model was capable of quantifying differences in upper torso and upper leg kinematics brought about by the different lengths of the clubs. There was also a high level of correlation (r= 0. 989) between the model predicted mean values for clubhead speed and the experimental values for each of the club lengths, both demonstrating increased clubhead velocity as club length increased. Muscle contraction force output by the model showed a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between driver simulations, demonstrating its capability to illustrate the link between gross muscle force production and club length, as evidenced by the increased force output for the longest shafted club. Conclusions & Implications. A large-scale musculoskeletal model has been developed that has the capacity to rapidly produce kinematic and kinetic results relating to variations in the golf swing when using clubs of different properties...|$|R
