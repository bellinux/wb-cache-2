25|$|The Netherlands {{emerged as}} a state during the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648), declaring their {{independence}} from the Spanish Empire in 1581. After futile attempts to find a hereditary head of state, the Dutch Republic was proclaimed in 1588. However, the war initially had neither the achievement of political independence nor {{the establishment of a}} republic as its ultimate goal, nor were the Southern Netherlands excluded from <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>purpose.</b> Rather, the inability of the Habsburg regime to adequately address religious, social and political unrest (that was originally most pressing in Flanders and Brabant), led to an irreconcilable situation. An independent Calvinist-dominated republic in the Northern Netherlands, opposed to the continuously Spanish Catholic-dominated royalist Southern Netherlands, was the unintended, improvised result. As the war progressed however, the House of Orange-Nassau played an increasingly important role, finally accumulating all stadtholderates and military leadership positions within the Dutch Republic by 1590. Struggles between the House of Orange, that gradually built up a dynasty with monarchical aspirations, and the Dutch States Party, a loose coalition of factions that favoured a republican, in most cases more or less oligarchical form of government, continued throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E

When he returns, Ivan finds the van with {{graffiti}} reading [...] "ladyboys" [...] and Paul surrounded by men. Ivan threatens the homophobic group with a cricket bat and tells them that he is Paul's boyfriend.

500|$|Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt {{pressure}} {{in making the}} episode be a worthy sequel to [...] "Blink", which he called a [...] "brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode", but also {{said that it was}} great to work with the Weeping Angels. He decided to have the interaction between the Doctor and River Song resemble that of an old married couple, bickering like [...] "mum and dad arguing over directions in the car". Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was [...] "great fun" [...] on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, there is a moment in the viewing room where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E

Sandro goes for a walk to the Piazza Municipio, where he notices an ink sketch left by one of the students. With his keychain he [...] "accidentally" [...] knocks over the ink onto the sketch.

2500|$|The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1989 is the magazine's top-selling {{issue of}} all-time.

[...] The St. Petersburg Times brought the picture to the magazine's attention. Sports Illustrated managing editor Mark Mulvoy responded, [...] "You're the first person to tell me this. Twenty million people have read that issue and no one noticed it. We did not do <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>purpose.</b> This was not an attempt to sneak the word into Sports Illustrated. I regret it." [...] The Register-Guard wrote that the magazine was accustomed to criticism for Swimsuit Issue photos being too revealing. The newspaper published an accompanying photo of the magazine cover with the caption, [...] "The SI cover was OK, but page 225 wasn't".|$|E
2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly. He was annoyed with Piquet and briefly visited the NextEV garage to know if the latter had also retired. Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, I hate that it happened with him and I hate these kinds of situations. I don't like bad feelings and I'm sure he's very upset and thinks I did <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>purpose,</b> but I was just going to defend my position." [...] Vergne represented the incident as less important six days later by saying he did not regret performing his manoeuvre and it was part of motor racing.|$|E
2500|$|Henry's former Arsenal {{manager and}} Frenchman Arsène Wenger {{said of the}} {{incident}} that [...] "This isn't the French way and football should learn from this", although he theorised that Henry did not inform the referee due to [...] "the pressure and what's at stake". Wenger later added, [...] "For the sense of justice it is quite embarrassing to see...I think even France is embarrassed...we won the game and won the qualification with a goal {{that was not a}} goal". Wenger believed Henry, {{who was one of the}} [...] "fairest [...] I've managed", was being unfairly left to face criticism by France, and that the real issue was the lack of technology being in place. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was of the opinion that [...] "every player and manager in the world" [...] thinks that [...] "technology can play a part" [...] to help referees, but recognised that it was FIFA who had to be convinced. Henry's club manager of Barcelona, Pep Guardiola said as Henry returned to training in Spain that he [...] "is not proud to have done that, but it wasn't premeditated", and gave guarded support for use of video refereeing. German Robert Huth expressed sympathy with the Irish, but on the merits of a replay, contrasted the lack of a replay after the controversial goal in the 1966 World Cup final. Danish goalkeeper Brian Jensen said [...] "He didn't do <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>purpose?</b> Blah blah blah. My 'beep'. I won't say the word cheats – but ... I said it".|$|E
