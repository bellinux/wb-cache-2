40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate more completely the variable of achievement effort (<b>effort</b> in school) <b>as</b> related to self rating, teacher rating, student self concept, actual achievement, and sex differences. A group of 198 sixth grade students were used as the experimental subjects. Five sets of data were obtained on the students: (a) students 2 ̆ 7 self ratings on an achievement effort rating scale, (b) teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of their students on the same achievement effort rating scale, (c) students 2 ̆ 7 scores on a self concept scale, (d) students 2 ̆ 7 performances on an achievement test, and (e) students 2 ̆ 7 performances on an intelligence test. Partial correlation, product-moment correlation, and chi-square were the statistical techniques used to analyze the data. The results showed that the correlations which were not significantly different than zero were: (1) achievement with self concept, and (2) achievement with achievements <b>effort</b> <b>as</b> rated by the student. The correlations which were significantly greater than zero were: (1) achievement <b>effort</b> <b>as</b> rated by the student with self concept, (2) achievement with achievement <b>effort</b> <b>as</b> rated by the teacher, and (3) achievement <b>effort</b> <b>as</b> rated by the student with achievement <b>effort</b> <b>as</b> rated by the teacher...|$|R

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>as</b> well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these <b>efforts,</b> <b>as</b> well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E

Joining the Spartans in 2002–03, he recorded 36 points (17 goals and 19 assists) over 39 games, ranking fourth in team scoring and 13th in the CCHA overall. His freshman year included two CCHA Rookie of the Week distinctions and a hat-trick, recorded on January 10, 2003, in a 5–2 win against the Alaska Nanooks. His <b>efforts</b> <b>as</b> a freshman earned him Spartans Rookie of the Year and CCHA All-Rookie Team honors.

5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing <b>efforts</b> <b>as</b> eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|Kačićs and Omiš {{citizens}} made a {{peace treaty}} with Venice in 1208, and the brothers Desislav, Radoš, Dragan, Bogdan and Sinko were mentioned by knez Sebena in the document. However, in February 1215, Kačićs were, for first time, cited for piracy. In 1220, the Hungarian-Croatian king Andrew II threatened retaliation with the royal army against knez Malduč and his relatives unless the piracy and heresy ended. In May 1221, Pope Honorius III sent legate Aconcius {{to the citizens of}} Split, among other cities, to prevent piracy and defend the Crusaders. In 1222, the pope sought help from residents of Dubrovnik against the activity of Bosnian heretics and Omiš pirates. His <b>efforts,</b> <b>as</b> well as those of Guncel, Archbishop of Split, resulted in a temporary peace treaty with Kačići Omišani (Cacecli Almesiani).|$|E

5|$|The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today {{known as}} DARPA) {{was formed in}} 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in {{reaction}} to Soviet rocketry advances.

ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these <b>efforts.</b> <b>As</b> the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem and come up with other solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser.|$|E

During the FN's 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted {{of a variety of}} European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from non-EU countries. The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe, and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) refused to join the <b>efforts,</b> <b>as</b> Jörg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan's Issuikai ("right-wing") movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{was drafted}} by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2002 NFL Draft and played in six games with the Jaguars in the 2002 NFL season before being picked up off waivers by the Minnesota Vikings on October 23, 2002, {{where he was a}} kickoff {{specialist}} {{for the remainder of the}} season. Epstein tore his anterior cruciate ligament with one week remaining in the 2002 season and had offseason surgery. Despite being reactivated during the 2003 preseason, he was released before the 2003 season. 43-year-old Gary Anderson performed the PATs and field goals for the 2002 Vikings. Anderson, had been brought out of retirement during the season to contribute to the Vikings' special teams <b>efforts</b> <b>as</b> Doug Brien faltered. Epstein replaced Brien. As a Jaguar, Epstein made 5 out of 9 field goals (with a long of 34 yards) and 13 PATs. He was 0–4 on field goals of 39 yards or longer. Of his 72 career kickoffs, 10 of them were touchbacks and his average distance was 61.7 yards. After Epstein was released, the Jaguars continued to have troubles as his successor Tim Seder was cut five games later. 8 of Epstein's 28 career points came in a 28–25 October 6, 2002 Jacksonville victory over Philadelphia. He was 2-for-2 on both field goals and PATs.|$|E
5|$|Japan's air {{defenses}} {{were unable to}} stop the Allied air attacks. Owing to the short range of the country's land-based radar, and Allied attacks on IJN picket ships, the defenders typically had only about an hour to respond to incoming B-29s once they had been detected. Japanese signals intelligence units could provide longer warning times of incoming raids by eavesdropping on the bombers' radio communications, but were unable to predict {{the target of the}} attack. As a result, fighter units did not have enough time to scramble and reach the bombers' cruising altitude before they arrived over their target, and most raids were intercepted by only small numbers of aircraft. Moreover, the American bombers were capable of flying faster at high altitude than many Japanese fighters. Even when the fighters managed to close within gun range, the well-built B-29s were often able to sustain large amounts of damage. Due to the difficulty of intercepting and downing B-29s, the Japanese fighter pilots increasingly perceived their <b>efforts</b> <b>as</b> being futile. From August 1944 Japanese aircraft occasionally conducted suicide ramming attacks on B-29s, and several specialized kamikaze fighter units were established in October; {{by the end of the}} war, ramming tactics had destroyed nine B-29s and damaged another 13 for the loss of 21 fighters.|$|E
