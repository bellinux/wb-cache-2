25|$|To {{understand}} why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, {{one needs to}} understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on {{the tips of the}} decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called recoil leaders, usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of electromagnetic waveform records and video {{images of a}} multistroke cloud-to-ground (CG) strike to the NASA F- 106 B instrumented airplane is presented. The CG flash started as a lightning strike triggered by the airplane and later produced multiple return strokes to the ground (the ground strike network registered six return strokes). Although there are some uncertainties in data interpretation resulting from lack of independent measurements with other than the airborne instruments, recoil streamers and eight sequences of <b>dart</b> <b>leaders</b> followed by return strokes (two more than were indicated by the ground network) were identified in the airborne data. At least three of the subsequent return strokes were attached to the airplane.

40|$|Three {{triggered}} lightning flashes, initiated {{during the}} Thunderstorm Research International Program (1981) at Langmuir Laboratory, New Mexico, are examined {{on the basis}} of three-dimensional return stroke propagation speeds and peak currents. Nonlinear relationships result between return stroke propagation speed and stroke peak current for 56 strokes, and between return stroke propagation speed and <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> propagation speed for 32 strokes. Calculated linear correlation coefficients include <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> propagation speed and ensuing return stroke peak current (32 strokes; r = 0. 84); and stroke peak current and interstroke interval (69 strokes; r = 0. 57). Earlier natural lightning data do not concur with the weak positive correlation between <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> propagation speed and interstroke interval. Therefore, application of triggered lightning results to natural lightning phenomena must be made with certain caveats.

40|$|Time-resolved {{photographic}} {{records of}} three strokes of a triggered lightning flash are examined. These strokes exhibit several examples of novel behavior that include (1) the abrupt transformation of dart leaders to stepped leaders and (2) the partial 'reflection' of <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> luminosity {{back up the}} channel. Both phenomena are associated with an apparent discontinuity in channel characteristics between the natural and artificial (wire) sections of the channel. We estimate the ratio of characteristic impedances for these sections to have an upper bound of about a factor of 3. Analysis {{of one of the}} <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> 'reflections' yields a propagation speed of 9. 6 x 10 to the 7 th m/s whereas the <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> and return stroke speeds (two-dimensional) over the same channel section are 1. 7 x 10 to the 7 th and 13 x 10 to the seventh m/s, respectively.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis aims at investigating the attachment of lightning flashes to wind turbines. Modern wind turbines are highly exposed to lightning strikes, due to the increase of their height and {{the rotation of the}} blades. Upward lightning is the dominant mechanism of lightning strikes to them. Therefore, this study evaluates the initiation of the initial upward leader discharge and the process of lightning attachment of <b>dart</b> <b>leaders</b> taking place prior to the first return stroke in upward flashes. This work extends the self-consistent leader inception and propagation model (SLIM) to evaluate the lightning attachment of <b>dart</b> and dart-stepped <b>leaders</b> to grounded objects. SLIM was originally proposed to evaluate the lightning attachment of stepped leaders. Unlike the well-studied lightning attachment of stepped leaders, upward connecting leaders initiated in response to <b>dart</b> and dart-stepped <b>leaders</b> develop under a significantly faster change of the ambient electric field. Additionally, these connecting leaders could develop in warm air pre-conditioned by the previous strokes in the same flash. An analytical expression to evaluate the charge required to thermalize the connecting leader per unit length is also developed in the extended model. This model is validated through the analysis of three attachment events recorded in rocket-triggered lightning experiments. Good agreement between the predicted properties of the upward leaders and the measurements has been found. The model is utilized to evaluate the different conditions where connecting leaders can develop prior to the return strokes in upward lightning. The extended model of SLIM is also applied to study the interception of lightning <b>dart</b> <b>leaders</b> by upward connecting leaders initiated from wind turbines. The evaluation considers the influence of the return stroke peak current, the blade rotation and wind on the attachment of lightning <b>dart</b> <b>leaders</b> to wind turbines. The probability of lightning strikes to the receptors along the blade and on the nacelle is calculated for upward lightning flashes. It is shown that the lightning attachment of <b>dart</b> <b>leaders</b> is a mechanism that can explain the lightning damages to the inboard region of the blades (more than 10 meters from the tip) and the nacelle of wind turbines. Furthermore, the critical stabilization electric field required to initiate upward lightning from wind turbines is evaluated for both ‘self-initiated’ and ‘other-triggered’ upward flashes. The calculation shows that the stabilization electric field of an operating wind turbine periodically changes due to the rotation of its blades.  The initiation of upward lightning is greatly facilitated by the electric field change produced by nearby lightning events. However, the rate of rise of the electric field only has a weak impact on the stabilization electric field. The evaluation of the stabilization electric field provides essential information needed for the estimation of the incidence of upward lightning to wind turbines. QC 20161201 </p...|$|R

40|$|Krehbiel et al., 1979 [1] have {{reported}} that subsequent strokes followed by long continuing currents are usually preceded by long dart-leader processes. Furthermore, observations made by Shindo and Uman, 1989 [2] noticed that the electric field peak of return strokes that develop long continuing currents are, on average, 31 % lower than the cases that develop short continuing currents. Saba et al., 2006 [3] made a similar analysis using high-speed video and LLS (lightning locating system) data and observed a decrease of 50 % in the estimated peak current of return strokes followed by long continuing current. In this work we analyze {{the relation between the}} average speeds of the <b>dart</b> <b>leaders</b> that precede subsequent return strokes with long continuing currents (longer than 40 ms). For that we have used GPS-time stamped high-speed video recordings obtained at frame rates ranging from 4000 to 8000 frames per second. LLS data combined with the GPS-synchronization of the camera allowed us to estimate the distance of the ground contact point of each dart-leader and continuing current studied. Average and partial speeds of each dart-leader observation were obtained using the same technique discussed in detail by Saba et al., 2008 [4] and Campos et al., 2009 [5]. <b>Dart</b> <b>leaders</b> that preceded long continuing currents tend to develop speeds lower than the average. Considering that the speed of a leader is related to the amount of charge present in it, the lower speeds observed in this study may help to explain both the lower charge and the lower peak current usually observed in the return strokes preceding long continuing currents [1 - 3].

40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} interpretation in {{the lightning}} literature, based on field measurements, defines recoil leaders as negative leaders.

Such verification, reported in this paper, has been obtained from observations of branched upward positive leaders from a tall tower using a high-speed video system synchronized with electric and magnetic field change and luminosity measurements on the ground. The analysis of these observations clearly reveals the nature of recoil and <b>dart</b> <b>leaders</b> as bidirectional and bipolar electrodeless discharges that develop from a small region along a path of the decayed channels of a previous positive leader, or a positively charged return stroke of negative CG flashes...|$|R

Radiation during the initial breakdown of a flash and {{in the early stages of}} initial leaders to ground is found to be similar. In both instances, the activity consists of localized bursts of radiation that are intense and slow moving. Motion within a given burst is unresolved by the interferometer. Radiation from in-cloud K type events is essentially the same as that from dart leaders; in both cases it is produced at the leading edge of a fast moving streamer that propagates along a well defined, often extensive path.

40|$|A {{device to}} measure the {{propagation}} speeds of cloud-to-ground lightning has been developed. The lightning propagation speed (LPS) device consists of eight solid state silicon photodetectors mounted behind precision horizontal slits in the focal plane of a 50 -mm lens on a 35 -mm camera.

In some cases, unobscured segments of lightning channels 1 km or longer are visible in clear air around and above the cloud. Multiple images of lightning channels indicate multiple discharges in the same channel. Photographs taken through a diffraction grating show that the lightning has a spectrum similar to that observed in the lower troposphere. Lightning spectra obtained with a slitless line-scan spectrometer show strong singly ionized nitrogen emissions at 463. 0 and 500. 5 nm.

Optical signals corresponding to <b>dart</b> <b>leader,</b> return stroke, and continuing current events are readily distinguished in the scattered light emerging from the cloud surface. The variation of light intensity with time in lightning events is consistent with predicted modification of optical lightning signals by clouds. It appears that satellite based optical sensor measurements cannot provide reliable information on current rise times in return strokes.

The X-ray emission for all three events has a radial fall off proportional to [exp (r/ 120) ]/r and is most consistent with the energetic source electrons being emitted isotropically from the leader.

Most, lightning activity seems {{to be associated with}} clouds with strong convective cauliflower tops. In both of the storms lightning channels were visible in the clear air above the cloud. It is shown that substances produced by thunderstorm electrical discharges can be introduced directly into the stratosphere. The cause and nature of the discharges above the cloud are not clear. They may be produced by accumulations of space charge in the clear air above the cloud. The discharges may arise solely because of the intense electric fields produced by charges within the cloud. In the latter case the ions introduced by these discharges will increase the electrical conductivity of the air above the cloud and increase the conduction current that flows from the cloud to the electrosphere. More quantitative data at higher resolution may show significant spectral differences between cloud to ground and intracloud strokes.

It is suggested that the chaotic pulse trains are created by a superposition of several regular pulse trains. Since regular pulse trains are probably created by <b>dart</b> or dart-stepped <b>leaders</b> or K-changes inside the cloud, chaotic pulse trains are caused by the superposition of electric fields caused by more than one of these leaders or K-changes propagating simultaneously.

In triggered lighting x-rays were found to be originated from a tip of a <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> that also possesses stepping propagation mechanism. Therefore, stepping mechanism is the key to understanding the x-ray pulses generated by lightning. Unfortunately, leader stepping mechanism itself is far from well understood. Negative long laboratory discharges also develop through a formation of a space stem/leader and they also generate bursts of x-ray radiation. In this study we investigate the development of a long negative laboratory spark in particular focusing on its x-ray emission. A 2 MV Marx generator delivers high-voltage standard lightning pulse with 1. 2 / 50 microsec rise/fall time to a spark gap with conical electrodes. The distance between cone tips was varied between 1 m and 1. 75 m. An upper voltage limit is set to about 1 MV level. The voltage is measured by capacitive high-voltage divider. Two Pearson 7427 current probes determine the currents through high-voltage and grounded electrodes. Two LaBr 3 scintillator detectors were mounted in EMC-cabinets and recorded the x-rays. Picos 4 Stanford Optics camera with intensified CCD is placed in 4 m distance from the spark gap and directed perpendicular to the spark plane. The camera allows us to make ns-fast images of pre-breakdown phenomena in controllable time. We discovered new details of space stem/leader formation and development in long laboratory sparks. The connection moment of positive part of the space stem/leader to negative high-voltage is accompanied by intense x-ray emission.

40|$|Abstract. Preliminary {{observations}} of simultaneous VHF and optical emissions from lightning {{as seen by}} the Fast on-Orbit Recording of Transient Events (FORTE) spacecraft are presented. VHF/optical waveform pairs are routinely collected both as individual lightning events and as sequences of events associated with cloud-to-ground (CG) and intracloud (IC) flashes. CG pulses can be distinguished from IC pulses {{on the basis of}} the properties of the VHF and optical waveforms but mostly {{on the basis of the}} associated VHF spectrograms. The VHF spectrograms are very similar to previous ground-based HF and VHF {{observations of}} lightning and show signatures associated with return strokes, stepped and dart leaders, attachment processes, and intracloud activity. For a typical IC flash, the FORTE-detected VHF is generally characterized by impulsive broadband bursts of emission, and the associated optical emissions are often highly structured. For a typical initial return stroke, the FORTE-detected VHF is generated by the stepped leader, the attachment process, and the actual return stroke. For a typical subsequent return stroke, the FORTE-detected VHF is mainly generated by <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> processes. The detected optical signal in both return stroke cases is primarily produced by the in-cloud portion of the discharge and lags the arrival of the corresponding VHF emissions at the satellite by a mean value of 243 ms. This delay is composed of a transit time delay (mean of 105 ms) as the return stroke current propagates from the attachment point up into the region of in-cloud activity plus an additional delay due to the scattering of light during its traversal through the clouds. The broadening of the light pulse during its propagation through the clouds is measured and used to infer a mean of this scattering delay of about 138 ms (41 km additional path length) for CG light. This value for the mean scattering delay is consistent with the Thomason and Krider [1982] model for light propagation through clouds. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Schonland et al. (1938), {{in their}} seminal streak camera studies of lightning, have {{identified}} a peculiar type of negative stepped leader that they termed &# 946;, a rather rare variant of the type &# 946; leader and in it the second and slower stage of the leader {{is associated with the}} appearance of one or more fast dart streamers, which travel rapidly down from the cloud along the previously formed track and cease when they have caught up with the slower leader-tip. They reported four events, two were accompanied by a dart streamer (a nomenclature we will keep for historical reasons), one event contained two examples, and one event that was not described in detail. During a July-August 2007 campaign in Tucson, Arizona, USA, we recorded four downward leaders that fit in the type-&# 946; 22 description given by Schonland et al. (1938). All cases occurred between about 12 and 32 km from a high-speed camera that was operating at 4000 frames per second. Two cases were produced by the first stroke in a flash, and one case was associated with a subsequent stroke that produced a new ground termination. Our fourth case was a subsequent stroke that began with a <b>dart</b> <b>leader</b> and then changed to a type-&# 61538; stepped leader approximately 1350 m above the ground; in this case, we observed a dart streamer (with the leader tip at about 720 m from the ground) about 3. 25 ms after the stepped progression began and the return stroke occurred 2 ms later. All the dart streamers that we observed had speeds between 10 6 and 10 7 m s - 1 - 2, in agreement with previous observations of recoil leaders (Saba et al., 2008); therefore, we suggest that the type-&# 61538; negative leaders are the visible manifestation of the development of recoil leaders that were initiated inside the cloud and propagate below the cloud-base, during the development of a bipolar, bidirectional leader that precedes a lightning flash to ground. The recoil leaders develop in previously ionized channels that are produced by the in-cloud 2 positive portion of a bidirectional leader, and when they reach the tip of the negative downward portion, they produce an intense pulse of luminosity that optically appears as a dart streamer...|$|E
50|$|Charles St. George {{designed}} the production tooling, and the factory at Smithfield began to initially turn out 200 units per month, which increased to 400 per month some months later. St. George developed a selective-fire version called the T2 (including a carbine {{version of the}} T1 Leader) which attracted {{the interest of the}} Royal Australian Armoured Corps, as well as foreign arms companies, including Luigi Franchi (a subsidiary of Beretta) in Italy, Fábrica Militar de Braço de Prata in Portugal, and foreign militaries, such as the Sultanate of Oman Armed Forces. ATA Target Systems of Albury NSW hosted the visitors, and Charles St. George together with Terry Dinnen demonstrated the Leader weapons on ATA's <b>Dart</b> System. The <b>Leader</b> demonstration resulted in Oman placing trial weapon orders for 12 Leader select-fire rifles (SAR) and 12 Leader assault carbines (SAC).|$|R
50|$|Ever since, {{the soul}} of the God of Destruction has wandered the Earth and, every one hundred and eight years, {{possesses}} the body of a human child in an attempt to return to its body. The body can be summoned if the Signets are destroyed, which can be done using the immense magical power contained within the artifacts that Lloyd gathered, called the Divine Moon Objects. At this time, the human that is {{the soul of}} the God of Destruction is Shana. Emperor Diaz then reveals himself to be Zieg Feld, <b>Dart's</b> father and <b>leader</b> of the Dragoons that fought alongside Rose in the Dragon Campaign. After Zieg defeated Melbu Frahma, Melbu cast a spell that both petrified him and kept Melbu's spirit alive within Zieg's body. Finally, it is revealed that Rose is the Black Monster that destroyed Dart’s village, in an attempt to kill the person carrying {{the soul of the}} God of Destruction.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a wavelet transformation of chaotic pulse trains (CPTs) prior to negative subsequent return strokes in Malaysia. A total of 593 recorded waveforms were examined. Even though several hundred waveforms {{were identified as}} containing CPTs, only 47 waveforms with CPTs preceding subsequent return stroke were selected for analysis. 19 samples are classified as CPTs associated with <b>dart</b> or dart-stepped <b>leader</b> (Type 1 CPTs) with spectral and spread regions average frequency range of 34. 8 - 154. 3 kHz and 56. 2 - 81. 4 kHz respectively. 28 samples are classified as chaotic pulse trains alone (Type 2 CPTs) with spectral and spread regions average frequency range of 24. 6 - 121 kHz and 40. 3 - 62 kHz, respectively. The Type 1 CPTs tends to radiate at a higher frequency range compared to Type 2 CPTs. The maximum power radiated by the largest pulse in Type 1 CPTs is more than six times larger than that for the Type 2 CPTs. In addition, the Type 1 CPTs have larger electric field variations, higher frequency, and higher power radiated spectrum compared to Type 2 CPTs. The reported radiated energy can be further compared with other lightning activities to give a better insight on the in-cloud breakdown processes prior to subsequent return strokes...|$|R
