Of those vessels, 20 were apprehended. The largest apprehension of salmon occurred in 1997 during a joint Japanese-American enforcement operation where one hundred and twenty tons of salmon were confiscated from the vessel Nanao 55008.|$|E

50|$|Banning Mediterranean Driftnetting: In February 2008, the European Court of Justice {{rejected}} {{any further}} requests by the French government for exemptions from the EU ban on <b>driftnetting</b> in the Mediterranean Sea. This ruling will spare 25,000 juvenile bluefin tuna annually, along with 10,000 non-targeted marine species caught {{annually in the}} <b>driftnets.</b>|$|R
25|$|While gillweed nets are a {{principal}} concern, {{other types of}} nets also pose a problem: trawl nets, purse seines, beach seines, longline gear, and <b>driftnets.</b> <b>Driftnets</b> are known for high rates of bycatch and they affect all cetaceans and other marine species. They are fatal for small toothed whales (Odontocetes) and sperm whales, {{as well as other}} marine mammals and fish such as sharks, sea birds and sea turtles. Many fisheries routinely use <b>driftnets</b> exceeding the EU size limit of 2.5km/boat. This illegal drift-netting is a major issue, especially in important feeding and breeding grounds for cetaceans.|$|R
25|$|In the Philippines, tuna <b>driftnet</b> {{fisheries}} have {{a substantial}} impact on the populations. One tuna fishery alone kills 400 Spinner Dolphin (Stenella longirostris) and Fraser's dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei) each year. Round-haul nets are an even greater concern with a bycatch of up to 3000 dolphins per year. Dolphins that are bycaught often end up as shark bait for longline fisheries. There is not enough data to conclude total bycatch for the Philippines. Initial assessment indicates that bycatch is not sustainable. Monitoring of dolphin populations and fisheries is urgently needed.|$|E
500|$|With {{thousands}} of lakes, over [...] of fish bearing rivers and over [...] of coastline, Ireland {{is a popular}} angling destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with {{the closing of the}} salmon <b>driftnet</b> fishery. Coarse fishing continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted, and the range of sea angling species is around 80.|$|E
50|$|High Seas <b>Driftnet</b> Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992 is United States {{declaration}} citing an {{observance of}} the United Nationsinternational <b>driftnet</b> fishery conservation program to restrict large scale <b>driftnet</b> fishing in high seas or international waters.

In accordance with Title 16 section 1857, the United States federal law 102-582 proclaims the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act prohibits {{the application of}} large scale <b>driftnet</b> fishing within an exclusive economic zone of any sovereign state and the United States.|$|E

50|$|Operation <b>DRIFTNET</b> is an {{important}} component of Canada's contribution to the NPAFC. More than four million square kilometres of the North Pacific Ocean are monitored every year, with patrols taking place throughout spring, summer and fall. When illegal activity by a vessel is confirmed by a patrol, the ship's flag is identified and the vessel's nation is responsible for prosecuting the violator. Operation <b>DRIFTNET</b> patrols also deter potential illegal fishing activity, due to their presence.|$|E

50|$|In 1991, Sea Shepherd {{learned that}} driftnetters were {{destroying}} the seabird and fish populations {{off of the}} coasts of Trinidad and Tobago. They travelled there and patrolled the area {{near the mouth of}} the Amazon. They encountered a <b>driftnetting</b> ship and threw stink bombs on its deck. The ship rammed the Sea Shepherd II, and they rammed the driftnetter back, leading to a confrontation that severely damaged both ships. Back in Trinidad, Sea Shepherd revealed that corrupt officials were taking bribes to {{turn a blind eye to}} <b>driftnetting</b> in the area, and the corrupt officials were removed from office. Sea Shepherd later donated four assault rifles to help the Coast Guard chase driftnetters.|$|R
