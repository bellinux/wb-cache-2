40|$|Abstract - Passive {{stabilization}} can drastically {{simplify the}} design of attitude control systems of Earth-oriented satellites with moderate pointing requirements. Long tethers are attractive for passive attitude stabilization because, {{at the expense of}} a small mass increment, they provide strong restoring torques about the roll and pitch axes of the satellite. Consequently, reaction wheels and thrusters for pitch and roll control can be eliminated, thereby saving propellant mass in direct proportion to the mission duration. The attainable pointing accuracies, the masses and inertia ratios required for passive attitude stabilization are analyzed and discussed in this paper.

50|$|A {{geostationary}} orbit, <b>geostationary</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> or geosynchronous {{equatorial orbit}} (GEO) is a circular orbit 35786 km above the Earth's equator {{and following the}} direction of the Earth's rotation. An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day) and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. Communications satellites and weather satellites are often placed in geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas (located on Earth) that communicate with them do not have to rotate to track them, but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Using this characteristic, ocean color satellites with visible and near-infrared light sensors (e.g. the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)) can also be operated in geostationary orbit in order to monitor sensitive changes of ocean environments.|$|E
50|$|Beam park is a radar mode {{used for}} space surveillance, {{particularly}} tracking space debris. In beam-park mode, a radar beam {{is kept in}} a fixed direction {{with respect to the}} Earth, while objects passing through the beam are tracked. In 24 hours, {{as a result of the}} Earth’s rotation, the radar effectively scans a narrow strip through 360° of the celestial sphere. The scattered waves are detected by a receiver and the measurements obtained during the observations can be used to determine object radar cross-section, time of peak occurrence, polarization ratio, doppler shift and object rotation. The obtained information for each object is then processed and matched against data from previously catalogued objects.The beam-park mode can be used to detect both previously known and uncatalogued objects at any altitude, provided that the reflected power captured by the receiver can be distinguished from the noise. This limits the use of radar-based beam park observations to objects in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). Optical instruments, in turn, have very good performance for objects in <b>Geostationary</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit</b> (GEO) and in Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). The radar technique typically outperforms optical facilities in LEO and can conduct observations for longer periods, both during day and night, independently of the weather and object illumination by sunlight.|$|E

The comparisons show that the root mean square (RMS) of clock errors of <b>geostationary</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (GEO) is about 0. 63 ns, whereas those of inclined geosynchronous orbits (IGSO) and medium <b>Earth</b> <b>orbits</b> (MEO) are about 0. 2 – 0. 3 ns and 0. 1 ns, respectively. Then, the 1 Hz clock products are used for BDS precise point positioning (PPP) to retrieve seismic displacements of the 2015 Mw 7. 8 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake. The derived seismic displacements from BDS PPP are consistent with those from the Global Positioning System (GPS) PPP, with RMS of 0. 29, 0. 38, and 1. 08 cm in east, north, and vertical components, respectively. In addition, the BDS PPP solutions with different clock intervals of 1 s, 5 s, 30 s, and 300 s are processed and compared with each other. The results demonstrate that PPP with 300 s clock intervals is the worst and that with 1 s clock interval is the best. For the scenario of 5 s clock intervals, the precision of PPP solutions is almost the same to 1 s results.

By design, via other components of the satellite, other stray light from sun or Earth is kept to a minimum. Minimizing the stray light is very important with respect to the class of this instrument, involving the requirement for level 1B and 2 data product accuracies where the sensitivity to stray light is very high.

At {{the speed of light}} (about 300,000 km/s or 186,000 miles per second), it takes a quarter of a second for a radio signal to travel from the Earth to the satellite and back. When other switching and routing delays are added and the delays are doubled to allow for a full round-trip transmission, the total delay can be 0.75 to 1.25 seconds. This latency is large when compared to other forms of Internet access with typical latencies that range from 0.015 to 0.2 seconds. Long latencies negatively affect some applications that require real-time response, particularly online games, voice over IP, and remote control devices. TCP tuning and TCP acceleration techniques can mitigate some of these problems. GEO satellites do not cover the Earth's polar regions. HughesNet, Exede, AT&T and Dish Network have GEO systems.
