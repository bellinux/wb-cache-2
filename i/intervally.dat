Closed <b>intervally</b> thin sets behave like sets with measure zero (for example such a set cannot “disconnect” an open {{connected}} set). Let us also mention {{that if the}} (N− 1) -dimensional Hausdorff measure of A is zero, then A is <b>intervally</b> thin. A function f is preconvex if it is convex on every convex subset of its domain. The consequence of our main theorem is the following: Let U be an open subset of RN and let A be a closed <b>intervally</b> thin subset of U. Then every preconvex function f:U∖A→R can be uniquely extended (with preservation of preconvexity) onto U. In fact we show that a more general version of this result holds for semiconvex functions...|$|E

Kochia can grow under saline conditions and used as fodder in dry and saline areas. Therefore, three experiments was conducted in complete randomize design with four replication, to study effects of different levels of salinity (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 dS m- 1) at different growth stages (planting and early seedling) and salinity appllication <b>intervally.</b> Results of applying saline water {{at the beginning of}} growth showed that kochia seedling was able to survive up to 30 dS m- 1 sodium chloride. The results showed that increasing salinity at planting and early seedling satge reduced plant height, branches number, shoot fresh and dry weight, and increased digestible dry matter, digestive value, and crude protein yield. On the other hand with increasing salinity digestibility of dry matter, organic matter digestibility, crude protein and ash percentage were increased. Total phenol was not significantly affected by salinity in all treatments. Application of salinity intermittently at early seedling except of digestive value and ash percentage had no significant affect on other treats. Generally, results showed that the kochia seedlings are sensitive to salinity higher than 30 dS m- 1 and also kochia be able to keep biomass production with salinity appllication <b>intervally...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} article we provide a {{sufficient}} condition for a closed set F in R^d to have the following property which we call c-removability: Whenever a function f:R^d->R is locally convex on the complement of F, it is convex on the whole R^d. We also prove that no generalized rectangle of positive Lebesgue measure in R^ 2 is c-removable. Our results also answer the following question asked in an article by Jacek Tabor and Jozef Tabor [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 365 (2010) ]: Assume the closed set F in R^d is such that any locally convex function defined on R^d has a unique convex extension on R^d.

40|$|An {{input-output}} {{approach to}} the stability and stabilization of uncertain Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with time-varying delay is proposed in this paper. The time-varying parameter uncertainties {{are assumed to be}} norm-bounded, and the delay is <b>intervally</b> time varying. A novel method is employed to approximate the time-varying delay, based on which the considered system is transformed into a feedback interconnection form. The new formulation of the system is comprised of a forward subsystem with constant time delay and a feedback subsystem embedding the uncertainties. By applying the scaled small-gain theorem to the converted system, less conservative stability and stabilization criteria are obtained. Moreover, the applicability of the proposed {{approach to the}} robust case is simpler since both delay and parameter uncertainties are processed in a unified framework. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the advantage of the proposed techniques. Â© 1993 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Hom-computable coalgebras, a {{composition}} factors matrix and the Euler bilinear {{form of an}} Euler coalgebra. (English summary) J. Algebra 315 (2007), no. 1, 42 – 75. Let K be a field, C a K-coalgebra and C-Comod the category of left C-comodules. Let {Ei}i∈IC and {Si}i∈IC be {{a complete set of}} pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable injective left C-comodules and simple left C-comodules, respectively. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} study the category C-Comod by means of some numerical invariants defined by the author. In order to make use of these tools, certain finiteness conditions on C are needed. These are imposed by defining the notions of Hom-computable coalgebra and Euler coalgebra. The K-coalgebra C is left Homcomputable if any indecomposable injective left C-comodule Ei is computable, i. e., if, for simple left C-comodule Sj, the sum lj(Ei) = lj(E m i) m= 0 is finite, where lj(E m i) is the number of times that Sj appears in a semisimple decomposition of Em i = socmEi/socm− 1 Ei (for a path coalgebra KQ, this means that Q is <b>intervally</b> finite). Then the length composition vector may be extended from the class of finite-dimensional comodules to the class of Hom-computable comodules. Also the author defines the left composition length matrix of C, CF = (lj(Ei)) i,j∈IC, and the left Cartan matri...|$|E
40|$|Lattice {{disorder}} due to atomic vacancies has detrimental {{impact on}} the transport properties of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs; MX 2). We theoretically study the effect of Mo and S vacancies on carrier scattering and transport in p- and n-type monolayer MoS 2 based on an atomistic first-principles description of atomic disorder. Due {{to the presence of}} vacancy midgap states, the vacancies are shown to act as combined short-range and Coulomb disorder scattering centers. For the short-range scattering potential typical for atomic point defects, we surprisingly find that the threefold rotational symmetry of the vacancy sites, in most cases, leads to a strong protection against <b>intervally</b> scattering. In addition, we find that Mo and S vacancies resemble, respectively, strong and weak short-range disorder. The dual character of the vacancies results in a nontrivial interplay between short-range and Coulomb disorder scattering and a pronounced screening-induced temperature and density dependence of the low-temperature carrier mobility. Our work identifies atomic vacancies as the likely source of both short-range and Coulomb disorder in monolayer TMDs, and presents a unified microscopic framework where these scattering mechanisms can be treated consistently. Comment: This manuscript has been temporarily withdrawn for practical reasons as (i) it is being converted into two separate publications, and (ii) the calculations of the defect scattering amplitude are being upgraded from the Born approximation to a proper T-matrix treatment. A revisited version of the original manuscript will appear shortly under a slightly modified titl...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground {{and purpose}} : Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate interacelullar {{parasite}} that infect {{a wide variety}} of nucleated cells in its intermediate hosts. Tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii in able to multiply in mouse macrophages. Inducing synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages is an important mechanism of the host defense against interacelullar infection in mice. The 1. 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 is a potent modulator of immune system and may be beneficial in the treatment of some diseases. Recent evidence suggests that, 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 may increase production of nitric oxide. Otherwise 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 acts to suppress the Th 1 immune response that effect on antigen presenting cell and increases production of Th 2 cell. The aim of present study is to determine effective concentration of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 for stimulation of nitric oxide production. The effect of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 on multiplication of Toxoplasma gondii in macrophage of Balb/c mice in vivo and in vitro were also studied. Materials and methods : Mice were injected with different doses of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 and/or Toxoplasma gondii interpretoneally. Then infected macrophages were cultured in RPMI- 1640. Culture supernatants were collected for nitric oxide assay following 18 hours, then every 24 hours <b>intervally.</b> Nitric oxide was measured by Griess method. Infection levels were assessed microscopically by counting the numbers of tachyzoites in macrophages. Results : This results indicated that there is a {{decrease in the number of}} T. gondii in macrophages following treatment with 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 dose dependent (P< 0. 05). In addition, injection of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 plus INFγ in medium culture inhibited the multiplication of T. gondii. High level of production of nitric oxide may relate to dose of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 plus INFγ. Conclusion: In the dose of 1000 microgram of vitamin D 3 the highest killing effect of macrophages were demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Diamond is a {{promising}} material for high-power, high-frequency and high- temperature electronics applications, where its outstanding physical properties can be fully exploited. It exhibits an extremely high bandgap, very high carrier mobilities, high breakdown field strength, {{and the highest}} thermal conductivity of any wide bandgap material. It is therefore an outstanding candidate for the fastest switching, the highest power density, and the most efficient electronic devices obtainable, with applications in the RF power, automotive and aerospace industries. Lightweight diamond devices, capable of high temperature operation in harsh environments, could also be used in radiation detectors and particle physics applications where no other semiconductor devices would survive. The high defect and impurity concentration in natural diamond or high-pressure-high-temperature (HPHT) diamond substrates has made it difficult to obtain reliable results when studying the electronic properties of diamond. However, progress in the growth of high purity Single Crystal Chemical Vapor Deposited (SC-CVD) diamond has opened the perspective of applications under such extreme conditions based on this type of synthetic diamond. Despite the improvements, there are still many open questions. This work will focus on the electrical characterization of SC-CVD diamond by different measurement techniques such as internal photo-emission, I-V, C-V, Hall measurements and in particular, Time-of-Flight (ToF) carrier drift velocity measurements. With these mentioned techniques, some important properties of diamond such as drift mobilities, lateral carrier transit velocities, compensation ratio and Schottky barrier heights have been investigated. Low compensation ratios (ND/NA) < 10 - 4 have been achieved in boron-doped diamond and a drift mobility of about 860 cm 2 /Vs for the hole transit near the surface in a lateral ToF configuration could be measured. The carrier drift velocity was studied for electrons and holes at the temperature interval of 80 - 460 K. The study is performed in the low-injection regime and includes low-field drift mobilities. The hole mobility was further investigated at low temperatures (10 - 80 K) and as expected a very high mobility was observed. In the case of electrons, a negative differential mobility was seen in the temperature interval of 100 - 150 K. An explanation for this phenomenon is given by the <b>intervally</b> scattering and the relation between hot and cold conduction band valleys. This was observed in direct bandgap semiconductors with non-equivalent valleys such as GaAs but has not been seen in diamond before. Furthermore, first steps have been taken to utilize diamond for infrared (IR) radiation detection. To understand the fundamentals of the thermal response of diamond, Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCR) measurements were performed on diamond Schottky diodes which are a candidate for high temperature sensors. As a result, very high TCR values in combination with a low noise constant (K 1 /f) was observed...|$|E
