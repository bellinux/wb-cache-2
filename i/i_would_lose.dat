Pohren said that de Lucía's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea {{must have been an}} [...] "exciting and stimulating" [...] experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him [...] "so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity." [...] This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, [...] "I have never lost the roots in my music, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> myself. What I have tried to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among other songs is {{the ballad}} [...] "Speechless", {{which is a}} 1970s rock-inspired number that talks about abusive relationships: [...] "I can't believe how you slurred at me with your half-wired broken jaw". It {{consists}} of vocal harmonies and guitar riffs, which according to PopMatters, {{is comparable to the}} work of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Gaga's inspiration behind the track was her father's heart condition, and her fear about his death. Gaga recalled that her [...] "dad used to call after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was speechless and I just feared that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> him and I wouldn't be there. I wrote this song as a plea to him." [...] Produced by Ron Fair, [...] "Speechless" [...] was recorded with all live instruments such as drums, guitars, bass and piano played by Gaga. The album's fifth track, [...] "Dance in the Dark", talks about a girl being uncomfortable having sex with the lights on, so she would prefer to perform it in the [...] "dark". Gaga has [...] "resolute" [...] vocals in the song, and the synths ultimately lead to the chorus where she belts, [...] "Baby loves to Dance in the Dark, 'Cause when he's looking she falls apart".|$|E
2500|$|Zina {{recorded}} in her autobiography {{that when she}} was eighteen she was courted by Henry Bailey Jacobs. During this time, Joseph Smith, also taught her about plural marriage in private conversations; he proposed that she become his spiritual wife on at least three different occasions. Zina declined the proposals out of her respect for Emma Smith and for traditional Christian monogamy, and because such a union would require secrecy. On March 7, 1841, she married Jacobs, believing she had thus avoided future proposals from Smith. Nauvoo mayor John C. Bennett conducted the ceremony. Her journal from the day of the wedding reads: I was Married to Mr. Henry Bailey Jacobs. He had been a missionary preaching the Gospel for some time. His Father Henry Jacobs {{was one of the first}} elders in the Church, faithful and true until the last.Zina become pregnant shortly after her marriage. However, she continued to feel concern that she had rejected God by rejecting Joseph, whom she considered a prophet and God's spokesperson. Later she recorded, [...] "I received a testimony for myself from the Lord of this work, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God before I ever saw him, while I resided in the state of New York, given in answer to prayer. I knew him in his lifetime, and know him to have been a great true man and a servant of God." [...] Smith wrote to her in October 1841 that he had [...] "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told me if I did not establish that principle [...] upon the earth <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> my position and my life."
