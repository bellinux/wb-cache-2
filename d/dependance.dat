You have it thus: 'He came unto his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of {{the will of the}} flesh--but of God.' ...|$|E
60|$|Through {{the stillness}} a little breeze came stirring, and she awoke {{out of her}} dream and turned and faced the {{shuttered}} <b>dépendance.</b> A solitary dim light was showing on the verandah. All {{the rest of the}} building was a shapeless mass of grey. The long pale front of the hotel seen through a grove of orange trees was lit now at every other window with people going to bed.

It is a place of no force, wanting both walls and gates. Its buildings are (as I said before) very ordinary, insomuch {{that it would be a}} place of no tolerable entertainment, were it not for the anniversary resort of so many thousand Hagges, or pilgrims, on whose coming the whole <b>dependance</b> of the town (in a manner) is; for many shops are scarcely open all the year besides.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} feel sorry. She did her utmost to feel sorry; {{presently}} {{when she went}} back into the <b>dépendance,</b> she had to check her feet to a regretful pace; she dreaded the eyes of the hotel visitors she passed in the garden lest they should detect the liberation of her soul. But the hotel visitors being English were for the most part too preoccupied with manifestations of a sympathy that should be at once heart-felt and quite unobtrusive and altogether in the best possible taste, to have any attention free for the soul of Lady Harman.|$|E

60|$|I {{received}} of {{the general}} about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed in advance-money to the wagon owners, &c.; but that sum being insufficient, I advanced upward of two hundred pounds more; and in two weeks, the {{one hundred and fifty}} wagons, with two hundred and fifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The advertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case any wagons or horses should be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what <b>dependance</b> might be had on his promise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, the honourable House of Commons may consider, {{whether the}} scheme of {{multiplying}} beggarly clergymen through the whole kingdom who must all have votes for choosing parliament men (provided they can prove their freeholds to be worth 40s. per annum, ultra reprisas) may not, by their numbers, have great influence upon elections, being entirely under the <b>dependance</b> of their bishops. For by a moderate computation, after all the divisions and subdivisions of parishes, that, my lords, the bishops, have power to make by their new laws, there will, {{as soon as the}} present set of clergy go off, be raised an army of ecclesiastical militants, able enough for any kind of service, except that of the altar.|$|E

"Si on considère que c'est dans un temps où presque toutes les nations tremblaient devant la puissance pontificale, que les Vénitiens surent tenir leur clergé dans la <b>dépendance,</b> et braver souvent les censures ecclésiastiques et les interdits, sans encourir jamais aucun reproche sur la pureté de leur foi, on sera forcé de reconnaître que cette république avait dévancé de loin les autres peuples dans cette partie de la science du gouvernement. La fameuse maxime, 'Siamo veneziani, poi christiani,' n'était qu'une formule énergique qui ne prouvait point quils voulussent placer l'intérêt de la {{religion}} après celui de l'Etat, mais qui annonçait leur invariable résolution de ne pas souffrir qu'un pouvoir étranger portât atteinte aux droits de la république.|$|E

60|$|First then, It {{is caused}} {{from the very}} nature of God. There are two things in God, from which, or by the virtue of which, all things have their rise, to wit, the eternity of God in general, and the eternal {{perfection}} of every one of his attributes in particular: for as by the first, he must needs be before all things; so by virtue of the second, must all things consist. And as he is before all things, they having consistence by him; so also is he before all states, or their causes, be they either good or bad, of continuance or otherwise, he being the first without beginning, &c., whereas all other things, with their causes, have rise, <b>dependance,</b> or toleration of being from him (Col 1:17).|$|E

But this Argument having only the imaginary fear of an Arbitrary power for its foundation, is already answer'd, he adds in the close of it, That the Prince has a cheap bargain, who gives Paper-Laws in exchange of Money and Power. Bargains, he tells us, there have always been, and always will be, betwixt Prince and People, because {{it is in the}} Constitution of our Goverment, and the chief <b>dependance</b> of our Kings is in the love and liberality of their People.|$|E
