500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lithotripsy.</b> This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic lithotripsy, where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone. A probe uses electricity to generate shock waves that break down the obstructing stone. [...] Rarely, surgical exploration of the common bile duct (termed choledochotomy), which can be performed with laparoscopy, is required to remove the stone.|$|E

Results: A total of 38 patients, 16 male and 22 female patients, {{with a mean age}} at last follow-up of 38 years (range 5 - 73) were included. During a mean follow-up of 108 months (range 9 - 246) an average of 4, 7 stone episodes occurred, resulting in a total of 179 episodes. A total of 121 <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lithotripsies</b> were performed, achieving stone clearance in 23 (19 %). No complications were encountered.

The C-arm Siemens (produced in 2010 by Siemens AG, Germany) was used for ureteroscopy.

We evaluated patient exposure to ionizing radiation by using a relevant parameter, the air kerma-area product (P KA; all values in cGy cm 2), calculated from the radiation dose values recorded by the fluoroscopy device. P KA depends on technical parameters that change due to anatomical characteristics of each case examined, such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and stone location. For the patients subjected to ESWL for lumbar ureteral lithiasis the mean of P KA  (cGy cm 2) was 509 (SD= 180), while for those treated for pelvic ureteral lithiasis the mean of P KA  was 342 (SD= 201).

40|$|Objective 　To {{summarize}} the method {{and experiences of}} the treatment of upper ureteral calculi with ureteroscope after anterograde low-pressure irrigation by percutaneous nephrostomy fistulation, and to establish a minimal invasive operation mode with high clearance of stone and low urinary infection rate. Methods 　Fifty-eight patients were enrolled with upper ureteral calculi having undergone ureteroscopic pneumatic lithotripsy from Jun. 2013 to Dec. 2014 in 309 Hospital of PLA. Before surgery, all patients had undergone percutaneous nephrostomy under ultrasound scanning. Low-pressure flushing was done during operation, and ureteroscopic pneumatic lithotripsy was done during surgery. Patients in whom complete ureteroscopy could not be done were excluded. Among 58 patients, 33 were male and 25 female, the mean age was 43. 5 years (22 - 67 years), and {{the average length of}} the ureter stones was 1. 25 cm (0. 7 - 1. 8 cm). Results 　The ureter stones in 54 cases (93. 1 %) were successfully crushed during the operation; the ureter stones in 2 cases (3. 4 %) were wrapped by granulation tissue, and the operation was changed to laparoscopic surgery. Fragments of stones were returned to the renal pelvis during the operation in 2 patients (3. 4 %), and in 1 patient a D-J indwelling tube was inserted and <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> for <b>lithotripsy</b> was done. One another patient underwent a secondary ureteroscopic lithotripsy. The mean operative time was about 47 min (24 - 70 min). No infection or secondary bleeding occurred 2 days after the removal of nephrostomy tube. The mean time of hospitalization was 4. 5 d (2 - 7 d). No infection or leakage of urine occurred in all the patients. Conclusions 　Treatment of upper urinary calculi with ureteroscope after anterograde low-pressure irrigation through percutaneous nephrostomy fistula is a safe and effective operation method which is easy to perform, with low cost, minimal invasion, fewer complications, lower rate of ureter stone returning to pelvis and higher stone clearance rate.

40|$|Abstract. BACKGROUND: <b>Extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> {{are known}} to stimulate the {{differentiation}} of mesenchymal stem cells toward osteoprogenitors and induce the expression of osteogenic-related growth hormones. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if and how <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> affected new bone formation, bone microarchitecture, and the mechanical properties of bone in a healthy rat model, in order to evaluate whether <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> therapy might be a potential treatment for osteoporosis. METHODS: Thirteen rats received 1000 electrohydraulically generated unfocused <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> to the right tibia. The contralateral, left tibia was not treated and served as a control. At two, seven, twenty-one, and forty-nine days after administration of the <b>shock</b> <b>waves,</b> in vivo single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning was performed to measure new bone formation on the basis of uptake of technetium-labeled methylene diphosphonate ((99 m) Tc-MDP) (n = 6). Prior to and forty-nine days after the <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> therapy, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans were made to examine the architectural bone changes. In addition, mechanical testing, microcrack, and histological analyses were performed. RESULTS: <b>Extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> induced a strong increase in (99 m) Tc-MDP uptake in the treated tibia compared with the uptake in the untreated, control tibia. Micro-CT analysis showed that <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> stimulated increases in both trabecular and cortical volume, which resulted in higher bone stiffness compared with that of the control tibiae. Histological analysis showed intramedullary soft-tissue damage and de novo bone with active osteoblasts and osteoid in the bone marrow of the legs treated with <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves.</b> Microcrack analysis showed no differences between the treated and control legs. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a single treatment with <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> induces anabolic effects in both cancellous and cortical bone, leading to improved biomechanical properties. Furthermore, treatment with <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> results in transient damage to the bone marrow, which might be related to the anabolic effects.

There are many non-invasive procedures, ranging from simple observation, to specialised forms of surgery, such as radiosurgery. <b>Extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> is a non-invasive treatment of stones in the kidney,gallbladder or liver, using an acoustic pulse. For centuries, physicians have employed many simple non-invasive methods based on physical parameters in order to assess body function in health and disease (physical examination and inspection), such as pulse-taking, the auscultation of heart sounds and lung sounds (using the stethoscope), temperature examination (using thermometers), respiratory examination, peripheral vascular examination, oral examination, abdominal examination, external percussion and palpation, blood pressure measurement (using the sphygmomanometer), change in body volumes (using plethysmograph), audiometry, eye examination, and many others.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{treatment}} is with adequate hydration, alkalization of the urine with citrate supplementation or acetazolamide, and dietary modification to reduce salt and protein intake (especially methionine). If this fails then patients are usually started on chelation therapy with an agent such as penicillamine. Tiopronin is another agent.Once renal stones have formed, however, the first-line {{treatment is}} ESWL (<b>Extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lithotripsy).</b> If ESWL {{do not work}} efficiently surgery can be necessary. Both endoscopic surgery and conventional open-abdominal surgery {{have proven to be}} effective treatment modalities for patients with more advanced disease. Adequate hydration is the foremost aim of treatment to prevent cysteine stones. The goal is to increase the urine volume because the concentration of cystine in the urine is reduced which prevents cystine from precipitating from the urine and forming stones. People with cystine stones should consume 5 to 7 liters a day. The rationale behind alkalizing the urine is that cystine tends to stay in solution and causes no harm. In order to alkalize the urine, sodium biocarbonate has been used. One must be careful in alkalizing their urine because it could lead to other forms of stones in process of preventing cystine stones. Penicillamine is a drug that acts to form a complex with cystine that is 50 times more soluble than cystine itself. Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) is performed via a port created by puncturing the kidney through the skin and enlarging the access port to 1 cm in diameter. Most of the time, cystine stones are too dense to be broken up by shock (ESWL) so PNL is needed.|$|E

40|$|The thesis "Analysis of the {{distribution}} of the sole pressures in standing position and in walking of person s with the diagnosis of calcar calcanei before and after <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> therapy" is a theoretical-empirical case study. The theoretical part deals with kinesiology and function of foot, furthermore it attends to postural stability system, control, analysis of physiological walk and plantar distribution of pressures in standing position and in walk. Also, findings about heel spur and its treatment possibilities are worked up. The theoretical part ends with the summary of findings about <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> therapy, advantages and disadvantages, indications and contraindications. The empirical part of the thesis is concemed with verifying the influence of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> therapy to standing position and walk of patients with the diagnosis calcar calcanei. The main object of the research was observing changes in {{the distribution}} of the sole pressures in standing position and walk of the patients with heel spur before and after <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> herapy.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the role of retroperitoneal laparoscopic pyelolithotomy (RPPL) and its comparison with extra corporeal <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> in the management of renal calculi. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in the Department of surgery, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India. The study included 86 cases of solitary renal calculi in the retroperitoneoscopic (RPPL) group and 82 cases in the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> (SWL) group. The parameters compared were stone clearance, hospital stay, number of postoperative visits, mean time to resume normal activities, number of man days lost, and analgesic requirement. Results : The RPPL group showed better stone clearance, fewer hospital visits, low analgesic requirement, fewer number of man days lost, and early resumption of normal activities, as compared to the SWL group. Conclusions : <b>Shock</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lithotripsy,</b> being a noninvasive modality, is an established procedure all over the world. However RPPL achieves comparable or better results in high volume centers...|$|R
