5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Richmond {{convention}} opened, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document clause by clause, which may have played {{into the hands of}} the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and who had more able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason's motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted the president would use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in the federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future Chief Justice of the United States, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear warhead for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the Polaris missile. His counterpart <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is to be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E

25|$|Although {{neutrino}} oscillations {{have been}} experimentally confirmed, the theoretical foundations are still controversial, {{as it can}} be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> related to sterile neutrinos.

However, oscillations could also occur as a consequence of Lorentz violations, so there are speculations as to how much those violations contribute to the mass of the neutrinos.|$|E
