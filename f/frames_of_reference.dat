5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference,</b> particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E

5|$|Whorf and Sapir both drew {{explicitly}} on Albert Einstein's {{principle of}} general relativity; hence linguistic relativity {{refers to the}} concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying phoneme and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation {{is an example of how}} various observational <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> leads to different patterns of attention and perception.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{physical}} paradoxes defy {{common sense}} predictions about physical situations. In some cases, {{this is the}} result of modern physics correctly describing the natural world in circumstances which are far outside of everyday experience. For example, special relativity has traditionally yielded two common paradoxes: the twin paradox and the ladder paradox. Both of these paradoxes involve thought experiments which defy traditional common sense assumptions about time and space. In particular, the effects of time dilation and length contraction are used in both of these paradoxes to create situations which seemingly contradict each other. It turns out that the fundamental postulate of special relativity that the speed of light is invariant in all <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> requires that concepts such as simultaneity and absolute time are not applicable when comparing radically different <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} manifestations of {{hydraulic}} jumps and historically different terminology {{has been used for}} each. However, the mechanisms behind them are similar because they are simply variations of each other seen from different <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference,</b> and so the physics and analysis techniques can be used for both types.|$|E
25|$|Length contraction, like time dilation, is {{a manifestation}} of the {{relativity}} of simultaneity. Measurement of length requires measurement of the spacetime interval between two events that are simultaneous in one's frame of reference.

40|$|Joined-wing aircrafts are {{characterized}} by statically indeterminate structures, i. e. struc-tures with multiple load paths. In this paper {{a new way of}} analyzing these configurations is introduced. Using this method, NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability for HALE Aircraft) has been updated so that it is now capable of analyzing joined-wing configurations. This new formulation is based on the fully intrinsic equations, which intro-duce neither singularities and nor infinite-degree nonlinearities caused by finite rotation. The formulation makes use of an incremental form of the kinematical equations, which allows preservation of the main advantageous features of the fully intrinsic equations. The method is applied and validated for a joined-wing structure.

40|$|Abstract. The modern {{teaching}} is that centrifugal force only {{exists in a}} rotating <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> {{and that the only}} force that acts in an inertial <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> when a body undergoes circular motion is an inward acting centripetal force. On the contrary however it is here proposed that a rotating <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference,</b> rather than creating an inertial centrifugal force, actually masks a hithertofore unrecognized inertial centripetal force. When the books are correctly balanced, it will be demonstrated that centrifugal force is a real force, closely related to kinetic energy, and observable in any <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference...</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{inertial}} <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference,</b> {{in classical}} physics, is a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> in which bodies, whose net force acting upon them is zero, are not accelerated, that {{is they are}} at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line. In analytical terms, it is a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> that describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner. Conceptually, in classical physics and special relativity, the physics of a system in an inertial frame have no causes external to the system. An inertial <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> may also be called an inertial reference frame, inertial frame, Galilean reference frame, or inertial space.|$|R
25|$|The {{impression}} that a paradox exists {{stems from a}} misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare all <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin's frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, {{the difference between the}} twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Cubism, artists were forced into the {{position}} of re-evaluating {{the role of the}} observer. Classical linear and aerial perspective, uninterrupted surface transitions and chiaroscuro were pushed aside. What remained was a series of images obtained by the observer (the artist) in different <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> as the object was being painted. Essentially, observations became linked through a system of coordinate transformations. The result was Metzinger's 'total image' or a combination of successive images.|$|E

25|$|Minkowski {{space is}} closely {{associated}} with Einstein's theory of special relativity, and {{is the most common}} mathematical structure on which special relativity is formulated. While the individual components in Euclidean space and time may differ due to length contraction and time dilation, in Minkowski spacetime, all <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> will agree on the total distance in spacetime between events. Because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial dimensions, Minkowski space differs from four-dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
25|$|Aberration may be {{explained}} as the difference in angle of {{a beam of light}} in different inertial <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b> A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically in the frame of reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer to tilt their umbrella forwards. The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.|$|E
25|$|Thus the {{kinetic energy}} of a system is lowest with respect to center of {{momentum}} reference frames, i.e., <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> in which the center of mass is stationary (either the center of mass frame or any other center of momentum frame).
