5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians. They reproduced through internal <b>fertilization</b> rather than mating in water. The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious. The head of one individual rests under the tail of another {{in what may be}} a courtship display. Internal <b>fertilization</b> and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair <b>fertilization,</b> therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair <b>fertilization</b> occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair <b>fertilization</b> frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external <b>fertilization,</b> {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external <b>fertilization.</b> Some molluscs use internal <b>fertilization</b> and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} mates, their fecundity, {{and the number}} of extra-pair <b>fertilizations</b> can all affect male {{reproductive}} success in biparental species. Extra-pair mating in birds has been of particular interest, because it could generate strong levels of sexual selection even when a species is socially monogamous. We examined how extra-pair <b>fertilizations</b> affect the opportunity for selection in the sexually dimorphic common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and the sexually monomorphic house wren (Troglodytes aedon). We were able to identify sires for at least 95 % of all nestlings, and, thus, we were able to make a nearly complete accounting of male reproductive success. Although extra-pair <b>fertilizations</b> were common in yellowthroats (26 % of young) it contributed little (21 %) to the total variance in male reproductive success. Most of the variance in reproductive success (58 %) was attributable to the male's within-pair success, which was influenced primarily by the number of young produced by each mate and the proportion of within-pair young sired. Despite a moderate level of extra-pair <b>fertilizations</b> (10 % of young) in house wrens, almost all of the variance in male reproductive success (97 %) was attributable to within-pair success, particularly the number of social mates. Although extra-pair <b>fertilizations</b> generally increase the variance in male reproductive success, within-pair reproductive success may be the major source of variation in male reproductive success. Thus, sexual dimorphism in monogamous birds may be influenced more by the number of mates and their fecundity than by extra-pair matings.

40|$|Polygyny and extrapair <b>fertilizations</b> {{in eastern}} red-winged {{blackbirds}} (Agelaius phoeniceus) Parentage of nestling red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) from an eastern population was deter-mined using DNA fingerprinting techniques. Of 235 nestlings surveyed, 58 had fingerprints excluding the male, but none excluded the female tending the nest. Data on pairing status during the female's fertilizable period {{was available for}} 232 offspring; 55 (25 % of 1988 nestlings, 23 % of 1989 nestlings) of those were sired through extrapair copulations. Of these 55 offspring, 33 could be assigned to nearby territory holders; 16 of the remaining nestlings may have been sired by nearby males that were not captured. During both years, 44 % of territorial males {{had more than one}} female nesting simultaneously on their territory. The number of extrapair <b>fertilizations</b> gained by males increased significandy with harem size in 1 year. Paternity (die proportion of nesdings on the territory sired by die territory holder) showed a positive but nonsignificant increase widi harem size in bodi years. There was no apparent cost in paternity for males guarding two or more fertilizable females at the same time. The broods of females that were fertilizable at die same time anodier female was setding on die same territory tended to have a greater proportion of extrapair <b>fertilizations</b> (0. 37) than did die broods of odier females within harems (0. 15). Established fertilizable females were chased significantly more by die territory owner and by extrapair males when a new female was setding. There were no associations between a male's paternity or success at gaining extrapair <b>fertilizations</b> and his age or color-band combination. Overall, extrapair <b>fertilizations</b> had litde effect on die relationship between fledgling success and harem size and appeared to have a minimal impact on die overall intensity of sexual selection on males.

5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. <b>Fertilization</b> is generally external, but platyctenids use internal <b>fertilization</b> and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; <b>fertilization</b> is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous.

Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the <b>fertilization</b> chamber, where <b>fertilization</b> occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E

40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the benefits of}} early arrival date of migratory birds, a hidden and often ignored component of males 2 ̆ 7 fitness is the higher chance of early-arriving birds to obtain extra-pair <b>fertilizations.</b> Here we investigated how extra-pair paternity might affect the relationship between male arrival date and number of <b>fertilizations</b> in a model study system, the European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. For this purpose, we sampled and genotyped breeding pairs, unpaired males and offspring (including embryos from unhatched eggs when possible) of a Dutch pied flycatcher population. Detailed information on arrival date of males, egg laying date of their social mates and nest success was also recorded. Early-arriving males had early-laying females and males with early-laying females had a higher probability of siring extra-pair eggs and obtain more <b>fertilizations.</b> However, male arrival date alone did not correlate with the probability to gain extra-pair paternity and neither {{to the amount of}} fertilized eggs. Both early- and late-arriving males had a higher probability of losing paternity in their own nest compared to birds with an intermediate arrival date. Finally, late-arriving males were more likely to remain unpaired but, interestingly, a few of these birds obtained paternity via extra-pair copulations. Because earlier arrival date did not lead to more extra-pair <b>fertilizations</b> and because such relationship seems to be driven mainly by the female 2 ̆ 7 s laying date, we conclude that the contribution of extra-pair paternity to the overall fitness benefits of early male arrival date is relatively small...|$|R
40|$|Females should {{prefer to}} be fertilized by males that {{increase}} the genetic quality of their offspring. In vertebrates, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) {{play a key role}} in the acquired immune response and have been shown to affect mating preferences. They are therefore important candidates for the link between mate choice and indirect genetic benefits. Higher MHC diversity may be advantageous because this allows a wider range of pathogens to be detected and combated. Furthermore, individuals harbouring rare MHC alleles might better resist pathogen variants that have evolved to evade common MHC alleles. In the Seychelles warbler, females paired with low MHC-diversity males elevate the MHC diversity of their offspring to levels comparable to the population mean by gaining extra-pair <b>fertilizations.</b> Here, we investigate whether increased MHC diversity results in higher life expectancy and whether there are any additional benefits of extra-pair <b>fertilizations.</b> Our 10 -year study found a positive association between MHC diversity and juvenile survival, but no additional survival advantage of extra-pair <b>fertilizations.</b> In addition, offspring with a specific allele (Ase-ua 4) had a fivefold longer life expectancy than offspring without this allele. Consequently, the interacting effects of sexual selection and pathogen-mediated viability selection appear to be important for maintaining MHC variation in the Seychelles warbler. Our study supports the prediction that MHC-dependent extra-pair <b>fertilizations</b> result in genetic benefits for offspring in natural populations. However, such genetic benefits might be hidden and not necessarily apparent in the widely used fitness comparison of extra- and within-pair offspring. ...|$|R

Most Pseudonitzschia species in coastal waters produce the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), with their blooms causing detrimental marine ecosystem impacts, but oceanic Pseudonitzschia species are considered nontoxic. Here we demonstrate that the sparse oceanic Pseudonitzschia community at the high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll Ocean Station PAPA (50 ° N, 145 ° W) produces approximately 200 pg DA L− 1 in response to iron addition, that DA alters phytoplankton community structure to benefit Pseudonitzschia, and that oceanic cell isolates are toxic.

However, both species showed increased allocation to male function (estimated as total mass of sex-specific tissues) with increased crowding.

This paper describes a means of estimating the long-term rate of self-fertilization from samples of alleles taken from individuals in a population. Use is made of the genealogy of pairs of alleles at a locus within individuals and pairs between individuals. The degree of selfing is closely related {{to the extent to which}} the number of nucleotide sites differing within an individual is reduced relative to the number differing between individuals. Importantly, the estimate of long-term selfing is largely independent of population size and is not affected by historical fluctuations in population size; instead it responds directly to the mating system itself. The approach outlined here is most appropriate to evolutionary problems in which the long-term nature of the mating system is of interest, such as to determine the relationship between prior inbreeding and inbreeding depression...|$|R

The proportion of females obtaining extra-pair <b>fertilizations,</b> however, did not differ between controls and experimentals, indicating that mating tactics of female tree swallows were unaffected by mate replacement. However, differences between early-settling and replacement males did exist. Replacement males had shorter wing chords than early-settling males, suggesting that they were younger. Moreover, a significantly greater proportion of replacement males than early-settling males were unringed and thus new to the study site.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide the first {{molecular}} genetic data on extra-pair paternity in a simultaneously polyandrous, sex-role-reversed avian species, the wattled jacana (Jacana jacana). Female jacanas often copulated with multiple mates, {{provided that the}} mates were not actively incubating eggs or tending young chicks. Both the presence of multiple 'available' mates, and the copulation behaviour of the female near the time of nest initiation, significantly predicted the probability of extra-pair <b>fertilizations.</b> A male's risk of being cuckolded was 0 % in monandrous pairings, rose to 41 % of broods (17 % of chicks) in polyandrous associations where an additional mate was 'available', and increased to 74 % of broods (29 % of chicks) where the female was observed to copulate with multiple mates. Unlike findings from several sequentially polyandrous bird species, few if any <b>fertilizations</b> resulted from sperm stored from a previous nesting. We conclude that lost paternity can constitute a very real cost of polyandry for male wattled jacanas. The source of this cost is sexually active males simultaneously paired to the same female...|$|R

While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external <b>fertilization,</b> air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect <b>fertilization.</b> Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge.
