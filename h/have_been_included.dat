5|$|Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} about 1990 or 1992 {{as part of}} {{the contemporary}} Indigenous art movement that had begun at Papunya in the 1970s.

Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue; her painting was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy Watson, who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Musée du quai Branly.

5|$|M-64 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the highway. These traffic counts are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This number {{is an expression of}} the traffic that uses a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT's surveys showed that the highest AADT along M-64 was 3,333vehicles daily on the Ontonagon River Bridge; the lowest traffic was between US2 and the Gogebic–Ontonagon county line at 418vehicles per day. The only segments of the trunkline that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>included</b> on the National Highway System (NHS) are the US2 and M-28 concurrencies.
