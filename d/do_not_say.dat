5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s the lessee at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt. The 1940s also {{marked a}} {{significant}} change in the region's road infrastructure. A dirt track had been formed to service the telegraph line in the late nineteenth century. This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940, before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 a natural gas pipeline was built across the station, carrying gas from Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.|$|E

25|$|Rugby {{union is}} {{played on a}} field, known as a pitch, that should have a grassy surface, though the Laws {{permit the use of}} {{artificial}} grass, clay, sand or snow, but not permanently hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete. The Laws <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that the pitch needs to be flat or level, merely that the surface must be safe to play on. If either team feels that the pitch is unsafe, the referee must try to resolve the issues and must not start the match if any part of the ground is considered to be dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The Annals state that, in {{the year}} 1002, Máel Sechnaill {{surrendered}} his title to Brian, although they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> anything about how or why this came about. The Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh provides a story in which Brian challenges High King Máel Sechnaill to a battle at the Hill of Tara {{in the province of}} Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. Máel Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.|$|E

25|$|The detectives {{return to}} the lake in Discovery Park where Rosie's body was found. Linden notes {{that no one has}} said what {{happened}} there. Holder suggests they inform the Larsens. They find Terry in the Larsen garage and tell her they found Rosie's killer, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> who it is. After Terry goes upstairs, Linden notices the tail light on Terry's car is broken, recalling Jasper describing the car that dropped his father off on the night of Rosie's murder as having a broken tail light. In Rosie's room, they confront Terry about being at the lake when Rosie died. As Stan and Mitch enter the room, Terry apologizes, asking them to not be mad at her.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Tutankhamun and the two {{stillborn}} children buried with him, the Thutmoside family line came to an end. The Amarna letters indicate that Tutankhamun's wife, recently widowed, wrote to the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, asking if she could marry one of his sons. The letters <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> how Tutankhamun died. In the message, Ankhesenamun says {{that she was very}} afraid, but would not take one of her own people as husband. However, the son was killed before reaching his new wife. Shortly afterward, Ay married Tutankhamun's widow and became Pharaoh as a war was fought between the two countries, and Egypt was left defeated. The fate of Ankhesenamun is not known, but she disappears from record and Ay's second wife Tey became Great Royal Wife. After Ay's death, Horemheb usurped the throne and instigated a campaign of damnatio memoriae against him. Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten, stepmother Nefertiti, his wife Ankhesenamun, half sisters and other family members were also included. Not even Tutankhamun was spared. His images and cartouches were also erased. Horemheb himself was left childless and willed the throne to Paramessu, who founded the Ramesside family line of pharaohs.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E

500|$|Despite their {{political}} differences, Vane and Winthrop developed an epistolary {{relationship in the}} following years. [...] Vane's legacy from {{his time in the}} New World includes the colonial legislation appropriating £400 for the establishment of an institute of higher learning now known as Harvard University, and his support of Roger Williams in the acquisition of Aquidneck Island from the local Indians that resulted in the formal beginnings of Rhode Island. [...] The surviving accounts <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that Vane provide the funds for the acquisition; Williams credits Vane as being [...] "an instrument in the hand of God for procuring this island".|$|E
500|$|Coenred was tonsured in Rome, whence he was {{accompanied}} by Offa, son of Sighere, king of the East Saxons, and became a monk [...] "at {{the threshold of the}} apostles" [...] as Bede had it; he stayed in Rome until his death, the date of which is unknown. [...] He is not recorded as having a wife or children. The Evesham Chronicle kept at Evesham Abbey, however, claim that he was an ancestor of Wigstan. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> whether this was through Wigstan's father, Wigmund, son of Wiglaf of Mercia, or through his mother, Ælfflæd, daughter of Ceolwulf I of Mercia.|$|E

500|$|Shelley {{continued}} to practice her mother's feminist principles by extending aid to women whom society disapproved of. For instance, Shelley extend {{financial aid to}} Diana Mary Dods, a single mother and illegitimate herself who {{appears to have been}} a lesbian and gave her the new identity of Isabel Robinson, the wife of a fictitious Walter Sholto Douglas. Shelley also assisted Georgiana Paul, a woman disallowed for by her husband for alleged adultery. Shelley in her diary about her assistance to the latter: [...] "I do not make a boast-I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> aloud-behold my generosity and greatness of mind-for in truth it is simple justice I perform-and so I am still reviled for being worldly".|$|E
500|$|At {{a thanksgiving}} service for a {{victory at the}} Battle of Oudenarde, Anne did not wear the jewels that Sarah had {{selected}} for her. At the door of St Paul's Cathedral, they had an argument that culminated in Sarah offending the Queen by telling her to be quiet. Anne was dismayed. When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, [...] "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you, I should not have troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and {{for the same reason}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> anything to that, nor to yours which enclosed it." ...|$|E
500|$|The sagas <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> when Augvald lived, but {{an early}} {{suggestion}} by Torfæus placed Augvald in the 3rd century AD. Modern estimates {{have been made}} based on two of his reported descendants, Geirmund and Håvard Heljarskinn, who {{are said to have}} settled Iceland as [...] "old men" [...] when Harald Fairhair consolidated his power in Norway. According to an estimate by Marit Synnøve Vea based on generation-cycles of 30 years (though she notes 25 years might be more accurate), Augvald would have lived in the Migration Period, with slightly varied interpretations around 580–630, around 600 or in the early 7th century. Arnfrid Opedal has considered a shorter generation-cycle of 20 years, which would place Augvald 90 years later, {{at the end of the}} 7th century.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{recorded}} unrest {{against the}} queen accompanying her ascendance in ancient sources hostile to her, indicating no serious {{opposition to the}} new regime. The most obvious candidates for opposition were the Roman provincial governors, but the sources <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that Zenobia marched on any of them or that they tried to remove her from the throne. According to Hartmann, the governors and military leaders of the eastern provinces apparently acknowledged and supported Vaballathus as the successor of Odaenathus. During Zenobia's early regency, [...] she focused on safegarding the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the Persian borders, the queen fortified many settlements on the Euphrates (including the citadels of Halabiye—later called Zenobia—and Zalabiye). Circumstantial evidence exists for confrontations with the Sassanid Persians; probably in 269, Vaballathus assumed the victory title of Persicus Maximus (the great victor in Persia); this may be connected to an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to control northern Mesopotamia.|$|E
500|$|Æthelred {{was the son}} of Penda of Mercia. [...] Penda's queen, Cynewise, {{is named}} by Bede, who does not mention her children; no other wives of Penda are known and so it is likely but not certain that she was Æthelred's mother. [...] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives Penda's age as fifty in 626, and credits him with a thirty-year reign, but this would put Penda at eighty {{years old at the time}} of his death, which is {{generally}} thought unlikely as two of his sons (Wulfhere and Æthelred) were young when he was killed. [...] At least as likely is that Penda was fifty years old at his death, rather than at his accession. [...] Æthelred's date of birth is unknown, but Bede describes Wulfhere as a youth at the time of his accession in 658, so it is likely he and Æthelred were in their middle teens at that time. [...] The early sources <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> whether Æthelred was older or younger than Wulfhere.|$|E
