They enter the office and find Teresa Mueller (Lisa Dempsey), the building's cleaning lady, dead, {{and some of the}} patient files scattered. Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is dismissed as a suspect as he has a confirmed alibi.|$|E

The exhibition contextualizes Dial as a relevant, contemporary artist rather than a folk artist or outsider artist as many have portrayed <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The pieces on view in Hard Truths cover a range {{of social and political}} themes, many of which address rural life in the south and the treatment of African Americans. After departing Indianapolis, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to New Orleans, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|Middleton {{stayed at}} LSU until 1942, {{describing}} {{his days as}} the comptroller of LSU as long days {{that he would not}} want to relive, but after the first year he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
5|$|Planescape: Torment is {{primarily}} story-driven and combat is not prominently featured. The protagonist, known as The Nameless One, is an immortal {{who has lived}} many lives but has forgotten all about them, even forgetting his own name. The game focuses on his journey through the city of Sigil and other planes to reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, {{and most of these}} characters have encountered <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> or have been influenced by his actions in some way.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
50|$|The Democratic primary {{took place}} on July 18, 1944.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{reviewer}} Richard S. Ginell stated [...] "With the Skylark [...] "experiment" [...] behind him, Paul Desmond {{reverted to}} the relaxed quartet format that suited <b>him</b> well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past...</b> <b>In</b> fact, it sparked a Desmond renaissance where he regained {{a good deal}} of the witty spark and erudite cool".|$|R
5|$|During their U.S. tours, the Beatles were {{introduced}} to both Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Strongly influenced by Presley since before their formation, the band had tried to meet <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> but arrangements had fallen through. At Presley's suggestion, guitars were set up {{in his living room}} and the gathering played music for an hour, following which they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes. The other meeting, with Dylan, influenced the music subsequently produced by the Beatles as well as shaping Dylan's own musical style. This was made evident both in Dylan's controversial adoption of electric guitar, and in changes that were apparent in Lennon's vocal and guitar-playing styles.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this about <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, {{who were trying to}} keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E
5|$|Link {{locates the}} Triforce on Skyloft and {{uses it to}} destroy Demise. With Demise dead, Zelda is freed, but Ghirahim arrives and kidnaps Zelda: though Demise is dead in the present, Ghirahim intends to use Zelda as a {{sacrifice}} to resurrect <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Link pursues Ghirahim into the past and fights through his army. He then defeats Ghirahim, who {{turns out to be}} the spirit of Demise's sword, but is unable to prevent Zelda's soul from being used to reincarnate Demise's humanoid form. Groose guards Zelda's body while Link challenges Demise to single combat: Link triumphs, absorbing Demise's essence into the sword, but not before Demise curses Link and Zelda's descendants to be haunted by his reincarnated rage. To complete the sword's seal, Link drives it into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple, with Fi accepting eternal slumber as a result. Groose, Link and the revived Zelda return to their time while Impa remains behind and destroys the Time Gate, as she is a person of that time period and must watch over the Master Sword. In the present, the old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes, revealing that she was Impa. The game ends with Zelda deciding to remain on the Surface to watch over the Triforce: she and Link together establish the kingdom of Hyrule.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced {{the start of}} the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with a}} bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.|$|E

50|$|On 21 May 1956 Valentin {{was at a}} Whitmonday {{air show}} in Liverpool before 100,000 spectators (including three-year-old Clive Barker), using wings similar to the wooden ones that had brought <b>him</b> success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> but longer and more aerodynamic. However, the stunt {{immediately}} went wrong. When exiting the plane, one of his wings made contact and a piece broke away. He attempted to land safely using a parachute, but that also failed: Valentin died.|$|R
25|$|The Cowboys {{improved}} their defense before the 2005 {{season with the}} additions of first round draft picks DeMarcus Ware and Marcus Spears. Parcells drafted these players in hopes of jumpstarting the team's transition from the traditional 4–3 defense to a 3–4 defense, which Parcells had run {{in all of his}} previous stops. Jerry Jones also added a number of high-priced older veteran players, acquiring nose tackle Jason Ferguson and cornerback Anthony Henry via free agency, and linebacker Scott Fujita via the Kansas City Chiefs. On offense, the Cowboys felt the need to upgrade their passing game to complement their top 2004 draft pick, running back Julius Jones, and acquired quarterback Drew Bledsoe via free agency. During his tenure, Parcells made a point of signing players who had played for <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> including Bledsoe, Terry Glenn (with the Patriots), Testaverde, cornerback Aaron Glenn, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and fullback Richie Anderson with the Jets. In 2005, the Cowboys went 9–7, missing the playoffs by one game.|$|E
25|$|Baybars II ruled {{for roughly}} {{one year before}} an-Nasir Muhammad became sultan again in 1310, this time ruling for over three {{consecutive}} decades in a period that is often considered by historians of the Mamluk period to be the apex of both the Bahri regime specifically and the Mamluk Sultanate in general. To avoid the experiences of his previous two reigns where the mamluks of Qalawun and Khalil held sway and periodically assumed the sultanate, an-Nasir Muhammad launched efforts to establish a centralized autocracy. Early into his third reign, in 1310, an-Nasir Muhammad imprisoned, exiled or killed any Mamluk emirs that supported those who toppled <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> including the Burji mamluks. He then assigned emirates to over thirty of his own mamluks. Initially, an-Nasir Muhammad left most of his father's mamluks undisturbed, but in 1311 and 1316, he imprisoned and executed most of them, and again redistributed emirates to his own mamluks. By 1316, the number of mamluks was reduced to 2,000. An-Nasir Muhammad went further in imposing his rule by intervening to have al-Wathiq succeed Caliph al-Mustakfi, as well as compelling the qadi to issue legal rulings that advanced his interests.|$|E

50|$|David is a Toad and Ham Jamming enthusiast. He is {{the founder}} of the Fake Bacon Society.

500|$|Planer {{suggests}} that the [...] "searing" [...] verse-two lines [...] "You thought you had got me in your grip / Baby, looks like you was not so smart" [...] are a further example of this interpretation. Like Planer, Inglis recognises a third possible target of Harrison's scorn – former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Inglis observes that in the song's final verse, Harrison is making it clear {{to those who have}} underestimated <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> that his abilities are not [...] "recent acquisitions": ...|$|E
500|$|... "Time Will Crawl", which Bowie {{named as}} his {{favourite}} track from the album, {{was inspired by}} events from the Chernobyl disaster {{and the idea that}} someone from one's own neighborhood could be responsible {{for the end of the}} world. Bowie said his vocals on this song [...] "owed a lot to Neil Young", and noted that the variety of voices he used on the album were a nod to the musicians who had influenced <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Bowie performed the song for the BBC show Top of the Pops, although that performance has never been aired. This track was the second single released from the album.|$|E
