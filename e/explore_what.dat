5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, and the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E
5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> is now the Bering Sea area of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they {{could not make out}} the Alaskan coast. The storm proved too powerful so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions and possibly even unrecorded episodes.|$|E

25|$|In June 2016, it was {{announced}} that Mel Gibson is working on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ, focusing on the resurrection of Jesus. The screenwriter is Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay for Braveheart (1995). Gibson has expressed an interest in directing the film. He also said that the film will come out in a few years since it is a big project. In November 2016, Gibson confirmed that the title of the sequel would be Resurrection and implied that part of the movie would be taking place in hell, stating that the film would <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> happened in the three-day period between the death of Jesus and his return. He also revealed that the film would probably be about three years away, because of its massive undertaking. Mel also said Its a vast theological experience, need to dwell into.|$|E

In 1788 eleven men from Kingston, New York came to the area with two Delaware people (Lenape) guides, to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> they considered wilderness. The following year Jacob Yaple, Isaac Dumond, and Peter Hinepaw returned with their families and constructed log cabins. That same year Abraham Bloodgood of Albany obtained a patent from the state for 1400 acres, which included all of the present downtown west of Tioga Street. In 1790, the federal government and state began an official program to grant land in the area, known as the Central New York Military Tract, as payment for service to the American soldiers of the Revolutionary War, as the government was cash poor. Most local land titles trace back to these Revolutionary war grants.|$|E
25|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} represent another {{class of}} synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy {{at the molecular}} level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed {{onto the surface of}} the pores by physisorption. Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.|$|E

[...] This post-war dream was that their victory would usher in a more peaceful world, whose leaders would no longer be so eager to resolve disputes by resorting to war. [...] The album's lyrics are critical of Thatcher, whose policies and decisions Waters regarded as an example of this betrayal. [...] She is referred to as [...] "Maggie" [...] throughout the album.|$|E
500|$|Holby City is a British medical drama {{television}} series {{that has been}} broadcast on BBC One since 12 January 1999.

Young wanted to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> happened to patients treated in Casualty once they were taken away to the hospital's surgical wards.

500|$|Steve Young, {{a writer}} for the Late Show with David Letterman, was brought in as a {{freelance}} writer to write the episode. The writers wanted to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> made Flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does. The original idea came from George Meyer, who had also wanted an episode about Flanders' faith being tested. One of the key story points came from his friend Jack Handey, {{a writer for}} Saturday Night Live, who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him, but make very bad shoes. Likewise, it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders' house, but do a bad job and provoke an outburst.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} took place at various {{locations}} in and around New York City in June 2009. In creating the visual effects for the series, the company turned to Brooklyn-based effects company Brainstorm Digital.

Everything is HD now, {{so we have to}} treat it like a feature film." [...] "Anytime you get to work on a period piece, it's more fun," [...] comments visual effects artist Chris [...] "Pinkus" [...] Wesselman, who used archival photographs, postcards, and architectural plans to recreate the Atlantic City boardwalks as accurately as possible. [...] "We got to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> the old Atlantic City was really like. The piers were one of the toughest parts because every summer they would change – new houses, new advertisements."

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel and written by Dan Greaney, who wanted to <b>explore</b> <b>what</b> Bart's life would end up like. Several designs {{were made by the}} animators for future Bart, but Greaney did not think they matched the personality of the character and had to give clearer instructions on how he wanted him to look. Reception of [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] by critics has been generally mixed to negative. In 2003, it was named the worst episode of the series by Entertainment Weekly writers who felt the [...] "looking-into-the-future premise" [...] was carried out better in [...] "Lisa's Wedding." [...] Around 8.77 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD {{along with the rest of}} the episodes of the eleventh season. The episode attracted renewed attention in the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election, because of a reference to the presidency of Donald Trump.|$|E

[...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game".

500|$|This was {{the third}} time that an episode of The Simpsons focused on homosexuality. The episode—written by J.

Around {{the time of the}} episode's original airdate, February 20, 2005, the same-sex marriage question was a hot political issue in the United States and the episode became controversial. [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] received a lot of criticism from conservative groups, including the Parents Television Council and the American Family Association, that claimed it was promoting gay marriage. Jean stated in response that the staff was not taking a side on the issue and that they were just examining all sides of it.
