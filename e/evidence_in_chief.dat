6000|$|While Walter Dene solemnly swore amid {{dead silence}} to this treble lie, {{he did not}} dare to look Joe Harley once in the face; and while Joe Harley listened in amazement to this {{unexpected}} assistance to his case--for counsel, suspecting a mistaken identity, had not questioned him too closely on the subject--he had presence of mind enough not to let his astonishment show upon his stolid features. But when Walter had finished his <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> he stole a glance at Joe; {{and for a moment}} their eyes met. Then Walter's fell in utter self-humiliation; and he said to himself fiercely, [...] "I would not so have debased and degraded myself before any man to save my own life--what is my life worth me, after all?--but to save Christina, to save Christina, to save Christina! I have brought all this upon myself for Christina's sake." ...|$|E
60|$|Crinkett was the next, who {{swore that}} he had been Caldigate's partner in sundry mining speculations,--that they had been in every way intimate,--{{that he had}} always {{recommended}} Caldigate to marry Mrs. Smith, thinking, as he said, 'that respectability paid in the long run,'--and that, having so advised him, he had become Caldigate's special friend at the time, to the exclusion of Dick Shand, who was generally drunk, and who, whether drunk or sober, was opposed to the marriage. He had been selected to stand by his friend at the marriage, and he, thinking that another witness would be beneficial, had taken Adamson with him. His only wonder was that any one should dispute a fact which was at the time so notorious both at Ahalala and at Nobble. He held his head high during his <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> and more than once called the prisoner 'Caldigate,'--'Caldigate knew this,'--and 'Caldigate did that.' It was past four when he was handed over for cross-examination; but when it was said that another hour would suffice for it, the judge agreed to sit for that other hour.|$|E
6000|$|The {{jury was}} sworn in without more than {{ordinary}} delay, and then the trial was commenced. That {{which had to be}} done for the prosecution seemed to be simple enough. The first witness called was the woman herself, who was summoned in the names of Euphemia Caldigate alias Smith. She gave her evidence very clearly, and with great composure,--saying how she had become acquainted with the man on board the ship; how she had been engaged to him at Melbourne; how he had come down to her at Sydney; how, in compliance with his orders, she had followed him up to Ahalala; and how she had there been married to him by Mr. Allan. Then she brought forth the documents which professed to be the copy of the register of the marriage, made by the minister in his own book; and the envelope,--the damning envelope,--which Caldigate was prepared to admit that he had himself addressed to Mrs. Caldigate; and the letter which purported to have been written by the minister to Caldigate, recommending him to be married in some better established township than that existing at Ahalala. She did it well. She was very correct, {{and at the same time}} very determined, giving many details of her early theatrical life, which it was thought better to get from her in the comparative ease of a direct examination than to have them extracted afterwards by an adverse advocate. During her <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> which was necessarily long, she seemed to be quite at ease; but those around her observed that she never once turned her eyes upon him whom she claimed as her husband except when she was asked whether the man there before her was the man she had married at Ahalala. Then, looking at him for a moment in silence, she replied, very steadily, 'Yes; that is my husband, John Caldigate.' ...|$|E
50|$|Generally {{an accused}} cannot waive the {{admissibility}} {{requirements of a}} confession.But section 217(3) of CPA renders an inadmissible confession admissible if the accused adduces <b>evidence,</b> whether <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> or <b>in</b> cross-examination, of the confession, and the court considers that {{that part of the}} evidence so adduced is in favour of accused.|$|R
50|$|The law of {{evidence}} governs {{the proof of}} facts and the inferences flowing from such facts during the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits. Before the twentieth century, evidence law was largely the product of decisional law. During the twentieth century, projects such as the California Evidence Code and the Uniform Rules of Evidence encouraged the codification of those common law <b>evidence</b> rules. <b>In</b> 1965, <b>Chief</b> Justice Earl Warren appointed an advisory committee of fifteen to draft the new rules. The committee was composed of lawyers and legal scholars from across the country.|$|R
50|$|The Pallava king {{seems to}} have had {{extensive}} influence over the deccan and other parts of subcontinent. A festival in his honor was conducted in great ancient temples at sree kalahasti (now in AP), Draksharama coinciding with the king's natal asterism of tiruvonam. This is <b>evidenced</b> <b>in</b> epigraphs.The Pallava <b>chief</b> also {{seems to have}} had extensive influence in the Asian region as we see traders from kingdoms on banks of river ganga namely radha desam (southern UP) visiting the country for trade. Certain official called kambujattu acharya from kambujadesam (Vietnam), came and took charge as priestly official at srirangam temple during his time.This is evidenced by epigraphs. The epigraph registers an order of the officer Solakon,an officer of kopperunjingan exempting from taxes the lands given for the maintenance of our gardeners looking after the garden called ‘Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan-tirunandavanam’ which was formed by Gangayar(meaning from banks of ganga) Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyar alias Udaiyar Isvarasivar of Savarnna-gotra and belonging to the Southern Radha country in Uttarapatha(UP), for providing garlands to the god Udaiyar Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyar and the goddess Tirukkamakkottamudaiya-Periyanachchiyar.|$|R

2500|$|According to a {{documentary}} programme broadcast on the Swedish television channel SVT in February2006,, associates of Pettersson {{claimed that he}} had confessed to them {{his role in the}} murder, but with the explanation that {{it was a case of}} mistaken identity. Allegedly, Pettersson had intended to kill Sigvard Cedergren, a drug dealer who customarily walked along the same street at night and resembled Palme both in appearance and dress. [...] The programme also suggested there was greater police awareness than previously acknowledged because of surveillance of drug activity in the area. The police had several officers in apartments and cars along those few blocks of Sveavägen but, 45minutes before the murder, the police monitoring ceased. In the light of these revelations, Swedish police undertook to review Palme's case and Pettersson's role. [...] Writing in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter of 28 February 2006 other SVT reporters scathingly criticized the documentary, alleging that the film-maker had fabricated a number of statements while omitting other contradictory <b>evidence,</b> <b>in</b> particular his <b>chief</b> source's earlier testimony that could not be reconciled with his claim to have seen the shooting.|$|R

40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} PhD, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of OsloIn most child sexual abuse (CSA) cases field investigative interviews of children (FIIC) {{plays a crucial role}} in these investigations and are considered to be the <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> primarily because other evidence is typically unavailable. Whether or not an FIIC results in free narrative from the interviewed child says {{a great deal about the}} conversation, and in the cause of that it is the interviewer’s responsibility to make sure that the communication with the interviewed child goes well. The interviewer is the one who ultimately determines whether the FIIC is going to be an effective information gathering exercise. In the analysis of the most prominent variables in FIIC the conclusion of this PhD thesis could be summarised around three main findings. Firstly, the interviewers’ use of open questions was demonstrated to be the quality measurement in FIIC, eliciting the longest answers compared to any of the other variables. The ratio of open and closed questions in study two and three was 1 : 10. Obviously police officers who conduct FIIC need to use more open questions in their interviews. And the only way to do that is for the interviewers to plan, practice, evaluate and continue to evaluate their interview practices. Secondly, interviewing skills are not static. Even if the interviewers do have the knowledge and the research-based recommendations are endorsed, they are not implemented in the interviewers’ way of conducting FIIC in practice. The studies demonstrate that the interviewers, however skilful, get rusty and the interviewers with most practical competence are less effectively getting the shortest responses from the interviewed children. In the suggested improvement of the interviewers` FIIC, two models are presented. The first, at the individual interviewers’ level, suggests improvement in the training programmes by including supervision of the interviewers with the interviews conducted similar to the real FIIC, at the local police stations. The second suggested model is at the organisational level, by organising teams of investigators working together with dedicated peer consulting co-interviewers, monitoring and focusing on the interviewer`s performance coming up with alternative questions during the FIIC. Thirdly, there is a verbal competence effect in court. The results indicate that the courts decisions are affected by the length of the children's responses in their testimonies. The children's responses to open questions was found to be 1. 9 and 2. 3 times longer in the convicted cases compared to acquittals or cases with insufficient evidence to proceed to court. This emphasises the importance of open questions in the interviews, and for both the interviewers and members of court to implement content analysis of the interviews and improve their evaluation procedures of FIIC. Contrary to the popular myth, children do respond when they are questioned. The key point the author would like to emphasise is: Whether or not children give a long response depends, not only on their limitation, but also on the interviewers` limitations and the interviewers` ability to, in a sense, take advantage of the children's strength and get them to function at the best of their abilities. Whereas, what he often saw in the analysis for this thesis were children functioning below their best effort. Interviewers, teaching institutions, academia and research environments, legislative authorities, and the court of law, are all responsible for improving the quality of procedures in connection with FIIC.
