30|$|We {{introduce}} a new method to modify films of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) to produce non-porous, water-resistant substrates for diagnostics. First, water resistant NFC films were prepared from mechanically disintegrated NFC hydrogel, and then their surfaces were carboxylated via TEMPO-mediated oxidation. Next, the topologically functionalized film was activated via EDS/NHS chemistry, and its reactivity verified with bovine serum albumin and antihuman IgG. The surface carboxylation, EDC/NHS activation and the protein attachment were confirmed using quartz crystal microbalance with <b>dissipation,</b> contact <b>angle</b> measurements, conductometric titrations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. The surface morphology of the prepared films was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Finally, we demonstrate that antihuman IgG can be immobilized on the activated NFC surface using commercial piezoelectric inkjet printing.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the well known model of spin 1 / 2 coupled to a slowly varying magnetic {{field in the}} presence of a weak damping represented by a Lindblad-form operator. We show that Berry's geometrical phase remains unaltered by dissipation. A clear and physically appealing interpretation of this dynamics is given in terms of Bloch's vector. Dissipation effects are twofold: a shrinking in the modulus of this vector, which (geometrically) characterizes coherence loss and a time dependent (<b>dissipation</b> related) precession <b>angle.</b> Experimentally accessible effects are calculated...|$|R

40|$|Here, we {{analyze the}} transverse-magnetic (TM) wave {{interaction}} {{with a pair}} of slabs, one being an epsilon-negative (ENG) layer in which the real part of permittivity is assumed to be negative while its permeability has positive real part, and the other being a mu-negative (MNG) layer that has the real part of its permeability negative but its permittivity has positive real part. Although wave interaction with each slab by itself has predictable features, we show that the juxtaposition and pairing of such ENG and MNG slabs may, under certain conditions, lead to some unusual features, such as resonance, complete tunneling, zero reflection and transparency. The field distributions inside and outside such paired slabs are analyzed, and the Poynting vector distributions in such structures are studied. Using equivalent transmission-line models, we obtain the conditions for the resonance, complete tunneling and transparency, and we justify and explain the field behavior in these resonant paired structures. Salient features of the tunneling conditions, such as the roles of material parameters, slab thicknesses, <b>dissipation,</b> and <b>angle</b> of incidence are discussed. The analogy and correspondence between the ENG-MNG pair and the pair of a slab of conventional material juxtaposed with a “double-negative” medium is also discussed. Finally, a conceptual idea for a potential application of such a “matched” lossless ENG-MNG pair in “ideal” image displacement and image reconstruction is proposed...|$|R
40|$|We present {{classical}} trajectory {{calculations of}} the rotational vibrational scattering of a nonrigid methane molecule from a Ni(111) surface. Energy <b>dissipation</b> and scattering <b>angles</b> {{have been studied}} {{as a function of}} the translational kinetic energy, the incidence angle, the (rotational) nozzle temperature, and the surface temperature. Scattering angles are somewhat toward the surface for the incidence angles of 30 °, 45 °, and 60 ° at a translational energy of 96 kJ/mol. Energy loss is primarily from the normal component of the translational energy. It is transferred for somewhat more than half to the surface and the rest is transferred mostly to rotational motion. The spread in the change of translational energy has a basis in the spread of the transfer to rotational energy, and can be enhanced by raising of the surface temperature through the transfer process to the surface motion...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissociation}} {{of methane}} on transition metals {{is an important}} reaction in catalysis. It is the rate limiting step in steam reforming to produce syngas. Molecular beam experiments {{have shown that the}} energy in the internal vibrations are about as effective as the translational energy in inducing dissociation. The published wave packet simulations on the methane dissociation reaction on transition metals have treated the methane molecule always as a diatomic up to now. Besides the C-H bond and molecule surface distance, a combination of other coordinates were included, like (multiple) rotations and some lattice motion. None of them have looked at the role of the internal vibrations. We were not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all internal vibrations. Instead we simulated the scattering of methane in fixed orientations, for which all internal vibrations can be included, and used the results to deduce consequences for the dissociation. Furthermore we studied the isotope effect, and the role of vibrational excitations. We ended with classical trajectory calculations of the rotational vibrational scattering of a non-rigid methane molecule from a Ni(111) surface. Energy <b>dissipation</b> and scattering <b>angles</b> have been studied {{as a function of the}} translational kinetic energy, the incident angle, the (rotational) nozzle temperature, and the surface temperature.

40|$|This study aims to (i) {{demonstrate}} {{the efficacy of}} a new surgical planning framework for complex cardiovascular reconstructions, (ii) develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled multi-dimensional shape optimization method to aid patient-specific coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) design and, (iii) compare the hemodynamic efficiency of the sequential CABG, i. e., raising a daughter parallel branch from the parent CABG in patient-specific 3 D settings. Hemodynamic efficiency of patient-specific complete revascularization scenarios for right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) bypasses were investigated {{in comparison to the}} stenosis condition. Multivariate 2 D constraint optimization was applied on the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft, which was parameterized based on actual surgical settings extracted from 2 D CT slices. The objective function was set to minimize the local variation of wall shear stress (WSS) and other hemodynamic indices (energy <b>dissipation,</b> flow deviation <b>angle,</b> average WSS, and vorticity) that correlate with performance of the graft and risk of re-stenosis at the anastomosis zone. Once the optimized 2 D graft shape was obtained, it was translated to 3 D using an in-house “sketch-based” interactive anatomical editing tool. The final graft design was evaluated using an experimentally validated second-order non-Newtonian CFD solver incorporating resistance based outlet boundary conditions.   3 D patient-specific simulations for the healthy coronary anatomy produced realistic coronary flows. All revascularization techniques restored coronary perfusions to the healthy baseline. Multi-scale evaluation of the optimized LIMA graft enabled significant wall shear stress gradient (WSSG) relief (~ 34 %). In comparison to original LIMA graft, sequential graft also lowered the WSSG by 15 % proximal to LAD and diagonal bifurcation. The proposed sketch-based surgical planning paradigm evaluated the selected coronary bypass surgery procedures based on acute hemodynamic readjustments of aorta-CA flow. This methodology may provide a rational to aid surgical decision making in time-critical, patient-specific CA bypass operations before in vivo execution...|$|R
40|$|The {{excitement}} {{which followed}} {{the discovery of}} high-temperature superconductors in 1986 was short-lived, as {{it became clear that}} their current carrying capacity (the critical current density Jc) was limited by grain boundaries (GBs). In order to reduce their detrimental effects coated conductors have been developed, in which a superconducting thin film is deposited on a polycrystalline, textured substrate. Within certain temperature and magnetic field ranges, however, GBs still limit the overall Jc. This fact motivated the present thesis, for which the electrical properties of different types of coated conductors, and in particular their GBs, were investigated. Several GBs and a single grain were isolated in a tape produced by metal-organic deposition (MOD), using a novel approach based on electron backscatter diffraction and a focused ion beam microscope. Measurements of their critical current densities for fields swept in the film plane showed the expected decrease with increasing misorientation angle at low fields. At higher fields an angle dependent crossover was found, from a GB to grain limited Jc. In order to confirm this result and put it into broader perspective, the dependence of Jc on the width of polycrystalline tracks was studied, and then explained in terms of the behaviour of the single GBs. Investigations using low-temperature scanning laser microscopy rounded out the picture, which also showed GB <b>dissipation</b> at certain <b>angles</b> and grain limitation at others. In measurements on samples produced by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) characteristic differences compared to the MOD film were found. While both conductors exhibited high values of Jc, the variation with in-plane angle was significantly stronger for the MOCVD conductor, which can be explained by its sharper texture. In a track patterned perpendicular to the tape direction the phenomenon of vicinal channelling was observed, which previously was known only from films on single crystal substrates. Finally, an isolated boundary showed very high values of Jc, consistent with its low misorientation. In order to better understand how the substrate influences the superconducting properties, measurements were carried out on otherwise identical samples grown on different substrates. A tape with grains elongated along its rolling direction showed particularly good properties at all examined field orientations. This extends the previously reported result that high aspect ratios are beneficial at fields applied perpendicular to the tape plane. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Cartilage {{has limited}} {{potential}} for self repair. Therefore, articular cartilage lesions {{often lead to}} early osteoarthritis. Early clinical results of cartilage replacement procedures such as autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) seem promising, but long term results are not available to date. Only longitudinal studies of 20 years and more will show whether the cartilage repair procedures currently in evaluation will prevent the treated patients from developing early osteoarthritis and if the progression of osteoarthritis will be halted. In {{order to be able}} to evaluate and compare different methods of cartilage treatment, a thorough understanding of the mechanical properties of intact cartilage and cartilage with early degenerations is needed. The prime function of cartilage is load bearing. Cartilage absorbs and spreads the applied energy thereby protecting the underlying bone. It also provides diarthrodial joints with an almost frictionless gliding surface. It has been shown in clinic that there is a correlation between the histological quality, the load bearing capacity and the durability of the repair. Thus it seems logical to search for a repair with properties close to that of normal cartilage. The mechanical behaviour of cartilage is complex, since the tissue structure is a combination of partly porous, viscous and elastic components. This results in deformation rate-dependent stiffness, i. e. how much energy is needed to deform the cartilage (dynamic modulus) and energy <b>dissipation</b> (loss <b>angle)</b> properties. The water movement through or out of the cartilage under a given loading condition makes its response to loading more complex compared to an ordinary viscoelastic solid. To determine these properties, several tests can be performed, i. e. unconfined or confined compression, or indentation tests. In this thesis, dynamic indentation tests were performed because indentation minimizes specimen preparation and has been shown by others to produce meaningful cartilage stiffness data. However, a mathematical model is needed to calculate stiffness data out of those experiments. These models are always a simplification of the real situation, since cartilage is a complex structure with complex mechanical properties. To determine the influence of the mathematical model used on the results the conventional model (Hayes) is compared with a novel method (Kren) in chapter 2, which has as a main advantage that it does not assume linear elasticity. Although a difference was found in absolute values calculated with these models, the trends they show were similar when used to evaluate the same set of data. Thus experimental data cannot be compared between these different models, but for comparisons within one model, both models give similar results. In order to determine cartilage behaviour, preferably healthy human specimens are tested. Unfortunately, these specimens were extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore in chapter 3, we investigated whether swine cartilage could serve as a model for human cartilage for mechanical testing. At equivalent anatomic locations, dynamic modulus was similar for human and swine specimens, but a small difference was found in the loss angle. Keeping these differences in mind, swine specimens can be used for ex-vivo testing. Since mechanical behaviour of cartilage depends on the applied deformation rate and inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity, in chapter 3 the behaviour of cartilage in swine knee joints was determined as a function of loading mode and anatomic location. We observed a larger heterogenity at fast compared to slow deformation rates. Moreover, no differences were found in the loss angle at slow deformation rate between locations. These differences highlight the need for using multiple test modes, i. e. loading cartilage at different strain rates. After expanding the knowledge of dynamic stiffness properties of cartilage, in chapter 4 and 5 we explored whether double network hydrogels (DN-gels) are suitable as a cartilage repair material. It already has been shown by others that these DN-gels look promising to serve as a cartilage repair material because of its low sliding friction, high wear resistancy, high thoughness and biocompatibility. Current focal repairs have a much lower initial stiffness and strength than the surrounding tissue, which increases early failure potential. In chapter 4, we tested the mechanical properties related to surgical use of two kinds of DN-gels. Both DN-gels showed good suture tear-out strength and also pull-off tests with tissue adhesive showed promising results. However, dynamic stiffness of both DN-gels was only about 10...|$|R
