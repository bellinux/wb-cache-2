5|$|The {{morpheme}} that is glossed as aspect in {{the above}} example, {{referred to in the}} literature as the -ma suffix, denotes aspectual unmarkedness. <b>Its</b> <b>absence</b> signifies perfective aspect, and it may be further suffixed with -yan, producing -ma-yan, to denote continuous or imperfective aspect.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the arctometatarsus first evolved; {{it was not}} present in the {{earliest}} tyrannosauroids like Dilong, but {{was found in the}} later Appalachiosaurus. This structure also characterized troodontids, ornithomimids and caenagnathids, but <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> in the earliest tyrannosauroids indicates that it was acquired by convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|The partly ionic {{structure}} of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> {{of color and}} a large band gap. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the basal planes (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high anisotropy of most properties of h-BN.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> heralded moral decay.|$|E

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In <b>its</b> <b>absence,</b> fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying. Although {{it has never}} been played at the Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future. <b>Its</b> <b>absence</b> from the Olympics has been seen by the netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and funding sources. Some funding sources became available with {{recognition in}} 1995, including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} memory and forgetting, {{far from being}} the {{individual}} matters they were taken to be in the 20 th century, are social phenomena: that they are collective, or social, products, and form {{two sides of the same}} coin. Collective memory has its own resources:it is guided by societal forces and sustained by language. Social forgetting, on the other hand, is sustained by silence, oppression and censorship. The two together furnish society with its presences and <b>its</b> <b>absences.</b> There is a conflict between memory and oblivion. Where one flourishes, the other withers, and vice versa. Societies are built on just such problematic relationships...|$|R

5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} defined areas of New Zealand, one on the North Island {{and the other on}} the South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part of}} the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import. It is more likely that the species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{is known}} {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This process can be understood as the field lines wrapping around an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits mangroves and <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Felix's {{party is}} able to achieve {{entrance}} into Piers' home, a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature; {{it has always been}} the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss. Knowing that restoring Alchemy is what must be done to actually save the world, Felix crosses the sea in order to activate Jupiter Lighthouse. But when Isaac's pursuing party enters the lighthouse, they are trapped and ambushed by Karst and Agatio. Felix rescues Isaac, but Karst and Agatio escape with the Mars Star formerly in Isaac's possession.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even where}} {{recognisable}} facts are present, {{their use in}} the History cannot be taken at face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged {{the landscape of the}} state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area is known as the Driftless Zone for <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> of glacial drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, {{and most of them are}} minor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Canavan’s disease (CD) is a fatal {{autosomal}} recessive pediatric leukodystrophy in which patients show severe neurodegeneration and typically die {{by the age}} of 10, though life expectancy in patients can be highly variable. Currently, there is no effective treatment for CD; however, gene therapy seems to be a feasible approach to combat the disease. Being a monogenic defect, the disease provides an excellent model system to develop gene therapy approaches that can be extended to other monogenic leukodystrophies and neurodegenerative diseases. CD results from mutations in a single gene aspartoacylase which hydrolyses N-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA) which accumulates in <b>its</b> <b>absences.</b> Since CD {{is one of the few}} diseases that show high NAA levels, it can also be used to study the enigmatic biological role of NAA...|$|R

5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} <b>its</b> <b>absence</b> in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least {{as far back as the}} Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E
5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In <b>its</b> <b>absence,</b> the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E
