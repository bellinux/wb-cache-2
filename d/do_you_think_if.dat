2500|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> the {{election}} of 1984 {{had not been a}} snap election, there would have been time for the opposing forces within the party to have successfully blocked the reforms or to have severely limited them? ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "Yes. But what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>If</b> {{you think}} differently, {{and can make}} me see it differently, oughtn't you to do so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Q. Considering the {{resolution}} of Parliament[20] as to the right, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> the stamp-act is repealed, that the North Americans will be satisfied? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most certainly. Marian {{ask me to}} tell! {{you must}} be dreaming. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> even <b>if</b> Marian were capable of making an advance, that I would consent {{to act as a}} go-between? Really, Mr. Douglas!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you, Frank," [...] he said reproachfully, [...] "that I had no money. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I had it I {{would not}} have given it to you at once, instead of sending it in that {{roundabout}} manner? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know the handwriting? that may afford you some clue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me go, Pinch!' cried Martin, shaking him away. 'Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> hold me? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a blow {{could make}} him a more abject {{creature}} than he is? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I spat upon him, I could degrade him to a lower level than his own? Look at him. Look at him, Pinch!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so harassed that I {{hardly know}} what I am saying. Would it be wise, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> I were {{to pay him}} anything, so as to keep him quiet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beg pardon, nurse," [...] he said, [...] "but we've {{sent for}} a stretcher, {{as the police}} don't seem in any hurry. Would you like us to take him. Or would it upset him, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> he knew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] Anna laughed, [...] "how unfortunate! What ought I to do? Should I be forgiven, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> I {{were to go}} {{and hold}} that skein of wool for the old lady in the yellow cap?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Mr. Crawley, very irate at this {{appeal to}} his wife, and {{speaking}} in a loud voice, [...] "do you misdoubt my word; or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I were minded to be false to you, that I should be corrected in my falsehood by the firmer faith of my wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ALICE. 'Take care, Amy, or I shall {{begin to}} believe that your father was right. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would happen <b>if</b> I were to leave you to him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Edmund," [...] Siegbert replied. [...] "I am {{sure you}} need have no fear that she has {{softened}} towards Sweyn. But how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of proceeding <b>if</b> <b>you</b> land?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wait--oh do wait! NO-O, I won't {{give it to}} you, I'll read it aloud. I'll {{read you}} the choice bits,--hic! Oh dear! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I drink water it would take off this hiccup? HIC! Oh, I feel {{perfectly}} helpless.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's not it, that's not it," [...] said Christian, quickly. [...] "Repentance is not enough. Why, man, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I went to England just now, {{and said}} ever so earnestly or so truly, `I repent,' that I'd escape {{swinging}} at the yard-arm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} would, {{but what would}} you think of a man who would refuse such a {{proposition}} when he didn't want the place himself? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I'd been there foxes would have been poisoned in Dillsborough wood? I'd have had that fellow Goarly under my thumb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'This is {{all very}} fine, Courtenay Ivor--all very fine in its way; but {{how are you going}} to prove it? that's the real question. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> any jury in England will believe, on your {{unsupported}} oath, such a cock-and-bull story? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> even <b>if</b> Richard Wharton's come back, and you've got him on your side, I can't cross-examine all the life out of his body?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--that's what I mean to try. The Duke, of course, {{would like}} me to marry Lord Rufford. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I were at home here it wouldn't make Mistletoe a very {{different}} sort of place for <b>you?</b> The Duke <b>does</b> like papa {{in a sort of}} way, and he's civil enough to me when I'm there. He never did like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ve been thinking," [...] said Mrs. Banks, nodding {{her head}} with some animation, [...] "of giving Fred a little surprise. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he’d <b>do</b> <b>if</b> I said they might marry this autumn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|GLORIA. I {{have only}} this to say. You dragged {{me down to}} your level for a moment this afternoon. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> that had ever {{happened}} before, that I {{should not have been}} on my guard---that I should not have known what was coming, and known my own miserable weakness? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A chap what {{knows all}} about p’isons," [...] {{continued}} the cook, [...] "p’isons what a man can take without knowing it in ’is grub. Would it be wrong, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> that friend I was speaking about {{put it in your}} food to put you out of your misery?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNYS Oh, well, {{they have}} to provide for them when they do come. That's fair enough division, I su- [Suddenly she turns fiercely.] Why do you talk like that? As if we women were cowards. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> God sent me a child I should grudge Him the price! ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. Of course it's ridiculous. Well, that's what my eyes tell me. (Gloria makes a {{movement}} of contemptuous protest.) No: I'm not flattering. I tell you I don't believe it. (She is ashamed to find that this does not quite please her either.) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to turn away in disgust from my weakness, I should sit down here and cry like a child? ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY (indignantly). We {{are not all}} the same, {{any more}} than <b>you</b> are. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I loved another man, I should pretend to go on loving my husband, or be afraid to tell him or all the world? But this woman is not made that way. She governs men by {{cheating}} them; and (with disdain) they like it, and let her govern them. (She sits down again, {{with her back to}} him.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have it--the rotten, insular conceit {{of these}} Englishmen! <b>You</b> <b>think</b> {{that she would}} not come? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I were to say to her,--'Come and listen while I make garlands of words, while I take you through the golden doors!'--do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{that she would not}} put her hand in mine? Fancy--to live in my fairy chamber, to listen while I give shape and {{substance}} to all that I conceive--what woman would refuse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is a frigate, certainly, Mr. Probert, {{and by the}} cut of her sails I {{should say}} a Frenchman. We are in an awkward fix. She has got the weather gage of us. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> we put up helm and ran due north, we should come out ahead of her?" ...|$|E
60|$|MANGAN. Pretending to be asleep! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I {{was only}} pretending that I'd have sprawled there helpless, {{and listened to}} such unfairness, such lies, such {{injustice}} and plotting and backbiting and slandering of me, if I could have up and told you what I thought of you! I wonder I didn't burst.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the escort}} of the Inkosazana," [...] he added. [...] "Do {{you think that}} she can take hurt among so many? And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> you dare to disobey the words of Dingaan, that you can escape so many? Go back new, lest they should come over and kill you where you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain frowned, {{with an air}} {{of angry}} impatience. [...] "I could excuse that poor negro, madam," [...] he said, [...] "when he made such a {{proposition}} to me, but I must say I did not expect anything of the kind from <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> even <b>if</b> we had a bishop with us, that I would propose to marry any woman in the world for the sake of making her what that fellow called the 'boss' of this party?" ...|$|R
5000|$|One day Broadis {{arrived late}} for {{training}}. Shankly's {{version of what}} he said to Broadis: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're <b>doing?</b> Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> the training we <b>do</b> <b>you</b> can train with us and we'll play five-a-side and you'll run your guts out as an example to everybody else".|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have the}} choice,' he said, 'of giving me half, or of my taking everything.' And then he swore with terrible oaths that unless his father signed the paper, that day should be his last. 'You {{are in my}} power,' he said, 'and I am desperate. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> three dead bodies are found in a house now any will trouble to inquire how they came to their end? They will be tossed into the plague-cart, and none will make inquiry about them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Son," [...] I said, while I {{pretended to}} chase coins in my penny pocket, [...] "doesn't it {{sometimes}} seem {{to you as}} if the city {{ought to be able}} to talk? All these ups and downs and funny business and queer things happening every day--what would it say, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> it could speak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The white figure stood motionless; but Verrian {{interpreted}} its {{quiet as}} a kindly intelligence, and the girl made a fresh start in a note a little more piteous than before. [...] "It's about the--the truth. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> sometimes we don't tell it exactly, but we wish we had very, very much, it will come round somehow the same {{as if we had}} told it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My poor {{husband was}} fond of old carving," [...] she {{explained}} modestly; [...] "what I know about it, I know from him. Dear Mr. Engelman, your room is a picture in itself. What glorious colors! How simple and how grand! Might we----" [...] she paused, with a becoming appearance of confusion. Her voice dropped softly to lower tones. [...] "Might we be pardoned, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> we ventured to peep into Mr. Keller's room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Dias, I {{hope they}} won't try {{anything}} of the sort. If anything should happen to you, I should not only be extremely sorry for your sake and your wife's, but it would destroy the last chance I have of carrying out my search for treasure. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I were {{to go to the}} consul and lay a complaint against them, on the ground, in the first place, of their attack on you, and now of burning your house, it would have any effect?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY (listlessly). Yes, like me. (With deep melancholy.) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> I {{only wanted}} those despatches for myself, I dare venture into {{a battle for}} them? No: if that were all, I should not {{have the courage to}} ask to see you at your hotel, even. My courage is mere slavishness: it is of no use to me for my own purposes. It is only through love, through pity, through the {{instinct}} to save and protect someone else, that I can do the things that terrify me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed? Odd, wasn't it? But {{you were}} saying that you thought I dropped from the sky. Why, I had been {{following}} you for five minutes before! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that? <b>If</b> I may take the liberty of asking, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come to be walking round Soho at such an hour with a little ragged boy?" ...|$|R
