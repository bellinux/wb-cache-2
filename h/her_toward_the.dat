Henry met <b>her</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end of World War II {{when they were}} working as medical {{personnel}} {{near one of the}} Nazi concentration camps. Over the years, she worked as a nurse {{in addition to being a}} housewife. The latest time period in which Abigail has been shown is 1982, when she was still married to Henry but looked a generation older than him (Janet Zarish); in 1984, she vanished without a trace despite Henry's best efforts to find her.
