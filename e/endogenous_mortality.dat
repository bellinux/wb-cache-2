40|$|Many {{developing}} countries are characterized by high and persistent inequality {{in the distribution of}} income. While a growing body of literature emphasizes differential fertility as a channel through which income inequality persists, this paper investigates differential child mortality- differences in the incidence of child mortality among different income groups- as a critical link in this regard. We incorporate both <b>endogenous</b> child <b>mortality</b> and <b>endogenous</b> fertility in an overlapping generations model. We demonstrate that differential child mortality and its interaction with differential fertility can generate an “income inequality trap ” where high risk of child death prevents poor households from adequately investing in education. Empirical evidence based on cross-country micro-data support differential child mortality as an important channel for the transmission of inequality, as predicted by the model. From a policy perspective, the results suggest that better access to child health-care may be a more promising way to reduce income inequality than providing incentives to lower the family size of poor households...|$|R

Using Mexican cohort data it addresses issues such as when elderly males retire, what are the incentives to retire provided by social security and how have they changed over time, {{what is the relationship}} between social security institutions and retirement behaviour, and the issue of sample-selection bias due to <b>endogenous</b> <b>mortality.</b> Population estimates of the retirement age from a censored regression show that the higher the educational skills of individuals the sooner they retire; by looking at changes in the retirement age over time it is found that it has increased for successive generations-as younger cohorts have a higher retirement age than older cohorts. These estimates are interpreted with caution as I suspect they might be affected by <b>endogenous</b> <b>mortality</b> selection. A weighted measure of retirement incentives that accounts for an informal sector is constructed to examine the financial gain from postponing retirement. Over time, these are reduced dramatically for younger cohorts after economic crises and contractions in real wages. When retirement outcomes are regressed on the measure of retirement incentives it is found that social security is important in determining retirement status; pension wealth is positively and strongly associated with the propensity to retire.

40|$|Although the {{economic}} growth literature {{has come a long}} way since the Solow-Swan model of the fifties, there is still considerable debate on the "real'' or "deep" determinants of growth. This paper revisits the question of what is really important for strong long-term growth by using a Binary Classification Tree approach, a nonparametric statistical technique that is not commonly used in the growth literature. A key strength of the method is that it recognizes that a combination of conditions can be instrumental in leading to a particular outcome, in this case strong growth. The paper finds that strong growth is a result of a complex set of interacting factors, rather than a particular set of variables such as institutions or geography, as is often cited in the literature. In particular, geographical luck and a favorable external environment, combined with trade openness and strong human capital are conducive to growth.

However, they typically treat fishing mortality as an exogenous parameter. Implicitly, this approach assumes that the supply of fishing effort is perfectly inelastic. That is, the supply curve of effort is vertical. Fishery modelers often run simulations for different values of fishing mortality, but his exercise also assumes vertical supply and simply explores a series of these curves as different scenarios. The seemingly innocuous assumption of vertical supply conflicts with a large body of empirical work on behavior of fishermen and fishing fleets. Economists and fisheries scientists consistently find that fishing behavior is responsive to economic opportunities over time and space as well as across target species. Accounting for this phenomenon requires that fishing <b>mortality</b> be made <b>endogenous.</b> This paper demonstrates an approach to endogenizing fishing mortality in life history models by allowing the fish stock in the previous period and other behavioral drivers to enter into the equation that predicts fishing effort in the next period. The paper discusses conditions under which the standard approach is approximately accurate and when <b>endogenous</b> fishing <b>mortality</b> dramatically alters model predictions. An empirical application to the Gulf of Mexico gag, a species of grouper, illustrates the importance of endogenizing fishing mortality.

The first part presents the method of decomposition {{of the difference between}} two demographic indicators (E. Kitagawa's method or methods from E. Arriaga, R. Pressat and J. Pollard). In the second part mortality development in Russia is analyzed by using methods that decomposed the value of demographic indicators in a given year. Mortality is divided into senescent and background component by using the Gompertz-Makeham formula and by using the logistic model. Afterwards, avoidable and unavoidable mortality and <b>mortality</b> due to <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous causes of death is analyzed. Hypotheses, set out in the introductory chapter, are verified by using different decomposition methods.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that fertility is positively correlated with infant mortality, and that a child`s chance of surviving to maturity increases {{with the level of}} nutrition, medical care, etc. received {{in the early stages of}} life. By modelling parental decisions as a problem of choice under uncertainty, the paper shows that fertility and infant mortality are most likely to move in opposite directions if, as implicitly assumed by existing economic theories, parents believe that there is nothing they can do to improve the survival chances of their own children. By contrast, if parents realize that those chances improve with the amount they spend for the health, nutrition, etc. of each child that they put into the world, then fertility and infant mortality may move in the same direction. Under such an assumption, the model has the strong policy implication that directly death-reducing public expenditures are most effective, but stimulate population growth, at low levels of development. By contrast, at high levels of development, such expenditures tend to crowd out parental expenditures, and are a factor in fertility decline.

Hospital mortality predictors were characterised as odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression. The impact of predictor variables on (log) total hospital-stay costs was determined using least squares regression. An alternate treatment-effects regression model estimated the mortality cost-effect as an <b>endogenous</b> variable. <b>Mortality</b> predictors (P ≤ 0. 0001, comparator: ICU ≥ 65 years, ventilated) were: ICU < 65 not-ventilated (OR 0. 014); ICU < 65 ventilated (OR 0. 090); ICU age ≥ 65 not-ventilated (OR 0. 061) and ward ≥ 65 (OR 0. 086); increasing injury severity score and increased Charlson comorbidity index of 1 and 2, compared with zero (OR 2. 21 [1. 40 to 3. 48] and OR 2. 57 [1. 45 to 4. 55]).

While climate-induced mortality increases demand for medical care, reduced income tends to lower health spending, particularly among the elderly. Moreover, we find that age-specific vulnerabilities to climate change considerably shape the effect on aggregate health care demand.

Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the association between <b>endogenous</b> testosterone and <b>mortality.</b> Data sources included MEDLINE (1966 to December 2010), EMBASE (1988 to December 2010), and reference lists. Eligible studies were published English-language observational studies of men that reported the association between endogenous testosterone and all-cause or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. A two-stage process was used for study selection. 1) Working independently and in duplicate, reviewers screened a subset (10 %) of abstracts. Results indicated 96 % agreement, and thereafter, abstract screening was conducted in singlicate. 2) All full-text publications were reviewed independently and in duplicate for eligibility. Reviewers working independently and in duplicate determined methodological quality of studies and extracted descriptive, quality, and outcome data. Of 820 studies identified, 21 were included in the systematic review, and 12 were eligible for meta-analysis [n = 11 studies of all-cause mortality (16, 184 subjects); n = 7 studies of CVD mortality (11, 831 subjects) ]. Subject mean age and testosterone level were 61 yr and 487 ng/dl, respectively, and mean follow-up time was 9. 7 yr. Between-study heterogeneity was observed among studies of all-cause (P <. 001) and CVD mortality (P = 0. 06), limiting the ability to provide valid summary estimates. Heterogeneity in all-cause mortality (higher relative risks) was observed in studies that included older subjects (P = 0. 020), reported lower {{testosterone levels}} (P = 0. 018), followed subjects for a shorter time period (P = 0. 010), and sampled blood throughout the day (P = 0. 030). Low endogenous testosterone levels are associated with increased risk of all-cause and CVD death in community-based studies of men, but considerable between-study heterogeneity, which was related to study and subject characteristics, suggests that effects are driven by differences between cohorts (e. g. in underlying health status).

40|$|Trabajo presentado en la 36 th Annual Larval Fish Conference, celebrada del 2 al 6 de julio de 2012 en Os (Noruega) The {{causes of}} {{mortality}} in early life stages (ELS) of fish are dynamic through time, space, ontogeny and species. Crossing these factors with exogenous and <b>endogenous</b> <b>mortality</b> sources, {{even for a}} single species, may be a task for a lifetime. There {{is a problem of}} scale in the analysis of critical mortality processes, as methods of study are fundamentally different between the pelagic phase, the settlement period and the benthic phase. This involved high research costs and likely a loss of synopticity. Reviews on mortality sources suggest that we have done nothing but drawing general drivers and processes, and quantified only a few of those in a reduced number of species. Research on fish ELS has been polarized towards pelagic stages. Whereas the paradigm says that the mortality during these stages is maximal, this does not always mean that the first year class strength is best predicted from variations on mortality at those stages. Mortality drivers and rates may change at a bottleneck defined by the need of many species to settle at the bottom. Around settlement, mortality rates may suffer several abrupt changes. If such events are not identified and the drivers understood, there is little hope for a successful prediction of recruitment variability. Methods of study change as a consequence of a shift in the spatial dimension of the problem. There are fundamental changes in trophism, predator fields and movement patterns. Further, density-dependence may add to the mortality equation. The transition between the pelagic realm and the settlement at a suitable habitat may not be rapid, and shared mortality sources between the pelagia and the benthic realm can coexist for a variable period. In species-rich areas such as tropical systems or the Mediterranean, partition of mortality sources or even the understanding of basic mechanisms become additionally complicated. Many unknowns concerning the mobility of fish around settlement are being resolved through new techniques based on otolith michrochemistry, tagging or inmunology. However, species and system-dependent characteristics may impede the study of mortality processes adequately.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of six independent chapters, {{besides the}} introduction and conclusions, {{with the common}} theme of optimal public policies in dynamic general equilibrium models with different kinds of distortions. Broadly speaking, the issues considered are: tax evasion, bureaucratic corruption, costs of tax collection and endogenous probability of survival. With financial repression being modeled via obligatory reserve requirements that banks in the economy need to hold, the second chapter analyzes whether financial repression {{can be explained by}} endogenous tax evasion. In this regard the chapter develops two dynamic monetary general equilibrium endogenous growth models. When calibrated to four southern European countries, we indicate that higher degrees of tax evasion emanating from higher corruption and lower penalty rates would result in financial repression as a welfare-maximizing outcome. The third chapter develops an overlapping generations monetary endogenous growth model characterized by tax evasion, and analyzes the effect of the nature of tax evasion on the growth maximizing policies. It is concluded that a growth-maximizing government has to take the behavioral nature of tax evasion into account, since failure to do so will lead to misalignment in not only fiscal but also monetary policies. In fact, the government is found to repress the financial sector more than the optimal level if it treats tax evasion as exogenous. The fourth chapter develops a dynamic general equilibrium overlapping generations monetary endogenous growth model of a financially repressed small open economy characterized by bureaucratic corruption, and uses it to analyze optimal policy decisions of the government following an increase in the degree of corruption. We find that increases in the degree of corruption should ideally result in a fall in seigniorage, as an optimal response of the benevolent government. In addition, higher degrees of corruption should also be accompanied with lower levels of financial repression. Chapter five develops a production-economy overlapping generations model characterized by financial repression, purposeful government expenditures and costly tax collection, to analyze whether ¯nancial repression {{can be explained by the}} cost of raising taxes. It is shown that costs of tax collection cannot produce a monotonic increase in the reserve requirements, what are critical, in this regard, are the weights the consumer assigns to the public good in the utility function and the size of the government. Chapter six analyzes the same issues as in the previous chapter, but in a monetary endogenous growth model. We show that higher costs of tax collection produce a monotonic increase in reserve requirements. Moreover, the government tends to rely more on indirect taxation, compared to direct taxation as costs of tax collection increase. The seventh chapter develops a simple monetary pure-exchange two-period overlapping generations model characterized by financial repression and <b>endogenous</b> <b>mortality.</b> The probability of survival of the young agents is assumed to depend upon the share of government expenditure on health, education and infrastructure. In this setting, we analyze the welfare-maximizing policy mix between explicit and implicit taxation for a benevolent government. We show that increases in the survival probability lead to an increase in the reliance on seigniorage as a welfare maximizing outcome. However, for our results to hold, the seigniorage tax base must be large enough for the benevolent planner to use the inflation tax. Each of the chapters aims to provide the theoretical underpinnings behind the design of optimal fiscal and monetary policies under tax evasion, bureaucratic corruption, costs of tax collection and endogenous probability of survival. With each of the models based on proper micro foundations and calibrated to match features of developing economies, the six independent papers attempt to broaden our understanding on public policies in the presence of commonly observed distortions that characterize the developing world.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{the most}} common severe autosomal recessive disorder among Caucasians and is caused by mutations of the chloride channel, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. Despite a markedly improved median survival many CF patients still die at a young age. The chronic lung disorder is the main cause of <b>mortality.</b> <b>Endogenous</b> and exogenous factors, which may contribute to the severity of the pulmonary disorder, are partly unknown. The autosomal recessive form of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA 1) is a rare salt-wasting disorder and is caused by mutations of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) genes. The pulmonary symptoms in PHA 1 have been described as mimicking those in CF. Genetic and clinical studies of these two diseases were the focus of this thesis. Paper I extended clinical data for two CFTR mutations, T 338 I and S 549 I. T 338 I conferred a more severe and S 549 I a milder phenotype, than previously reported. In paper II and III the phenotype and origin of two novel CFTR mutations, Y 109 C and 175 insT, are described. Y 109 C was associated with a milder form of CF. In study IV, examination of the mutational spectrum in the Swedish CF population was completed with the aim of preparing for a pilot study of neonatal screening. A third common gene deficiency, 3659 delC, was identified. Inclusion of deltaF 508, 394 delTT and 3659 delC in a gene test after an initial test for immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), would theoretically have detected practically all CF patients. The aim of paper V was to identify risk factors for progression of the pulmonary disorder in CF. The severity was partly predicted by the CFTR genotype. Patients with pancreatic sufficiency could be expected to have an almost normal long-term lung function, but an earlier diagnosis in this group is important. Negative risk factors included pancreatic insufficiency, chronic pseudomonas colonisation and diabetes. In study VI, of PHA 1 patients, mutations of the alpha-subunit of the ENaC were associated with prominent lung symptoms. However, no chronic lung disease with decline of lung function with age and development of bronchiectasis was observed as seen in CF...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} and evaluate the experience of poverty in an urban area during the period 1760 - 1835, using Oxford as a case study. Chapter 1 ofthe thesis reviews the current historiography on the subject and sets out the methodology {{and scope of the}} study. To fully capture the experience of poverty, a holistic approach is adopted; the poor are taken to be not just those receiving poor relief but all at the margin of subsistence, vulnerable for example to crisis episodes such as sickness. Chapter 2 examines the social and economic background in Oxford. It was found that, while atypical in being a university town, Oxford has much in common with other provincial centres of the period, with significant retailing and commercial functions, a sizeable middle-class and a large body of unskilled labour. To a certain degree, conclusions drawn from research on the city can thus be applicable to other English towns. Chapter 3 examines the numbers and composition of the poor in this period, using Poor Law and charity records from two Oxford parishes with particularly detailed information, St. Giles's and St. Clement's. In contrast to many rural areas, the numbers of those needing assistance in Oxford {{does not appear to have}} steadily increased between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, but fluctuated more according to trade cycles and periods of hardship such as bad weather. The proportion ofpeople receiving poor relief was roughly the same in 1835 as it was in 1760. The composition of the poor in Oxford was also different than in rural areas. There was no significant increase in the numbers of young families on relief, as historians have observed in the so-called 'Speenhamland' counties. Life-cycle types seem to have predominated: widows, the elderly and the very young, and some people could move in and out of poverty over the course of their lives. To some extent, there was an underlying level of background poverty present throughout the period, as indicated by the charity evidence, from which more acute cases of hardship could arise. Oxford may have been experiencing its own 'urban' type of poverty: one that was a product of the city's market-driven economy and less influenced by structural factors as in the countryside. Chapter 4 discusses how those in poverty managed to support themselves in Oxford. Work and the Poor Law were two of the most obvious expedients, but a number of other strategies were also available: endowed and subscription charity, friendly societies, credit, help from kin and neighbours, even petty crime and prostitution. Rarely though were these makeshift strands sufficient by themselves to support people. The amount of help given was generally small and access conditions could constrain supply. Many of the poor were thus forced to utilise several strategies to make ends meet. Different expedients were also employed according to different phases of poverty; credit for short-term crisis episodes, for example, the Poor Law or endowed charity for longer life-cycle conditions. The search for work and changes in circumstance also occasioned much mobility among the poor, the subject of Chapter 5. By using material from maniage registers, settlement examinations and the records of the University police, a picture of the migratory habits of the poor in Oxford was built up. In line with existing research for this period, it was found that distances travelled were generally short, with 70 per cent of people moving less than 20 km, and many immigrants to Oxford came from its immediate hinterland. There was though a significant degree of inter-urban migration; particularly to London. The actual patterns of migration were complex, with people not only moving in and out of the city, but often stopping off at several points in the way. Movement within Oxford itself was also common. A whole variety of causes seem to have prompted people to move; as well as work we can see kin, maniage, housing, even individual crises like a sudden bereavement. An underlying feature behind many moves again seems to be the life-cycle. People could move for workrelated reasons when young; to find larger housing when they married; perhaps even to a smaller dwelling in old age. The final chapter of the thesis looks at living standards among the poor in Oxford. After an examination of the research concerning this subject, the extent of any changes between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are investigated through an analysis ofinfant mortality in S 1. Clement's based on a family reconstitution. It was found that infant mortality in the parish fell from 270 per 1000 in the early eighteenth century to 169 per 1000 by 1800, though it then rose again slightly by 1837. This is in line with the general trend in urban areas at this time. Some ofthis improvement may have been caused by improved medical care at childbirth and reductions in the incidence of infectious disease, particularly smallpox. Conversely, changes in feeding practices and increased urbanisation in S 1. Clement's during the 1820 s and 1830 s may then have led to some deterioration in conditions. Nevertheless, infant mortality rates were still lower in 1837 than in the early eighteenth century, and much of the fall appears to be due to a decline in <b>endogenous</b> <b>mortality</b> (associated with the physical condition of the mother). There therefore may be some scope for suggesting a slight improvement in living standards among the poor, one that may have as its background the economic growth occurring in Oxford at the time.
