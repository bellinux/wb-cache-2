5|$|A core is a graph with no {{homomorphism}} to any proper subgraph. <b>Equivalently,</b> a core can {{be defined}} as a graph that does not retract to any proper subgraph.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{case of the}} clique-finding {{problem is}} finding a triangle in a graph, or <b>equivalently</b> determining whether the graph is triangle-free.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, <b>equivalently,</b> gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, <b>equivalently,</b> by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Convolve the {{pixelated}} {{image with}} a heat kernel to simulate its evolution under the heat equation {{for a short}} time step. The result is a Gaussian blur of the image, or <b>equivalently</b> the Weierstrass transform of the indicator function, with radius proportional to the square root of the time step.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus gracilis, {{the older}} species, {{is found in}} the Löwenstein Formation (Lower Norian). P.engelhardti stems from the upper Löwenstein Formation (Upper Norian), the Trossingen Formation (Upper Norian), and <b>equivalently</b> aged rock units. Plateosaurus thus lived {{probably}} from approximately 214 to 204 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The odd girth is, <b>equivalently,</b> the {{smallest}} odd number g {{for which there}} exists a homomorphism from the cycle graph on g vertices to G. For this reason, if G → H, then the odd girth of G is {{greater than or equal}} to the odd girth of H.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, which is the same as {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent column vectors. <b>Equivalently</b> it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.|$|E
5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal {{notation}} (<b>equivalently,</b> endless trailing 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly {{as in the}} special case considered. These numbers are exactly the decimal fractions, and they are dense.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{relating the}} two radial forces {{can be understood}} qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or <b>equivalently,</b> in angular momenta) causes {{a difference in the}} centripetal force requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{visualization}} of complex {{numbers in the}} complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers A and B, interpreted as points of the complex plane, is the point X obtained by building a parallelogram three of whose vertices are O, A and B. <b>Equivalently,</b> X is the point such that the triangles with vertices O, A, B, and X, B, A, are congruent.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or <b>equivalently</b> by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (<b>equivalently,</b> sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), {{but it can be}} transformed into a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. <b>Equivalently</b> (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or <b>equivalently,</b> the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or <b>equivalently</b> over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E
5|$|Other organothorium {{compounds}} are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH2C6H5), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C3H5)4, are known, {{but their}} structures {{have not been}} determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) they behave <b>equivalently</b> in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH3)4, is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands.|$|E
5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or <b>equivalently</b> when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
5|$|The pseudoarboricity of a graph G {{is defined}} by analogy to the arboricity as the minimum number of pseudoforests into which its edges can be partitioned; <b>equivalently,</b> it is the minimum k such that G is (k,0)-sparse, or the minimum k such that the edges of G can be {{oriented}} to form a directed graph with outdegree at most k. Due to the matroid structure of pseudoforests, the pseudoarboricity may be computed in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. <b>Equivalently,</b> we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Major-thirds tuning was {{introduced}} in 1964 by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt. He was studying with Gunther Schuller, whose twelve-tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher, ArnoldSchoenberg. Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of OrnetteColeman and JohnColtrane. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve-tones, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) tuning, Patt started using seven-string guitars in 1963, before settling on eight-string guitars with high G (<b>equivalently</b> A) as their highest open-notes. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of {{his work as a}} session musician after 1965 in New York. Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning.|$|E
5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} {{a pattern in}} which the cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to a pattern that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to a pattern that can <b>equivalently</b> be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Equivalently,</b> a {{subnormal}} {{series for}} which {{each of the}} A'i is a maximal normal subgroup of A'i+1. <b>Equivalently,</b> a composition series is a normal series for which each of the factor groups are simple.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} {{in the area of}} modern algebra known as group theory, a group is said to be perfect if it equals its own commutator subgroup, or <b>equivalently,</b> if the group has no nontrivial abelian quotients (<b>equivalently,</b> its abelianization, which is the universal abelian quotient, is trivial). In symbols, a perfect group is one such that G(1) = G (the commutator subgroup equals the group), or <b>equivalently</b> one such that Gab = {1} (its abelianization is trivial).|$|E

25|$|<b>Equivalently,</b> one {{can take}} the Stone space of the {{complete}} Boolean algebra of all subsets of X as the Stone–Čech compactification. This is really the same construction, as the Stone space of this Boolean algebra is the set of ultrafilters (or <b>equivalently</b> prime ideals, or homomorphisms to the 2 element Boolean algebra) of the Boolean algebra, {{which is the same}} as the set of ultrafilters on X.|$|E
25|$|Let X be a topological space. Then {{two points}} x and y in X are topologically {{distinguishable}} {{if they do}} not have exactly the same neighbourhoods (or <b>equivalently</b> the same open neighbourhoods); that is, {{at least one of them}} has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other (or <b>equivalently</b> there is an open set that one point belongs to but the other point does not).|$|E
