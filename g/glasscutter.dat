The famous Portland Vase was cut in Wordsley. One {{of the most famous}} glass designers was a Wordsley man, William Jabez Muckley. Another was John Northwood, and his son Harry C. Northwood who helped establish glassware in the USA [...] Yet another who established glassware in the USA was John Northwood's friend, Frederick Carder. One of the most accomplished <b>glasscutters</b> was George Woodall, whose campaign led to the building of the Wordsley School of Art. The 'Red House Glassworks', a 100-foot high glassmaking cone, survives and has recently been restored. Lead-crystal cut-glass from Wordsley's heyday is now rare and collectable. Glassworking continued in the area, albeit at a reduced scale, until the 1990s.|$|R
