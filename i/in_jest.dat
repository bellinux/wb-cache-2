25|$|Elwood Gordon Gee (born February 2, 1944) is an American {{academic}} {{and is currently}} serving his second term as President of West Virginia University. He {{has served as the}} chief executive at several universities in the United States, previously serving at Ohio State University. Gee had been heading an Ohio State-based think tank following his retirement from the Ohio State presidency on July 1, 2013. He retired in response to a series of controversies relating to comments he made, the last of which involved anti-Catholic comments allegedly made <b>in</b> <b>jest</b> about the University of Notre Dame. His resignation thus ended his second term as the president; he had previously served as president of Ohio State from 1990 to 1997.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{very little}} {{was known about}} Sun Ra's early life, and he contributed to its obscurity. As a self-invented person, he {{routinely}} gave evasive, contradictory or seemingly nonsensical answers to personal questions, and denied his birth name. He speculated, only half <b>in</b> <b>jest,</b> that he was distantly related to Elijah Poole, later famous as Elijah Muhammed, leader of the Nation of Islam. His birthday for years remained unknown, as he claimed it for years ranging from 1910 to 1918. Only {{a few years before}} his death, the date of Sun Ra's birth was still a mystery. Jim Macnie's notes for Blue Delight (1989) said that Sun Ra was believed to be about 75years old. But Szwed was able to uncover a wealth of information about his early life and confirmed a birth date of May 22, 1914.|$|E

25|$|The International Anthropomorphic Research Project, a team {{of social}} {{scientists}} from various disciplines led by Plante, Reysen, Roberts, and Gerbasi, has been collecting data on the furry fandom using numerous methodologies. Their 2016 publication collects several peer-reviewed and self-published studies into a single volume. Among their findings: The average adult furry is between 23–27 years of age, with more than 75% of adult furries reporting being 25 {{years of age or}} younger, and 88% of adult furries being under the age of 30. Minors {{were not included in the}} study for professional ethics reasons. Gender identity: 78-85% of furries identify as male, nearly 2% of furries identify as transgender, the remaining identify as female. Ethnicity: 83-90% of furries self-identify as White, with small minorities of furries self-identifying as Asian (2-4%), Black (2-3%), and Hispanic (3%). Furries' participation in other fandoms: 21% of furries consider themselves to be a , 44% consider themselves to be anime fans, and 11% consider themselves sport fans. Furries, as a group, are more politically liberal and less religious than the average American or other comparable fan groups such as anime fans, while still containing contentious groups such as neo-Nazis and alt-right activists whose affiliation is partly <b>in</b> <b>jest</b> and partly in earnest. Religion: 54% of furries self-identified as atheist or agnostic, 23% as Christian, 4% as Pagan, 2% as Wiccan, and the remainder identified with other religions. Approximately 70% of adult furries have either completed, or are currently completing post-secondary education.|$|E
500|$|Lampooning a {{controversy}} surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality, essayist Dennis Hans wrote a 2005 satirical {{piece for the}} National Catholic Reporter focusing on the marriage of Plankton and Karen. He remarked, <b>in</b> <b>jest,</b> that SpongeBob's sexual orientation was a lesser issue compared to the positive representation of Plankton's [...] "technosexuality". Hans identified instances where both Planktons were portrayed as a loving couple and joked: [...] "the subliminal message from SpongeBob's insidious creators... the technosexual lifestyle means bonding forever with your one true love".|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} {{explained in}} an interview that he was fascinated with the word [...] "fuck" [...] because of its different uses. He originally proposed the idea of a film about the word <b>in</b> <b>jest,</b> later realizing that the topic could fuel a documentary. The Observer quoted him as saying that he was entertained by the word [...] "fuck", and intrigued with the idea of examining how the word had been incorporated into popular culture. He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others enjoyed it, noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.|$|E

500|$|After {{the revelation}} {{in the closing}} minutes of [...] "The Bill", the {{character}} of the episode changes. The biggest changes come about in Watkins's Kevin and White's Anya. Kevin changes from a penny pincher referred to as [...] "the professor" [...] apparently <b>in</b> <b>jest</b> to a menacing criminal mastermind. Anya, initially reminiscent of Manuel of Fawlty Towers or a character from 'Allo 'Allo, faces criticism for taking her characterisation too far, allowing the writers, for one critic, to have their cake and eat it. The writers also acknowledge the plot's [...] "silliness" [...] in an almost-fourth-wall-breaking piece of dialogue, with Shearsmith's Archie declaring that the characters' plan [...] "was too elaborate".|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} this claim has been {{difficult}} to pin down with any certainty. John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably <b>in</b> <b>jest,</b> that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. In later years, McMasters has backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book [...] by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found [...] their flight was impossible, but [...] "One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality".|$|E
500|$|Lindow Man, {{also known}} as LindowII and (<b>in</b> <b>jest)</b> as Pete Marsh, is the {{preserved}} bog body of a man discovered in a peat bog at Lindow Moss near Wilmslow in Cheshire, North West England. The human remains were found on 1 August 1984 by commercial peat-cutters. Lindow Man {{is not the only}} bog body to have been found in the moss; Lindow Woman was discovered the year before, and other body parts have also been recovered. The find, described as [...] "one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 1980s", caused a media sensation. It helped invigorate study of British bog bodies, which had previously been neglected in comparison to those found in the rest of Europe.|$|E

6000|$|Under {{the happy}} {{influence}} of these improved circumstances every one went {{about the work}} of rendering their island home more comfortable, in good, almost in gleeful spirits. Phil Briant indulged <b>in</b> <b>jests</b> which {{a few hours ago}} would have been deemed profane, and Gurney actually volunteered the song of the [...] "man wot got his nose froze;" [...] but every one declined to listen to it, on the plea that it reminded them too forcibly of the cold of the early morning. Even the saturnine steward, Tarquin, looked less ferocious than usual, and King Bumble became so loquacious that he was ordered more than once to hold his tongue and to [...] "shut up." ...|$|R
500|$|Murray {{identifies}} {{himself as}} Scottish and British. His national identity {{has often been}} commented on by the media. While making a cameo appearance on the comedy show Outnumbered, Murray was asked whether he was British or Scottish, to which he responded [...] "Depends whether I win or not." [...] Much of the discussion about Murray's national identity began prior to Wimbledon 2006, when he {{was quoted as saying}} he would [...] "support whoever England is playing" [...] at the 2006 World Cup. English ex-tennis player Tim Henman confirmed that the remarks had been made <b>in</b> <b>jest</b> and were only in response to Murray being teased by journalist Des Kelly and Henman about Scotland's failure to qualify.|$|E
500|$|Topographer Reinhard Maack, {{who also}} {{discovered}} the White Lady rock painting at Brandberg, reported {{the presence of}} rock engravings {{in the area in}} 1921. A more thorough investigation was only conducted after David Levin studied the feasibility of farming in 1947. He rediscovered the spring but struggled to extract enough water to sustain his family and his herd. Slowly becoming obsessed with doubts about the capacity of the spring an Afrikaans-speaking friend began calling him David Twyfelfontein (David Doubts-the-spring) <b>in</b> <b>jest.</b> When Levin bought the land and registered his farm in 1948 he gave it the name Twyfelfontein. While commonly being translated as doubtful spring, a more accurate translation for the word twyfel is therefore [...] "questionable" [...] or [...] "uncertain".|$|E
500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, <b>in</b> <b>jest,</b> she said to me that she would like to know what a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E
