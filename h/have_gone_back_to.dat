5|$|Sri Lankan Tamils {{continue}} to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia. The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants. Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system. A Canadian government survey found that over 70% of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the legitimacy of their refugee claims.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E

25|$|The 80th {{floor of}} the {{original}} design was planned to be an observation deck, {{the first one in}} Miami. The complex was later redesigned as two 70-floor towers, with the main tower being all office space, hence taller. The shorter tower was to be all hotel space. The current design goes back to a single mixed-use tower with 80 floors on a large podium with the top floors being office space and the bottom being hotel or residential space. The observation deck {{can be seen in the}} schematic diagram. Two FECR published sources <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the floor count of 80 with the 1,010-foot design, and renderings of this design from 2009 show an observation deck, as well as the Metromover connection, in the blueprints.|$|E

500|$|Ned is {{informed}} that a deserter of the Night's Watch, Will, has been captured. Members of the Night's Watch are sworn never to desert their posts, upon penalty of death. Ned takes his sons to witness Will's execution. Will reports repeatedly {{that he saw}} White Walkers, but nobody believes him. The young man faces death bravely, admitting that he [...] "should <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Wall and warned them". Ned himself passes sentence and beheads him. When Bran asks his father about the ranger's talk of White Walkers, Ned dismisses it as a madman's ravings, insisting that the Walkers have been considered extinct for thousands of years.|$|E
500|$|Spencer was a {{difficult}} and hyperactive childâ€Š with poor school attendance. Raised as a Catholic, at nine years old he {{was placed in the}} care of Dominican nuns in the hope of transforming his behavior. Later in life he remarked, [...] "I never would <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> school if there had been any other way of learning to read the subtitles in the movies." [...] He became fascinated with motion pictures, watching the same ones repeatedly and then re-enacting scenes to his friends and neighbors. Tracy attended several Jesuit academies in his teenage years, which he claimed took the [...] "badness" [...] out of him and helped him improve his grades. At Marquette Academy he met future actor Pat O'Brien, and the pair began attending plays together, awakening Tracy's interest in the theatre.|$|E

2500|$|An EastEnders {{spokeswoman}} says: [...] "Joan {{had come}} to the end of her contract with the programme." [...] The character was written out of the serial after she was threatened with deportation for failing to renew her visa, making her last appearance on-screen in February 2000. Her exit has been described by journalist Danny Buckland as Josie's only decent storyline, but he adds [...] "even this belated plot was unrealistic". Hooley commented, [...] "There was no explanation about the visa problem. Also it is totally implausible that Josie would <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica without her daughter Kim." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quintus Publilius Philo {{positioned}} {{his army}} between Paleopolis and Neapolis to isolate them from each other. The Romans introduced an institutional novelty. Publilius Philo and Cornelius Lentulus should <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rome {{at the end}} of their term to make way for the consuls elected for the next year, who would continue the military operations. [...] Instead, their military command (but not their authority as civilian heads of the Republic) was extended until the termination of the campaigns with the title of proconsuls. In 326 BC two leading men of Naples, who were dissatisfied with the misbehaviour of the Samnite soldiers in the city, arranged a plot which enabled the Romans to take the city and called for renewed friendship with Rome. In Samnium the towns of Allifae, Callifae, and Rufrium were taken by the Romans. The Lucanians and the Apulians (from the toe of Italy) allied with Rome.|$|E
2500|$|Dexter filed {{a similar}} countersuit against Martin and Bernice on August 18, 2008, {{claiming}} they breached their duties to the King Center and their father's estate, misused assets {{belonging to the}} center and kept money that should <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the center and estate. Among the claims in the suit were that Martin improperly kept a $55,000 Lincoln Navigator SUV donated to the King Center for his own personal use, and that he [...] "commandeered a reception" [...] being held at the King Center and [...] "turned it into his own wedding reception." [...] Dexter claimed he made numerous attempts to get his siblings to stop such misuses of power but was unsuccessful. King III's lawyer, Jock Smith, denied the allegations as petty and misguided, and said the suit demonstrates Dexter King's misuse of power and his history of making poor decisions involving the Center without seeking proper input from his siblings.|$|E

He dropped out of college in the middle of his junior year to pursue music professionally, performing in local bars and working as a shoe salesman to make ends meet.
