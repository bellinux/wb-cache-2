2500|$|President Pohamba has {{declared}} a state of emergency across six northern districts, and has requested international assistance. [...] The Namibian state relief fund has been active in the region delivering water, food, tents and other supplies to flooded areas by helicopter and motorboat. [...] However it is hindered by a shortage of both aircraft and boats, and is running out of funding. [...] The Red Cross agencies in both Angola and Namibia have responded to the disaster. [...] The Angola Red Cross is distributing mosquito nets, water purification tablets and rehydration sachets and the Namibia Red Cross Society has been distributing chlorine tablets and promoting hygiene in the affected areas. [...] The World Health Organization has also responded with the delivery of five tonnes of health care kits and supplies of drinking water. [...] There are fears that the global financial crisis may limit the effectiveness of aid agencies who are already over-stretched across Africa. [...] Displaced persons camps have been established in Oshana, Oshikoto, Ohangwena and Omusati in Namibia and currently hold around 4,500 people although they are said to be overcrowded and lacking in fresh water and sanitaion provision. [...] The World Health Organisation has sent several healthcare teams into the area to train emergency personnel and to provide expertise in disease prevention. [...] The floods coincided with a visit to Angola by Pope Benedict XVI, who expressed solidarity with the flood victims and encouraged reconstruction efforts. [...] The Namibian national power company, NamPower, has donated food worth N$50,000 to those who have lost their homes in the areas near to Ruacana <b>Hydro-electric</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> which accounts for 70% of the country's electricity needs. [...] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an appeal for $1.3 million to fund relief operations to assist 20,000 people in Namibia.|$|E
