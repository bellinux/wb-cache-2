2500|$|On February 19, 2009, the IAEA {{reported}} that samples {{taken from the}} site revealed new traces of processed uranium. A senior UN official said additional analysis of the June find had found 40 more uranium particles, {{for a total of}} 80 particles, and described it as significant. He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to nuclear activity. The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top agency officials. Syria disputed these claims. According to Syria's IAEA representative Othman, {{there would have been a}} large amount of graphite had the building been a nuclear reactor. Othman continued, [...] "They found 80 particles in half a million tonnes of soil. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> use that figure to accuse somebody of building such a facility." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Morissette, {{the album}} {{features}} a [...] "nice cross-section" [...] of [...] "joy and levity" [...] {{similar to what}} is featured on her 2004 album, So-Called Chaos, and [...] " [...] kind of rock bottom, 'Holy shit, I am a broken woman' moment." [...] She said that the album features songs about her own personal relationships, explaining that writing about them is her favourite activity [...] "'cause it's the only thing I can really comment on {{with any kind of}} conviction or authority." [...] The album incorporates themes involving both personal and political conflict, and Morissette explained that [...] "Our emotions align themselves with larger symptomatic things in the world. We face a large war out there, but [...] more closely reflects the war in people's living rooms... the icy silence at home, versus the big cold war." [...] Morissette summarized the track [...] "Moratorium" [...] as being [...] "essentially a song about my readiness to stop repeating bad patterns. I've kicked some of those in my life." [...] She said of [...] "Not as We", [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> resist hitting rock bottom for a long time? That song just goes 'OK, I'm going. All the way down'". [...] "Underneath" [...] is about breakdowns in communication.|$|E

When are you going to start to demand of yourself what I demand of myself? When {{are you going to be}} as uncompromising with what you do as I am uncompromising in what I hear and what I insist on? When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day.

You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know—a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is—they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.” ...|$|E
