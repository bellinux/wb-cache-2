However, currently <b>data</b> <b>release</b> by governments is still novel {{and there is little}} experience and knowledge thus far about its benefits, costs and barriers.

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{magnitude}} {{tabular data}} and microdata masking {{have been treated}} as two independent problems. An increasing number of government agencies are exploring establishing remote data access centers where both types of <b>data</b> <b>release</b> may occur. We argue that in these cases, consistency across both types of <b>data</b> <b>release</b> becomes an important component {{in the assessment of}} the performance of a certain masking and a common approach to the problem of masking both tabular and microdata would produce better results than approaches that address the two problems separately. Along this line, in this study we investigate the efficacy of using a model based microdata masking method (specifically Data shuffling) when the data is also used for magnitude tabular <b>data</b> <b>release.</b> We identify some aspects of our proposal that are important in addressing this issue further to perform a comprehensive evaluation of techniques suitable for both microdata and magnitude tabular <b>data</b> <b>release...</b>|$|R

Our primary contribution is a computationally efficient reduction from differentially private <b>data</b> <b>release</b> for a class of counting queries, to learning thresholded sums of predicates from a related class. We instantiate this general reduction {{with a variety of}} algorithms for learning thresholds. These instantiations yield several new results for differentially private <b>data</b> <b>release.</b> As two examples, taking 0, 1 ^d to be the data domain (of dimension d), we obtain differentially private algorithms for: (*) Releasing all k-way conjunctions.

(*) Releasing a (1 -γ) -fraction of all parity queries. For any γ≥(1 /d), the algorithm has bounded error as long as the database is of size at least (d). The running time is polynomial in the database size. Several other instantiations yield further results for privacy-preserving <b>data</b> <b>release.</b> Of the two results highlighted above, the first learning algorithm uses techniques for representing thresholded sums of predicates as low-degree polynomial threshold functions.
