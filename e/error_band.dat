40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new <b>error</b> <b>band</b> model, the statistical simulation error model, for describing the positional error of line features by incorporating both analytical and simulation methods. In this study, line features include line segments, polylines, and polygons. In existing error models, {{an infinite number}} of points on the line segment are considered as the stochastic variables and the <b>error</b> <b>band</b> of a line segment is obtained from the union of all intermediate points on the line segment, while that of a polyline/polygon is obtained from the union of all error bands of the composite line segments. Our proposed <b>error</b> <b>band</b> model, however, regards the entire line feature (line segment/polyline/polygon) as the stochastic variable, instead of the infinite number of points on the line segment. Based solely on the statistical characteristics of the endpoints of the line feature and the predefined confidence level, our proposed error model is created by a simulation method that integrates a population of line segments/polylines/polygons computed from the entire solution set of the error model's defining equation. A comprehensive comparison of the proposed and existing <b>error</b> <b>band</b> models is carried out through both simulated and practical experiments. The experimental results show the following: (1) For line segments, the proposed standard statistically simulated <b>error</b> <b>band</b> matches that of existing error models (for example, the G-band). Further, it is found that a scaled G-band with a specific scale factor (e. g., √X 2 4 (σ)) matches the proposed statistically simulated <b>error</b> <b>band</b> with probability (1 -α) × 100 %. (2) For polylines and polygons, if we correlate the errors of all the endpoints of the polyline/polygon, there is a marked difference between the proposed statistically simulated <b>error</b> <b>band</b> and existing error bands. The reason for the difference is explained as follows. The existing error model defines the <b>error</b> <b>band</b> of a polyline/ polygon as the union of all error bands of the composite line segments, thereby only accounting for the correlation between the two endpoints of each composite line segment. However, our proposed <b>error</b> <b>band</b> model considers the entire polyline/polygon as a whole by accounting for the variance-covariance matrix of all vertices of the polyline/polygon when constructing the statistically simulated <b>error</b> <b>band.</b> Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} is presented {{for determining the}} performance of three-point mounted implement guidance systems. A test track with tractor ramp, implement ramp, sine wave, and curve path shapes {{was used as the}} desired path to guide the tractor and implement, and as a reference location for measuring implement positional errors. Potentiometers were used with mechanical frames to measure the tractor and implement positional errors (lateral displacement between the intended and actual travel paths). An optoelectronic sensor triggered acquisition of data from all sensors at known locations [15. 2 cm (6 in.) intervals] along the track. The accumulated errors for the tractor and implement positional error transducers included components of calibration, orientation angle, and wobble. The estimated accumulated errors for the tractor positional error transducer and implement positional error transducer were 0. 91 cm (0. 36 in.) and 0. 99 cm (0. 39 in.), respectively. The percentages of implement positional errors within an acceptable <b>error</b> <b>band</b> provide more relevant information for producers in row-crop agricultural situations than means, ranges and standard deviations. Tests were conducted with an articulated implement guidance system on fields with 0 % side slope and fields with 5 % side slopes at travel speeds of 4. 8 and 8. 0 km/h (3 and 5 mph). The tractor guidance system kept at least 70 % of the tractor positional errors within a ± 3 cm (± 1. 2 in.) <b>error</b> <b>band</b> except on the curve on the field with 0 % side slope at 4. 8 km/h (3. 0 mph). When the <b>error</b> <b>band</b> was widened to ± 5 cm (± 2 in.), the tractor guidance system controller kept 94 % of the tractor positional errors within the allowable <b>error</b> <b>band</b> on the curve on the field with 0 % side slope at 4. 8 km/h, and 100 % of the tractor positional errors within the allowable <b>error</b> <b>band</b> for all other test combinations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a new contour-coding {{technique}} for object-oriented video coding is proposed. In our approach, the two-stage motion compensation technique is considered, {{in order to}} cope with the rather complex motion of the object. While the object-based motion compensation is performed in the first stage, the second-stage motion compensation is carried out to search the best match of the contours, which are not motion compensated in the first stage. Also, by introducing the notion of the <b>error</b> <b>band,</b> the current contours can be properly fitted to the motioncompensated contours using the interframe relationship of the contours. In addition, an efficient {{technique for}} encoding the contours, simplified by the majority filter, is also proposed. From the simulation result, it is shown that the proposed technique provides better performance than the content-based arithmetic encoding, especially when lossy encoding is allowed. Moreover, by varying the width N of the <b>error</b> <b>band,</b> it is shown that the bit amount for the shape information can be adjusted according to the channel condition.
