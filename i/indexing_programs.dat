50|$|The {{position}} of a diffraction peak is 'independent' of the atomic positions within the cell and entirely determined by {{the size and shape}} of the unit cell of the crystalline phase. Each peak represents a certain lattice plane and can therefore be characterized by a Miller index. If the symmetry is high, e.g.: cubic or hexagonal it is usually not too hard to identify the index of each peak, even for an unknown phase. This is particularly important in solid-state chemistry, where one is interested in finding and identifying new materials. Once a pattern has been indexed, this characterizes the reaction product and identifies it as a new solid phase. <b>Indexing</b> <b>programs</b> exist to deal with the harder cases, but if the unit cell is very large and the symmetry low (triclinic) success is not always guaranteed.|$|E
50|$|Keyword {{stuffing}} {{involves the}} calculated placement of keywords within a page {{to raise the}} keyword count, variety, and density of the page. This is useful to make a page appear to be relevant for a web crawler {{in a way that}} makes it more likely to be found. Example: A promoter of a Ponzi scheme wants to attract web surfers to a site where he advertises his scam. He places hidden text appropriate for a fan page of a popular music group on his page, hoping that the page will be listed as a fan site and receive many visits from music lovers. Older versions of <b>indexing</b> <b>programs</b> simply counted how often a keyword appeared, and used that to determine relevance levels. Most modern search engines have the ability to analyze a page for keyword stuffing and determine whether the frequency is consistent with other sites created specifically to attract search engine traffic. Also, large webpages are truncated, so that massive dictionary lists cannot be indexed on a single webpage.|$|E

Recently {{released}} powder <b>indexing</b> <b>programs</b> {{are reviewed}} {{and placed in}} competition with the established programs (ITO, TREOR, DICVOL, etc.) {{through a series of}} problems selected among previously unindexed ICDD entries designated as “high quality”. Benchmarks are provided for testing <b>indexing</b> <b>programs,</b> based on the bethanechol chloride powder diffraction data. Applying these benchmarks leads to a classification (with respect to this specific example) of <b>indexing</b> <b>programs</b> as they face progressively more difficult situations. High data quality and the user experience to obtain it are concluded to remain the best way to indexing success, given that nearly all programs produce excellent results with excellent data. Lack of attention to data quality, even if followed by use of the most efficient programs, will usually lead to failure. It is demonstrated how not restricting oneself to a single indexing program can considerably increase the chances of success...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: The recent {{explosion}} {{of interest in}} mining the biomedical literature for associations between defined entities such as genes, diseases and drugs has made apparent the need for robust methods of identifying occurrences of these entities in biomedical text. Such concept-based indexing {{is strongly dependent on}} the availability of a comprehensive ontology or lexicon of biomedical terms. However, such ontologies are very difficult and expensive to construct, and often require extensive manual curation to render them suitable for use by automatic <b>indexing</b> <b>programs.</b> Furthermore, the use of statistically salient noun phrases as surrogates for curated terminology is not without difficulties, {{due to the lack of}} high-quality part-of-speech taggers specific to medical nomenclature. Results: We describe a method of improving the quality of automatically extracted noun phrases by employing prior knowledge during the HMM training procedure for the tagger. This enhancement, when combined with appropriate training data, can greatly improve the quality and relevance of the extracted phrases, thereby enabling greater accuracy in downstream literature mining tasks.

However, only Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) and Citrus dwarfing viroid (CDVd) {{have been reported in}} this crop in Brazil. The aim of our work was to identify and characterize viroids infecting plants of ‘Navelina ISA 315 ’ sweet orange cultivar grafted on ‘Rangpur ’ lime from field experiments located in Bebedouro, SP, that showed gumming in the bark and wood symptoms. Biological indexing was done on the indicator host ‘Clemelin 1120 ’ tangor plants that reacted with typical gumming symptoms. Viroid infection was assessed by graft-inoculation of buds from the field trees on ‘Etrog ’ citron plants grafted on ‘Rangpur ’ lime, followed by RNA extraction and sPAGE analysis. RNAs were subjected to RT-PCR with primers for citrus viroids. The full-length amplified products were sequenced and compared to those available in the GenBank. The trees were found to be infected with cachexia (Ca) variants of HSVd-Ca or HSVd-Ca plus CDVd.

The capabilities described here relate to Release 2013 products. The Powder Diffraction File has been published since 1941. The file itself was part of a system developed for phase identification and chemical analysis and was intimately integrated with a classification and indexing system (Hanawalt et al., 1936, 1938). The indexing and phase identification system was called the Hanawalt method, named after one of the original inventors of the system, and has been in continuous use since 1941. Up until the 1940 ’s, many scientists had collected reference data into databases. It was the development of the system that led to accurate phase identification.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{reliability}} and sensitivity of {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) in the detection of ilarvirus (isometric labile ringspot virus) subgroup B and prune dwarf virus (PDV) isolates in Prunus and Malus species has been well established. To use this technique in large scale virus <b>indexing</b> <b>programs</b> more information was required on the reactions of commercially available antisera against {{the wide range of}} naturally occurring ilarvirus isolates. Specifically, information was required to determine whether an antiserum, or a group of antisera, exists that will detect the entire spectrum of ilarvirus subgroup B and PDV isolates (here-after referred to as ILAR-b type isolates) in ELISA tests. In this thesis 44 isolates of ILAR-b have been tested by ELISA using eleven antisera prepared against isolates of this group. The virus isolates used were collected by previous workers in 12 states and four countries from a multitude of hosts, and cover a wide range of the isolates originally referred to by R. W. Fulton (1968) as ILAR viruses. Six of the antisera used were commercially available. Only three of the 44 isolates reported to be the ILAR-b type were not detected by any of the eleven antisera used. Those isolates detected by ELISA fell into three of the serogroups originally described by Fulton for this type of virus, namely a necrotic ringspot virus (NRSV) serogroup, an apple mosaic virus (ApMV) serogroup, and a prune dwarf virus (PDV) serogroup. Other serogroups described for ilarviruses were not used in this research. In these ELISA tests, the ability to detect a virus isolate in one serogroup using antisera of another serogroup was quite poor, whereas within-group detection was fairly uniform for all isolate-antiserum combinations. A mixture of the best antisera of each serogroup was able to detect all isolates previously detected individually by the three separate antisera. Bioassays employing Chenopodium quinoa and Cucumis sativus, detected ILAR-b isolates in young spring tissue of Malus and Prunus sp. with reliability about equal to ELISA. ELISA, however, was far more efficient (space, material, and time-wise) and proved more sensitive {{over an extended period of}} the growing season. It is hoped that the research results presented will: 1. Document those strains of ILAR-b type viruses that can be detected by ELISA using the presently available antisera. 2. Facilitate increased use of ELISA in virus certification programs...|$|E

The project builds on insights from our recent work in DGP, which has investigated both programming techniques (including reasoning about generic programs, and using them to capture design patterns precisely), and language mechanisms (particularly lightweight approaches: patterns for simulating highly-expressive techniques in familiar but apparently less-expressive languages). Firstly, these lightweight techniques, which we have been embedding in Haskell’s still relatively expressive type system, are in fact applicable to even less expressive but more popular mainstream languages such as Java and C#. Secondly, the techniques are more applicable than we first thought; in particular, they offer {{a solution to the}} so-called ‘expression problem’: safe combination of independent extensions along multiple dimensions. Thirdly, there is a synergy between DGP and IP: DGP makes IP more appealing, because the effort of stating properties can be amortized over more programs; IP provides a mechanism for DGP, because the indices can be representations of data’s shape. ...|$|R
