40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} realistic actuator constraints on the potential performance of a <b>hydraulic</b> active <b>suspension</b> system. The optimal control force, requested by an independent vehicle-level control law, can often not be generated by the hydraulic actuator due to physical constraints, resulting in a significant reduction of the suspension performance. Specifically preview-based vehicle-level control laws are considered, since they could, theoretically, result in a strong performance improvement. An innovative vehicle-level control law, based on hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC), is proposed to improve the performance of such a constrained <b>hydraulic</b> active <b>suspension.</b> Based on a simulation analysis, the performance of both control strategies is evaluated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>hydraulic</b> active <b>suspension</b> {{systems have}} certain {{nonlinear}} and time-varying behaviors. It {{is difficult to}} establish an appropriate dynamic model for model-based controller design. Here a novel neural network based sliding mode control is proposed by combining {{the advantages of the}} adaptive, radial basis function neural network and sliding mode control strategies to release the model information requirement. It has on-line learning ability for handling the system time-varying and nonlinear uncertainty behaviors by adjusting the neural network weightings and/or radial basis function parameters. It is implemented on a quarter-car <b>hydraulic</b> active <b>suspension</b> system. The experimental results show that this intelligent control approach effectively suppresses the oscillation amplitude of sprung mass in response to road surface disturbances...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two {{simulations of}} a heavy hybrid vehicle, {{the first part of}} the thesis is focused on the specifications of the vehicle designed in accordance with the requirements based on the literature study of the soils where the vehicle will travel. The second part presents the study of the vehicle through two simulations. The first simulation is oriented on the dynamical behavior of the vehicle. The second simulation focuses on the energy management of the vehicle. The presented thesis is a multi-disciplinary study, combining knowledge on vehicle dynamics, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>suspensions</b> and hybrid systems. The dynamical simulation of the vehicle has been performed with Matlab/Simulink and the third party program Delft-Tire for the tire modelling. Specials features of Matlab have been used; SimMechanics for the modelling of the parts, links and joints of the vehicle, and SimHydraulics for the modelling of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The principal tests performed on the vehicle by the dynamical simulation are the tests defined by the NATO - STANAG standards as AVTP 03 - 170. The tests are a crossing obstacle test and different sine wave roads. The obstacle of the obstacle crossing test is an APG- 10 obstacle, an 10 inch high step with vertical edges. The objective of this simulation is to verify the design of the suspension and to observe the forces created in each link of the suspension system in order to design the chassis and the suspension system. The sine wave driving tests are performed to highlight the influence of the different hydraulic connections. Finally the slalom test presents the influence of the hydraulic anti-roll bar. The results show that the vehicle suspension verifies the STANAG standard. The results show also that the forces applied at the wheel by the obstacle crossing defined in the AVTP 03 - 170 are directly related to the diameter and the stiffness of the tire. The maximum forces encountered at the wheel corresponds to 2. 5 G vertically and 1. 5 G longitudinally. The sine wave driving and the slalom test are showing the benefits and the need for advanced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The second simulation is the modelling of the hybrid power management of the vehicle. The simulation has been performed with the objectives to create a tool for sizing series hybrid powertrain. This simulation has also been performed with Matlab/Simulink and the Simscape Library. The tool created show that when, the vehicle is equipped with 150 kW of power generation and 300 kW of battery would be able to drive at a constant speed of 10 km/h with the terrain inputs evaluated from the literature study, but to create sufficient result the input parameters of the tools need to have a better definition...|$|R

The hydraulic model and the multibody model exchange forces and displacements at the joint points: one between actuator and sprung mass (chassis) and the other one between actuator and unsprung mass (front axle and wheels). Experimental test have been performed (suspension leveling maneuvers, tests on ISO 50008 track, bump tests) and the results of the numerical model have been compared with the experimental data, allowing the understanding of the influence of the numerous design and control parameters involved in the determination of the vehicle dynamic behaviour. The influence of mechanical and geometrical parameters on the damping force hysteresis measured during levelling test are shown and described.
