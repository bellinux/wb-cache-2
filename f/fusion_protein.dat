Thus, if a fusion between two proteins occurs twice in evolution (either between paralogues within the same species or between orthologues in different species) but in a different order, the resulting fusion proteins will be related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking <b>fusion</b> <b>protein,</b> etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
25|$|If {{fluorescence}} {{is detected}} when the fusion proteins are expressed, but is lacking or significantly reduced after {{the expression of}} the mutated negative control, it is likely that a specific interaction occurs between the two target proteins of interest. However, if the fluorescence intensity is not significantly different between the mutated negative control <b>fusion</b> <b>protein</b> and its wild-type counterpart, then the fluorescence is likely caused by non-specific protein interactions, so a different combination of <b>fusion</b> <b>protein</b> conformations should be tested.|$|E

30|$|The folding, stability, {{proteolytic}} {{sensitivity and}} function of <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> might {{be affected by the}} AA composition and the flexibility/rigidity and length of the peptide linkers.

Analyses of linker stability toward proteolysis and the cellulose-binding activity and lipase activity of the <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> were conducted; the results revealed that <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> with shorter linkers (4 – 16 AA residues) were more stable against proteolysis but had slightly lower cellulose-binding capacities than those containing longer linkers.

40|$|We studied <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> {{between the}} human {{adenosine}} A 1 receptor and different 351 Cys-mutated Gi 1 α-subunits (A 1 -Giα) {{with respect to}} two important concepts in receptor pharmacology, i. e. allosteric modulation and constitutive activity/inverse agonism. The aim of our study was twofold. We first analysed whether such fusion products are still subject to allosteric modulation, and, secondly, we investigated the potential utility of the <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> to study constitutive receptor activity. We determined the pharmacological profile of nine different A 1 -Giα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> in radioligand binding studies. In addition, we performed [35 S]GTPγS binding experiments to study receptor and G protein activation of selected A 1 -Giα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins.</b> Compared to unfused adenosine A 1 receptors, the affinity of N 6 -cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) at wild-type A 1 -Giα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> (351 Cys) increased more than eightfold, while the affinity of 1, 3 -dipropyl- 8 -cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) did not change significantly. Furthermore, we showed that the allosteric enhancer of agonist binding, PD 81, 723 (2 -amino- 4, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -thienyl-[3 -(trifluoromethyl) -phenyl]methanone), elicited similar effects on ligand binding; i. e. CPA binding to the A 1 -Giα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> was enhanced, whereas the affinity of DPCPX was hardly affected. Moreover, sodium ions were unable to decrease agonist binding {{to the majority of}} the A 1 -G iα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins,</b> presumably because they exhibit their effect through uncoupling of the R-G complex. From [35 S]GTPγS binding experiments, we learned that all the A 1 -Giα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> tested had a higher basal receptor activity than the unfused adenosine A 1 receptor, thereby providing improved conditions to observe inverse agonism. Moreover, the maximal CPA-induced stimulation of basal [35 S]GTPγS binding was increased for the five A 1 -Giα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> tested, whereas the inhibition induced by 8 -cyclopentyltheophylline (CPT) was more pronounced at 351 Cys, 351 Ile, and 351 Val A 1 -G iα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins.</b> Thus, the maximal receptor (de) activation depended on the amino acid at position 351 of the Gi α-subunit. In conclusion, A 1 -Giα <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins,</b> especially with 351 Cys and 351 Ile, can be used as research tools to investigate inverse agonism, due to their increased readout window in [35 S]GTPγS binding experiments. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is {{commonly}} used to promote the solubility of its fusion partners. To investigate the mechanism of solubility enhancement by MBP, we compared the properties of MBP <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> refolded in vitro {{with those of the}} corresponding <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> purified under native conditions. We fused five aggregation-prone passenger proteins to 3 different N-terminal tags: His₆-MBP, His₆-GST and His₆. After purifying the 15 <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> under denaturing conditions and refolding them by rapid dilution, we recovered far more of the soluble MBP <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> than their GST- or His-tagged counterparts. Hence, we can reproduce the solubilizing activity of MBP in a simple in vitro system, indicating that no additional factors are required to mediate this effect. We assayed both the soluble <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> and their TEV protease digestion products (i. e., with the N-terminal tag removed) for biological activity. Little or no activity was detected for some <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> whereas others were quite active. When the MBP <b>fusions</b> <b>proteins</b> were purified from E. coli under native conditions they were all substantially active. These results indicate that the ability of MBP to promote the solubility of its fusion partners in vitro sometimes, but not always, results in their proper folding. We show that the folding of some passenger proteins is mediated by endogenous chaperones in vivo. Hence, MBP serves as a passive participant in the folding process; passenger proteins either fold spontaneously or with the assistance of chaperones...|$|R
40|$|Targeted cancer therapy {{concepts}} often aim at {{the induction}} of adjuvant antitumor immunity or stimulation of tumor cell apoptosis. There is further evidence that combined application of immune stimulating and tumor apoptosis-inducing compounds elicits a synergistic antitumor effect. Here, we describe the development and characterization of bifunctional <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> consisting of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domain derived from the CD 40 -specific monoclonal antibody G 28 - 5 that is fused to the N-terminus of stabilized trimeric soluble variants of the death ligand TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). As shown before by us and others for other cell surface antigen-targeted scFv-TRAIL <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins,</b> scFv:G 28 -TRAIL displayed an enhanced capacity to induce apoptosis upon CD 40 binding. Studies with scFv:G 28 <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> of TRAIL mutants that discriminate between the two TRAIL death receptors, TRAILR 1 and TRAILR 2, further revealed that the CD 40 binding-dependent mode of apoptosis induction of scFv:G 28 -TRAIL is operable {{with each of the}} two TRAIL death receptors. Binding of scFv:G 28 -TRAIL <b>fusion</b> <b>proteins</b> to CD 40 not only result in enhanced TRAIL death receptor signaling but also in activation of the targeted CD 40 molecule.
