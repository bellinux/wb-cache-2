Specifically, two classes of design <b>representations</b> (i. e., <b>direct</b> <b>representations</b> and generative representations) were used to minimize the total weight and the maximum horizontal displacement of steel structural systems in tall buildings. In the reported experiments, the Strength-Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 was used to determine the shapes of Pareto fronts for this two-objective design optimization problem and the impact of the design representation on the results produced. The obtained results have shown that the type of the design representation has {{a significant impact on the}} shape and location of the Pareto front in this complex problem domain. Generally, <b>direct</b> <b>representations</b> produce Pareto fronts with better coverage (spread) than generative representations. Generative representations, however, produce additional regions of the Pareto front which cannot be found using <b>direct</b> <b>representations.</b> I...|$|R

25|$|The {{impossibility of}} the {{physical}} presence of the monarch was replaced by viceroys, the post of viceroy the <b>direct</b> <b>representation</b> of the monarch. The functions of the viceroy were: governor, captain general, president of the Audiencia, superintendent of the Royal Treasury and vicepatronage of the Church. Thus, the territories of the viceroyalties emerged to affirm {{the authority of the}} king in a specific territory. The territory which comprised the viceroyalty was divided in provinces —also called governorates— headed by the governor. In the 16th century the Spanish overseas territories were divided in two viceroyalties: New Spain (1535) for North America, Antilles, the Philippines and Venezuela, and Peru (1542) for South America, which was divided in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina {{was one of}} the {{original}} thirteen states of the United States. European exploration of the area began in April 1540, with the Hernando de Soto expedition, who unwittingly introduced new Eurasian diseases that decimated the local Native American population, because they lacked any immunity. In 1663 the English Crown granted land to eight proprietors of what became the colony. The first settlers came to the Province of Carolina at the port of Charleston in 1670; they were mostly wealthy planters and their slaves coming from the British Caribbean colony of Barbados. They started to develop their commodity crops of sugar and cotton. Pushing back the Native Americans in the Yamasee War (1715–17), colonists next overthrew the proprietors' rule, seeing more <b>direct</b> <b>representation.</b> In 1719, the colony was officially made a crown colony; North Carolina was split off and made into a separate colony in 1729.|$|E
25|$|XML and its {{extensions}} have regularly {{been criticized}} for verbosity and complexity. Mapping the basic tree model of XML to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult, especially when XML is used for exchanging highly structured data between applications, which was not its primary design goal. However, XML data binding systems allow applications to access XML data directly from objects representing a data structure of the data in the programming language used, which ensures type safety, rather than using the DOM or SAX to retrieve data from a <b>direct</b> <b>representation</b> of the XML itself. This is accomplished by automatically creating a mapping between elements of the XML schema XSD of the document and members of a class to be represented in memory. Other criticisms attempt to refute the claim that XML is a self-describing language (though the XML specification itself makes no such claim). JSON, YAML, and S-Expressions are frequently proposed as simpler alternatives (see Comparison of data serialization formats); that focus on representing highly structured data rather than documents, which may contain both highly structured and relatively unstructured content. However, W3C standardized XML schema specifications offer {{a broader range of}} structured XSD data types compared to simpler serialization formats and offer modularity and reuse through XML namespace.|$|E

From that time, Buddhist art diversified and evolved as it adapted to the new countries where the faith was expanding. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and Islam.|$|R

500|$|It is {{immediately}} noticeable that {{the poem is}} written in a vernacular English.

The speech is not a <b>direct</b> <b>representation</b> of any single dialect, but it serves to give a very clear effect of a working class English voice of the period. Note the [...] "taken of his buttons off", a deliberate error, to add to the stylised speech; it refers to the ceremony of military degradation, where the man to be executed is formally stripped of any marks of rank, such as his stripes, or of significant parts of his uniform – the buttons bore the regimental crest.|$|E
500|$|This impasse was {{resolved}} through {{negotiations between the}} juntas and the Council of Castile, {{which led to the}} creation of a [...] "Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies" [...] on September 25, 1808. It was agreed that the kingdoms of the peninsula would send two representatives to this Central Junta, and that the overseas kingdoms would send one representative each. These kingdoms were defined as [...] "the viceroyalties of New Spain (Mexico), Peru, New Granada, and Buenos Aires, and the independent captaincies general of the island of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Chile, Province of Venezuela, and the Philippines." [...] This plan was criticized for providing unequal representation to Spanish America; nevertheless, throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809, the regional capitals elected candidates, whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general. Several important and large cities were left without <b>direct</b> <b>representation</b> in the Supreme Junta. In particular Quito and Chuquisaca, which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms, resented being subsumed in the larger Viceroyalty of Peru. [...] This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809, which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year. An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped.|$|E

500|$|The 1960s was {{a tumultuous}} {{era in the}} United States, and public {{interest}} in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth. Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as sit ins and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics. The ACLU {{played a central role}} in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as gay rights, prisoner's rights, abortion, rights of the poor, and the death penalty. Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade, to 104,000 in 1970. In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states. During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation tactics; it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving amicus briefs submitted to the Supreme Court) to <b>direct</b> <b>representation</b> of defendants when they were initially arrested. At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from [...] "disengaged and elitist" [...] to [...] "emotionally engaged".
