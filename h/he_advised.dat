5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E
5|$|Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, {{such as the}} ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited {{influential}} {{white men}} to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by James Gamble (of Procter & Gamble) and Thomas H. White (of White Sewing Machines). When Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute visited in 1912, <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> her {{of the importance of}} gaining support by white benefactors for funding. Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E

5|$|In 1935 Nalder {{reported}} after {{a survey}} of his province {{that there was a}} general lack of tribal cohesion. Governor-General Sir Stewart Symes at Khartoum had little interest in development of the south of Sudan and <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> the local officials that chiefs should have territorial rather than ethnic authority. In 1936 Mongalla and the Bahr al-Ghazal provinces were incorporated into the Equatoria province, with headquarters at Juba, with parts of Upper Nile province detached.|$|E
5|$|Martin Wolf, an {{economics}} leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested {{there may be}} advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been {{by far the biggest}} practitioner of competitive devaluation. Though <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> that rather than using protectionist measures which may spark a trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. <b>He</b> <b>advised</b> the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} {{the morale of the}} Muslim fighters.

5|$|The {{case was}} argued before Judge (and later President) William Howard Taft, who {{held that the}} federal court could not prevent the removal of {{officers}} by injunction. <b>He</b> <b>advised</b> the Republicans to seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts. Taft further opined that, should any federal question be raised in such proceedings, the officers could seek remedy in a federal court on appeal. The Republicans were encouraged by Taft's decision, which {{cleared the way for}} an appeal {{all the way to the}} federal Supreme Court if a federal question could be raised.|$|E
5|$|According to the Samyutta Nikaya, Koṇḍañña {{retired to}} {{the banks of the}} Mandakini Lake in the Chaddanta forest, said to be the abode of the paccekabuddhas. It was said that the 8000 {{elephants}} in the forest took turns to catering for his needs. Koṇḍañña only left once, to farewell Gautama Buddha. Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. <b>He</b> <b>advised</b> his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E
5|$|After {{overseeing}} {{the transfer of}} Richmond, Breckinridge joined Lee's forces at Farmville, Virginia, {{on the night of}} April 5 and remained there until April 7. He continued on to Danville, arriving on April 11 to discover that Lee had surrendered on April 9 and the Confederate cabinet had already fled to Greensboro, North Carolina. Arriving in Greensboro on April 13, <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> the cabinet that the remaining Confederate armies should be surrendered; only Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin disagreed. At Bennett Place, he assisted Joseph E. Johnston in his surrender negotiations with Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman later praised Breckinridge's negotiating skills, and the surrender terms agreed to were later rejected by Washington as too generous, forcing Sherman to offer the same terms as Grant had at Appomattox, which were accepted.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|Charles Harmison's {{older brother}} {{had moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother learned that the Parsons farm was for sale, and <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven children and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by its view of the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E

5|$|Diplomacy failed despite {{continuing}} pressure {{applied by}} the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a 7-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender {{of at least}} ten Greek mountain artillery batteries. Du Fournet was instructed not {{to use force to}} take possession of the batteries. The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. <b>He</b> <b>advised</b> the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, as well as the army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Shulgin was {{introduced}} to MDMA by {{a student in the}} medicinal chemistry group <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1912 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had had four children.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} revolutionaries, Heliade favored {{maintaining}} {{good relations with}} the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's suzerain power, hoping that this policy could help counter Russian pressures. As Sultan Abdülmecid I was assessing the situation, Süleyman Paşa was dispatched to Bucharest, where <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> the revolutionaries to carry on with their diplomatic efforts, and ordered the Provisional Government to be replaced by Locotenenţa domnească, a triumvirate of regents comprising Heliade, Tell, and Nicolae Golescu. Nonetheless, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into joining a clampdown on revolutionary forces, which resulted, during September, in the reestablishment of Regulamentul Organic and its system of government. Together with Tell, Heliade sought refuge at the British consulate in Bucharest, where they were hosted by Robert Gilmour Colquhoun in exchange for a deposit of Austrian florins.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths <b>he</b> <b>advised</b> them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. He noted when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer Batten, who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E
