40|$|Following {{generally}} accepted axioms and assumptions the authors developed a phenomenological, thermodynamically consistent material model for large anisotropic elastoplastic deformations {{based on a}} substructure concept. The material model originally includes a stress relation in rate formulation, evolutional equations for the internal variables modeling the hardening behavior, and the yield condition. Due to the necessary time discretization solving the initial value problem (IVP) this approach is associated with an incremental stress computation. It will be shown that, within this context, the accuracy of stress values essentially deteriorates with increasing load steps. Consequently, the authors substitute the usual stress relation including the symmetric plastic strain tensor of right Cauchy-Green type instead of the stress tensor into the set of unknown constitutive variables.

Its basic structure {{is found to be}} satisfactory. For the purpose of applications, the theory is recast in Eulerian form. Additionally, a novel three-factor multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient is employed to define a unique intermediate configuration. The resulting theory of finite plasticity contains an <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>tensor</b> measured from the intermediate stress-free configuration. The constitutive equations involve the objective stress rate of the rotated Cauchy stress, which can be expressed in terms of the rate of deformation tensor.

Because the Green-Naghdi theory has a strain measure that represents the difference between total strain and plastic strain, rather than representing elastic strain, it does not lend itself to a physically realistic linearization for the case of small elastic deformations accompanied by large plastic deformations. The proposed theory is well suited to describe this case as it can be linearized about the intermediate configuration while allowing the plastic deformations to be large.

We demonstrate that the presence of this incompatibility gives rise to an additional long-range contribution in the inhomogeneous part of the Landau energy functional and to the corresponding stress fields. Competition amongst the local and long-range interactions results in frustration in the evolving order parameter (elastic) texture.

40|$|Predicting the {{behaviour}} {{of structural}} components under {{a particular set}} of loading conditions requires knowledge of the residual <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> distribution throughout the bulk of these components. Characterising the 3 D strain state at any particular point involves the measurement of six independent components which make up the second order <b>strain</b> <b>tensor.</b> Mapping the complete strain distribution throughout large volumes thus presents significant practical challenges. One possible solution to this problem is to reconstruct the 3 D variation of strain components using tomographic techniques. The basic principle underpinning this idea is that the multi-component <b>strain</b> <b>tensor</b> can be reconstructed from a redundant set of lower order projection data. Here we demonstrate this fundamental concept for two samples: a shrink fit 'ring-and-plug' sample, and a spray-quenched circular cylinder, both possessing axially symmetric internal strain distribution.

The methods described here can also be readily applied to high-energy X-ray diffraction measurements and represent an important step toward developing the tomographic reconstruction framework for <b>strain</b> <b>tensor</b> distributions of arbitrary complexity. The major benefit of neutron strain tomography is that the incident beam flux is utilised more fully, greatly reducing the data collection times. Using micro-channel plate (MCP) neutron detectors, a spatial resolution of the order of 0. 1 mm can be achieved [1]. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Three {{supplementary}} X-ray techniques new to semiconductor {{applications are}} discussed. These are the Computer Aided Rocking Curve Analyzer, the Divergent Beam Method {{and a new}} method based on enhanced X-ray flourescence. The first method is used for quantitative mapping of an <b>elastic</b> or plastic <b>strain</b> field while the other two methods are used only to measure <b>elastic</b> <b>strains.</b> The divergent beam method is used for measuring the full <b>strain</b> <b>tensor</b> while the microfluorescence method is useful for monitoring strain uniformity. These methods are discussed in detail and examples of their application is presented. Among these are determination of the full strain ellipsoid in state-of-the-art liquid phase epitaxy deposited III-V epitaxial films; mapping of the plastic strain concentrations in tensile deformed Si; and quantitative determination of damage in V 3 Si due to ion implantation...|$|R
