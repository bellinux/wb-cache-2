Due to development of very fast switching semiconductor devices, speed of computer and communication equipment has been increasing day by day {{and will continue to do}} so in future.

Small-signal ac transport of degenerate two-dimensional hot electrons in GaAs quantum wells is studied here incorporating deformation potential acoustic, polar optic and ionized impurity scattering in the framework of heated drifted Fermi-Dirac carrier distribution. <b>Delta</b> <b>doping</b> is considered in the calculations to investigate the effects of double <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> on millimeter and submillimeter wave response of two dimensional hot electrons in GaAs nanostructures.

40|$|A {{process for}} n-type (electron-donor) <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> has shown promise {{as a means}} of modifying back-illuminated image {{detectors}} made from n-doped high-purity silicon to enable them to detect high-energy photons (ultraviolet and x-rays) and low-energy charged particles (electrons and ions). This process is applicable to imaging detectors of several types, including charge-coupled devices, hybrid devices, and complementary metal oxide/semiconductor detector arrays. <b>Delta</b> <b>doping</b> is so named because its density-vs. -depth characteristic is reminiscent of the Dirac delta function (impulse function) : the dopant is highly concentrated in a very thin layer. Preferably, the dopant is concentrated in one or at most two atomic layers in a crystal plane and, therefore, <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> is also known as atomic-plane doping. The use of doping to enable detection of high-energy photons and low-energy particles was reported in several prior NASA Tech Briefs articles. As described in more detail in those articles, the main benefit afforded by <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> of a back-illuminated silicon detector is to eliminate a "dead" layer at the back surface of the silicon wherein high-energy photons and low-energy particles are absorbed without detection. An additional benefit is that the delta-doped layer can serve as a back-side electrical contact. <b>Delta</b> <b>doping</b> of p-type silicon detectors is well established. The development of the present process addresses concerns specific to the <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> of high-purity silicon detectors, which are typically n-type. The present process involves relatively low temperatures, is fully compatible with other processes used to fabricate the detectors, and does not entail interruption of those processes. Indeed, this process can be the last stage in the fabrication of an imaging detector that has, in all other respects, already been fully processed, including metallized. This process includes molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) for deposition of three layers, including metallization. The success of the process depends on accurate temperature control, surface treatment, growth of high-quality crystalline silicon, and precise control of thicknesses of layers. MBE affords the necessary nanometer- scale control of the placement of atoms for <b>delta</b> <b>doping.</b> More specifically, the process consists of MBE deposition of a thin silicon buffer layer, the n-type <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> layer, and a thin silicon cap layer. The n dopant selected for initial experiments was antimony, but other n dopants as (phosphorus or arsenic) could be used. All n-type dopants in silicon tend to surface-segregate during growth, leading to a broadened dopant-concentration- versus-depth profile. In order to keep the profile as narrow as possible, the substrate temperature is held below 300 C during deposition of the silicon cap layer onto the antimony delta layer. The deposition of silicon includes a silicon- surface-preparation step, involving H-termination, that enables the growth of high-quality crystalline silicon at the relatively low temperature with close to full electrical activation of donors in the surface layer...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, doped AlGaAs/GaAs {{parabolic}} quantum wells (PQW) {{with different}} well widths (from 1000 Å up to 3000 Å) were investigated {{by means of}} photoluminescence (PL) measurements. In order to achieve the 2 DEG inside the PQW Si <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> is placed at both side of the well. We have observed that the thickness of this space layer plays a major rule {{on the characteristics of}} the 2 DEG.

From PL measurement, we have observed beside the intra well transitions, indirect transitions involving still trapped electron on the <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> and holes inside the PQW. For the thinness sample, we have measured a well defined PL peak at low energy side of the GaAs bulk emission. With the increasing of the well thickness this peak intensity decreases and for the thickest sample it almost disappears. Our theoretical calculation indicated that carriers (electron and holes) are more placed {{at the center of the}} PQW. In this way, when the well thickness increases the distance between electrons on the <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> and holes on the well also increases, it decreases the probability of occurrence of these indirect optical transitions...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} three-dimensional (3 -D) statistical 'atomistic' simulation {{study of}} fluctuation-resistant sub- 0. 1 -(micron) meter MOSFET architectures with epitaxial channels and <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> is presented. The need for enhancing the fluctuation {{resistance of the}} sub- 0. 1 -(micron) meter generation transistors is highlighted by presenting summarized results from atomistic simulations {{of a wide range}} of conventional devices with uniformly doped channel. According to our atomistic results, the doping concentration dependence of the random dopant-induced threshold voltage fluctuations in conventional devices is stronger than the analytically predicted fourth-root dependence. As a result of this, the scaling of such devices will be restricted by the "intrinsic" random dopant-induced fluctuations earlier than anticipated. Our atomistic simulations confirm that the introduction of a thin epitaxial layer in the MOSFET's channel can efficiently suppress the random dopant-induced threshold voltage fluctuations in sub- 0. 1 -(micron) meter devices. For the first time, we observe an "anomalous" reduction in the threshold voltage fluctuations with an increase in the doping concentration behind the epitaxial channel, which we attribute to screening effects. Also, for the first time we study the effect of a delta-doping, positioned behind the epitaxial layer, on the intrinsic threshold voltage fluctuations. Above a certain thickness of epitaxial layer, we observe a pronounced anomalous decrease in the threshold voltage fluctuation with the increase of the <b>delta</b> <b>doping.</b> This phenomenon, which is also associated with screening, enhances the importance of the <b>delta</b> <b>doping</b> in the design of properly scaled fluctuation-resistant sub- 0. 1 -(micron) meter MOSFET's.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of more than}} one carrier to the conductivity in modulation-doped field effect transistors (MODFET) affects the resultant mobility and complicates the characterization of these devices.
