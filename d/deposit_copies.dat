40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a review of}} current literature addressing {{the issues of the}} <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> scheme within the two decades after 1989. The dynamic development of the publishing market in Poland following the emergence of the new social and economic reality, and the introduction of new media, prompted librarians and publishers to postulate changes in relevant obsolete legal regulations that dated back to 1968. The conflict of, or incompatibility of, interest between the two sections were most apparent in demands submitted by libraries to retain full control over the publishing market in terms of the obligation of publishers to furnish to libraries their complete publishing output according to the <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> scheme. On {{the opposite side of the}} conflict, publishers demanded the number of eligible <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> libraries to be significantly reduced. At the time, library periodicals and publishing journals abounded with articles presenting opinions, views and suggestions put forward by librarians and publishers alike. A number of stages in the discussion can be distinguished: from fact-finding evaluations produced soon after 1989 and proposals referring to changes in regulations with regard to passing an act in the lower house of the Parliament (the Polish Sejm), appraisals of new legal regulations in the light of their actual operation, to a new debate on amendments and changes in the Act. The article is complemented with an extensive bibliography in chronological order...|$|R
50|$|Around 1774, {{after the}} {{dissolution}} of Jesuits, the Lyceum Library formed from {{the remains of the}} Jesuit Library and several monastery libraries. It was established with a decree issued by Maria Theresa. The submission of legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> to the Lyceum library became mandatory with a decree published by the Austrian court in 1807, at first only in Carniola, except {{for a short period of}} French administration, when it received copies from all the Illyrian provinces. In 1919, it was named State Reference Library and started to collect legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> from the entire Slovenia of the time. In the same year, the University of Ljubljana (the first Slovenian university) was established and the library served its needs too. In 1921, it started to acquire legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> from the entire Yugoslavia. It was named University Library in 1938.|$|E

Second, this requirement helps the Library of Congress build its collection of works.|$|R

50|$|One of the odder {{documentation}} requirements {{is that most}} commercial contracts require an assurance that system documentation will be available indefinitely. The normal commercial method of providing this assurance is to form and fund a small foundation or trust. The trust then maintains a mailbox and <b>deposits</b> <b>copies</b> (usually in ultrafiche) in a secure location, such as rented space in a university's library (managed as a special collection), or (more rarely now) buried in a cave or a desert location.|$|R
50|$|The National Library {{was founded}} on 29 August 1919, one year after independence, as the Valsts Bibliotēka (State Library). Its first chief {{librarian}} and bibliographer was Jānis Misiņš (1862-1944) who made his immense private collection {{the basis of the}} new library. Within a year, until 1920, the stocks had grown to 250,000 volumes. Starting in the same year, all publishers were obliged to hand in a <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> of their works. Since 1927, the Library has published the National Bibliography of Latvia.|$|R

50|$|With the Soviet occupation, the Library {{became a}} regular public library, known {{under the name}} of the State Library of the Estonian SSR. The role of the Library changed considerably: all links with foreign {{countries}} and their libraries were severed, and Russian publications predominated, mostly consisting of all-Union <b>deposit</b> <b>copies.</b> The bulk of Estonian and foreign publications was placed in restricted access collections. Between 1948 and 1992 the Library was housed in the former Estonian Knighthood House in Tallinn’s historic centre.|$|E
50|$|During {{the time}} of the {{independent}} Republic of Estonia from 1918-1940, the Library developed and grew fast. In 1919, the Library began to receive a legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> of all printed matter published in Estonia. In 1921, the first international exchange agreements were concluded. In 1935 the State Library established an Archival Collection of all publications in the Estonian language and about Estonia. This {{was the beginning of a}} systematic acquisition of printed matter on Estonia and the Baltic countries. In the 1930s, the State Library started to perform more functions than those of a parliamentary library - the collections comprised about 50,000 items and the readership included outstanding intellectuals, cultural and public figures.|$|R
5000|$|In 1793 {{a new law}} {{was passed}} giving authors, composers, and artists the {{exclusive}} right to sell and distribute their works, and the right was extended to their heirs and assigns for 10 years after the author's death. The National Assembly placed this law firmly on a natural right footing, calling the law the [...] "Declaration of the Rights of Genius" [...] and so evoking the famous Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. However, author's rights were subject to the condition of making <b>depositing</b> <b>copies</b> of the work with the Bibliothèque Nationale and 19th Century commentators characterised the 1793 law as utilitarian and [...] "a charitable grant from society".|$|R
50|$|However, {{starting}} with film in 1915 {{the government has}} allowed copyright holders to avoid <b>depositing</b> a <b>copy</b> permanently with the Library of Congress. As a result, most of the copyrighted material from the twentieth century is unavailable {{to the public in}} any form.|$|R
5000|$|Lessig complained, [...] "While much {{of twentieth-century}} culture was {{constructed}} through television, only a tiny portion of that culture is available for anyone to see today." [...] Lessig suggests {{that this is a}} violation of the spirit if the letter of the constitution: Early American copyright law required copyright owners to <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> of their work in libraries. [...] "These copies were intended both to facilitate the spread of knowledge and to assure that a copy of the work would be around once the copyright expired".|$|E
50|$|It was {{established}} on 14 October 1907 as Tallinn Town Free Public Library, {{and was the}} first town library in Estonia.The library was led by Aleksander Sibul from 1921-1950, and he made it into a central library that had multiple branches and departments. Between 1938 and 1948 the library contained an active archival department that collected 40,000 units of archival materials and received the legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> for all of Estonia. The library maintained this archival material until 1958, at which time it was distributed to other libraries.|$|E
50|$|By early 2014 Folkstreams was hosting over 220 such documentaries created since 1949. The goal of Folkstreams is {{to recover}} many more such films, <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> {{in a library}} for {{long-term}} preservation, and digitize and stream the films for the internet public. Along with a quarter of them it already streams background information about {{the making of the}} film and the traditions presented. Most films on Folkstreams are protected by copyright, and the filmmakers have given their permission and encouragement for the streaming. An archive of all footage and corresponding materials is kept at the Folklife Collection http://www2.lib.unc.edu/wilson/sfc/ at the Wilson Library in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{portions}} of several European collections (e.g., Christian Hege of Germany and W.J. Kühler of the Netherlands) gave important depth to the library's holdings. Several printers and publishers have regularly donated <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> of their publications, notably Mennonite Publishing Network's Herald Press/Faith & Life Resources and Pathway Publishers (operated by Old Order Amish). Contributions {{have also been}} critical in the library's effort to sustain comprehensive acquisition of newly published material. Exchanges of material with sister collections, such as Bethel College's Mennonite Library and Archives (North Newton, Kansas), Eastern Mennonite University's Menno Simons Library (Harrisonburg, Virginia), and the Heritage Historical Library (Aylmer, Ontario), have helped broaden MHL holdings beyond the Swiss South-German Old Mennonite segment that continues to characterize their core strength.|$|E
