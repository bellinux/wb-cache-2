Lead determination by stripping analysis coupled with insonation was used to illustrate advantages of employing ultrasound in <b>electro-analysis.</b> Quantitative analysis of lead under insonation was shown to be possible in different media, including organic and biological samples where electroanalytical techniques often fail to give satisfactory results due to passivation of electrodes in these complex matrices...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} insonation of bismuth, silver, copper and {{tungsten}} metal particles suspended in octane {{in the vicinity}} of a glassy carbon electrode. AFM and voltammetry reveal that metal particles are immobilised onto the electrode substrate. In the case of bismuth, silver and copper, the possible melting of the metal particles due to the high sonochemical conditions cannot unambiguously be ruled out. However, {{it is likely that the}} immobilisation of the metal particles occurs predominantly through mechanical attachment due to the high rates of mass transport, evidenced from the fact that tungsten can be immobilised at a glassy carbon surface which has a melting point (mp 3410 degrees C) outside the likely sonochemical conditions. The immobilised particles are found to be in electrical contact with the glassy carbon electrodes which can then act as random assemblies of microelectrodes. Proof-of-concept for use in <b>electro-analysis</b> is examined for the possible detection of arsenic and cadmium at a silver and bismuth random microelectrode assemblies, respectively. This approach suggests a simple generic methodology for the construction of microelectrode assemblies via abrasive attachment induced by insonation with power ultrasound...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{its unique}} {{properties}} such as chemical stability, large potential windows of water stability (up to 3 V) and mechanical resistance, boron-doped diamond (BDD) thin films {{have been widely}} used as electrodes for <b>electro-analysis</b> and electrolysis. In this work we have studied surface structural modifications in BDD thin films grown by hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) due to usage as anodic working electrode in H 3 PO 4 aqueous solution (pH- 1, 2) up to 1000 h. With the powerful tool of Micro-Raman spectroscopy we show nonuniform structural variations of the diamond lattice. Modifications in the electrochemical properties has been observed while BDD electrodes were used as anodes. Moreover, by modelling the Fano interaction between discrete phonon states and the degenerate continuum of states, we point out an increase of the acceptor levels {{as a function of the}} electrode working hours. These experimental evidences indicate an anomalous behaviour of hydrogen loaded in the films during the growth process. A model based on the hydrogen boron interaction could explain the observed modifications in Fano coupling. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{nanotube}} array {{based on}} vertically aligned nanotubes or carbon nanofibers has been invented {{for use in}} localized electrical stimulation and recording of electrical responses in selected regions of an animal body, especially including the brain. There are numerous established, emerging, and potential applications for localized electrical stimulation and/or recording, including treatment of Parkinson s disease, Tourette s syndrome, and chronic pain, and research on electrochemical effects involved in neurotransmission. Carbon-nanotube-based electrodes offer potential advantages over metal macroelectrodes (having diameters {{of the order of}} a millimeter) and microelectrodes (having various diameters ranging down to tens of microns) heretofore used in such applications. These advantages include the following: a) Stimuli and responses could be localized at finer scales of spatial and temporal resolution, which is at subcellular level, with fewer disturbances to, and less interference from, adjacent regions. b) There would be less risk of hemorrhage on implantation because nano-electrode-based probe tips could be configured to be less traumatic. c) Being more biocompatible than are metal electrodes, carbon-nanotube-based electrodes and arrays would be more suitable for long-term or permanent implantation. d) Unlike macro- and microelectrodes, a nano-electrode could penetrate a cell membrane with minimal disruption. Thus, for example, a nanoelectrode could be used to generate an action potential inside a neuron or in proximity of an active neuron zone. Such stimulation may be much more effective than is extra- or intracellular stimulation via a macro- or microelectrode. e) The large surface area of an array at a micron-scale footprint of non-insulated nanoelectrodes coated with a suitable electrochemically active material containing redox ingredients would make it possible to obtain a pseudocapacitance large enough to dissipate a relatively large amount of electric charge, so that a large stimulation current could be applied at a micron-scale region without exhausting the redox ingredients. f) Carbon nanotube array is more compatible with the three-dimensional network of tissues. Particularly, a better electrical-neural interface can be formed. g) A carbon nanotube array inlaid in insulating materials with only the ends exposed is an extremely sensitive <b>electro-analysis</b> tool that can measure the local neurotransmitter signal at extremely high sensitivity and temporal resolution...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScCancer, {{the second}} most common cause of death after heart disease, is a complex and multifactorial disease that up to date is still under {{extensive}} research. To achieve early detection of cancer disease the discovery of specific, sensitive and reliable biomarkers is required. Telomerase is a ribonucleo-protein complex that has been identified as an important target for cancer diagnostics and cancer therapy, because 85 % of more than 950 primary tumours express telomerase activity. The standard method for the detection and quantification of telomerase activity is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assay known as the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. TRAP and other methods developed for telomerase detection have limitations for example its time consuming, requires complicated machinery, expensive equipment and reagents thus {{there is a need for}} a more sensitive, reliable and high-throughput method. Electrochemical biosensors are quickly emerging as an alternative for early detection of cancer because they can be designed to detect developing cancer biomarkers and to allow improved monitoring of cancer growth and patient therapy. This research study reported for the first time the successful fabrication and implementation of highly sensitive 3 -mercaptopropionic acid indium telluride quantum dots (3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs) based genosensor for detection of telomerase biomarker. The colloidal poly-dispersed 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs introduced into the genosensor system were successfully synthesized by a simple, inexpensive and reproducible aqueous method. The as prepared 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs was characterized by Ultraviolet Visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, Fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and High Resolution Transmission/Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR TEM/SEM). <b>Electro-analysis</b> of 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs was done by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). HR-TEM studies revealed formation of small sized QDs about 6 nm in diameter while UV-VIS studies showed presence of iv absorption peaks in the ultraviolet region (100 - 400 nm) which confirmed the formation of these small sized QDs. The good electrochemical, optical, physical and chemical properties of the 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs allowed them to be used as a mediating platform between deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and gold electrode (AuE). The successful detection of telomerase was achieved by hybridization process between the probe single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) drop coated on the 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs/AuE surface and its complementary ssDNA in biological buffer solution (0. 10 M tris-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (TE) buffer solution, pH 8. 00). The response of the 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs based genosensor towards different concentration of complementary ssDNA was studied by CV, square wave voltammetry (SWV) and EIS. It was observed that all three analytical techniques exhibited good linearity since their linear correlation coefficients (R 2) corresponded to 0. 99. However, it was observed that EIS was the best technique for the detection of telomerase compared to both CV and SWV since it showed a higher sensitivity (2. 44 Ω/nM) towards detecting telomerase with a detection limit as low as 0. 00014 ng/mL. Control experiments were also carried out by monitoring the hybridization process in the presence and absence of complementary ssDNA and it was determined that the QDs based genosensor was highly selective towards complementary ssDNA. In view of the attractive analytical characteristics and advantages, the ultimate goal of the developed QDs based genosensor is to apply it in real clinical samples of cancer cells or bodily fluids of cancer patients for the detection of telomerase cancer biomarker...|$|E
