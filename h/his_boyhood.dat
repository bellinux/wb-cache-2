5|$|Adams {{was born}} in Sheffield, Yorkshire, and was an {{associate}} schoolboy with Sheffield United {{from the age of}} twelve, where <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> idol was Tony Currie. He was a favourite of manager Jimmy Sirrel, though Adams was released from the youth set-up a few months after Harry Haslam replaced Sirrel as manager in September 1977.|$|E
5|$|After Euro 96, Manchester United again {{sought to}} sign Shearer, and {{attempted}} to enter the battle for his signature. However Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards stated that Blackburn Rovers refused to let Shearer go to Old Trafford. Ultimately Shearer joined <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> club and Manchester United's title rivals Newcastle United.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of On the Town Donen signed a seven-year {{contract}} with MGM as a director. His next two films were for producer Freed, but without Kelly. After being replaced as director on Pagan Love Song over personal differences with star Esther Williams, Donen was {{given the chance to}} direct <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> idol Fred Astaire.|$|E

5|$|Trautmann's {{idiosyncratic}} {{style of}} play also had an influence on budding young goalkeepers {{at the height of}} his career. The former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson names Trautmann as <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> hero, and Gordon Banks cited him as an influence on his playing style.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 2016, Torres {{signed for}} Atlético {{permanently}} on a one-year contract. In February 2017, he scored his 100th league goal in Spanish football when he netted a brace against Leganés. On 4 July 2017, Torres signed a new one-year {{contract with the}} rojiblancos to stay with <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> club for one more year after they were banned from signing new players.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{father was}} the Justice of the Westmoreland County Court. George spent much of <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> at Ferry Farm in Stafford County near Fredericksburg. Lawrence Washington {{inherited}} another family property from his father, a plantation on the Potomac River at Little Hunting Creek which he named Mount Vernon, {{in honor of his}} commanding officer, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon. George inherited Ferry Farm upon his father's death and eventually acquired Mount Vernon after Lawrence's death.|$|E
60|$|They fairly belted {{the city}} in their run, and in the end, as they went {{sweeping}} down the curving driveway of the lake, Mrs. Ollnee's face was delicately pink {{and her eyes were}} bright with happiness. To her son she seemed once more the lovely and delicate figure of <b>his</b> <b>boyhood's</b> admiration. It seemed that her death-like trance had been a horrible dream.|$|R

60|$|Although at {{this time}} over seventy years of age his mind was notably clear, orderly and active, and his talk (usually a {{carefully}} constructed monologue) was stately, formal and precise. He used no slang, and retained scarcely a word of <b>his</b> <b>boyhood's</b> vernacular. The only emotional expression he permitted himself was a chuckle of glee over an intellectual misstatement or a historical bungle. Novels, theaters, music possessed no interest for him.|$|R
5|$|Bird, who was Pixar's first outside director, {{developed}} {{the film as}} an extension of 1960s comic books and spy films from <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after the box office disappointment of his first feature, The Iron Giant (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop The Incredibles. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film's orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|During Barnes' {{first full}} {{season in the}} first team Manchester City enjoyed a {{successful}} run in the FA Cup. As a top-flight team Manchester City entered the competition in the third round, facing Derby County. Barnes scored the opening goal in a 3–1 win, his first goal in professional football. A derby victory against Manchester United and a win against Luton Town followed, setting up a quarter-final against <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> heroes Birmingham City. Single goal victories against Birmingham and Sunderland gave City {{a place in the}} final, where they faced Newcastle United. However, hampered by the loss of Jimmy Meadows to injury after 18 minutes, City were beaten 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, a rumour abounded that he {{had been}} killed {{charging}} the German lines on horseback. This story has persisted despite eye-witness accounts to the contrary. Capper was buried in Lillers Communal Cemetery behind British lines and his grave is surmounted by a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone. He is also commemorated on the War Memorial in Rayne, Essex, where he spent much of <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> with his uncle, the Rector of Rayne, Rev W S Hemming. His collected papers were donated to King's College in 1971, where they are still available to researchers and contain a wide selection of primary materials concerning the warfare of the early twentieth century.|$|E
60|$|Esterbrook {{accepted}} his mapped-out destiny and selected bride with {{the conviction that}} he was an exceptionally lucky fellow. Out of all the women in the world Marian was the very one whom he would have chosen as mistress of his fine, old home. She had been <b>his</b> <b>boyhood's</b> ideal. He believed that he loved her sincerely, but he was not too much in love to be blind to the worldly advantages of his marriage with his cousin.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, {{when he was}} 10 years old, Samaras joined <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> heroes, OFI Crete. His {{father was}} playing for {{them at the time}} and then retired in 1996. Six months later, he became Academy chief manager, a {{position}} he retained until 2000, when he became manager. Samaras credits his father highly with helping start his football career. His influence meant that Samaras trained every day of his childhood and he also got {{to spend a lot of}} time behind the scenes at OFI. Samaras left for Eredivisie club Heerenveen in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000, Horsfield {{signed a}} five-year {{contract}} with Birmingham, who paid a club record fee of £2.25million, £350,000 of which went to Halifax Town under the sell-on clause. He was their top scorer in his first season, finding the net on twelve occasions, and his two goals in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final helped the club reach their first major final for nearly 40 years. In the starting eleven for the final against <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> heroes Liverpool, Horsfield had been substituted by the time Birmingham lost in a penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler {{resisted}} Clay's attempts {{to set the}} Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with no political office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> home and presented it {{to him as a}} gift on his return to Kentucky.|$|E

[...] "I say, Derek, old scream, the most extraordinary thing has happened! You'll never guess. To cut {{a long story short}} and come to the blow-out of the scenario, I'm engaged!

5|$|Following his recovery, Liddell {{travelled}} to Canada {{to complete}} a course at the Central Navigation School and became a pilot officer navigator. While on leave, he {{was used as a}} substitute by the Toronto Scottish under an assumed name and scored twice in a semi-final play-off. He was recalled to Moncton, New Brunswick, before the final. After some seven months in Canada, Liddell returned to Britain and, when based in Perth in 1944, accepted an offer to guest for <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> favourites Dunfermline Athletic. He subsequently moved to Northern Ireland for further training, where he declined an offer from former Liverpool goalkeeper Elisha Scott to guest for Belfast Celtic because of a prior agreement to play for Linfield. By the end of the war, Liddell had been assigned to 617 Squadron, helping to transport Allied soldiers back to Britain on leave from Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to giving the originals of his diaries to USU, Arrington had given microfilm of his diary from <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> until 1982 to the Church Archives, {{but with the}} condition that his diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. Shortly after Arrington's death, a general authority asked Arrington's daughter, Susan Madsen, to excise 40 parts of her father's diary. By making this request, the LDS Church representatives revealed that they read Arrington's journals without proper permission. George Daines, the Arrington family attorney, explained that the family had grounds to take legal action against the LDS Church and the negotiations were quickly over. Arrington's family agreed to give the LDS Church some of the materials, including minutes to meetings with the Twelve Apostles and materials related to the temple ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In {{building}} for the 2010–11 season, Adams released nine players, and signed Sean Rigg, Stuart Tomlinson, Justin Richards, Ritchie Sutton and Gary Roberts. The season began similarly to the previous campaign, with a 3–1 win at Championship side Queens Park Rangers in the League Cup First Round, new signing Richards scoring twice. Five wins in five for September saw Adam's gifted the League Two Manager of the Month award, his team also boasting five clean sheets. He was also handed the award for November, after his team advanced into the Third Round of the FA Cup and rose {{to the top of}} the League Two table on the back of five clean sheets in seven games. Departing for <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> club at the end of December 2010, he left the club in second position in League Two.|$|E
60|$|Overcome by the {{memories}} of the past, he flung him-sell down on the cool and shadowy bank, and gave him-sell up to the bittersweet reveries of a man returning to <b>his</b> <b>boyhood's</b> home. He was filled somehow with a strange and powerful feeling of the passage of time; with a vague feeling of the mystery and elusiveness of human life. The leaves whispered it overhead, the birds sang it in chorus with the insects, and far above, in the measureless spaces of sky, the hawk told it in the silence and majesty of his flight from cloud to cloud.|$|R

5|$|Messi {{has also}} {{invested}} in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club {{based in the}} Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, {{as well as at}} River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell's Old Boys, <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Doctors without Borders.|$|E
5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
5|$|He {{imagined}} {{it as an}} homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from <b>his</b> <b>boyhood</b> and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000, breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters. In addition, {{it would be the}} company's first film in which all characters are human.|$|E
