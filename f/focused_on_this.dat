5|$|In 1980, Narayan was {{nominated}} to the Rajya Sabha, the upper {{house of the}} Indian Parliament, for his contributions to literature. During his entire six-year term, he was focused on one issue—the plight of school children, especially the heavy load of school books and the negative effect of the system on a child's creativity, which was something that he first highlighted in his debut novel, Swami and Friends. His inaugural speech was <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> particular problem, and resulted {{in the formation of}} a committee chaired by Prof. Yash Pal, to recommend changes to the school educational system.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of World War I (also known as the First World War or the Great War), Southern Rhodesia was {{administered}} by the British South Africa Company, which had controlled it and Northern Rhodesia since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The white population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while Northern Rhodesia had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government, which would make Southern Rhodesia a self-governing colony within the British Empire. Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910. Following {{the intervention of the}} war, the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E

25|$|Formerly {{located between}} and {{parallel}} to Queen Street and Victoria Street, and bisected by Ophir Road, Johore Road was the less well-known cousin of its glamorous counterpart, Bugis Street, just a stone's throw away.

No photographs or media attention were <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> street of ill-repute; only a no-frills approach to an economic exchange.|$|E
25|$|There {{are areas}} {{of his life}} and daily routine that Keats does not describe. He {{mentions}} little about his childhood or his financial straits and is seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is a total absence of any reference to his parents. In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often gave way to despair and morbid obsessions. The publications of letters to Fanny Brawne in 1870 <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> period and emphasised this tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.|$|E
25|$|Yield {{management}} {{has moved into}} the bus industry with companies such as Megabus (United Kingdom), Megabus (North America), BoltBus, and easyBus, which run low-cost networks in the United Kingdom {{and parts of the}} United States, and more recently, nakedbus.com and Intercape, which have networks in New Zealand and South Africa.

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature in}} the previous Serious Sam games was cooperative gameplay, in which multiple players could play the single-player campaign together. Serious Sam 2 <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> game mode even more than its predecessors, {{as it was the}} only multiplayer mode to be included when the game was released, although deathmatch was later added in a patch. The PC version allows up to sixteen people to play together, while the Xbox version allows four players, either via Xbox systemlink or Xbox Live. Unlike the previous games, Serious Sam 2 does not support split-screen gameplay on the PC nor the Xbox.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the quality}} of {{domestically}} produced and Chinese firearms perpetually remained inferior to European ones. The court concentrated on procuring coastal imports, which—given the demands of campaigning and the guns' rapid deterioration in tropical conditions—became an endless task. Thus a principal responsibility of coastal governors was to procure firearms through purchases and levies on incoming ships. Royal agents also purchased guns as far afield as India and Aceh; while diplomatic approaches to Europeans typically <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue. King Bodawpaya (r. 1782–1819) obliged Burmese merchants plying the Irrawaddy to supply specified quantities of foreign guns and powder in lieu of cash taxes.|$|E
25|$|SBML is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{assumed to be}} limited in scope only to biochemical network models because the original publications and early software <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> domain. In reality, although the central features of SBML are indeed oriented towards representing chemical reaction-like processes that act on entities, this same formalism serves analogously for many other types of processes; moreover, SBML has language features supporting the direct expression of mathematical formulas and discontinuous events separate from reaction processes, allowing SBML to represent much more than solely biochemical reactions. Evidence for SBML's ability {{to be used for}} more than merely descriptions of biochemistry {{can be seen in the}} variety of models available from BioModels Database.|$|E

25|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear {{frequently in the}} film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.|$|E
25|$|Judenplatz (English:Jewish Square) is a {{town square}} in Vienna's Innere Stadt that {{was the center of}} Jewish life and the Viennese Jewish Community in the Middle Ages. It is located in the {{immediate}} proximity of Am Hof square, Schulhof, and Wipplingerstraße. It exemplifies the long and eventful history {{of the city and the}} Jewish community <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> place. Archaeological excavations of the medieval synagogue are viewable underground by way of the museum on the square, Misrachi-Haus. Two sculptural works, a carved relief and several inscribed texts are located around the square that all have subject matter relating to Jewish history. One of these sculptures is a statue of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. The other is a memorial to Austrian Holocaust Victims, a project based on an idea of Simon Wiesenthal and unveiled in 2000. Created by British artist Rachel Whiteread, the memorial is a reinforced concrete cube resembling a library with its volumes turned inside out. The Judenplatz is the location of the Constitutional Court of Austria and the Administrative Court of Austria.|$|E

500|$|During {{this phase}} Ostojić first asked Jevđević to obtain more {{supplies}} from the Italians, {{and then when}} they refused, threatened to declare war on them. By early March, just as the Partisans were forcing a crossing of the Neretva at Jablanica, Mihailović joined Ostojić. In a letter to one of his other Montenegrin Chetnik commanders, Mihailović stated that he was managing the whole operation through Ostojić, although Mihailović later denied that {{he was in charge of}} the operation when questioned during his trial by a Partisan court after the war. Mihailović and Ostojić realised that the large concentrations of Chetnik troops in and around Mostar and the nearby bauxite mines were likely to draw German attention, and while they were <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue, the Partisans forced a crossing of the Neretva.|$|E
