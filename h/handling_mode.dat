40|$|Generative {{adversarial}} networks (GANs) are innovative {{techniques for}} learning generative models of complex data distributions from samples. Despite remarkable recent improvements in generating realistic images, {{one of their}} major shortcomings {{is the fact that}} in practice, they tend to produce samples with little diversity, even when trained on diverse datasets. This phenomenon, known as mode collapse, has been the main focus of several recent advances in GANs. Yet there is little understanding of why mode collapse happens and why existing approaches are able to mitigate mode collapse. We propose a principled approach to <b>handling</b> <b>mode</b> collapse, which we call packing. The main idea is to modify the discriminator to make decisions based on multiple samples from the same class, either real or artificially generated. We borrow analysis tools from binary hypothesis testing [...] -in particular the seminal result of Blackwell [Bla 53] [...] -to prove a fundamental connection between packing and mode collapse. We show that packing naturally penalizes generators with mode collapse, thereby favoring generator distributions with less mode collapse during the training process. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets suggests that packing provides significant improvements in practice as well. Comment: 40 pages, 19 figure...|$|E

This pilot study investigated the association between an interprofessional education and collaborative practice (IPECP) experience and the conflict handling modes of students from five health professions programs. Methods: The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) was used to assess 88 IPECP health professions students (health management= 9; nursing= 19; pharmacy= 36; physical therapy= 12; and optometry= 12). Pre- and post-intervention changes in student TKI percentiles were evaluated using paired t-tests and one-way ANCOVA. IBM SPSS 22 was used for statistical analyses with. 05 as cutoff value for significance. Results: After the IPECP intervention, in aggregate, participants were less likely to prefer avoiding as a means of handling conflict (t(87) = 3. 43, p =. 001). Using a one-way ANCOVA, degree program, (p =. 016) and gender (p =. 008) were significantly associated with changes in compromising <b>handling</b> <b>mode</b> percentile scores. Discussion: The decrease in the avoiding percentile suggests that, post-intervention, students were more willing to engage in conflict, thus, increasing their overall preference for the more assertive and cooperative dimensions of the TKI model. Conclusion: Though results are preliminary, they suggest that an interactive and patient-centered IPECP may be associated with the development of effective conflict handling skills among health professions students...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the study of tool use is {{presented}} from the perspective of an ecological approach to perception and action. It is argued that the essence of tool use lies in the maintenance of a specific relation between the organism + tool complex and the environment. Control over the tool is subordinate to this aim. It is proposed that perturbations of the tool-environment relation reveal the essential dimensions of organism + tool complex. A simple experiment is reported in which children (n = 43) from 2 to 4 years of age were asked to use (1 of 6) spoons to transport rice from 1 bucket to another. Perturbation of the tool-environment relation was introduced by manipulating the geometrical configuration of the spoons. The results indicated that all children indeed controlled the relation between tool and environment. They varied their grip such that the functional act of scooping was preserved. Hence, they perceived the new spoons in terms of its functional properties, its affordances. In addition, {{it was found that the}} relative occurrence of successful and unsuccessful transport attempts was contingent upon the configuration of the spoon. The control problems posed by one spoon in particular were such that, when using this implement, five children failed to transport any rice. A highly rigid <b>handling</b> <b>mode</b> was evident during many of the transport attempts undertaken using this spoon. The results further exemplified that failures in tool use, following perturbations of the tool-environment relation, are concommitant with the adoption of rigid handling modes and the selection of maladaptive grip configurations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} spring and damper settings that will ensure optimal ride comfort of an off-road vehicle, on different road profiles and at different speeds. These settings are required {{for the design of}} a four stage semi-active hydro-pneumatic spring damper suspension system (4 S 4). Spring and damper settings in the 4 S 4 can be set either to the ride mode or the <b>handling</b> <b>mode</b> and therefore a compromise ride-handling suspension is avoided. The extent to which the ride comfort optimal suspension settings vary for roads of different roughness and varying speeds and the levels of ride comfort that can be achieved, are addressed. The issues of the best objective function to be used when optimising and if a single road profile and speed can be used as representative conditions for ride comfort optimisation of semi-active suspensions, are dealt with. Optimisation is performed with the Dynamic-Q algorithm on a Land Rover Defender 110 modelled in MSC. ADAMS software for speeds ranging from 10 to 50 km/h. It is found that optimising for a combined driver plus rear passenger seat weighted root mean square vertical acceleration rather than using driver or passenger values only, returns the best results. Results indicate that optimisation of suspension settings using one road and speed will improve ride comfort on the same road at different speeds. These settings will also improve ride comfort for other roads at the optimisation speed and other speeds, although not as much as when optimisation has been done for the particular road. For improved ride comfort damping generally has to be lower than the standard (compromised) setting, the rear spring as soft as possible and the front spring ranging from as soft as possible to stiffer depending on road and speed conditions. Ride comfort is most sensitive to a change in rear spring stiffness.

40|$|A {{ground vehicle}} {{is a dynamic}} system {{containing}} many non-linear components, ranging from the non-linear engine response to the tyre-road interface. In pursuit of developing driver-assist systems for accident avoidance, as well as fully autonomous vehicles, the application of modern mechatronics systems to vehicles are widely investigated. Extensive {{work has been done}} in an attempt to model and control the lateral response of the vehicle system utilising a wide variety of conventional control and intelligent systems theory. The majority of driver models are however intended for low speed applications where the vehicle dynamics are fairly linear. This study proposes the use of adaptive control strategies as robust driver models capable of steering the vehicle without explicit knowledge of vehicle parameters. A Model Predictive Controller (MPC), self-tuning regulator and Linear Quadratic Self-Tuning Regulator (LQSTR) updated through the use of an Auto Regression with eXogenous input (ARX) model that describes the relation between the vehicle steering angle and yaw rate are considered as solutions. The strategies are evaluated by performing a double lane change in simulation using a validated full vehicle model in MSC ADAMS and comparing the maximum stable speed and lateral offset from the required path. It is found that all the adaptive controllers are able to successfully steer the vehicle through the manoeuvre with no prior knowledge of the vehicle parameters. An LQSTR proves to be the best adaptive strategy for driver model applications, delivering a stable response well into the non-linear tyre force regime. This controller is implemented on a fully instrumented Land Rover 110 of the Vehicle Dynamics Group at the University of Pretoria fitted with a semi-active spring-damper suspension that can be switched between two discrete setting representing opposite extremes of the desired response namely: ride mode (soft spring and low damping) and <b>handling</b> <b>mode</b> (stiff spring and high damping). The controller yields a stable response through a severe double lane change (DLC) up to the handling limit of the vehicle, safely completing the DLC at a maximum speed of 90 km/h all suspension configurations. The LQSTR also proves to be robust by following the same path for all suspension configurations through the manoeuvre for vehicle speeds up to 75 km/h. Validation is continued by successfully navigating the Gerotek dynamic handling track, as well as by performing a DLC manoeuvre on an off-road terrain. The study successfully developed and validated a driver model that is robust against variations in vehicle parameters and friction coefficients.

40|$|Today, Sport Utility Vehicles are {{marketed as}} both on-road and {{off-road}} vehicles. This {{results in a}} compromise when designing the suspension of the vehicle. If the suspension characteristics are fixed, the vehicle cannot have good handling capabilities on highways and good ride comfort over rough terrain. The rollover propensity {{of this type of}} vehicle compared to normal cars is high because it has a combination of a high centre of gravity and a softer suspension. The 4 State Semi-active Suspension System (4 S 4) that can switch between two discrete spring characteristics as well as two discrete damper characteristics, has been proven to overcome this compromise. The soft suspension setting (soft spring and low damping) is used for ride comfort, while the hard suspension setting (stiff spring and high damping) is used for handling. The following question arises: when is which setting most appropriate? The two main contributing factors are the terrain profile and the driver’s actions. Ride comfort is primarily dependant on the terrain that the vehicle is travelling over. If the terrain can be identified, certain driving styles can be expected for that specific environment. The terrains range from rough and uncomfortable to smooth with high speed manoeuvring. Terrain classification methods are proposed and tested with measured data from the test vehicle on known terrain types. Good results were obtained from the terrain classification methods. Five terrain types were accurately identified from over an hour’s worth of vehicle testing. Handling manoeuvres happen unexpectedly, often to avoid an accident. To improve the handling and therefore safety of the vehicle, the 4 S 4 can be switched to the hard suspension setting, which results in a reduced body roll angle. This decision should be made quickly with the occupants’ safety as the priority. Methods were investigated that will determine when to switch the suspension to the <b>handling</b> <b>mode</b> based on the kinematics of the vehicle. The switching strategies proposed in this study have the potential, with a little refinement, to make the ride versus handling decision correctly. Copyright 2007, University of Pretoria.

40|$|We {{show that}} it is {{possible}} to direct particles entrained in a fluid along trajectories much like rays of light in classical optics. A microstructured, asymmetric post array forms the core hydrodynamic element and is used as a building block to construct microfluidic metamaterials and to demonstrate refractive, focusing, and dispersive pathways for flowing beads and cells. The core element is based on the concept of deterministic lateral displacement where particles choose different paths through the asymmetric array based on their size: Particles larger than a critical size are displaced laterally at each row by a post and move along the asymmetric axis at an angle to the flow, while smaller particles move along streamline paths. We create compound elements with complex particle <b>handling</b> <b>modes</b> by tiling this core element using multiple transformation operations; we show that particle trajectories can be bent at an interface between two elements and that particles can be focused into hydrodynamic jets by using a single inlet port.
