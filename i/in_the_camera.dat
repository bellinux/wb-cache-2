5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.|$|E
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E

25|$|The system accumulates events, or counts, of gamma photons {{that are}} {{absorbed by the}} crystal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Usually a large flat crystal of sodium iodide with {{thallium}} doping in a light-sealed housing is used. The highly efficient capture method of this combination for detecting gamma rays was discovered in 1944 by Sir Samuel Curran whilst {{he was working on}} the Manhattan Project at the University of California at Berkeley. Nobel prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter also worked on the technique in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Because Niépce's camera {{photographs}} {{required an}} extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), {{he sought to}} greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.|$|E

25|$|Bitumen {{was used}} in early {{photographic}} technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist {{in the production of}} printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.|$|E
25|$|At 7am Platform 1 was cordoned off, as {{the camera}} crew filmed the three presenters drawing lots to {{determine}} which mode of transport to take. Jeremy Clarkson was allocated Tornado, May got the Jaguar while motorcycle fan Richard Hammond got the bike. Tornado was scheduled to depart at 7:25am. The race officially started with a blast on Tornado's whistle. James May and Richard Hammond proceeded {{to the car and}} bike which were parked in York Way. Tornado left approximately 90–120seconds late due to delays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> crew boarding the support coach. As seen on the programme, Hammond was delayed as he changed into his biker's leathers and was delayed again as he struggled to start the Black Shadow. The Vincent was eventually started by a motorcycle technician named Jim Church, who had been employed to provide technical support for the shoot.|$|E
25|$|An {{ordinary}} camera {{could be}} used to take the three pictures, by reloading it and changing filters between exposures, but pioneering color photographers usually built or bought special cameras that made the procedure less awkward and time-consuming. One of the two main types used beam splitters to produce three separate images <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> making all three exposures {{at the same time and}} from the same viewpoint. Although a camera of this type was ideal in theory, such cameras were optically complicated and delicate, and liable to get out of adjustment. Some designs were also subject to optical phenomena that could cause noticeably uneven color or other defects in the results. The other, more robust type was an essentially ordinary camera with a special sliding holder for the plates and filters that allowed each in turn to be efficiently shifted into position for exposure—an operation sometimes partly or even entirely automated with a pneumatic mechanism or spring-powered motor.|$|E
50|$|Tilting is a cinematographic {{technique}} <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> stays <b>in</b> a {{fixed position}} but rotates up/down in a vertical plane.

25|$|The {{scheme is}} both symbolically complex and {{elaborate}} in execution. The overriding theme is the Cycle of the Year {{as represented by}} {{the signs of the}} zodiac accompanied by the mysterious Deans each ruling ten days of the month. Above them, seated in a spectacular array of chariots drawn by lions, eagles, unicorns and other such beasts, are twelve Roman deities with their various attributes. In the lower tiers, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Camera</b> degli Sposi, are shown the life of the family. For the month of March, for example, the figure of Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom, is represented and in the panel beneath Borso d'Este is administering justice, while in the distance workers are pruning vines. Although areas of the frescoes are very badly damaged {{to the extent that the}} subject can no longer be identified, and although there are several different hands apparent in the works, there appears to be a consistency in the design of every remaining scene that shows the overriding eccentric style of Cosmè Tura.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, {{had succeeded}} in making crude but {{reasonably}} light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative {{which could be used}} to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as Daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot's famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, {{one of a number of}} camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.|$|E
25|$|The most {{difficult}} {{task for the}} special effects artists to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation - to make {{the interaction between the}} humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, than running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing {{the other part of the}} frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte. The Dunning process, invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lighting, filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} to accurately map the complete field-of-coverage {{of a camera}} to its pan-tilt space in an efficient manner. This camera model enables mapping the coordinates of any (x, y) point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera’s</b> current image to that point’s corresponding orientation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera’s</b> pan-tilt space. <b>The</b> model {{is based on the}} elliptical locus of the projections of a fixed point on the original focal plane of a moving <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> parametric location of this point along the ellipse defines <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>camera</b> orientation. <b>The</b> efficiency of <b>the</b> model lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fast and automatic mapping technique. We employ the proposed model to generate panoramas and evaluate the mapping procedure with multiple PTZ surveillance cameras. ...|$|R

30|$|Person re-identification is {{the problem}} of {{identifying}} people moving across cameras. Traditional approaches deal with this problem by pair-wise matching images recorded from two different <b>cameras.</b> A person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>camera</b> is identified by comparing his image with images <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>camera,</b> independently of other persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>camera.</b> <b>In</b> reality, there are many situations in which multiple persons appear concurrently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>camera.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a method for post-processing re-identification results. The idea is to utilize information of co-occurrence persons for comparing and re-arranging given ranked lists. Experiments conducted on different datasets with several state-of-the-art methods have shown the effectiveness of our post-processing method in improving re-identification accuracy.|$|R
