5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player <b>holsters</b> their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with <b>holsters</b> on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E
50|$|A BWB <b>Holster</b> or Below WaistBand <b>Holster</b> {{is a type}} of handgun <b>holster</b> worn {{inside the}} {{waistband}} of the wearers pants and rests below the belt line. A BWB <b>holster</b> offers deeper concealment when compared to the traditional IWB (Inside WaistBand) <b>holster,</b> which results in more noticeable comfort. Because a BWB <b>Holster</b> is worn inside the pants and below the belt it is often the most concealed type of <b>holster</b> available that works with most clothing options.|$|R

This was quickly followed by the Cloak Dock <b>holster</b> mount, an innovative yet simple mounting bracket that lets the user attach the bracket to compatible surfaces, to which the <b>holster</b> and firearm can be docked.|$|R
5000|$|A second, {{and equally}} {{well-known}} version, of the Berns-Martin <b>holster</b> was the company's [...] <b>holster,</b> a shoulder <b>holster</b> also for revolvers that carried {{them with the}} muzzles pointed upwards; that is, [...] "upside down". It was this <b>holster</b> that was made famous by its inclusion in Ian Fleming's later Bond books, {{although it was not}} suited to Bond's Walther semi-auto pistol, causing the company to mark its brochures of the period, [...] "no shoulder <b>holster</b> made for automatics". [...] Various adaptations of the Berns-Martin upside-down <b>holster</b> continue to this day, beginning with those various models made by the Bianchi <b>Holster</b> and Safariland companies of the 1960s/70s/80s/90s [...] and into today: as of 2012, Sherrick was producing a Berns-Martin type <b>holster</b> in a belted version called the Gumshoe Special.|$|R
5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original <b>holsters</b> no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007 film, Charlie Prince carries two Smith & Wesson Schofield Model 3 revolvers in butts-forward <b>holsters</b> {{built by}} Will Ghormley. Ghormley also {{designed}} Prince's <b>holsters.</b> Thell Reed extensively trained Foster in multiple quick draw and spinning techniques prior to filming. The Schofields {{were also used}} by Wade to kill Prince. Thell, the armorer, felt the arched back in the <b>holsters</b> impeded Foster’s ability to draw. Ultimately the arches were removed {{even though they were}} period correct. Also the <b>holsters</b> on the final rig were made ‘baggier’ than the holster on the prototype so Foster could holster his pistols with less resistance. However, in the 1957 film, he used a Colt Peacemaker.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>holsters</b> can {{be added}} to the belt to suit members duties such as a clip to hold the {{polycarbonate}} baton or mag light. In 2007/08, the chief commissioner approved the issue of firearm <b>holsters</b> which could be strapped around the members thighs, to replace the low-riding belt gun holster. These <b>holsters</b> are not standard issue but are issued to members upon request, and are commonly requested by members who suffer from back aches (as a result of heavy utility belt), or those who find it more operationally sound to draw their firearms from a lower position (as this option offers a more comfortable reach).|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the hard}} {{shell of a}} hybrid <b>holster</b> is usually press-molded for exactly the make and model firearm that the {{customer}} purchases the <b>holster</b> for, fitment is usually exact. Additionally, the <b>holster</b> exerts pressure exactly on the contour of the gun. This better ensures a pistol stays <b>holstered</b> whilst being carried.|$|R

50|$|McDaniel {{started off}} {{by having the}} student draw the gun very slowly, not {{permitting}} the student {{to look at the}} <b>holstered</b> gun while drawing it. In teaching the student swiftly exactly where the <b>holstered</b> gun-butt was located in reference to his body, he never permitted the student to look at his <b>holster</b> while he re-holstered the gun either. Instead, the student had to fumble the gun back into the <b>holster,</b> which swiftly taught him exactly where the <b>holstered</b> gun was located on his body.|$|R
5000|$|The Berns-Martin <b>holster</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} in the 1930s by J.E. Berns of the Navy Rifle Team, who, assigned to shore duty in Alaska, {{decided he wanted to}} carry a long-barrelled gun for hunting and invented a <b>holster</b> that allowed him to carry such a revolver high on his hip and out of the Alaskan snow. The leather work was left to Berns' Navy teammate Martin, and hence the name [...] "Berns-Martin" [...] for the company. [...] The <b>holster</b> was patented by John Emmett Berns in 1935 as 2,001,321 for a Revolver <b>Holster.</b> [...] When used in a hip <b>holster,</b> the revolver is drawn by pushing down (slightly) on the revolver grip while rocking the top of the revolver forward through the open front of the <b>holster.</b> While in the <b>holster,</b> a leather covered steel spring holds the revolver cylinder (and the rest of the revolver) securely in the <b>holster,</b> regardless of what physical gyrations the wearer might go through. No less an authority than Jeff Cooper stated that the Berns-Martin <b>holster</b> [...] "keeps the pistol secure enough for anything up to parachute jumping, and yet permit drawing without releasing any latch or strap beforehand." ...|$|R
25|$|Polymer <b>holsters</b> {{in various}} {{configurations}} and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups {{are designed to}} allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.|$|E
25|$|The harquebusier {{would usually}} have been {{armed with a}} doglock carbine, hung from a swivel {{attached}} to a baldric, pistols, either wheellock or flintlock, in saddle <b>holsters</b> and a stout, straight-bladed, sword. The 'dog' of the doglock was a type of safety-catch, very useful to prevent the unintentional firing of the carbine when on horseback. Records also indicate that some harquebusiers were also armed with a horseman's poleaxe or pick, these were hafted weapons with axe or hammer heads and armour-piercing spikes.|$|E
25|$|Lara Croft is {{the main}} protagonist and playable {{character}} of the series: {{she is a woman}} who travels the world in search of forgotten artifacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her shared traits are her origins as the only daughter and heir of the aristocratic Croft family. She is portrayed as intelligent, athletic, elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfill her own goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a braid or ponytail. The character's classic outfit consists of a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Recurring accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with <b>holsters</b> on either side, and twin pistols. Later games have multiple new outfits for her.|$|E
50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} best bet is a Jordan <b>holster</b> sewn to a wide stout belt, with tie-down straps to secure {{the bottom of the}} <b>holster</b> firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw <b>holster</b> by putting the gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting the <b>holster</b> thoroughly in a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into the <b>holster</b> to shape it, then letting the <b>holster</b> dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit in the <b>holster.</b> For uniformed police-officers, it does them good to learn how to unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into the <b>holster,</b> {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping the hand in that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from the <b>holster</b> and enable the extended fingers sweeping up the side of the <b>holster</b> to pop the snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|R

25|$|Mining, {{construction}} and utilities account for 26.61%. Mining includes plaster (mainly on the San Marcos Island), limestone (in Todos los Santos), phosphorus (in San Juan de La Costa and Adolfo LópezMateos, Comondú), copper (en Santa Rosalía), {{gold and silver}} (in the Triunfo-San Antonio mine), manganese (in Santa Rosalia and Punta Concepción Bay) and chrome (in San SebastiánVizcaíno and Magdalena bays). There are other minerals not yet routinely mined such as titanium, tungsten and cobalt. There is some possibility of offshore hydrocarbons. The state also produces salt of 99.7% purity, mostly {{in the area around}} Guerrero Negro. There are two major industrial/technology parks: Parque Tecnológico BioHelis, and Parque Industrial La Paz Sur. Traditional handcrafts can be found throughout the state and include articles made with seashells, palo chino, choya and cardon cactus. Baskets and other items are woven from palm fronds especially in el Triunfo Los Planes and the Sierra de los Dolores as well as fishing nets. Another important craft is leatherwork, especially the making of gear for horseback riding such as saddles, <b>holsters</b> and chaps along with belts and carrying bags. In addition, scrap metal is converted into various types of knives.|$|E
500|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} {{was issued}} with a clamshell holster {{similar to the}} French Modèle 1892 revolver. [...] The earliest Type 26 <b>holsters</b> were black, and the cotton lanyards issued with them were a dark blue color known in Japan as kon. A leather pocket for the cleaning rod was provided, sewn onto the forward edge of the holster body. Most examples of <b>holsters</b> are stamped {{on the inside of}} the clamshell flap with the maker's identification and arsenal inspection markings with the year of manufacture. [...] Very early <b>holsters,</b> issued in the late 1890s and early 1900s, were of a slightly different size and shape and without a pocket for the cleaning rod. A few <b>holsters</b> developed in 1943 have been noted to be all black lacquered hardware, missing the brass and galvanized steel fittings. <b>Holsters</b> produced towards the end of World War II have a last ditch fabric similar to late production Type 94 Nambu pistol <b>holsters,</b> with no shoulder straps or pouches for cleaning rods and ammunition.|$|E
500|$|<b>Holsters</b> for the Type 94 pistol were {{generally}} made from either pigskin or cowhide leather and ranged in color from tan to dark reddish brown. <b>Holsters</b> faced the same degradation in quality as the Type 94 pistol. As supplies of leather were exhausted in Japan, <b>holsters</b> manufactured in 1944 became fabricated from olive drab fabric. The Type 94 pistol holster is distinguishable from other Japanese <b>holsters</b> having a pointed closure flap and a vertically positioned magazine pouch. The pouch tow has a narrow extension {{to accommodate a}} cleaning rod. The majority of <b>holsters</b> were made in civilian owned tanneries with some ink stamped with arsenal and inspection marks. A belt loop and two shoulder strap [...] "D" [...] rings are provided on {{the rear of the}} holster and are made from brass, galvanized steel, or nickel plating.|$|E
5000|$|A paddle <b>holster</b> is a <b>holster</b> for {{a handgun}} whose method of {{securing}} the <b>holster</b> to the wearer utilizes a flat, concave shaped {{piece of plastic}} or stiffened leather designed to be worn against the body inside of the pants.

5000|$|Safety - a well {{designed}} <b>holster</b> will provide protection to the handgun during insertion into or removal from the <b>holster</b> or while being carried that will prevent three things: accidental trigger movement, accidental disengagement {{of the safety}} mechanism, and forward or rearward movement of the hammer. These features will vary greatly as applicable to {{the action of the}} handgun. The safety features of a <b>holster</b> very much require that the <b>holster</b> be engineered and designed for each specific manufacture and model of handgun.|$|R
500|$|At {{approximately}} 3:05p.m. CST, Steven Kazmierczak {{entered a}} large auditorium-style lecture hall in Cole Hall (Auditorium 101), where an oceanography class was in session with approximately 120 students present. Kazmierczak was wearing dark brown boots with laces; jeans; a black T-shirt {{with the word}} [...] "Terrorist" [...] imposed over an image of an assault rifle; a coat; a black knit hat; and a black utility belt with two magazine <b>holsters,</b> a holster for a handgun, three handguns (a 9×19mm Glock 19, a [...]380 ACP SIG Sauer P232, and a [...]380 ACP Hi-Point CF380), eight loaded magazines, and a knife. He also carried in a 12 gauge Remington Sportsman 48 shotgun concealed in a guitar case.

500|$|In 1668, the King {{appointed}} Rupert {{to be the}} Constable of Windsor Castle. Rupert {{was already}} one of the Knights of the Garter, who had their headquarters at the castle, and was a close companion of the King, who would wish to be suitably entertained at the castle. Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle's defences, sorting out the garrison's accommodation, repairing the Devil's Tower, reconstructing the real tennis court and improving the castle's hunting estate. Rupert acquired his own apartments in the castle, which were recorded as being [...] "very singular" [...] with some decorated with an [...] "extraordinary" [...] number of [...] "pikes, muskets, pistols, bandoliers, <b>holsters,</b> drums, back, breast, and head pieces", and his inner chambers [...] "hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures". King Charles II and Rupert spent much time together over the years hunting and playing tennis together at Windsor, and Rupert was also a close companion of James, the Duke of York. Rupert was considered by Pepys to be the fourth best tennis player in England.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{leather shoes}} and boots became {{affordable}} to the masses, and with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the demand for large numbers of polished army boots led to a need {{in the market for a}} product that would allow boots to be polished quickly, efficiently and easily. [...] The polish was also used to shine leather belts, handgun <b>holsters,</b> and horse tack. This demand led to a rapid increase in the sales of shoe and boot polish. The popularity of Kiwi shoe polish spread throughout the British Commonwealth and the United States. Rival brands began to emerge, including Shinola and Cavalier (United States), Cherry Blossom (United Kingdom), Parwa (India), Jean Bart (France), and many others. Advertising became more prominent; many shoe polish brands used fictional figures or historical characters to spread awareness of their products. [...] In the German documentary of 1927 Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, a scene focuses on shoe shining with a polish called Nigrin sporting the face of a Negro.|$|E
