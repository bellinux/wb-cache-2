5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 the Harvard medical {{researcher}} Hans Zinsser {{wrote the}} book Rats, Lice and History, alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> the body louse can transmit the disease.|$|E
5|$|The idea of token {{identity}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> {{particular occurrences}} of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events. Anomalous monism (see below) {{and most other}} non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories. Despite these problems, there is {{a renewed interest in}} the type identity theory today, primarily due to the influence of Jaegwon Kim.|$|E

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E

25|$|Thus, their {{argument}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> rights existing before {{the passing of}} the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (the first federal law to deal with the federal franchise) would be protected by section 41.|$|R
5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> Finland will utilise it, due, in part, to a requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, {{as one of the}} strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> a lower {{limit on the}} mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) {{were able to use}} one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E
5000|$|Reimer's {{viewpoint}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> [...] "good music" [...] (music evoking a feeling) {{should be}} taught. Teachers {{will have a}} firm pedagogical base and sensitivity, all will learn music because it helps us develop self-knowledge.|$|R

5|$|Lohan {{visits the}} Sanlaap centre, a women's and children's shelter in Kolkata. The centre offers dance therapy {{as part of}} their {{treatment}} and a group of girls perform a dance they have rehearsed. She talks to girls who had been held at a brothel and they describe being raped and drugged. The director of the Sanlaap centre describes how Lohan taking an interest in trafficking might inspire other young people to get involved in counteracting exploitation. Bharti Ali, director of the Non-governmental organization Centre for Child Rights, criticizes the government for not prioritizing child protection. Returning home, Lohan and the film crew are chased by paparazzi photographers at the airport. Two months later, Lohan is in London, England talking to Kate Redman, from Save the Children UK, who describes how one of the issues with government intervention <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> sex and drug trafficking is illegal. She also advocates raising awareness of the issues with trafficking.|$|E
5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were preparing to leave. The claim <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possibility}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> {{a portion}} of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and acid-base reactions. In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton.

25|$|If the {{detected}} structures {{have reached}} a certain threshold level, they are highlighted in the image for the radiologist. Depending on the CAD system these markings can be permanently or temporary saved. The latter's advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> the markings which are approved by the radiologist are saved. False hits should not be saved, because an examination {{at a later date}} becomes more difficult then.|$|E
25|$|Capping only {{occurs on}} motile cells and is {{therefore}} believed to reflect an intrinsic property of how cells move. It is an energy dependent process and in lymphocytes is partially inhibited by cytochalasin B (which disrupts microfilaments) but unaffected by colchicine (which disrupts microtubules). However, {{a combination of these}} drugs eliminates capping. A key feature of capping <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> those molecules that are crosslinked cap: Others do not.|$|E
