Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E

Methods: Three SDF products for caries control were studied: Cariestop- 12 %, Cariestop- 30 % and Saforide- 38 %. Their expected fluoride <b>ion</b> <b>concentrations</b> were 14, 200 ppm, 35, 400 ppm and 44, 800 ppm, respectively. The free fluoride <b>ion</b> <b>concentrations</b> were determined with an ion-selective electrode. The acidity was determined with a pH electrode. The measurements were taken when the bottles were newly opened and also after 7 days and after 28 days of storage at 4 oC. Five bottles of each product {{from the same}} lot number were measured. Results: The mean free fluoride <b>ion</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the freshly opened bottles were 12, 525 ± 450 ppm, 13, 200 ± 2, 060 ppm and 55, 800 ± 2, 536 ppm, respectively.

This change in expression correlates to a developmental {{shift of the}} chloride <b>ion</b> <b>concentration</b> within neurons from high to low intracellular concentration. Effectively, as the chloride <b>ion</b> <b>concentration</b> is reduced, the chloride gradient across the cellular membrane is reversed such that GABAA receptor and glycine receptor stimulation causes chloride ion influx, making the internal neuronal environment more negative (i.e. more hyperpolarized) {{than it would be}} at rest.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the neural system provides feedback to the vascular system of its need for more glucose is partly the release of glutamate as part of neuron firing. This glutamate affects nearby supporting cells, astrocytes, causing a change in calcium <b>ion</b> <b>concentration.</b> This, in turn, releases nitric oxide at the contact point of astrocytes and intermediate-sized blood vessels, the arterioles.

25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} {{leads to}} acetylcholine (ACh) release onto the salivary acinar cells. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors, specifically M3, and causes an increased intracellular calcium <b>ion</b> <b>concentration</b> (through the IP3/DAG second messenger system). Increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the apical cell membrane leading to secretion. ACh also causes the salivary gland to release kallikrein, an enzyme that converts kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. Lysyl-bradykinin acts upon {{blood vessels and}} capillaries of the salivary gland to generate vasodilation and increased capillary permeability respectively. The resulting increased {{blood flow to the}} acini allows production of more saliva. In addition, Substance P can bind to Tachykinin NK-1 receptors leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion. Lastly, both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to myoepithelium contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory acinus into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity.|$|E
25|$|Sulfates (SO4) in {{the soil}} or in groundwater, in {{sufficient}} concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., ettringite or thaumasite, {{which can lead to}} early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate <b>ion</b> <b>concentration</b> increases much slower {{in the soil}} mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.|$|E
