5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage overgrazing, logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were <b>having</b> <b>on</b> the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon {{be made into a}} state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} has not econometrically, for countries with non-developed financial markets, estimated the impact domestic credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality or the impact income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account. Based {{on a very}} comprehensive panel data set, which includes 152 different countries, we econometrically estimate the impact changes in domestic credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality {{as well as the}} impact changes in income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account. Based on the econometric results in this paper, we are able to identify that the impact credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality goes in opposite directions depending on if the financial market is developed or non-developed. Moreover, we were able to estimate the positive effects increased income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account for countries with non-developed financial markets, a result previous research only has estimated theoretically...|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{warn that}} climate change could {{increase}} the intensity of typhoons as climate change projections show that the difference in temperature between the ocean – the heat source for cyclones – and the storm tops – the cold parts of cyclones – are likely to increase. Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of high-intensity storms in selected ocean basins. While the effect changing climate is <b>having</b> <b>on</b> tropical storms remains largely unresolved scientists and president of Vanuatu Baldwin Lonsdale say the devastation caused by Pam, was aggravated by climate change.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (<b>having</b> <b>on</b> a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 the Guildhall Museum was amalgamated {{with the}} London Museum, {{creating}} the new Museum of London. Merrifield was appointed senior keeper, {{and soon after}} was promoted to deputy director. He retired in 1978 but remained active within the archaeological community, publishing The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic in 1987 and further studies of Roman London, and giving public lectures across the country. He was a keen supporter of the Standing Conference on London Archaeology, a body designed to monitor the impact that English Heritage was <b>having</b> <b>on</b> the city's archaeology, which he believed to be negative.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1957, Jordan {{signed the}} Arab Solidarity Agreement (ASA) with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria which entailed those countries' {{financial}} assistance to replace the annual British aid to Jordan that ended with the abrogation of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty in November 1956 (the treaty was officially and mutually abrogated in March 1957). However, implementation of the ASA was hindered by Egypt and Syria's inability or unwillingness to subsidize the Jordanian army, whose budget rivaled that of their own armies. Furthermore, by then, Abu Nuwar was steadily losing Hussein's confidence due to dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar among the army brass and the negative effects that his anti-Western hostility was <b>having</b> <b>on</b> relations with Jordan's principal Western allies, the UK and US; Hussein viewed the latter two as much-needed alternatives of financial support to Jordan in lieu of his disappointment with the ASA.|$|E

5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was <b>having</b> <b>on</b> his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E
5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a standard procedure, with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were <b>having</b> <b>on</b> {{the mental health of}} his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is <b>having</b> <b>on</b> the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E
