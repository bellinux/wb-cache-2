5|$|The HDMI {{specification}} {{defines the}} protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical {{requirements of the}} standard. The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340MHz, which allows for higher resolution (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single <b>digital</b> <b>link.</b> An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25MHz to 340MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25MHz to 680MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25MHz (e.g., 13.5MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.|$|E

For file transfer between personal computers over telephone circuits, the quality of resulting digital circuit may be much lower. The 3 byte (24 bit) and 4 byte (32 bit) polynomials are considered. Generator polynomials of a certain class have minimum weight and yet achieve the bound on minimum distance for arbitrary codes. Particular choices for 24 bit and 32 bit redundancies are exhibited: of weight and distance 6 in the 24 -bit case; and weight 10 and distance 8 in the 32 -bit case...|$|R
