5|$|Njörðr is {{introduced}} in Skáldskaparmál within {{a list of}} 12 Æsir attending a banquet held for Ægir. Further in Skáldskaparmál, the skaldic god Bragi recounds the death of Skaði's father Þjazi by the Æsir. As {{one of the three}} acts of reparation performed by the Æsir for Þjazi's death, Skaði was allowed by the Æsir to choose a husband from amongst them, but given the stipulation that she may not see any part of them but their <b>feet</b> <b>when</b> making the selection. Expecting to choose the god Baldr by the beauty of the feet she selects, Skaði instead finds that she has picked Njörðr.|$|E

5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or <b>feet</b> <b>when</b> side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their <b>feet</b> <b>when</b> visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{determining}} factor is {{strength in the}} legs, feet, ankles, and core. Without strong ankles, feet, and legs dancers are likely to hurt themselves once en pointe or be too weak to remain en pointe {{for the duration of}} a routine. Strong core strength ensures the dancer maintains their center and prevents them from rolling their <b>feet</b> <b>when</b> dancing en pointe.|$|E

25|$|Divine Liturgy of the Last Supper is held on {{the morning}} of Great and Holy Thursday, {{combining}} Vespers with the Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the Holy Table (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and monasteries it is customary for the bishop or hegumen (abbot) to celebrate the Washing of <b>Feet.</b> <b>When</b> it is necessary for an autocephalous church to consecrate more chrysm the primate of that church will consecrate it at this Liturgy.|$|E
25|$|In both, {{the male}} heroes make rash {{promises}} {{after having been}} stricken by the beauty of non-mortal maidens; both enlist the aid of great kings, Arthur and Finrod; both show rings that prove their identities; both are set impossible tasks that include, directly or indirectly, the hunting and killing of ferocious beasts (the wild boars, Twrch Trwyth and Ysgithrywyn, and the wolf Carcharoth) {{with the help of}} a supernatural hound (Cafall and Huan). Both maidens possess such beauty that flowers grow beneath their <b>feet</b> <b>when</b> they come to meet the heroes for the first time, as if they were living embodiments of spring.|$|E

On March 19, Wyatt's 34th birthday, he and James accompanied Morgan's body to Benson, where it was loaded aboard a train for California, watched over by James and two or three friends. They took Morgan to the Earp family home in Colton, California. It was not practical, given Virgil's injuries, to transport him and his wife Allie out of Tombstone {{at the same time as}} Morgan.|$|E

25|$|Japanese patrols were {{infrequent}} and Carey scrambled {{only three}} time in June 1942. In July the squadron received the Hurricane IICs armed with Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannons. On 3 August he damaged the tail plane of a Hurricane {{when he hit}} a tree during a mock-ground attack flight. On 11 September 1942 Carey was flying a high altitude patrol at 25,000 <b>feet</b> <b>when</b> his engine failed and force landed back at the airfield. Three days later he chased a Japanese aircraft out over the sea without success. On 12 October 1942 Carey was promoted to officer commanding 165 Wing RAF at Dum Dum airfield.|$|E
25|$|The lake has had {{a history}} of water level changes. Originally, it was {{essentially}} two lakes connected via a broad channel flowing through a marshy area along the north end. Prior to the dam and flooding much of area was forest and swamp land. The lake was flooded approximately ten <b>feet</b> <b>when</b> William Purdy and his sons dammed the Scugog River at Lindsay (Upstream from the current dam and locks) in 1834 to power his grist mill. During this period of high water levels through the mid-thirties, today's so-called islands of Washburn, Nonquon (now Seven Mile), Ball, Platten, and the enormous centrally located Scugog came into existence as islands. Today, these form part of the mainland, with the exception of Scugog Island, which is generally maintained as an island by man-made channels around the swampy south end of the island.|$|E
25|$|Inside Candlestick Park, {{fewer than}} half of the more than 62,000 fans had reached their seats {{by the time of the}} quake, and the load on the {{structure}} of the stadium was lower than maximum. There had also been a seismic-strengthening project previously completed on the upper deck concrete windscreen that may have prevented large numbers of injuries in the event of serious damage or even a catastrophic collapse. Fans reported that the stadium moved in an articulated manner as the earthquake wave passed through it, that the light standards swayed by many feet, and that the concrete upper deck windscreen moved in a wave-like manner over a distance of several <b>feet.</b> <b>When</b> electrical power to the stadium was lost, someone drove a police car onto the field, where an officer used the car's public address system to advise that the game had been postponed. After the shaking subsided, many of the players on both teams immediately searched for, and gathered, family and friends from the stands before evacuating the facility.|$|E
