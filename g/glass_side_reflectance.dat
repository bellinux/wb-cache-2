50|$|The KX300 is a {{triangular}} unit designed {{so it could}} be used in groups, although many were erected alone. The triangular design of the KX300 ensures acoustic and weather protection. It was also designed to enable full use of available floor space and to provide better siting flexibility. As with the KX100, it has raised sides to prevent litter accumulation.There are two versions, one with two <b>glass</b> <b>sides,</b> the other with one <b>glass</b> <b>side</b> and one fabricated side with acoustic panels and fittings for directory holders. It was essentially {{a triangular}}-based variant of the KX100. Several KX300s were fitted with doors that resemble the KX100 doors, although many were not.|$|R

40|$|Cation {{exchange}} membranes made of blends of sulphonated polyetherether ketone (S-PEEK) and poly(ether sulphone) (PES) were thoroughly characterized {{with respect}} to their concentration polarization properties. Current¿voltage curves and chronopotentiometry reveal some extent of membrane heterogeneity. Membranes cast on a glass plate and dried in air are characterized and the current¿voltage curves are determined for each of the two membrane <b>sides</b> (<b>glass</b> <b>side</b> contact and air side contact). Detailed analysis of the plateau length at the limiting current density reveals differences as the orientation of the membrane towards the feed is changed. The plateau length of the air side of the membrane always shows larger values compared to the <b>glass</b> <b>side.</b> Moreover, we discovered that the plateau length of the <b>glass</b> <b>side</b> remains constant whereas the air side value increases over a period more than 500 h approaching a quasi-equilibrium value, asymptotically. These data are the first ones suggesting an influence of orientation on the concentration polarization behavior as well as relaxation phenomena occurring in cation exchange membranes. The paper discusses strategies to gain new fundamental insight in the relationship between membrane morphology and transport properties by for instance microstructuring the surface...|$|R
