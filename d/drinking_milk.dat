5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at {{home but}} will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis}} of the specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E

25|$|Batman is a 1960s American {{live action}} {{television}} series, {{based on the}} DC comic book character of the same name. It stars Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin – two crime-fighting heroes who defend Gotham City {{from a variety of}} arch villains. It is known for its camp style, upbeat theme music, and its intentionally humorous, simplistic morality (aimed at its largely teenage audience). This included championing the importance of using seat belts, doing homework, eating vegetables, and <b>drinking</b> <b>milk.</b> It was described by executive producer William Dozier as the only situation comedy on the air without a laugh track. 120 episodes aired on the ABC network for three seasons from January 12, 1966, to March 14, 1968, twice weekly for the first two and weekly for the third. In 2016, television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked Batman as the 82nd greatest American television show of all time.|$|E
25|$|The first {{seeks to}} resolve a longstanding debate in {{historical}} linguistics by making a case for the Kurgan hypothesis {{on the origins of}} the Indo-European language group. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the Black and Caspian seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. <b>Drinking</b> <b>milk,</b> from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history’s greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, Scythians, Arabs, or Mongols. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history.

A study published in The BMJ that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in Sweden age 39 and older had similar results. Milk consumption in adults was associated with no protection for men, and an increased risk of fractures in women. The risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent. It was also associated with an increased risk of death in both sexes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBovine fat is {{dispersed}} in {{raw milk}} as natural milk fat globules, {{with an average}} diameter of 4 µm, which are enveloped in a biological membrane, the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). However, dairy processes modify the supramolecular structure and the surface composition of milk fat. Thus, milk fat is present in many dairy products under various forms. In this study, we focused {{on the fact that}} natural milk fat globules are rarely consumed in their native state, i. e. in fresh raw <b>milk.</b> In most <b>drinking</b> <b>milks,</b> fat globules are homogenised in order to avoid their rising at the surface of the products. Furthermore, fat globules are heat treated to avoid the growth of micro-organisms. As a consequence of the technological process applied, the volume-weighted average diameter of fat globules in <b>drinking</b> <b>milks</b> is in the range 0. 2 - 0. 5 µm. Homogenisation of fat globules led to the partial disruption of the MFGM and to the adsorption of milk proteins. Moreover, this study showed that in cheeses, milk fat can be dispersed as (i) fat globules with the MFGM, (ii) aggregates of fat globules, (ii) homogenised fat globules, (iii) free fat and (iv) a combination of different phases and structures. The knowledge of the supramolecular structure of milk fat in dairy products is of primary importance regarding its technological, sensorial and nutritional properties...|$|R

2500|$|Garlic {{is known}} to cause bad breath (halitosis) and body odor, {{described}} as a pungent [...] "garlicky" [...] smell to sweat. This is caused by allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs (and {{from there to the}} mouth, causing bad breath; see garlic breath) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk {{at the same time as}} consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath. Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> afterward.

40|$|Background The {{prevalence}} of lactose malabsorption varies widely throughout the world.

Objective To determine the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in the older age group and whether a change in <b>milk</b> <b>drinking</b> habit can affect it. Methods A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted on 98 children aged between 12 and 14 years (junior high school) in Jakarta. Lactose malabsorption was evaluated with Lactometer Breath Hydrogen Test (Hoek Loes, Amsterdam). <b>Milk</b> <b>drinking</b> habit was recorded, and drinking at least 1 glass of milk everyday since 6 months or more before the study was considered as regular <b>milk</b> <b>drinking.</b> Results This study showed 73 % of the children had lactose malabsorption. Regular <b>milk</b> <b>drinking</b> habit was found in 32 (33 %) children and lactose malabsorption occurred in 26. From 66 children who were irregular milk drinkers, lactose malabsorption was found in 46 (70 %). Lactose intolerance {{was about the same}} in both groups. Conclusion There was an increasing prevalence of lactose malabsorption in older children. <b>Milk</b> <b>drinking</b> habit is a major concern to review the practical implications of lactose malabsorption...|$|R

Monk is afraid of 312 things, including milk, ladybugs, harmonicas, heights, imperfection, claustrophobia, driving, food touching on his plates, messes, and risk. (He has a breakthrough from claustrophobia later in the series.) The OCD and plethora of phobias inevitably lead to very awkward situations and cause problems for Monk and anyone around him as he investigates cases. These same personal struggles, particularly the OCD, are what aid him in solving cases: his sharp memory, specific mindset, and attention to detail.

2500|$|Lactose {{intolerance}} is {{a condition}} in which people have symptoms due to the decreased ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk products. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. These typically start between one half and two hours after <b>drinking</b> <b>milk</b> or eating milk products. Severity depends on the amount a person eats or drinks. It does not cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract. The LCT gene provides the instructions for making lactase. The specific DNA sequence in the MCM6 gene helps control whether the LCT gene is turned on or off. At least several thousand years ago, some humans developed a mutation in the MCM6 gene that keeps the LCT gene turned on even after breast feeding is stopped. People who are lactose intolerant do not have this mutation. [...] The LCT and MCM6 genes are both located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 2 in region 21. The locus can be expressed as 2q21. The lactase deficiency also could be linked to certain heritages. Approximately 75 percent of African Americans, Native Americans, and Jewish Americans are lactose intolerant, as are 90 percent of Asian Americans and 53 percent of Mexican Americans. Analysis of the DNA of 94 ancient skeletons in Europe and Russia concluded that the lactose tolerant mutation appeared about 4,300 years ago and spread throughout the European population.|$|E
