50|$|Prior to sowing, {{the seeds}} {{are subject to}} Rhizobium culture. Seeds are planted preferably in flat beds in rows 30 cm apart and spaced at 10cm, and in depths of less than 5 cm. Farm yard manure or compost is used to enhance the {{fertility}} of the fields before sowing, say at 15 to 20 tons per ha. While sowing, chemicals added are 50 kg N/ha and 40 kg P205/ha, depending on the inherent fertility values of the soil which can be ascertained by testing the soil. Irrigation water is provided immediately after sowing and then after 30, 70-75, 85-90, and 105-110 days; good drainage is facilitated to prevent any water-logging. Other cultivation methods of hoeing and weeding are done as required. Harvesting is done when the lower leaves of the plant start shedding and the pods turn colour. Timely manual harvesting is done by way of cutting using sickles. The harvested plants are tied in bundles and dried for 5-7 days. Threshing, by hand or using mechanical methods, is done to separate the seeds from the plants. A vacuum <b>gravity</b> <b>separator</b> or spiral <b>gravity</b> <b>separator</b> is used to clean the seeds which are then graded. Disinfected jute bags are used to store the graded seeds and they are kept in moisture-free and airy chambers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>separators</b> {{are widely}} used for {{separation}} of gas/oil/water/sand from both offshore and onshore oil production facilities. Estimation of the gas/liquid and oil/water interface levels in <b>gravity</b> <b>separators</b> have been a concern since these parameters are important for reliable operation. Most of the instruments {{on the market today}} do not provide reliable measurements of both gas/liquid and oil/water interface levels. The few instruments that do provide reliable measurements are however based on radioactive principles. Nevertheless these radioactive instruments possess a strong health, safety and environmental risk. An alternative inexpensive, environmentally friendly, accurate and cost effective way for gas/liquid and oil/water interface level estimation based on pressure measurement is presented. The root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for gas/liquid and oil/water interface level estimation from traversing a pressure sensor based on partial least square regression (PLS-R) were 14. 5 mm and 17. 7 mm respectively. A comparison of results from models based on PLS-R and ordinary least square regression (OLS-R) techniques proved that the RMSEP from the PLS-R technique was better in estimating the oil/water interface level {{but in the case of}} gas/liquid interface level estimation the OLS-R technique was slightly better. It was concluded that the PLS-R technique provided a better overall result and is recommended when pressure measurements in combination with multivariate data analysis is applied for gas/liquid and oil/water interface level estimations in <b>gravity</b> <b>separators...</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>gravity</b> <b>separator</b> {{separates}} {{products of}} same size but with difference in specific weight. It has a vibrating rectangular deck, {{which makes it}} easy for the product to travel a longer distance, ensuring improved quality of the end product. The pressurized air in the deck enables the material to split according to its specific weight. As a result, the heavier particles travel to the higher level while the lighter particles travel to the lower level of the deck. It comes with easily adjustable air fans to control the volume of air distribution at different areas of the vibrating deck to meet the air supply needs of the deck. The table inclination, speed of eccentric motion and the feed rate can be precisely adjusted to achieve smooth operation of the machine.|$|E
5000|$|Usually {{the term}} bio-surfactant {{is used for}} the {{surfactants}} of microbial origin. This is because the shorter generation time of microbial biomass compared to biomass of animal or plant origin, makes the production of bio-surfactants using bacteria and fungi more industrially relevant. Furthermore, most of the bio-surfactants produced by microbes are synthesized extracellularly and many microbes are known to produce bio-surfactants in large relative quantities. Both these factors (i.e. extracellular location and high concentration) can make the process of recovery, concentration and purification of microbial bio-surfactants simple and cost effective.

This paper introduces this new compact separator, technological process and performance test. The test results show that the compact separator has good separating effect. When the water-cut inlet is from 50 % to 60 %, and the mixture flow rate is from 40 t/hr to 100 t/hr, the water-cut in oil outlet is less than 5 %, and the oil-cut in water is less than 100 mg/l...|$|R
50|$|Peel {{gave the}} ergot {{business}} the name Universal Laboratories. Production initially began with ergotic rye bought from local farmers. Universal Laboratories staff would then bring the rye through small mills that would {{break up the}} rye kernels. They would then pick the grain from the conveyor belt and let the ergot fall into a receptacle for bagging. The company also hired people to work from their homes in Dassel picking and bagging ergot. Later, the process was improved by new machines that automated the process of separating the ergot from the rye. The grain was passed through mills that would flow into <b>gravity</b> <b>separators,</b> which had spiraling chutes that would separate the light ergot kernels from the heavier rye kernels.|$|R
50|$|Gravity {{separation}} is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. {{the components of}} the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common {{in the sense that they}} all use gravity as the dominant force. One type of <b>gravity</b> <b>separator</b> lifts the material by vacuum over an inclined vibrating screen covered deck. This results in the material being suspended in air while the heavier impurities are left behind on the screen and are discharged from the stone outlet. Gravity {{separation is}} used in a wide variety of industries, and can be most simply differentiated by the characteristics of the mixture to be separated - principally that of 'wet' i.e. - a suspension versus 'dry' -a mixture of granular product. Often other methods are applied to make the separation faster and more efficient, such as flocculation, coagulation and suction. The most notable advantages of the gravitational methods are their cost effectiveness and in some cases excellent reduction. Gravity separation is an attractive unit operation as it generally has low capital and operating costs, uses few if any chemicals that might cause environmental concerns and the recent development of new equipment enhances the range of separations possible.|$|E
50|$|Most fine coffee {{goes through}} a battery of {{machines}} that sort the coffee by density of bean and by bean size, all the while removing sticks, rocks, nails, and miscellaneous debris that may have become mixed with the coffee during drying. First machines blow the beans into the air; those that fall into bins closest to the air source are heaviest and biggest; the lightest (and likely defective) beans plus chaff are blown in the farthest bin. Other machines shake the beans {{through a series of}} sieves, sorting them by size. Finally, a machine called a <b>gravity</b> <b>separator</b> shakes the sized beans on a tilted table, so that the heaviest, densest and best vibrate {{to one side of the}} pulsating table, and the lightest to the other.The final step in the cleaning and sorting procedure is called color sorting, or separating defective beans from sound beans on the basis of color rather than density or size. Color sorting is the trickiest and perhaps most important of all the steps in sorting and cleaning. With most high-quality coffees color sorting is done in the simplest possible way: by hand. Teams of workers pick discolored and other defective beans from the sound beans. The very best coffees may be hand-cleaned twice (double picked) or even three times (triple picked). Coffee that has been cleaned by hand is usually called European preparation; most specialty coffees have been cleaned and sorted in this way.|$|E

The development of classification techniques capable of reducing this variability is instrumental for quality control purposes and the production of high quality C&D aggregate. This paper investigates how the classification of C&D mixed coarse aggregate according to porosity influences the mechanical performance of concrete. Concretes using a variety of C&D aggregate porosity classes and different water/cement ratios were produced and the mechanical properties measured. For concretes produced with constant volume fractions of water, cement, natural sand and coarse aggregate from recycled mixed C&D waste, the compressive strength and Young modulus are direct exponential functions of the aggregate porosity. Sink and float technique is a simple laboratory density separation tool that facilitates the separation of cement particles with lower porosity, a difficult task when done only by visual sorting. For this experiment, separation using a 2. 2 kg/dmA(3) suspension produced recycled aggregate (porosity less than 17 %) which yielded good performance in concrete production.
