5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. The <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> dominated by the primary sector of industry.

Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E
30|$|First, the 2015 {{reform was}} {{implemented}} {{in a very}} complex international and domestic economic and financial environment, largely reflected in the unsynchronized economic cycles and uncoordinated economic policies of major economies. At that time, the US <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> steadily recovering with heightened expectation that the Fed would raise interest rates {{for the first time}} in 8  years, which the Fed did on December 17, 2015. The European and Japanese <b>economies</b> <b>were</b> still clouded with crises with ongoing QE. The emerging <b>economies</b> <b>were</b> largely facing macroeconomic risks and experiencing currency depreciation because of tumbling commodity prices and accelerated capital outflow. Troubled by structural deflation, excess capacity in certain industries and high leverage, the Chinese <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> decelerating and expanded only 6.9  %, the lowest growth rate in 25  years, in 2015.|$|R
