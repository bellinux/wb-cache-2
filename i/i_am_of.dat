5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> {{opinion that}} by the terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator. The remedy for the act complained of {{is provided by the}} statute, as well as the officers to carry it into execution. It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> {{opinion that}} the system is {{applicable}} with certainty and efficiency to the Cornwall Railway. That a sufficient power may be obtained so as to work the trains, which I think your traffic will require, at an average speed of 30 miles an hour for passenger trains, and from 15 to 20 miles an hour for goods, including stoppages in both cases, and that special trains may be despatched at greater speed if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated against innocent civilians by {{individuals and groups}} under the guise to liberate Oromia were abominable crimes and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Whoever that commits such barbaric acts of terror {{in the name of}} liberation struggle should not be tolerated. The killing of innocent civilians and destroying their properties couldn't be justified by any standard. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> the view that a democratic unity on the basis of justice and equality would be of much benefit to the people of Oromia.|$|E

500|$|The Front of Jesus College, {{within these}} few years, {{has been cleared}} from the Bronze of Antiquity, and beautified with a modern Portico. [...] But, with due Submission, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> Opinion, that the {{contiguous}} Eastern Window of the Chapel, which is still absurdly suffered to remain with its antique Mullions and Ramifications, {{is by no means}} of a piece with the rest. [...] I would therefore humbly suggest in it's [...] stead, a spacious Venetian-Window.|$|E

This peculiar cleverness given to the fair sex is a very equitable compensation for their lesser share of strength, a compensation without which women would be not man’s companion but his slave. It is by means of this superiority in talent that she keeps herself his equal and that she governs him while obeying him... She has in her favor only her art and her beauty.|$|E
500|$|Arriving at Wessagusset, Standish {{found that}} many of the Englishmen had gone to live with the Massachusetts, and he ordered them to be called back to Wessagusset. [...] Pecksuot was a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group {{threatening}} Wessagusset; he came to the settlement with Wituwamat and other warriors the day after Standish's arrival. [...] Standish claimed simply to be in Wessagusset on a trading mission, but Pecksuot said to Hobbamock, [...] "Let him begin when he dare... he shall not take us unawares." [...] Later in the day, Pecksuot approached Standish, looking down on him, and said, [...] "You are a great captain, yet you are but a little man. Though I be no sachem, yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> great strength and courage." ...|$|E

500|$|Lawson met {{journalist}} John Diamond in 1986, {{when they}} were both writing for The Sunday Times. They married in Venice in 1992, and have a daughter, Cosima, and a son, Bruno. Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> you and what you have become. The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her [...] "Morbidobox".|$|E
500|$|Andreas Heldal-Lund, {{founder of}} the Scientology-critical website and {{non-profit}} organization Operation Clambake, released a statement criticizing the digital assault against Scientology. Heldal-Lund commented, [...] "People {{should be able to}} have easy access to both sides and make up their own opinions. Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people. I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion." [...] He also stated that [...] "Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card ... They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy." ...|$|E
500|$|Alfred Bem postulates in Dramatizatsiia breda that The Landlady {{incorporates}} autobiographical elements. Influenced by Freud's psychoanalysis, {{he argued}} that Ordynov's familial relationship with Katerina and Murin was similar to Dostoyevsky's own, and found reflections of the writer's affair with Avdotya Panayeva, whom he met within her husband's political circle. Bem states that tiring quarrels between circle members Nikolay Nekrasov and Ivan Turgenev worsened Dostoyevsky's health, although he had stress problems prior to working on The Landlady. Elements of Gothic literature were also detected in the story's dark atmosphere, and the strange character {{of the relationship between}} Katerina and Ordynov. [...] believes that the novella discusses good and evil. The critic Stanisław Mackiewicz stated that he found [...] "the key to understand its symbolic content and Belinsky's fierce rejection. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> the belief that the young person represents the Russian intelligence, and the woman with the expressive name 'The Landlady' the Russian folk, while the haunted fortuneteller echoes the religious beliefs of that folk and especially the schismatic Old Believers." ...|$|E

500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> the school of thought that every little bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E
500|$|One {{consequence}} of the Cornwallis Code was that it, in effect, institutionalised racism in the legal system. [...] Cornwallis, in a manner not uncommon at the time, believed that well-bred gentlemen of European extraction were superior to others, including those that were the product of mixed relationships in India. [...] Of the latter, he wrote [...] "as on account of their colour & extraction they are considered {{in this country as}} inferior to Europeans, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> opinion that those of them who possess the best abilities could not command that authority and respect which is necessary in the due discharge of the duty of an officer." [...] In 1791 he issued an order that [...] "No person, the son of a Native Indian, shall henceforward be appointed by this Court to Employment in the Civil, Military, or Marine Service of the Company." [...] Cornwallis's biographers, the Wickwires, also observe that this institutionalisation of the British as an elite class simply added another layer on top of the complex status hierarchy of caste and religion that existed in India at the time. Cornwallis could not have formalised these policies without the (tacit or explicit) agreement of the company's directors and employees.|$|E

"For {{the reasons}} set forth below, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> {{the opinion that}} federal courts do {{have the power to}} award damages for {{violation}} of 'constitutionally protected interests' and I agree with the Court that a traditional judicial remedy such as damages is appropriate to the vindication of the personal interests protected by the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on the {{upcoming}} 2016 election, Guthrie {{identified himself as}} an independent {{and said he was}} [...] "equally suspicious of Democrats as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>of</b> Republicans".
