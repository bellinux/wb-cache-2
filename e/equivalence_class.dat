5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an <b>equivalence</b> <b>class</b> {{will have the same}} number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each <b>equivalence</b> <b>class</b> and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of the}} <b>equivalence</b> <b>class.</b> We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each <b>equivalence</b> <b>class.</b> Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
5|$|An {{enumeration}} technique {{based on}} band generation was developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.

5|$|Felgenhauer/Jarvis catalogued the Band1 {{permutations}} using lexicographical ordered IDs {{based on}} the ordered digits from blocks B2,3.

40|$|In Experiment 1, {{subjects}} acquired conditional <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> {{controlled by}} three male and three female names as contextual stimuli. When equivalence relations were tested using new names {{not used in}} training (three male and three female), contextual control remained intact. Thus, generalized control of the composition of conditional <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> by characteristically gender-identified names was shown. A basic analysis of this finding was tested in Experiment 2. Contextual <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> were established using as contextual stimuli nonrepresentational visual figures that were members of additional pretrained three-member <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes.</b> When other stimuli in the pretrained <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> were used as contextual stimuli, the conditional <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> remained intact. Control subjects showed that this effect depended on the equivalence relations established in pretraining. The results show that contextual control over <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> can transfer through <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes.</b> The implications of this phenomenon for social stereotyping are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{define and}} discuss the utility of two <b>equivalence</b> graph <b>classes</b> over which a {{spectral}} projector-based graph Fourier transform is equivalent: isomorphic <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> and Jordan <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes.</b> Isomorphic <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> show that the transform is equivalent up to a permutation on the node labels. Jordan <b>equivalence</b> <b>classes</b> permit identical transforms over graphs of nonidentical topologies and allow a basis-invariant characterization of total variation orderings of the spectral components.

5|$|For {{each of the}} Band1 {{equivalence}} classes, {{all possible}} Band2,3 solutions need to be enumerated. An outer Band1 loop iterates over the 44 equivalence classes.

5|$|The {{following}} sequence demonstrates mapping a band configuration to a counting symmetry <b>equivalence</b> <b>class.</b> Begin with a valid band configuration (1). Build column triplets {{by ordering}} the column values within each column. This {{is not a}} valid Sudoku band, but does place the same constraints on the lower bands as the example (2). Construct an <b>equivalence</b> <b>class</b> ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column and box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column and box ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID {{will have the same}} number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this process can be used to build the largest possible band counting symmetry equivalence classes (3).|$|E
5|$|Counting {{symmetry}} partitions valid Band1 permutations into {{classes that}} place the same completion constraints on lower bands; {{all members of}} a band counting symmetry <b>equivalence</b> <b>class</b> must have {{the same number of}} grid completions since the completion constraints are equivalent. Counting symmetry constraints are identified by the Band1 column triplets (a column value set, no implied element order). Using band counting symmetry, a minimal generating set of 44 equivalence classes was established.|$|E

5|$|In a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis {{analyzed}} the permutations {{of the top}} band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence classes for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each <b>equivalence</b> <b>class.</b> Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by class size, gives {{the total number of}} solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second enumeration technique based on band generation was later developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry <b>equivalence</b> <b>class</b> only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E
