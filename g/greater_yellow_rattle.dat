40|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> is a hemiparasitic weed that is {{becoming}} increasingly problematic in hay fields in the northeastern United States. The biomass of <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> was assessed in two experiments in which commercially available soil amendments were applied to an infested hay field under no-till management. The amendments were applied {{in the fall of}} 2010 and 2011 and included wood ash, biochar, hardwood sawdust, lime, and K. Wood ash applied at a rate of 8, 967 kg ha− 1 (4 tons per acre) had the greatest suppressive effect and reduced <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass the following summer by 86 and 92 % relative to the untreated control in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Two additional treatments included in Experiment 2, a doubled rate of wood ash and sawdust applied at a rate of 13, 450 kg ha− 1, also reduced <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass. No other treatments affected <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass. A partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analysis that included aboveground plant community and soil biochemical data explained only 42. 4 % of the variation in <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> biomass, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for the suppression of <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> by wood ash and sawdust are complex. Amending hay fields with wood ash or sawdust may be an effective nonherbicide strategy for managing <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> infestations. Additional research will be required to determine the mechanisms and generality of <b>yellow</b> <b>rattle</b> suppression by wood ash and sawdust amendments to the soil...|$|R
