5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{seen in the}} breed are currently in flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of the breed closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. Some members of the breed closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. Some members of the breed are branded on the left <b>hindquarter.</b> Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E
500|$|Some Arabians, {{though not}} all, have 5 lumbar {{vertebrae}} {{instead of the}} usual 6, and 17 pairs of ribs rather than 18. A quality Arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled pelvis as well as good croup length and depth to the hip (determined by the length of the pelvis), that allows agility and impulsion. A misconception confuses the topline of the croup with the angle of the [...] "hip" [...] (the pelvis or ilium), leading some to assert that Arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly. However, the croup is formed by the sacral vertebrae. The hip angle is determined by the attachment of the ilium to the spine, the structure and length of the femur, and other aspects of <b>hindquarter</b> anatomy, which is not correlated to the topline of the sacrum. Thus, the Arabian has conformation typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance, such as the Thoroughbred, where the angle of the ilium is more oblique than that of the croup. Thus, the hip angle is not necessarily correlated to the topline of the croup. Horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles, and so unlike angle, length of hip and croup do go together as a rule.|$|E

50|$|There is a dissenting opinion, {{that being}} that the animal held in Tranquillitas’s hand is not a dragon, but rather a capricornus, which would tie in with the {{maritime}} theme of the transportation of Egypt’s grain harvest across the Mediterranean to Rome.

According to myth, Pan’s transmutation into a capricornus was to escape the wrath of Typhon - and occurred as Pan threw himself into a river. The capricornus was often depicted on Roman coinage in conjunction with a rudder, again tying to the maritime transport so critical in moving grain into Rome.|$|E
5000|$|Trace clip: varies, but {{generally}} {{the horse is}} clipped from under its throat, down along the jugular groove, and then clipped halfway up the shoulder and belly. Variations include clipping higher along the neck, shoulder, and belly, and clipping a strip {{off the side of}} the <b>hindquarter,</b> to the buttock. Additionally, many clip a strip halfway up the cheek to the muzzle. The back and legs are left unclipped. The clip is named after the traces of the carriage, as it follows a similar pattern. The amount of hair removed is based on the work the horse is in, the amount it sweats during work, and the areas where it sweats the most. It is most commonly seen used by eventers.|$|E

5000|$|Santanaraptor (meaning [...] "Santana Formation thief") is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{that lived}} in South America during the Early Cretaceous (late Aptian-early Albian), about 112 million years ago.

While primarily known from <b>hindquarter</b> elements, the individual represented by the fossil may have reached 1.25 m in length. The fossil consists of bones from the pelvis, hindlimbs, and tail. These provide little information on its overall appearance. However, it was definitely a coelurosaur, and a few of its details suggest that it might {{be a member of the}} tyrannosauroids. It is presumed to be similar to Dilong and Guanlong in that it had long arms, three fingered hands, and slim hindlimbs.

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the hypothalamus produces cardiovascular adjustments consisting of hypertension, tachycardia, visceral vasoconstriction and hindlimb vasodilation. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} hindlimb vasodilation is due a reduction of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone and to activation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors by catecholamine release. However, the existence of a yet unidentified vasodilator mechanism has also been proposed. Recent studies have suggested that nitric oxide (NO) may be involved. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the role of NO in the <b>hindquarter</b> vasodilation in response to hypothalamic stimulation. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats hypothalamic stimulation (100 Hz, 150 µA, 6 s) produced hypertension, tachycardia, <b>hindquarter</b> vasodilation and mesenteric vasoconstriction. Alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine (1. 5 mg/kg, iv) plus bilateral adrenalectomy did not modify hypertension, tachycardia or mesenteric vasoconstriction induced by hypothalamic stimulation. <b>Hindquarter</b> vasodilation was strongly reduced but not abolished. The remaining vasodilation was completely abolished after iv injection of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (20 mg/kg, iv). To properly evaluate the role of the mechanism of NO in <b>hindquarter</b> vasodilation, in a second group of animals L-NAME was administered before alpha-adrenoceptor blockade plus adrenalectomy. L-NAME treatment strongly reduced <b>hindquarter</b> vasodilation in magnitude and duration. These results suggest that NO is involved in the <b>hindquarter</b> vasodilation produced by hypothalamic stimulation...|$|E
