This reduces the loss of solvent {{allowing}} the mixture to be heated for extended periods. Condensers are used in distillation to cool the hot vapors, condensing them into liquid for separate collection. For fractional distillation, an air or Vigreux condenser is usually used to slow {{the rate at which}} the hot vapors rise, giving a better separation between the different components in the distillate. For microscale distillation, the apparatus includes the [...] "pot", and the condenser fused into one-piece, which reduces the <b>hold-up</b> <b>volume,</b> and obviates the need for ground glass joints preventing contamination by grease and precluding leaks.|$|E

The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to develop a control strategy for the operation of an equalization tank upstream of a waste water treatment plant which utilizes the available equalization <b>hold-up</b> <b>volume</b> in such a manner that it reduces, optimally, diurnal fluctuations in both influent flow and load rates. The influent to a wastewater treatment plant generally exhibits wide diurnal variations in both flow rate and concentration, and consequently in load rate (defined as the product of flow rate and concentration). Deviations of these parameters from steady state cause plant operating problems in areas such as aeration control (due to load rate fluctuations) settling tank overloading due to flow rate fluctuations) and/or over- or under-aeration which affects settling properties, and others...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnnular {{centrifugal}} contactors (ACCs) use {{centrifugal force}} {{to mix and}} separate two immiscible liquids of different densities. The compact size, small liquid <b>hold-up</b> <b>volume,</b> short liquid residence time and high efficiency of ACCs have made them be favored for nuclear processes and destined to play a more important role for future advanced nuclear processing schemes. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can provide a more complete understanding of the flow within the ACC for further advancements in design and operation of future ACCs. In this paper, CFD simulations of the air/water two-phase flow in the mixing zone of the ACC were carried out.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a predictive experimentally verified computational fluid dynamic (CFD) three phase model. It predicts the gas, liquid and solid <b>hold-ups</b> (<b>volume</b> fractions) and flow patterns in the industrially important bubble-coalesced (churn-turbulent) regime. The input into the model can be either particulate viscosities as measured with a Brookfield viscometer or effective restitution coefficient for particles. A combination of x-ray and {gamma}-ray densitometers was used to measure solid and liquid volume fractions. There is a fair agreement between the theory and the experiment. A CCD camera was used to measure instantaneous particle velocities. There is a good agreement between the computed time average velocities and the measurements. There is an excellent agreement between the viscosity of 800 {micro}m glass beads obtained from measurement of granular temperature (random kinetic energy of particles) and the measurement using a Brookfield viscometer. A relation between particle Reynolds stresses and granular temperature was found for developed flow. Such measurement and computations gave a restitution coefficient for a methanol catalyst to be about 0. 9. A transient, two-dimensional hydrodynamic model for production of methanol from syn-gas in an Air Products/DOE LaPorte slurry bubble column reactor was developed. The model predicts downflow of catalyst at the walls and oscillatory particle and gas flow at the center, with a frequency of about 0. 7 Hertz. The computed temperature variation in the rector with heat exchangers was only about 5 K, indicating good thermal management. The computed slurry height, the gas holdup and the rate of methanol production agree with LaPorte's reported data. Unlike the previous models in the literature, this model computes the gas and the particle holdups and the particle rheology. The only adjustable parameter in the model is the effective particle restitution coefficient...|$|R

40|$|A fixed-film (biofilm) reactor was {{designed}} and its performance was determined at various retention times. The goal was to find the optimal retention time for recycling plant nutrients in an advanced life support system, to minimize the size, mass, and <b>volume</b> (<b>hold-up)</b> of a production model. The prototype reactor was tested with aqueous leachate from wheat crop residue at 24, 12, 6, and 3 h hydraulic retention times (HRTs). Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrates and other plant nutrients, carbohydrates, total phenolics, and microbial counts were monitored to characterize reactor performance. BOD removal decreased significantly from 92 % at the 24 h HRT to 73 % at 3 h. Removal of phenolics was 62 % at the 24 h retention time, but 37 % at 3 h. Dissolved oxygen concentrations, nitric acid consumption, and calcium and magnesium removals were also affected by HRT. Carbohydrate removals, carbon dioxide (CO 2) productions, denitrification, potassium concentrations, and microbial counts were not affected by different retention times.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is to gain insight into the {{behaviour}} of two-phase flow in horizontal and downward inclined pipes. An experimental flow facility was built to investigate flow patterns developed over three pipe orientations of 0 º, - 15 º and - 30 º, using air-water as the fluid combination and a 19 mm diameter test section. Superficial velocities for air ranged from 0. 5 to 5. 0 m/s with an increment of 0. 5 m/s and for water from 0. 1 m/s to 0. 9 m/s with a 0. 1 m/s increment. Flow visualization was conducted for flow pattern identification, and a high-speed video system was employed to obtain image sequence of the flow under different pre-selected conditions. Flow pattern maps were developed showing the effect of pipe orientation on flow pattern transition. Liquid <b>hold-up,</b> using a <b>volume</b> collection method, and pressure drop, using a differential pressure transducer, were measured. Also, stratified to slug flow transition regime in horizontal pipes was investigated using a non-intrusive optical technique – Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) – to evaluate the velocity field of the liquid phase. This was achieved by {{the application of a}} PIV laser-induced fluorescence technique (LIF), whereby seeding particles impregnated with fluorescent dye (Rhodamine B); Fluorescent Polymer Particles 20 - 50 micrometers, 100 g was used. The main aim here was to attain a thorough physical understanding of the internal flow structure of the two-phase flow transition regime with a view to providing an experimental database of results to the CFD research community for the validation of their numerical predictions. In particular, experimental data has been acquired {{in the form of an}} instantaneous velocity field (radial and axial velocities in the vertical cross section of the pipeline as well as distribution of velocity magnitude) together with the resulting vorticity field in the liquid phase.

40|$|Debris {{transport}} on {{the containment}} floor following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) of the Advanced Power Reactor (APR) 1400 plant is calculated. The plant {{does not have}} a switchover to recirculation operation and, thus, requires a fully transient analysis of debris transport. To calculate the flow field in a practical computational time and reasonable accuracy, two-dimensional Shallow Water Equations are solved using the Finite Volume Method. An approximate Riemann solver, Harten-Laxvan Leer (HLL) scheme is used to capture dry-to-wet interface. To calculate the debris particle transport, a simple two-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking model including a drag force is developed. Some efficient schemes are implemented to search a hosting cell, to determine the intersection of a particle trajectory with a cell side, and to find the reflected position of particle. The hydraulic solver is validated with an open channel flow experiment.

40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to test the}} feasibility of using the foam technology to separate polyphenols from fruit juices for use as functional food ingredients. The separation performance, expressed as enrichment ratio, selectivity and percentage recovery, was determined {{as a function of}} operating variables, namely air or N 2 flow rate, initial feed concentration, bubble size, solution pH and the presence of alcohol to modify the surface tension. Measurements were made of the average bubble size and gas <b>hold-up</b> <b>volume</b> to calculate interfacial area. The bulk phase concentrations of the polyphenolics in the feed and foam fractions were analysed for total phenolic content by Folin assay and phenolic composition by reverse phase HPLC. Enrichment factors of up to 6 were found under optimum conditions of low sugar concentration (6 - 9 oBrix), low flow rate (0. 2 - 0. 6 ml min- 1) and acidic pH (3 - 4). However recoveries were low at around 30 % of total phenolics and selectivity was poor. It was concluded that foam fractionation represents a potential low cost technology to recover a proportion of the polyphenolic content in an enriched juice concentrate suitable for use as a functional ingredient...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} an {{efficient}} process flow-sheet requires accurate extraction data for experimental set-up used. Often this data is provided as equilibrium data. Due {{to the small}} <b>hold-up</b> <b>volume</b> compared to the flow rate in centrifugal contactors the time for extraction is often too short to reach equilibrium D-ratios. In this work single stage kinetics experiments {{have been carried out}} to investigate the D-ratio dependence of the flow rate and to compare this with equilibrium batch experiments for a SANEX system based on CyMe 4 -BTBP. The first centrifuge experiment was run with spiked solutions while in the second a genuine actinide/lanthanide fraction from a TODGA process was used. Three different flow rates were tested with each set-up. the results show that even with low flow rates, only around 9 % of the equilibrium D-ratio (Am) was reached for the extraction in the spiked test and around 16 % in the hot test (the difference is due {{to the size of the}} centrifuges). In the hot test the lanthanide scrubbing was inefficient whereas in the stripping both the actinides and the lanthanides showed good results.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{contributes}} to theoretical {{advances in the}} conception, modelling and design of multi-scale fluidic elements, namely fluid distributors. The function of such fluid distributors is to deliver a controlled amount or rate of fluid to an array of distributing ports, in order for example to feed uniformly the channels of a multi-tubular heat exchanger, or of a catalytic monolith, or any other fluid-handling engineering apparatus. In recent years, distributors based on multi-scale channel networks, of fractal tree type, have been developed. The theoretical approach presented allows to design such distributors optimally, within certain constraints. The basis of the optimization is a compromise between “costs” related to pressure drop and viscous dissipation on one hand, and <b>hold-up</b> <b>volume</b> of the pore structure on the other hand. The calculations lead to geometric scaling laws, that is to relations between {{the dimensions of the}} channels at the different scales. Scaling relations are also established for different characteristic quantities, such as pressure drop, viscous dissipation power, volume fractions, wall surfaces, cost functions. An example of design procedure is given, and examples of distributors fabricated by stereolithography is shown...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{models of}} both {{packed-bed}} and stacked-membrane chromatography typically attribute elution band broadening to non-idealities within the column. However, when the column length to diameter ratio is greatly reduced, as in stacked-membrane chromatography, variations in solute residence times within the feed-distribution (inlet) and eluent-collection (outlet) manifolds can {{also contribute to}} band broadening. We report on a new zonal rate model (ZRM) for stacked-membrane chromatography that improves on existing <b>hold-up</b> <b>volume</b> models that rely on one plug-flow reactor and one stirred-tank reactor in series to describe dispersion of solute during transport {{into and out of}} the column. The ZRM radially partitions the membrane stack and the hold-up volumes within the inlet and outlet manifolds into zones to better capture non-uniform flow distribution effects associated with the large column diameter to height ratio. Breakthrough curves from a scaled-down anion-exchange membrane chromatography module using ovalbumin as a model protein were collected at flow rates ranging from 1. 5 to 20 mL min(- 1) under non-binding conditions and used to evaluate the ZRM as well as previous models. The ZRM was shown to be significantly more accurate in describing protein dispersion and breakthrough. The model was then used to decompose breakthrough data, where it was found that variations in solute residence time distributions within the inlet and outlet manifolds make the dominant contribution to solute dispersion over the recommended range of feed flow rates. The ZRM therefore identifies manifold design as a critical contributor to separation quality within stacked-membrane chromatography units...|$|E
40|$|Bubble {{inclusion}} {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing operations practiced in the food industry. A variety of aerated foods is currently available in supermarkets, and newer products are emerging all the time. This paper aims to combine knowledge on chocolate aeration with studies performed on bubble formation and dispersion characteristics. More specifically, we have investigated bubble formation induced by applying vacuum. Experimental methods to determine gas <b>hold-up</b> (<b>volume</b> fraction of air), bubble section distributions along specific planes, and chocolate rheological properties are presented. This study concludes that decreasing pressures elevate gas hold-up values due to an increase in the number of bubble nuclei being formed and release of a greater volume of dissolved gases. Furthermore, bubbles are observed to be larger at lower pressures for a set amount of gas because the internal pressure needs to be in equilibrium with the surrounding pressures. Temperature-induced changes to the properties of the chocolate have less of an effect on bubble formation. On the other hand, when different fats and emulsifiers are added to a standard chocolate recipe, milk fat was found to increase, significantly, the gas hold-up values and the mean bubble-section diameters. It is hypothesized that this behavior is related to the way milk fats, which contain different fatty acids to cocoa butter, crystallize and influence the setting properties of the final product. It is highlighted that apparent viscosity values at low shear rate, as well as setting behavior, play an important role in terms of bubble formation and entrainment...|$|E
