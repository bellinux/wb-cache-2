50|$|Nuclear {{criticality}} {{safety is}} a field of nuclear engineering dedicated to the prevention of nuclear and radiation accidents resulting from an inadvertent, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Additionally, nuclear criticality safety is concerned with mitigating {{the consequences of a}} nuclear criticality accident. A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve fissile material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of radiation. Nuclear criticality safety practitioners attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in fissile material operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials. A common practice is to apply a <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> analysis to the operation in which two or more independent, concurrent and unlikely changes in process conditions must occur before a nuclear criticality accident can occur. For example, the first change in conditions may be complete or partial flooding and the second change a re-arrangement of the fissile material. Controls (requirements) on process parameters (e.g., fissile material mass, equipment) result from this analysis. These controls, either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), are implemented by inherently safe or fault-tolerant plant designs, or, if such designs are not practicable, by administrative controls such as operating procedures, job instructions and other means to minimize the potential for significant process changes {{that could lead to a}} nuclear criticality accident.|$|E

Some cases are cited, and the criticality safety evaluation of contaminated combustible waste collectors is considered in detail. The criticality safety evaluation for combustible collectors is based on applying one very good control to the one controllable parameter. Safety can only be defended when the contingency of excess density {{is limited to a}} credible value based on process knowledge.

40|$|Purpose • This article {{investigates the}} {{emergence}} of subsystems in societies {{as a solution to}} the <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> problem. Context • There are two underlying paradigms: one is radical constructivism in the sense that perturbations are at the centre of the self-organising processes; the other is Luhmann’s <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> problem, where agents learn anticipations from each other. Approach • Central to our investigation is a computer simulation where we place agents into an arena. These agents can learn to (a) collect food and/or (b) steal food from other agents. In order to analyse subsystem formation, we investigate whether agents use both behaviours or just one of these, which is equivalent to determining the number of self-referential loops. This is detected with a novel measure that we call “prediction utilisation. ” Results • During the simulation, symmetry breaking is observed. The system of agents divides itself up into two subsystems: one where agents just collect food and another one where agents just steal food from other agents. The ratio between these two populations is determined by the amount of food available...|$|E

40|$|When {{we are to}} {{introduce}} the interpretative dynamic role process against 'homo sociologicus, ' we are confronted with the problem how to capture the various reality systematically. By coupling the 'complementarity of expectations ' with balance theory, we formally propose a cognitive framework to analyze the <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> role relationship. Through conceptual discussions, we introduce two basic signed graphs: the unit graph T that presents the in-personal role regulation and the <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> graph G in which two unit graphs are connected by the two inter-unit lines. While the signs of inter-unit lines, that inter-personally connect role-expectations, determine the complementarity in G, the signs of G's cycles determine the balance of G. With regard to G's balance, two theorems are derived. The first states that T's imbalance is the sufficient condition of G's imbalance, and the second states that one positive cycle in G larger than 3 -cycle is the sufficient condition of the balance of G that is composed of balanced T. Utilizing these theorems, we systematically classify the role relationship represented by G, and discuss about the substantial meaning that some paradoxical cases imply...|$|E

In addition, {{there are always}} unexpected outages in the system due to component failures or protection system incorrect actions. Power systems likely face with the condition that one, two, or more components are out of service. Dealing with power system assessments in contingency conditions is hence crucial for the system operators [5, 27]. Note as well that since the higher order of contingencies are of trivial probabilities, usually single and <b>double</b> outage <b>contingencies</b> are merely accounted for in system studies. However, power system resilience analysis calls for low probability but very sever disturbances.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the study of electrical power system security analysis in steady state. The problem consists in identifying quickly and precisely the contingencies which create thermal constraints violations. The suggested approach is based on the use of artificial intelligence techniques and specifically on expert systems. Who says expert system, says knowledge. This thesis presents different approaches for knowledge acquisition. It is proposed to exploit quantitative as well as qualitative knowledge. An approach based on the systematic analysis of single contingencies is advanced to establish a quantitative knowledge base. The method consists in quantifying the effect of each branch on the other branches of the power system. The knowledge base can be used in two different ways. On the one hand, it allows the estimation of the power flows in a branch following a single contingency around the working point for which it has ken established. This first use could be also extended to the analysis of <b>double</b> <b>contingencies</b> by considering the contingencies for which the superposition principle can be applied. On the other hand, this same knowledge base could be used to automatically extract rules for a contingency. Rules are extracted by considering similarities between the knowledge bases obtained for different characteristic operating states. This thesis also deals with knowledge obtained by experienced power system operators. The rules are expressed by considering the main factors which allow a qualitative identification of the critical contingencies. An approach based on fuzzy filtering is recommended to process the knowledge. Furthermore, this work presents a study of contingency ranking methods by order of severity. The methods performances are analyzed with the intention of integrating them within an expert system. The different knowledge forms collected and developed have allowed the development of an expert system prototype. The prototype performances have been evaluated by considering the Swiss utility system. The proposed approach is greatly time-saving in comparison with a classical approach based on the use of a power flow calculation, while maintaining an acceptable results precision...|$|R
3000|$|In this example, {{the method}} {{requires}} three iterations to converge {{to a minimum}} cost solution, when no better solutions are found by adding additional SPS failure modes to secure against. In this case, the solution κ _ 3 {{is equal to the}} global optimum found by enumeration of all possible candidates. The method starts with the base case κ _ 0 =κ (Q_ 0) that has a large optimality gap, largely due to the loss-of-load risk X. The root cause to this high exposure is that all selected generators are located at Bus 22, which increases the risk from a common mode failure at this bus. In the first iteration, the method generates and evaluates a variety of SPS configurations that differ from the base case. The best of these, κ _ 1, [...] is found by securing the system against the common fault at Bus 22 when the most onerous contingency (lines 25 and 26) occurs. It reduces the risk X by diversifying the SPS capacity among Buses 18, 21 and 22, and by committing an additional 100  MW of SPS capacity. The next two iterations provide further robustness to the SPS in case of the <b>double</b> line <b>contingency</b> event, securing the system against the common failure to trip generation in Bus 21 and a failure to trip generator 1 in Bus 18. This is achieved by committing an extra 100   MW of generation in Bus 22.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1992 This {{research}} addresses {{two aspects}} of voltage security in electric transmission systems. First, the efficient assessment of steady state security with respect to all plausible single and <b>double</b> line <b>contingencies</b> is investigated. Second, detection and avoidance of a dynamic voltage collapse event is investigated. This dissertation develops an expert system called SEEKS which assesses steady state voltage security by intelligently select line outages likely to cause steady state voltage violations. Outages are assessed {{in the context of}} the local topology and operating condition, using heuristics derived from operational planning experience. Information about topology is captured by grouping buses into neighborhoods (or structures), useful for comparing the impact of outages connected to the same structure. Using operational planning concepts, SEEKS tries to identify only the most severe outage amongst sets of outages in the same neighborhood. This assumes that remedial control used to compensate for the most severe outage will correct the violations caused by other outages in the same neighborhood. The worst outages are evaluated by running fast decoupled power flows. When voltage violations are found, remedial action consisting of capacitor, transformer, and generator adjustments is investigated. The results provide a sufficient but non-optimal set of controls for removing violations. This dissertation also develops an algorithm for local detection and remedial control of an imminent voltage collapse in real-time. The detection scheme monitors each load bus voltage and reactive load demand in the time domain, looking for an indication of imminent collapse at each bus. Once a collapse is detected at a bus, the remedial control scheme calculates the amount of control necessary to steer the system voltages away from the collapse. Imminent collapse is monitored by using continuously updated Thevenin equivalents at each load bus. The stability of the first order system consisting of the load bus reactive demand and the equivalent is continuously evaluated. When this system approaches instability, the remedial control scheme is triggered. The remedial control set consists of switchable capacitors and load shedding. The remedial scheme attempts to minimize both the load shedding and the total amount of control applied by iteratively applying remedial control...|$|R

After removal from the containers, the plutonium metal buttons or plutonium bearing materials will be placed into muffle furnace boats and then be sent to one of the muffle furnace gloveboxes for stabilization.

30|$|Luhmann [1] – {{one of the}} {{pioneering}} and key contributors in present day discussions of trust – argued that trust is an important means of facing the uncertainty of complexity. This uncertainty results from the problem of <b>double</b> <b>contingency.</b> <b>Double</b> <b>contingency</b> emerges in every social situation as in the most basic one, namely in interaction between alter and ego. Both are black boxes for each other because they cannot know what the other is really up to. They can only make assumptions based on attempts {{to understand what the}} other’s intentions could be. The ongoing assumption amounts to a complexity which inhibits both communication and the undertaking of action. Under these circumstances, by directing expectations and attention trust reduces this basic complexity and absorbs uncertainty [ibid.]. In the face of deficient knowledge about future events and situations, it enables actors to be confident of success even if there is no guarantee [2 : 265]. In addition to this, trust also has an affective component and especially an action-related one [3]. Trust provides a sense of certainty and creates a sense of coherence, so that communication, decision-making and action-taking are possible. This is owing to the fact that trust-givers, despite uncertain knowledge about the future, still assume that their expectations will be fulfilled. Trust is a means by which people can react to basic uncertainty. Due to the unpredictable nature of other’s actions, this basic uncertainty can also take on the form of a danger of failure. This danger can then turn into risk [1]. Thus, danger has by no means been eliminated, but becomes limited due to observable, explicit expectations as expressed as trust [4 : 370]. However in our complex modern society trust between people is no longer sufficient. Instead social complexity can only be sufficiently reduced by trust in the system(s), and more importantly, in organisations.|$|E

In Luhmann"s systems theory "intransparency", that is, the problem that one has no access to the mind of someone else, seems to be analogous to "Privatheit". Do the epistemological problems (of solipsim and semantical scepticism) implicated by the privatist concept therefore return in systems theory? In my opinion, Luhmann addressed these problems by introducing the notion of "double contingency" in the communication. On the basis of a systematic comparison between the two terms "Privatheit" and "intransparency", I argue that the model of "double contingency" is not necessarily bound to the concept of "Privatheit".

A first step is therefore taken to capture the role of the public in communication societies theoretically by what may be called ‘triple contingency’.

30|$|Furthermore, {{social systems}} arise from <b>double</b> <b>contingency.</b> Usually, space does not {{react to the}} observers’ {{movements}} unless it has been intentionally constructed for this purpose. 19 In social systems, the observer who is aware that he is object of an anticipatory behaviour by his communication partner will for sure anticipate such anticipation. Consequently, {{a more or less}} unpredictable situation arises (e.g., when partners play chess). In other words, both system and environment are performing an anticipatory behaviour. For instance, politics is simultaneously system and environment: it is an autonomous social system and an (anticipatory) environment for other social systems as economy. When politics tries to anticipate economic reactions by means of political decisions, economy reacts anticipatorily. The financial crisis has clearly demonstrated that an unpredictable situation thus arises. As a consequence, to speak of anticipatory systems is not enough; we should also speak of anticipatory environments and ask the question “How is it possible for a system to behave anticipatorily when it interacts with an anticipatory environment?”. 20 Anticipation turns into a reflexive performance, and second-order anticipations arise from such reflexivity.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Whereas the voluminous work of Niklas Luhmann (1927 – 98) can be {{considered}} as a major focus of discussions in theoretical sociology in the Germanspeaking world, it has only been translated sporadically and remains widely unknown in the English-speaking world. This review article provides a general introduction to Luhmann’s systems theory. Section I embeds systems theory in a broader philosophical context and traces its particular legacy. It demonstrates, in contrast to Luhmann’s rhetoric of starting afresh, that his theory inherits and reformulates the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl. In Section II, Luhmann’s basic concept of system is developed, modeled on his early understanding of formal organization. The epistemological and ontological uncertainty that lies beneath the necessity of organizing proves to be the raison d’être of social systems in general. Finally, in Section III, the problem of uncertainty is translated into a situation of <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> which, according to Luhmann, makes up the core of every form of socialization.

The FTA considered the annual rate of occurrence for the events identified as potential causes of criticality issues. This report also examines the advantages of using this type of evaluation to assess the removal process for additional components and equipment...|$|E

One activity at SRS is the Container Surveillance and Storage Capability (CSSC) Project, which will perform surveillances on 3013 containers (hereafter {{referred to as}} 3013 s) to verify that they meet the Department of Energy (DOE) Standard (STD) 3013 for plutonium storage. The project will handle quantities of material that are greater than ANS/ANSI- 8. 1 single parameter mass limits, and thus required a Nuclear Criticality Safety Evaluation (NCSE). The WSMS methodology for conducting an NCSE is outlined in the WSMS methods manual. The WSMS methods manual currently follows the requirements of DOE-O- 420. 1 B, DOE-STD- 3007 - 2007, and the Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC) SCD- 3 manual. DOE-STD- 3007 - 2007 describes how a NCSE should be performed, while DOE-O- 420. 1 B outlines the requirements for a Criticality Safety Program (CSP). The WSRC SCD- 3 manual implements DOE requirements and ANS standards. NCSEs do not address the Nuclear Criticality Safety (NCS) of non-reactor nuclear facilities that may be affected by overt or covert activities of sabotage, espionage, terrorism or other security malevolence. Events which are beyond the Design Basis Accidents (DBAs) are {{outside the scope of}} a <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to share the SRS methodology for identifying the reliability requirements and documenting the expected performance of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) used as criticality defenses. Nuclear Criticality SIFs are comprised of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements, which may be either automatic or manual, to detect a process hazard and respond to prevent a criticality. The Savannah River Site (SRS) has invoked the chemical process industry safety standard (ANSI/ISA 84. 00. 01) for the design of safety significant instrumented systems. The ISA standard provides a graded approach to design based on the amount of risk reduction that is required of an SIF. SRS is embarking on application of this standard to nuclear criticality defenses, thus integrating criticality safety requirements with verifiable design methodology. Per the DOE G 421. 1 - 1 discussion of the <b>double</b> <b>contingency</b> principle, guidance for a single contingency barrier includes, ''The estimated probability that the control will fail (when called upon for protection) is not greater than 1 in 100 demands''. The application of this standard to nuclear criticality SIFs will provide clear requirements in terms of safety availability and testing to assure that the instrumented criticality system as designed, installed, and maintained will meet is performance requirements. The paper identifies the numerous challenges presented by this initiative and the benefits of this approach...|$|E
