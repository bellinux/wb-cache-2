25|$|Because of the {{military}} potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard's services were offered, {{but there was no}} interest, initially. Two young, imaginative officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build liquid-fueled rockets for <b>jet-assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> (JATO) of aircraft.

2500|$|Named [...] "Little Joe", and {{designated}} KAN-1, {{the missile}} {{was the first}} SAM developed and tested by the United States. The Little Joe's fuselage was {{essentially the same as}} the standard Aerojet <b>Jet-Assisted</b> <b>Take-Off</b> (JATO) rocket, ordinarily used to provide additional takeoff thrust for heavily loaded aircraft. Cruciform wings and canard control surfaces were fitted to the missile; guidance was provided by a radio command-to-line-of-sight system. Four auxiliary rockets were mounted as boosters to provide for the rapid launch response needed to deal with Kamikaze aircraft.|$|E
50|$|JATO (acronym for <b>jet-{{assisted}}</b> <b>take-off),</b> {{is a type}} of {{assisted take-off}} for helping overloaded aircraft into the air by providing additional thrust in the form of small rockets. The term JATO is used interchangeably with the (more specific) term RATO, for rocket-assisted take-off (or, in RAF parlance, RATOG for rocket-assisted take-off gear).|$|E
50|$|The Private {{program was}} begun in 1944 as an {{outgrowth}} of work by the California Institute of Technology's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory that had produced the first practical <b>jet-assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> (JATO) rockets. A proposal to adapt the JATO rockets for research into the development of ballistic missiles was accepted, and the first flight of the Private A rocket, developed {{under the direction of}} Tsien Hsue-shen, took place in December 1944, conducted at Camp Irwin in California.|$|E

50|$|Yakutat tended the PBM Mariners of Patrol Bomber Squadron 27 (VPB-27) for {{the rest}} of World War II. She {{established}} seadrome operations at Kerama Retto on 28 March 1945 and {{spent the rest of the}} important Okinawa campaign in seaplane tending duties. The presence of Japanese aircraft in the vicinity on numerous occasions meant many hours spent at general quarters stations, lookouts' eyes and radar alert for any sign of approaching enemy planes. Yakutat provided quarters and subsistence for the crews of the Mariners and furnished the planes with gasoline, lubricating oil, and <b>jet-assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> (JATO) units. The Mariners conducted antisubmarine and air-sea rescue ("Dumbo") duties locally, as well as offensive patrols that ranged as far as the coast of Korea.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Darwin Awards {{can be traced back}} to posts on Usenet group discussions as early as 1985. An early post, on August 7, 1985, {{describes}} the awards as being, [...] "given posthumously to people who have made the supreme sacrifice to keep their genes out of our pool. Style counts, not everyone who dies from their own stupidity can win." [...] This early post cites an example of a person who pulled a vending machine over his head and was crushed to death trying to break into it. Another widely distributed early story mentioning the Darwin Awards is the JATO Rocket Car, which describes a man who strapped a <b>jet-assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> unit to his Chevrolet Impala in the Arizona desert and who died gloriously on the side of a cliff as his car achieved speeds of 250 to 300 mph. This story was later confirmed to be an urban legend by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The official Darwin Awards website run by Northcutt does its best to confirm all stories submitted, listing them as, [...] "confirmed true by Darwin." [...] Many of the viral emails circulating the Internet, however, are hoaxes and urban legends.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of rocketry in the U. S. S. R. during the post-war years was {{due largely to}} pre-war activity; in particular, to investigations conducted in the Jet Propulsion Research Institute (RNII). The history of RNII commenced in 1933, resulting from the merger of two rocket research organizations. Previous research was continued in areas of solid-propellant rockets, <b>jet-assisted</b> <b>take-off</b> of aircraft, liquid propellant engines (generally with nitric acid as the oxidizer), liquid-propellant rockets (generally with oxgen as the oxidizer), ram jet engines, rockets with and without wings, and rocket planes. RNII research is described and summarized for the years 1933 - 1942...|$|E
