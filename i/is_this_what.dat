25|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? began in London in June 1968. The {{majority of the}} songs were recorded in Los Angeles in October–November that year, after Harrison had completed work on the Beatles' White Album. Among the other guest musicians on the album {{were members of the}} Wrecking Crew, Eric Clapton, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann and John Barham. Although the album received favourable reviews, it failed to achieve commercial success. The 2010 reissue includes bonus tracks covering the rest of Lomax's output while on Apple Records.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Apple reissued <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? as both an {{individual}} release {{and as part}} of the seventeen-disc box set titled The Apple Box. [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] also appeared on the accompanying two-CD compilation, [...] In conjunction with these releases, a mono mix of the song was made available for digital download.|$|E
500|$|Mixing on [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] {{was also}} {{completed}} on 14 October, after which Harrison left for Los Angeles to produce Jackie Lomax's album <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? The stereo and mono mixes {{of the song}} differ in their editing of the lead guitar parts; in addition, the mono version omits the organ over the third verse.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> they want? Or <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, what <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> <b>what</b> is this?' The only other record I ever felt that way about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|At the premiere, John Williams {{conducted}} a live {{performance of the}} score. The new release grossed $68 million in total, with $35 million coming from Canada and the United States. The changes to it, particularly the escape scene, were criticized as political correctness. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wondered, [...] "Remember those guns the feds carried? Thanks to the miracle of digital, they're now brandishing walkie-talkies.... <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> two decades have done to free speech?" [...] Chris Hewitt of Empire wrote, [...] "The changes are surprisingly low-key...while ILM's CGI E.T. is used sparingly as a complement to Carlo Rambaldi's extraordinary puppet."

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] {{to promote}} Transcendental Meditation, which the Beatles had been {{studying}} in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for their 1968 double album, The Beatles (also known as the White Album). On release, Lomax's single was overshadowed in Apple's [...] "Our First Four" [...] promotional campaign by the Beatles' [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and Mary Hopkin's [...] "Those Were the Days"; it enjoyed only minor success internationally, becoming a top 30 hit in Canada. Together with its B-side, the Lomax-written [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You", the song was included on the singer's only Apple album, <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want?, released in March 1969.|$|E
500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year. The song {{was written by}} Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is {{one half of the}} London bred neo-soul act Floetry, and was produced by Jackson and Harris. Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think? <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> you were looking for? He was so open".|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 {{shows of}} the tour, the {{performance}} of [...] "Monster" [...] was changed a little to include an ending, where Gaga is portrayed as getting killed by a murderer, after which she lies [...] "dying" [...] {{in a pool of}} blood. Her performances of that scene in Manchester, England, triggered protests from family groups and fans {{in the aftermath of the}} Cumbria shootings, in which 12 people were murdered by a taxi driver. [...] "What happened in Bradford is very fresh in people's minds and given all the violence which happened in Cumbria just hours earlier, it was insensitive," [...] said Lynn Costello of Mothers Against Violence. Chris Rock later defended her flamboyant, provocative behavior. [...] "Well, she's Lady Gaga," [...] he said. [...] "She's not 'Lady Behave Yourself.' Do you want great behavior from a person named Gaga? <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> you were expecting?" ...|$|E

500|$|In his {{preview of}} Apple's 2010 reissues, for Rolling Stone, David Fricke listed <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? third among the label's top five non-Beatle album {{releases}} and praised [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as, variously, a [...] "get-off-your-ass rocker" [...] and [...] "dynamite". Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot considered {{it to be}} [...] "a knockout version". Among reviews of the Come and Get It compilation, Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media opined that [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] "would've {{been one of the}} best songs on [...] if George had kept it for himself", while Uncuts David Cavanagh described the track as [...] "sensational". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the song [...] "a dense, brilliant, and soulful psychedelic rocker". In his liner notes to the compilation, Andy Davis, formerly the editor of Record Collector magazine, highlights [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as [...] "the greatest record The Beatles never made".|$|E
500|$|The song's exhortation to [...] "Get back {{to where}} you should be" [...] was partly {{appropriated}} by McCartney in his lyrics to [...] "Get Back", which the Beatles recorded in January 1969. Both sides of Lomax's single were included on his only album for Apple, <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want?, released in March 1969. The album similarly failed to achieve commercial success, a result that perplexed the Beatles, who continued to believe in his talents. Due to the song's strong association with the Beatles and Eric Clapton, [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] retained a degree of renown among rock music fans; Danny Eccleston of Mojo magazine later {{described it as a}} [...] "cult rendering". In 1970, Sour Milk Sea, one of singer Freddie Mercury's pre-Queen bands, was named after the track. In June the following year, Apple re-released [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] with [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes" [...] on the B-side, but this single also failed to chart.|$|E

The album includes Lomax's debut single for Apple, the Harrison-written [...] "Sour Milk Sea", while the US version added [...] "New Day", which was produced by Lomax and released as a non-album single in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|Author Bill Harry {{has written}} that Lomax's lack of chart success [...] "completely baffled The Beatles because Jackie {{had one of the}} rare and {{distinctive}} voices which have the potential of turning its owner into a superstar". Leng attributes the album's underachievement to the Beatles' inexperience as label owners. He says that they relied too heavily on establishing their artists with a hit single and that, after [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] had failed to become a hit, this formula left <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? without an adequate marketing strategy.|$|E

2500|$|Barham {{also worked}} on Harrison's {{projects}} with acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label. Among these releases was <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? (1969) by Jackie Lomax, That's the Way God Planned It (1969) by Billy Preston, and Radha Krishna Temple (London)'s 1970 hit single [...] "Govinda". The latter was a musical adaptation of a sacred Hindu poem from the Satya Yuga. Through his connection with Harrison, Barham also played harpsichord on Yoko Ono's [...] "Who Has Seen the Wind?", released in February 1970 as the B-side to John Lennon's Spector-produced single [...] "Instant Karma!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On release, <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want? {{received}} enthusiastic reviews. In a 1970 {{interview with}} Robert Greenfield of Rolling Stone, however, Lomax lamented that commentators {{tended to focus}} on the line-up of superstar backing musicians, saying, [...] "they're always talkin' about who's on the album and not the album itself." [...] Writing in ZigZag in July 1974, Andy Childs advised the magazine's readers: [...] "it's worth its weight in gold, so if it's absent from your collection, add it to your shopping list of second-hand records." [...] Greenfield and Childs both recognised Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as a highlight of the album.|$|E
2500|$|Recording resumed in London in December 1968, with {{horns and}} backing vocals being overdubbed on [...] "Baby You're a Lover" [...] and [...] "You've Got Me Thinking". The album (in its UK version) was {{completed}} in London during January 1969, in between Harrison's commitments to the Beatles' ill-fated Get Back project. Although only John Barham would be credited for orchestration on <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> You Want?, Beatles producer George Martin can be heard on Get Back audio tapes from 10 January wondering whether Harrison, who had just walked out on the band, would be attending a strings overdubbing session Martin had arranged that evening for one of Lomax's tracks.|$|E
