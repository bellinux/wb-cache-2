40|$|Objective: <b>Heptafluoropropane</b> is an {{inert gas}} commercially used as {{propellant}} for inhalers. Since <b>heptafluoropropane</b> {{can be detected}} in low concentrations, {{it could also be}} used as a tracer gas to measure functional residual capacity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to validate functional residual capacity measurements by <b>heptafluoropropane</b> wash-in/wash-out (0. 8 %) during mechanical ventilation in small, surfactant-depleted lungs using a newborn piglet model. Design: Prospective laboratory and animal trial. Setting: Animal laboratory in a university setting. Subjects: Sixteen newborn piglets (age < 12 hrs, median weight 1390 g [705 – 4200 g]) before and after surfactant depletion by lung lavage. Interventions: <b>Heptafluoropropane</b> was measured with an infrared mainstream sensor connected with the flow sensor of the Dräger Babylog 8000. Accuracy and precision of the measurement technique were tested in a mechanical lung model with a volume range from 11 to 35 mL. Furthermore changes of functional residual capacity were assessed in vivo by variation of ventilatory variables. Measurements and Main Results: In vitro the absolute error of functional residual capacity was < 1 mL (relative errors < 3 %) with a coefficient of variation < 4 %. The coefficient of variation of consecutive in vivo measurements was only slightly higher (< 5. 1 %). After lung lavage, the functional residual capacity decreased despite increased ventilator pressures. In healthy lungs, the increase in peak inflation pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure had only a moderate, non-significant effect on functional residual capacity, whereas in surfactant-depleted lungs an elevated PEEP increased functional residual capacity significantly. Conclusions: <b>Heptafluoropropane</b> is a suitable tracer gas for precise functional residual capacity measurements tested in vitro and allows for reproducible measurements in ventilated small lungs without any adverse effects on mechanical ventilation. The sensitivity of the method is sufficiently high to demonstrate the effect of changes in ventilatory settings on the functional residual capacity...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work reported in this thesis was to investigate molecules of atmospheric importance and their reactions. This has been achieved using spectroscopic methods, notably photoelectron spectroscopy, u. v. -visible spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy, as well as kinetics simulations, global modelling and quantum chemical calculations. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) was used to investigate the pyrolysis behaviour of two hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) fire suppression agents, pentafluoroethane (CF 3 CHF 2) and 2 -H <b>heptafluoropropane</b> (CF 3 CHFCF 3) to determine their thermal decomposition pathways. The thermal decomposition of flowing pentafluoroethane (CF 3 CHF 2) diluted in argon was studied over the temperature range 600 - 1600 ?C. At lower temperatures, (< 1000 ?C) {{there is evidence of}} production of the thermal decomposition products C 2 F 4 and HF and at higher temperatures (over 1000 ?C) the decomposition products CF 2 and CF 3 H are observed. The adiabatic and vertical ionisation energy (AIE and VIE) have been measured for the first band of CF 3 CHF 2 from the recorded photoelectron spectrum as (12. 71 +- 0. 05) eV and (13. 76 +- 0. 02) eV respectively. The main pathways for decomposition have been established over the temperature range investigated. Pyrolysis of 2 -H <b>heptafluoropropane</b> (CF 3 CHFCF 3), at low pressure, diluted in argon, has been studied over the temperature range 600 - 2000 ?C. Comparison of the results obtained has been made with results of recent electronic structure calculations of possible decomposition pathways. The most favoured reaction thermodynamically, to produce CF 3 CF=CF 2 + HF, is found to be the main decomposition reaction at lower temperatures, 600 - 900 ?C. At higher temperatures, 900 - 1200 ?C, decomposition gave C 2 F 4 + CF 3 H and it was found that C 3 F 6 decomposes to C 2 F 4 + CF 2, and C 2 F 4 decomposes to CF 2 at temperatures above 1400 ?C. Three ozone-alkene reactions (O 3 + ethene, O 3 + 2 -methylpropene (2 MP) and O 3 + 2, 3 dimethyl- 2 -butene (DMB)) were separately investigated, each at low pressure, using a flow-tube interfaced to a photoelectron spectrometer. Photoelectron spectra, recorded as a function of reaction time, have been used to estimate partial pressures of the reagents and products, using photoionisation cross-sections for selected photoelectron bands of the reagents and products, (which have been measured separately) for each reaction. The yields of all the main products have been determined for each reaction. For each reaction, oxygen was observed as a product {{for the first time and}} for the O 3 + ethene reaction acetaldehyde was measured as a product for the first time. Kinetics simulations were performed using reaction schemes which were developed for these reactions in order to determine the main reactions for production of the observed products. A feasibility study was carried out on the first PE bands of four selected non-linear triatomic molecules, SF 2, HO 2, HOCl and Cl 2 O in order to optimise the experimental production conditions for a threshold PES study using synchrotron radiation. Reliable methods were developed to record threshold PE spectra of SF 2, HOCl and Cl 2 O consistently for upwards of 4 hours. The work on HO 2 is still ongoing and the method developed requires further optimisation.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P ABCT 2016 Ngxxxvi, 246 pages :color illustrationsKinetic {{modeling}} of gas-phase reaction systems has improved enormously due to rapid advances in computational {{technology in the}} last decade. It becomes a powerful tool to understand complex chemical systems in {{a broad range of}} areas, including combustion, fire suppression, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atmospheric chemistry. Reliable thermochemical and kinetic data is required to incorporate accurate description of chemical reactions into kinetic models. However, this data may not be experimentally available due to some experimental limitations. In this connection, calculating these thermochemical constants and reaction rate coefficients in an ab initio manner has the advantage of not being restricted by any experimental conditions. However, the relationship between various levels of approximation in ab initio, density functional theory (DFT) and transition state theory (TST) is complicated {{and it is difficult to}} make the appropriate choices of levels of approximation in each of these areas in calculations. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of different levels of ab initio, DFT and TST calculations on computed reaction rate coefficients, in order to ultimately establish a consistent, reliable and practical methodology for calculating reaction rate coefficients in an ab initio manner for the development of a reliably computed thermochemical and kinetic database, which complements available experimental databases, for kinetic modeling. State-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations were performed at different levels of theory to obtain reaction enthalpies, barrier heights, rate coefficients and branching ratios (if applicable) for the gas-phase reactions of importance in fire suppression, thin film preparation in the electronics industry and atmospheric chemistry. The three gas-phase reactions being presented in this work are (i) the reaction between hydrogen atom and a Halon-alternative fire suppression agent, <b>heptafluoropropane</b> (FM 200), (ii) the decomposition reactions of a feed gas, hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO), utilized in CVD for thin film preparation in the electronics industry and (iii) the Cl-initiated oxidation of formic acid (HCOOH). In particular, the effects of basis set size, the lower-level geometry and the complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation scheme on computed relative energies, the variational, tunneling and classical adiabatic ground-state (CAG) effects on computed rate coefficients, and the correlation of computed rate coefficients obtained at different TST levels with some computed critical quantities of the minimum energy paths (MEPs) were examined. Although no single level considered in this work gives good agreement with the theoretical benchmarks for all relevant stationary points of all the gas-phase reactions being studied, the BH&HLYP, MPW 1 PW 91 and BMK functionals are recommended for reliable rate coefficients because of their good performance in reaction rate coefficient calculations. It was found that variational effect depends on both the barrier height of the classical potential energy (VMEP) curve, and the shape and position of the dip in the zero-point energy difference (ΔZPE) curve. The results also showed that multidimensional tunneling effects depend on both the barrier height and the imaginary vibrational frequency of the transition state, and CAG corrections at the TST level are similar to the variational effects at the canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) level. This work not only improves the understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the kinetics of the gas-phase reactions being studied, but also provides valuable data for building up a high-level ab initio thermodynamic and kinetic database on these reactions, and makes progress in calculating reliable reaction rate coefficients in an ab initio manner.

40|$|Particularly among newborns {{postoperative}} {{mortality and}} long-term morbidity {{are caused by}} thoraco-abdominal surgery. In this context lung hypertension – the volutrauma plays an important part. The volutrauma {{as well as the}} associated complications have to be avoided by all means. Common methods used to measure the lung volume of adults can problematically not be adapted for newborns. The work at hand aims to investigate the effect of thoraco-abdominal surgery on ventilated newborn’s lung volume. It is based on the data of 29 newborn infants born between November 2006 and June 2008. 13 underwent thoracic, 9 abdominal and 7 congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) surgery. The FRC measurement was performed within 6 hours before and 22 - 26 h after surgery and within 6 hours prior to Extubation by a multiple breath washout (MBWO) technique using <b>heptafluoropropane</b> (HFP) devised and modified by Dräger, Lübeck for Babylog 8000. The measurements recorded gas exchange, respiratory mechanic, functional residual capacity (FRC) and ventilations inhomogeneity (VI) index data. Concerning the the leading questions, mentioned in 1. 5. of the thesis, the following points can be made: Question 1 : “Which preoperative effect do the basic, surgery requiring malformations have to the lung volume?” Comparing the several surgery causing malformations it became clear that CDH-surgery has a significant effect on the preoperative measured lung function parameters compared to the reference group. Especially compliance and FRC show significant low values. This {{can be traced back to}} fact that the displacement of lung tissue causes by intrathoracic located organs and therefor lower lung extendibility. The non-CDH-patients regardless of whether thoracic or abdominal surgery were showing no significant differences in their lung function. Question 2 : “Do thoraco-abdominal surgeries effect the lung volume of newborns?” The analysis showed that thoraco-abdominal sorgeries do not have a significant effect to customarily gathered vital parameters, whereas a diagnosis-related effect to FRC and VI could be noticed. The CDH-infants showed a significant decrease of FRC after their surgery, while the CDH-infants had a continuous increase of FRC. The ventilation inhomogeneity indices (VI) are also diagnosis-related, but of inverse behaviour. Based on those results, it can be concluded that for non-CDH-infants the operative stress results in an impaired alveolar ventilation, which affects the lung function. Later, the FRC recovered to the initial value, indicating improved ventilation by the time of extubation. Among the CDH-infants a definite improvement of the alveolar ventilation was already noticed 22 - 26 h postoperative. FRC increased significantly, whereas VI decreased. The thoracal space, gained through surgery, enables the lung to expand and predominates the oedemata that are evoked by the stress factors connected with the surgery. Despite the improvement of FRC and VI there was still a postoperative difference between CDH- and non-CDH-infants indicating a continuity of lung impairment among these patients. Question 3 : “Which advantage has the knowledge of the patients FRC for the peri- or postoperative ventilation management?” The knowledge leads to the possibility of a patient-optimized ventilation and its individual adaptation. It allows an immediate reaction to peri- and postoperative changes in lung function and enables to take urgent measures against hypo- and hyperventilation. Furthermore the surgery’s impact on lung function and the development until the moment of Extubation can be monitored. Although the results can not provide final conclusions about the effect of thoraco-abdominal surgery on lung function yet they substantially prove the thesis that a knowledge about FRC-values among ventilated newborns is important to optimize postoperative ventilation properly. For this purpose FRC-measurement using HFP as trace gas is a sensitive non-invasive method to prove surgery-caused changes of lung function after thoraco-abdominal surgery in ventilated newborn infants...|$|E
