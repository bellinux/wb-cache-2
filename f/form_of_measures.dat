In that way, Serbia got unique Criminal Code which includes all provisions of material criminal law except provisions related to the criminal position of juveniles. System of criminal sanctions for juvenile off enders, procedure for their imposition and the way, procedure and terms for their execution are regulated by the provisions of the separate law - the Law on juvenile off enders and criminal protection of juveniles. Some of the most important novelties introduced by new juvenile criminal law are system of diversion, i. e. system of diversion orders, which aim at excluding the imposition of criminal sanctions in the cases when criminal sanction is not necessary from the perspective of crime suppression.

40|$|Information {{about the}} {{performance}} of diagnostic tests is typically presented in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> of test accuracy such as sensitivity and specificity. These measures {{may be difficult to}} translate directly into decisions about patient treatment, for which information presented in the form of probabilities of disease after a positive or a negative test result may be more useful. These probabilities depend on the prevalence of the disease, which is likely to vary between populations. This article aims to clarify the relationship between pre-test (prevalence) and post-test probabilities of disease, and presents two free, online, interactive tools to illustrate this relationship. These tools allow probabilities of disease to be compared to decision thresholds above and below which different treatment decisions may be indicated. They are intended to help those involved in communicating information about diagnostic test performance and are likely to be of benefit when teaching these concepts. A substantive example is presented using C-reactive protein as a diagnostic marker for bacterial infection in the older adult population.

3000|$|The precautionary {{principle}} (Caroline Aeberli) The {{precautionary principle}} {{is a way}} of dealing with scientific uncertainty, based on available scientific knowledge, the degree of uncertainty and societal values (e.g. legal or political assessments). In Switzerland, the precautionary principle is anchored in the Federal Constitution (BV) and the Environmental Protection Act (USG). The aim of the USG is to protect people, animals and plants, as well as their biotic communities and habitats, from harmful effects or nuisances. Pursuant to art. 1 paragraph 2 of the USG, “In keeping with the precautionary principle, […], impacts which could become harmful or create a nuisance are to be limited at an early stage”. The precautionary principle also applies in further decrees, inter alia in the Water Protection Act (GSchG) and the Chemicals Act (ChemG), or at ordinance level, for example, in the Plant Protection Product Ordinance (PSMV). The precautionary principle is chiefly underpinned by the concept of avoiding or limiting incalculable risks. It creates a safety margin (in Swiss legal terms) taking the uncertainties vis-à-vis the longer-term effects of environmental pollution into account. 2 The precautionary principle can be applied in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> even when there is not yet any concrete danger, and it is intended to be effective where scientific uncertainty still exists.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} European {{legitimacy and}} regulatory governance. The research analyzes {{the link between}} regulatory governance and legitimacy in EU regulation and evaluates whether governance tools {{in the form of}} qualitative administrative criteria can contribute to European regulatory legitimacy. Governance here refers to the exercise of delegated regulatory powers by the European Commission. The question of whether the adoption of qualitative regulatory governance practices can enhance the supranational regulatory legitimacy of the European Commission has been underexamined in the literature typically without distinguishing the analysis from the so-called ‘democratic deficit’ of the EU. Using a case study from the telecommunications sector, the thesis conducts such an examination using a documentary method. To create the analytical context, the thesis distinguishes the theoretical concept of legitimacy for a transnational regulator from that of a national regulator of a sovereign state. The choice is made to use a form of normative regulatory legitimacy drawn from the scholarship on regulatory governance theory. An analytical model is constructed that reflects criteria and values that bear upon legitimacy so as to constitute a meaningful alternative to democratic forms of regulatory accountability. Regulation was defined in the research to cover policy instruments, in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> of positive and negative integration, adopted for the EU single market under Article 106 (3) and Article 114 TFEU. The analysis evaluates the regulatory governance used by the European Commission over a twenty-three year time period in which the telecommunications sector was entirely liberalized and harmonized. Analysis revealed that, while the Commission has improved the quality of its regulatory governance in principle, its use of normative regulatory governance in practice requires further attention, notably in respect of improving the evidence base for policy proposals and in creating a meaningful form of empirical feedback in evaluating regulatory outcomes, corresponding to an ex post accountability mechanism. On the other hand, the research validated the premise that a transnational regulator could purposively use regulatory governance as a tool with which to construct a defensible form of regulatory legitimacy...|$|E
40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{international economic}} sanctions {{from the point}} of view of the interaction between international law and the domestic legal systems of the States concerned. In doing so, it may prove useful to resort to the private international law tools. International economic sanctions, when observed through the lens of a municipal legal system in which they claim implementation, take the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> interfering in the regulation of private economic intercourse. To better understand how such measures are to be dealt with, the present work sorts out some of these measures by the form they take in their implementation at the municipal level. They can take the form of prohibitive measures directly affecting commercial transactions, seizures, measures consisting in the deprivation of rights or status, the non-recognition of juridical situations as created by non-domestic decisions. The author stresses moreover that the furtherance of the respect of existing legal rules can also be carried out by positive sanctions and measures: inducements that prove sometimes to be far more effective, as they determine the harmonization of municipal law with the international standards and rules whose respect is at stake. To understand how measures of economic sanction become effective, it is important to face the question of their application as raised before a judge vested with the authority of settling a dispute at the municipal level. In dealing with this issue, the work follows in principle European private international law, as shaped by the Rome Convention of 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations. Firstly, the author deals with cases where sanctions are incorporated into the judge’s State legal system. For such cases, he analyses the three alternative situations: the least problematic one is that of the lex fori governing the relationship as a whole. Where lex causae is a foreign law which incorporates international sanctions, the authors thesis is that the lex fori should not prevail on it automatically: a functional comparison of the measures should be carried out, and only in case of violation of the core objectives of the lex fori sanctioning approach should the ordre public limit operate. If however the lex causae does not contain provisions enacting the sanctions that the lex fori wants to be applied, the latter’s provisions will be considered as internationally mandatory. The author then deals with the case in which the law of the forum does not incorporate any sanc- tions against the violator State, but the foreign law which is to be applied under the conflict-of-laws rules of the forum does. In such cases, the sanctioning provi- sions of the lex causae will normally apply, except in cases where ordre public considerations require a different outcome. The possible adoption of so called blocking regulations will be a straight forward case of such a contrast. Soft law recommending a given sanctioning attitude, on the other end, will significantly reduce the possibility of a judge considering foreign law incorporating sanctions to be contrary to the forum’s public policy. The work then deals with the case of sanctions not incorporated in the lex fori or in the lex causae, but in the law of a third State, and considers the role former art. 7. 1 of the Rome Convention, or equivalent approaches, could play: in this framework, an extensive analysis of the relevant case law is carried out. A similar analytical approach is followed when dealing with the recognition of foreign judicial decisions, and their relationship with international economic sanctions. The work then deals with the interplay between international economic sanctions and transnational commercial arbitration, in terms of arbitrability issues, of recognition and enforcement, as well as the setting aside of arbitral awards. Then, the question of the application of international economic sanctions by arbitrators is considered, in the light of the absence of a forum state in strict legal terms. Further, the author assesses the role of internal judges in evaluating the lawfulness of the adopted sanctions, at the international level, and suggests that a non negligible role could be played by judges. Among other things, national judges should take into considerations limitations arising from jus cogens, and in particular a so-called humanitarian exception to a full scale embargo. The last part of the work is devoted to a tentative dogmatic assessment of so-called positive sanctions and measures. Their role in shaping the public policy exceptions, for conflict of law purposes, is finally outlined...|$|E

40|$|Rural {{potential}} to be fully exploited The combined population of the ACP States will double over the next twenty years. How will these nations be able to feed themselves if {{a substantial part of}} their food has to be imported, especially as most of these countries also have to import their energy? This is the real challenge facing ACP countries at the close of this century. The majority of these States do, in fact, have the {{potential to}} feed themselves, but in order to do so they will have to exploit their resources to the full. Moreover, they will need the will to do this. To attain food self-sufficiency, a systematic approach to food and nutrition is needed. This is precisely what is intended by the adoption of 'food strategies'. Food strategies are aimed primarily at creating the necessary conditions for small farmers to improve {{the quantity and quality of}} their produce. The first step is the adoption of a rigorous economic policy by government. Then all the factors involved in the food production process, from producer to consumer, are carefully identified and considered, and are integrated into a coherent development policy. This is no easy task, as the various factors of development are so interrelated. First a diagnosis has to be made, then a set of goals is decided upon, and finally policies and programmes are defined which will realize these goals within the framework of an overall strategy. The small farmer needs motivation to produce and the assurance that there will be a market for the product. So it is not enough to encourage farmers to increase production. Other complementary measures must also be taken, which may include increasing storage capacity, improving marketing systems, ensuring that inputs are available when they are required, gradually introducing an appropriate system of loan facilities, increasing the use of mechanisation, etc. Pricing policies lie at the heart of the conflict of interest between producers and consumers. There must be a compromise between prices that will stimulate production and prices that are acceptable to the consumer. Marketing policy is often the main obstacle to increased food production and distribution. Generally speaking, state-run organizations have proved incapable of marketing foodstuffs satisfactorily on their own, and are a burden to the nation in terms of the subsidies needed to cover the losses they make. There must be a free market for food, with the proviso that the public sector should not push the private sector out of the market. Parastatal bodies should be set up to monitor the trade in food, in other words to make sure that the price limits set for producers and consumers are actually adhered to. On the other hand, it is the public bodies which are best placed to organize reserve stocks of cereals, which are in themselves one of the best ways of stabilizing pricesand ensuring food security. A consumer policy should be drawn :up which favours the consumption -particularly in towns-of locally processed produce. Such a policy will help create stable outlets for national produce. Increasing production entails a more rational use of available resources in a way that is environmentally sound. It is therefore important to stimulate national research and to establish information on matters such as networks. Technology transfer on matters such as fertilizers, improved seeds and the use of draught animals, is also important. Such technologies should be based on traditional practices, should respond to the needs of small farmers and must be adapted and tested under real working conditions. Finally, it is important to improve the flow of information Management and extension service infrastructures should be made as efficient as possible. This may require modification of certain deeply-rooted structures in the agricultural world: in particular, it will usually mean reform of land ownership and of water resource management. Agricultural producers need easier access to loan and investment facilities. The main obstacles to this are usually the cost of loans, which is prohibitive to the small farmer, and the question of repayments. However both these difficulties can be overcome if loans are made to small-scale village organizations or to cooperatives in which farmers share responsibility. The responsibility of such groups should extend both to obtaining inputs and to providing marketing services. Greater emphasis should be given to integrating food aid into national food strategies, whether this takes the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> to support the stabilization of prices, the constitution of strategic reserve stocks, or subsidies to farmers. Nutrition programmes, particularly those concerned with the most vulnerable social groups, should be given their former prominence. They can be carried out within the framework of health and population programmes. The regional dimension of any development project, and especially of any programme concerned with food crops, should be taken into account. At the international level commercial ties should be developed from the secular exchanges which continue to take place, however clandestinely, between most neighbouring African countries. The availability-or non-availability -of reliable statistics often influences not only the formulation of policy but the monitoring of its application. It is therefore essential to support data collection and analysis Once developing nations have themselves defined the policies they choose to follow, good communication and coordination are needed both among potential donors, and between donors and the various official bodies within the recipient country. It is vital to respect the specific needs and conditions of each individual country, because 'progress' follows a different path in each case. A flexible approach, which can be adapted to the needs of each recipient country, is essentially. In 1981, the European Community and its member States decided to support the introduction of food strategies in four ACP countries-Rwanda, Mali, Zambia and Kenya - each one being representative of a group of African States. Four years after the introduction of these strategies, CTA feels it would be interesting to review the experience to date, so that other ACP States which are interested in the concept might benefit from this experience. The information will help them to avoid the mistakes which have been made, and to benefit from the successes. A seminar on this subject will therefore be organised by CTA in collaboration with the Academie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer of Belgium. It will be held in Brussels from 3 rd to 7 th November 1986. It is hoped that above all the seminar will be practical. The participants will look at how a number of agreed goals can be carried out technically, and how they can be translated into plans of action. This important event will be covered in greater detail in forthcoming issues of 'Spore'.
