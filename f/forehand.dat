5|$|Del Potro is an {{offensive}} baseliner {{with a very}} powerful serve and deep, flat, topspin groundstroke, where he pushes his opponents deeper with his heavy groundstroke and trying to blast past them with a winner. His <b>forehand</b> {{is one of his}} main strengths and possibly the most powerful in the game, capable of frequently generating speeds of 160km/h.|$|E
5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his <b>forehand</b> is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|The British No. 1 {{sustained}} {{tendon damage}} {{during his first}} round match at the German Open in Hamburg. Murray was up 5–1 when he hit a <b>forehand</b> {{from the back of}} the court and snapped the tendons in his wrist, leaving him out of action from 15 May until 7 August, thereby missing Wimbledon. During this rest period, Murray rose to world No. 8, but by 7 August, he had dropped to no 14.|$|E
50|$|Bozoljac {{is known}} for his unique style of play. He often changes the way he {{performs}} <b>forehands</b> and backhands, hitting double-handed <b>forehands</b> and single-handed backhands. He also has a strong serve, but he has to limit the strength of his serve due to a back injury. Nevertheless, he still serves well over 200 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|Amongst {{the male}} players, {{some of the}} notable players with great <b>forehands</b> are: ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Federer, Considered to {{have one}} of the best <b>forehands</b> of all time ...|$|R
5|$|With {{the switch}} to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with less shanks. However this has diminished his <b>forehand,</b> slice backhand and dropshot. Since his {{comeback}} in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both down the line and cross court which was cited {{as the reason for}} his defeat of Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th Round.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovakia {{split into}} the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993. The IIHF {{recognized}} the Czech Republic as {{the successor to}} Czechoslovakia, allowing the team to retain {{its position in the}} top World Championship division, while Slovakia started in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 and was forced to work its way up. Both nations competed in the tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, as did Russia. Slovakia and Finland both finished the preliminary round undefeated. Slovakia lost their medal round quarter-final game to Russia, who later lost to Finland in the bronze medal game. In the gold medal game between Sweden and Canada, both teams finished regulation and overtime play with a 2–2 tie. In the resulting shootout, the first in Olympic competition, both nations scored two goals, which resulted in a sudden death shootout. Peter Forsberg of Sweden scored {{one of the most famous}} goals in Olympic history by faking a <b>forehand</b> shot, then sliding a one-handed backhand shot past goaltender Corey Hirsch. Canada's final shooter Paul Kariya's shot was saved by Tommy Salo and Sweden won the game and its first gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy <b>forehand</b> and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
5000|$|Pancho Segura, 1940s and '50s professional, {{the most}} noted of the 2-handed <b>forehands</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Small in stature, Johnson {{learned to}} hit the ball with both hands and {{throughout}} his career used two-handed shots for both <b>forehands</b> and backhands.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forehand’s</b> {{constituent}} service, {{institutional memory}} {{and willingness to}} stand her ground on tough issues have resulted in numerous awards recognizing her leadership and forward thinking.|$|R
5|$|Murray {{is known}} for {{being one of the}} most {{intelligent}} tacticians on the court, often constructing points. Other strengths in his game, although not huge parts of his game, include a well-disguised drop shot and his net game. As he plays predominantly from the baseline, he usually approaches the net to volley when finishing points more quickly. Murray is most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he has won eight singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal, although hard courts are his preferred surface. He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game, ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid, as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's serve is a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points, it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure, especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since his 2011 season and Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray has played a more offensive game and has also worked to improve his second serve, <b>forehand,</b> consistency and mental game which have all been crucial to his further success.|$|E
25|$|The main {{weapons in}} Graf's game were her {{powerful}} inside-out <b>forehand</b> drive (which earned her the moniker Fräulein <b>Forehand)</b> and her intricate footwork. She often positioned {{herself in her}} backhand corner and although this left her <b>forehand</b> wide open and vulnerable to attack, her court speed meant that only the most accurate shots wide to her <b>forehand</b> caused any trouble.|$|E
25|$|Graf’s {{technique}} on the <b>forehand</b> {{was unique}} and instantly recognizable: generating considerable racquet head speed with her swing, {{she reached the}} point of contact late and typically out of the air. As a result, she hit her <b>forehand</b> with exceptional pace and accuracy. According to her coaches Pavel Složil and Heinz Günthardt, Graf's superior sense of timing was the key behind the success of her <b>forehand.</b>|$|E
50|$|A rarity among tennis players, Kulikovskaya was ambidextrous; {{she played}} with two <b>forehands</b> and no backhand, {{switching}} her racket hand {{depending on where}} the ball was coming.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Federer {{has been}} noted to have {{the one of the}} {{greatest}} <b>forehands</b> in history, described as a [...] "great liquid whip" [...] by David Foster Wallace.|$|R
25|$|González {{was known}} for {{having one of the}} hardest <b>forehands</b> on the tour. In Spanish he is called El Bombardero de La Reina ("The La Reina Bomber") and Mano de Piedra ("Stone Hand").|$|R
25|$|Odesnik has {{a modest}} serve, an {{excellent}} <b>forehand,</b> an improving backhand, and good quickness. He also varies {{his first and}} second serves, hides the placement of his <b>forehand,</b> and plays the angles on the court.|$|E
25|$|Sato {{played with}} a flat <b>forehand</b> drive which he modeled after Henri Cochet when Cochet visited Japan in 1929. He hit {{the ball on the}} <b>forehand</b> side early after the bounce and he was an {{excellent}} volleyer.|$|E
25|$|At a {{professional}} event in 1951, the <b>forehand</b> drives {{of a number}} of players were electronically measured. Kramer was particularly known for his fine <b>forehand,</b> but Gonzales was recorded as hitting the fastest one, 112.88mph, followed by Kramer at 107.8 and Welby Van Horn at 104. Since it was generally assumed at the time that Pancho Segura's two-handed <b>forehand</b> was the hardest in tennis, it is possible that he was not present at that event.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>forehands</b> are {{hit with}} topspin {{because it helps}} keep the ball from landing outside the court. On some occasions, such as an {{approach}} shot, a player can opt to hit with backspin, which can also be called a 'slice'.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} {{have different}} modes and functions for practicing <b>forehands</b> and backhands, fixed, random, decay, interval training, vertical swing, lob and drop. They are powered by electrical AC and DC power supplies {{and can be}} controlled remotely. Protective eyewear is recommended while using the machine.|$|R
50|$|On defense, {{she often}} attacks second serves with quick <b>forehands,</b> and hits prompt returns while taking {{the ball on}} the rise. Occasionally, she will break a {{prolonged}} rally by mixing in a drop shot. Her lower-body strength creates quickness around the court, enabling her to reach and return shots.|$|R
25|$|For a {{right-handed}} player, the <b>forehand</b> is {{a stroke}} that begins {{on the right}} side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. There are various grips for executing the <b>forehand,</b> and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the continental, the eastern, the semi-western, and the western. For a number of years, the small, frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best <b>forehand</b> of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a western grip. Few top players used the western grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the western <b>forehand</b> made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed <b>forehand</b> to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. Players such as Monica Seles or France's Fabrice Santoro and Marion Bartoli are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands.|$|E
25|$|Massú has a style {{characteristic}} of a clay-court specialist, with strong baseline play characterized by a solid <b>forehand</b> and backhand.|$|E
25|$|Tsonga {{is known}} for his {{aggressive}} groundstrokes. His <b>forehand</b> and backhand are both effective in setting up points. His powerful, heavy and accurate <b>forehand</b> is his most consistent shot, especially when delivered down the line. Although his backhand is generally not as strong as his <b>forehand</b> during the rallies, he is very capable of hitting attacking shots on his backhand wing. His net play is skillful, especially on attack. He can play both two-handed and one-handed backhand. He added the one-handed backhand to his repertoire midway through 2011 as was evident in his matches against Murray in the final of Queen's Club and against Federer in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. Although rarely used as a groundstroke in a neutral rally, it is particularly effective as a passing shot down the line or cross-court.|$|E

25|$|Dementieva was an {{offensive}} baseline player with powerful groundstrokes off {{both sides and}} excellent defensive skills. Her preferred groundstroke was her <b>forehand,</b> which she hit hard and flat. In particular, her running <b>forehand,</b> which she rarely missed, was a key weapon for Dementieva {{when she was on}} the defensive. Dementieva was also known for her excellent athleticism and speed around the court. Dementieva made few net approaches except to return drop shots or to take advantage of weak returns from her opponents.|$|E

50|$|Cîrstea {{is a power}} player. Her groundstrokes {{are often}} erratic with an {{emphasis}} on going for a winner leading her to make a high amount of unforced errors per match but with a high number of winners. According to the Tennis Spy, her long stride means she covers ground while not appearing to move particularly quickly. As a doubles player, she is also a very solid volleyer. Her <b>forehands</b> and backhands are delivered quickly on both sides.|$|R

2500|$|Blake was {{primarily}} an offensive baseliner. Blake {{was known for}} possessing {{one of the most}} powerful <b>forehands</b> in the game, with a solid transition game, and an effective serve and volley. Blake also possessed extremely quick footwork, although many claimed that he needed to work on changing direction. Blake's reputation as a [...] "shotmaker," [...] combined with potentially high-error flat groundstrokes made his style of play notably flashy, characterized by both a high number of winners and unforced errors. In turn, this made Blake's game somewhat streaky, as evidenced by his playing history.|$|R
