40|$|Abstract — Based on the {{analysis}} of the influence of the class ratio modeling to the model smoothness in equigap model, in this paper we put forward a practical method of raising non- equigap grey prediction precision that we model to non-equigap GM (1, 1) model by the class ratio modeling method,at the same time, propose a method that we predict the non-equigap model by carrying out prediction to the temporal series <b>index</b> <b>with</b> <b>linking</b> the suitable model, which is utilized to optimize and forecast the non- equigap model with the new method. Ultimately, examples that are cited from the actual works show that the method is good in stimulation and prediction precision.

40|$|This {{editorial}} memorializes Lynn Arthur Steen (1941 - 2015) with a bibliographic {{resource that}} indexes {{all of his}} writings (papers, books, edited volumes, and papers contained therein) that are cited in papers in Numeracy. The citation index contains 67 cited works, each accompanied {{with a list of}} linked Numeracy papers that cite them. All told, there are 68 such citing papers (called sources); they cite the 67 cited works a total of 290 times and are listed alphabetically in a source <b>index</b> <b>with</b> <b>links.</b> The paired citation and source indexes provide a vehicle for easy browsing by which those familiar with Lynn Steen’s works can easily be refreshed and reminded, while those who are new to QL can quickly come {{to an understanding of the}} importance of the concept and get an appreciation of Lynn Steen’s impact on the field. It is worth emphasizing that all of the source papers and many of the cited works are open access. It is hoped that this resource will facilitate hours of happy and thought-provoking reading and a deeper understanding of quantitative literacy. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new method of {{combining}} ASHRAE Room Energy Balance Method with 3 -d airflow modeling to estimate the thermal comfort conditions of the emerging air-conditioning system that combines radiant cooling and desiccant dehumidification. The room cooling load at a desired operative temperature is calculated, {{and so are the}} room surface temperatures and convective and radiative heat fluxes, which are used as input for the simulation of 3 -d room airflow and radiant temperature distributions, which are subsequently combined to calculate the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). The simulation results indicate that raising air supply temperature can provide better thermal comfort in terms of thermal field uniformity, and that thermal comfort <b>indices</b> directly <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> local body-surface heat transfers may be more useful in estimating uniformity associated with elevated air velocities...|$|R

RDI <b>index</b> is <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> life expectancy at birth about 60 %. Then we have divided Italian Regions into five different classes, from the “best” (less deprived) to the “worst” (much deprived) one. In each group we have examined the working population in every sector and the share of labourers in primary, secondary and tertiary sector, in order to verify the usual argument according to which growth and socio-economic development go with the boost of tertiary. The tertiary sector is determined according to ISTAT definition, which includes public administration. However, in a further step of our analysis we separate private from public tertiary. The evolution towards the advanced “post-industrial” society is apparently proved wrong in this case...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} inter-sectoral linkages on productivity at the sectoral level. An exhaustive Chinese panel data set for capital, infrastructure and a sectoral agglomeration <b>index</b> is <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> an economic distance matrix derived from inter-sectoral transactions. The latter matrix can replace the conventional geographic distance matrix from spatial econometrics. The impact through spillovers is mixed-the direct impact passing to related sectors {{and back to the}} initial sector itself, and the indirect impact arising from changes in all sectors. The results suggest that (1) economic growth in a sector is driven by spillovers among sectors that are linked through flows of goods and services; economic distance plays a more important role in stimulating productivity spillover than spatial distance; a shorter economic distance transmits a larger productivity spillover between sectors; (2) infrastructure spillover improves labor productivity in linked sectors; (3) agglomeration diseconomies can be partially reduced by infrastructure investment.

40|$|Background:  A {{trend towards}} in {{increase}} of hypertension in adults and children. If criteria of hypertension according to JNC VII 2003 {{applied to the}} population aged 15 - 17 years in Indonesia, the prevalence of hypertension in adolescents was obtained 5. 3 % nationally. Examination of blood pressure and factors related to blood pressure are of particular importance in children due to the decline in physical activity and weight changes contributing to blood pressure elevations that occur {{at this point in}} maturation. Blood pressure levels begin to increase as children approach adolescence. Weight control and physical activity regularly are recommended to prevent blood pressure elevations in both adult and youth. Objective: Determine the relationship between body mass index and physical activity with blood pressure in high school students in Pekanbaru. Method: This is an analytic observational study with cross sectional design. This study was involved 353 high school students in Pekanbaru who meets inclusion and exclusion criteria through cluster sampling technique. Data collected by direct measurements such as weight, height and blood pressure whereas physical activity and characteristic of the subject was collected by questionnaire. The results of the data collection were analyzed using univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: There is a correlation between body mass <b>index</b> <b>with</b> systolic (p= 0. 000; r= 0. 238) and diastolic blood pressure (p= 0. 010; r= 0. 136). Each increase in 1 kg/m 2 body mass <b>index</b> was <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> an increase of 2. 339 mmHg systolic blood pressure and 0. 979 mmHg diastolic blood pressure. However, there is no correlation between physical activity with systolic (p= 0. 829) nor diastolic blood pressure (p= 0, 643). Multivariate analysis showed that sex and screen time activity were factors most dominantly affecting blood pressure. Conclusion: There is a correlation between body mass <b>index</b> <b>with</b> blood pressure. However, there is no correlation between physical activity with blood pressure...|$|R

40|$|Navigating {{back and}} forth from a list of links (index) to its target pages is common on the web, but tethers screen-reader users to {{unnecessary}} cognitive and mechanical steps.

This paper investigates how blind users who navigate the web with screen-readers can bypass a scentless <b>index</b> <b>with</b> guided tours: a much simpler browsing pattern that linearly concatenates items of a collection. In a controlled study (N= 11) at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ISBVI), guided tours lowered user’s cognitive effort and significantly decreased time-on-task and number of pages visited when compared to an <b>index</b> <b>with</b> poor information scent.

40|$|Torezolid {{phosphate}} (TR- 701) is the phosphate monoester prodrug of the oxazolidinone TR- 700 which demonstrates potent {{in vitro}} activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The pharmacodynamics of TR- 701 or TR- 700 (TR- 701 / 700) against S. aureus is incompletely defined. Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies {{were conducted in}} mice for TR- 701 / 700. Forty-eight-hour dose range and 24 -hour dose fractionation studies were conducted in a neutropenic mouse thigh model of S. aureus infection using MRSA ATCC 33591 to identify the dose and schedule of administration of TR- 701 / 700 that was <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> optimized antimicrobial effect. Additional dose range studies compared the efficacies of TR- 701 / 700 and linezolid for one MSSA strain and one community-associated MRSA strain. In dose range studies, TR- 701 / 700 was equally bactericidal against MSSA and MRSA. Mean doses of 37. 6 and 66. 9 mg/kg of body weight/day of TR- 701 / 700 resulted in stasis and 1 log CFU/g decreases in bacterial densities, respectively, at 24 h, and mean doses of 35. 3, 46. 6, and 71. 1 mg/kg/day resulted in stasis and 1 and 2 log CFU/g reductions, respectively, at 48 h. Linezolid administered at doses as high as 150 mg/kg/day did not achieve stasis at either time point. Dose fractionation studies demonstrated that the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio) was the pharmacodynamic index for TR- 701 / 700 that was <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> efficacy. TR- 701 / 700 was highly active against MSSA and MRSA, in vivo, and was substantially more efficacious than linezolid, although linezolid's top exposure has half the human exposure. Dose fractionation studies showed that AUC/MIC was the pharmacodynamic <b>index</b> <b>linked</b> <b>with</b> efficacy, indicating that once-daily dosing in humans is feasible...|$|R
