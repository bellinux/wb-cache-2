40|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} of this study, reports {{had appeared in the}} popular and trade literature describing the beneficial effects of Norwegian <b>kelp</b> <b>meal</b> on chick growth and feed utilization. To the knowl-edge of the authors these reports were based only on field observations and not on any controlled research. The study reported here represents observations made at this station {{over the past four years}} where Norwegian <b>kelp</b> <b>meal</b> was fed to male broiler crosses receiving complete corn-soybean-type rations. Using kelp meals prepared from a variety of other seaweed sources, previous investigators were unable to show that any nutritional benefits could be derived from supple-menting complete poultry rations (Miller and Bearse, 1936; Maclntyre and Jenkins, 1952; Black, 1955; and Middendorf el al. ...|$|E

40|$|The world's brown marine algae, or kelps, {{have a great}} {{potential}} for agricultural use. Over 14 million tonnes of kelp {{are estimated to be}} available for harvesting every year, but only 6. 3 % is harvested, mostly for food products or alginate extraction. The inclusion of kelp in an animal's ration has been found by several researchers to have a beneficial effect on the animal's health and productivity. High concentrations of kelp in an animal's ration, however, can have detrimental effects on the animal's health due to toxic levels of certain inorganic salts. By including a dewatering operation in the production of dried <b>kelp</b> <b>meal,</b> much of the soluble salts present in the kelp will be removed with the filtrate. The filtrate would also be valuable as a source of potassium, trace minerals, and phyto-hormones for crops. Energy costs for dewatering are also much lower than for drying. Because kelp is difficult to dewater using conventional methods, a combined fields technique using electro-osmosis and mechanical pressure was investigated. Electric current and pressure were both found to have a significant positive effect on dewatering. Dewatering resulted in significantly lower ash and available carbohydrate fractions, while having no other significant effect on <b>kelp</b> <b>meal</b> composition. The combined fields dewatering resulted in significant total energy savings over conventional dewatering or drying alone. The combined fields dewatering process was successfully scaled up to a continuous process using a prototype roller press. The press was able to produce a press cake with up to 32 % solids. The continuous process resulted in significantly lower ash content and significantly higher protein. The total energy to produce <b>kelp</b> <b>meal</b> with the roller press was found to be about half of the energy required for drying alone...|$|E
40|$|In two experiments, {{seeds of}} tomato (Solanum esculentum L.) {{cultivar}} ‘Celebrity ’ were planted in four root substrates (Grower’s Mix 20, Fafard 4 P, Johnny’s 512 Select and Sunshine Planter’s) in 72 -cell plastic plugs trays using different cover materials. In physical property evaluations, the four substrates had similar total porosity. However, Johnny’s 512 Select {{had the highest}} container capacity and bulk density while Fafard 4 P and Sunshine Planter’s had the largest air space. There was some seasonal variation between the germination and growth results of the two studies. The use of root substrate, coir, or vermiculite resulted in better germination than leaving the seeds uncovered, {{with the exception of}} the seeds germinated in Johnny’s 512 Select in Experiment 1. Also, in Experiment 1, tomato seedlings were the tallest and heaviest when grown in Grower’s Mix 20. Using newspaper to cover seeds reduced germination in Experiment 2. Tomato seedlings grown in Grower’s Mix 20 and Johnny’s 512 Select were equal or greater in shoot height or weight as compared to those grown in the conventional substrate Fafard 4 P.

40|$|Elevated metal burdens in {{farmed fish}} can pose {{potential}} risks {{to public health}} {{as a result of}} fish consumption. It has been recognized that dietary exposure is a dominant route for metal accumulation in fish. In this study, we first assessed the metal contamination in commercial fish diet and its raw materials. Squid viscera meal, <b>kelp</b> <b>meal</b> and rapeseed meal had metal-specific contamination and contributed to high metal levels in commercial fish diet. We then quantified the metal assimilation efficiency (AE) in a juvenile marine fish blackhead seabream Acanthopagrus schlegelii using a radiotracer technique to assess the dietary bioavailability of cadmium (Cd), inorganic mercury (Hg(II)), and zinc (Zn). Different sources of protein in artificial diets did not significantly affect the metal AEs, except for Hg(II) from corn meal and Zn from corn meal and rapeseed meal. Generally, metal AEs tended to decrease with increasing dietary metal concentrations. Compared to meso- 2, 3 -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and L-cysteine in commercial fish diet, metal additives (i. e., 3000 mu g Fe/g or 200 mu g Cu/g) were more influential on metal AEs, probably due to metal competition. The relative bioavailability of metals in natural prey vs. artificial diet was inconsistent and complicated by metal chemical species and gut passage time. Our results indicated that metal contamination in commercial fish diet was probably underestimated in fish aquaculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 88 - 89) Kelp beds {{along the}} coasts of southern California have been harvested commercially for over SO years but little information is f 9 und {{in the literature of}} economic and regional geography on the exploitation of this natural resource. The harvesting and processing of Southern California kelp on a commercial scale dates from 1911 and can be divided into two periods. The first period lasted for ten years and was characterized by intensive kelp harvesting and processing operations to extract potash and acetone needed in the manufacture of munitions. The second period began in 1927 and continues to the present. Kelp 1 s presently harvested by three companies. Harvesting methods presently used have changed relatively little since first developed during the early period. One kelp company, The Kelco Company, has been extracting algin [...] a natural seaweed gum [...] from kelp since 1929. The resulting algin product has numerous commerc 1 al and industrial applications. The other two companies, the Kopoo Corporation and the Philip R. Park Company, dry and grind kelp to produce <b>kelp</b> <b>meal</b> and powder which are used in fertilizers, stock feeds, health roods, and other products. Kelp processing is handicapped because the chemical composition or kelp varies considerably, making difficult the manufacture of uniform kelp products. The State's management of this natural resource particularly the regulation of commercial harvesting operations, reflects a concern that kelp cutting will interfere with other interests and activities. Opposition by the sportfishing interests has been most vocal, and presents a continuing threat to commercial kelp harvesting. Based upon present operations, little change in the I exploitation of this resource 1 s foreseen for the immediate future...|$|E
40|$|Disease {{management}} in organic apple orchards in Vermont {{is focused on}} controlling diseases with sulfur fungicides. The objective of this two year study was to evaluate the target and non-target effects of an organic disease management system containing agricultural biostimulants compared to two sulfur-based systems on foliar and fruit diseases, pest and beneficial arthropods, tree growth, yield and fruit quality on four cultivars, `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7 and `Liberty 2 ̆ 7 and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7. Trees were arranged in a complete randomized design of five three-tree replications in a certified organic orchard. The two sulfur-based systems differed {{in the number of}} applications; in the third system, sulfur was replaced with biostimulants including pure neem oil, liquid fish, an activated microbial inoculant plus equisetum and stinging nettle teas. Each biostimulant application also included <b>kelp</b> <b>meal,</b> unsulfured organic molasses and yucca extract emulsifier. The biostimulant system did not successfully manage apple scab and rust diseases as well as the sulfur-based fungicide systems, and had variable results with other diseases. No differences were observed among the three systems in tree growth parameters; however, the length of the study may not have been sufficient to determine effects. Differences in the incidence of disease among the three systems were reflected in extrapolated figures for gross income per hectare which takes into account fruit yield and quality. In the higher fruit-bearing year of the study, it was estimated that the gross income per hectare of the biostimulant system would be significantly lower than the reduced-sulfur system and the full-sulfur system by at least 5, 800 and 12, 000, respectively. In that same year, it is estimated that the full-sulfur system would have generated approximately 6, 500 more gross income per hectare than the reduced-sulfur system suggesting the number of sulfur sprays can influence fruit quality and income. The use of the agricultural biostimulants had very limited non-target effects and when present, they were beneficial in suppressing insect pest incidence and/or damage on foliage compared to {{one or both of the}} sulfur-based fungicide systems. However, many insect pests or their damage were not observed on the foliage or had incidence of less than 1...|$|E
