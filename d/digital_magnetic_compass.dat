40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient algorithm {{for using the}} two-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> in portable devices. The general <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module consists of a three-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and a two-axis inclinometer to calculate tilt-compensated azimuth information. In this paper, the tilt error is compensated using just a two-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and two-axis accelerometer. The third-axis data of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is estimated using coordinate information that includes the extended dip angle and tilt information. The extended dip angle is estimated during the normalization process.

40|$|Abstract: A <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module must be {{calibrated}} accurately before use. Moreover, the calibration process must {{be performed}} {{taking into account}} any magnetic dip if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module has tilt angles. For this, a calibration method for a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is explained. Tilt error of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is compensated using a biaxial accelerometer generally. The accelerometer error causes a tilt angle calculation error that gives rise to an azimuth calculation error. For error property analysis, error equations are derived and simulations are performed. In the simulation results, the accuracy of derived error equations is verified. If a biaxial <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is used instead of a triaxial one, the magnetic dip and z-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> data must be estimated for tilt compensation. Lastly, estimation equations for the magnetic dip and z-axis magnetic compas...|$|R

The system integrates an inclinometer, <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass,</b> dual-frequency GPS receiver and consumer digital camera into a multi-sensor mapping system. The GPS provides estimates of the camera's position at the exposure stations, and the magnetic compass and inclinometer provide estimates of the camera's attitude. These exterior orientation estimates are used together with image point measurements in a photogrammetric bundle adjustment, and the result is 3 -D georeferenced coordinates. The design and implementation of the prototype system is detailed, and new techniques for including navigational data in a bundle adjustment are derived.

40|$|Abstract. The {{encroachment}} {{of wireless}} mobile technology {{had led to}} the advancement of tracking system through the mobile device. This paper concentrate on delivering the indoor tracking system that utilized the 3 D virtual world as the representation of indoor sensing information. (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) VRML is powerful 3 D modeling software that suitable to build the virtual map for visualization on the PDA. Moreover, culling algorithm is integrated to decrease the rendering time of VRML files on the PDA. In case of the tracking approach, Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) provides the low-cost implementation to locate multi-target user in indoor environment. A feasible accuracy refinement algorithm is proposed to cater the low accuracy position estimation by the unstable RSSI signals caused by the indoor environmental factors.

40|$|A {{method of}} quickly {{collecting}} digital imagery of ground areas from video cameras carried aboard locally launched rockets has been developed. The method can be used, for example, to record rare or episodic events or to gather image data to guide decisions regarding treatment of agricultural fields or fighting wildfires. The method involves acquisition and digitization {{of a video}} frame at a known time along with information on the position and orientation of the rocket and camera at that time. The position and orientation data are obtained by use of a Global Positioning System receiver and a <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> carried aboard the rocket. These data are radioed to a ground station, where they are processed, by a real-time algorithm, into georeferenced position and orientation data. The algorithm also generates a file of transformation parameters that account for the variation of image magnification and distortion associated with the position and orientation of the camera relative to the ground scene depicted in the image. As the altitude, horizontal position, and orientation of the rocket change between image frames, the algorithm calculates the corresponding new georeferenced position and orientation data and the associated transformation parameters. The output imagery can be rendered in any {{of a variety of}} formats. The figure presents an example of one such format...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of birds is located only in the right eye. However, here we show that night-migrating garden warblers (Sylvia borin) are able to perform <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation with both eyes open, with only the left eye open and with only the right eye open. We did not observe any clear lateralization of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation behaviour in this migratory songbird, and, therefore, it seems that the suggested all-or-none lateralization of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation towards the right eye only cannot be generalized to all birds, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation in birds is lateralized is probably not as simple as suggested previously...|$|R
40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of a migratory bird, the European robin (Erithacus rubecula), {{was shown}} to be lateralized in favour of the right eye/left brain hemisphere. However, {{this seems to be}} a {{property}} of the avian <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> that is not present from the beginning, but develops only as the birds grow older. During first migration in autumn, juvenile robins can orient by their <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> with their right as well as with their left eye. In the following spring, however, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is already lateralized, but this lateralization is still flexible: it could be removed by covering the right eye for 6 h. During the following autumn migration, the lateralization becomes more strongly fixed, with a 6 h occlusion of the right eye no longer having an effect. This change from a bilateral to a lateralized <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> appears to be a maturation process, the first such case known so far in birds. Because both eyes mediate identical information about the geomagnetic field, brain asymmetry for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> could increase efficiency by setting the other hemisphere free for other processes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we are {{discussing}} {{the effect of the}} use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> on the orientation of ancient Chinese architectonical complexes. As Czech researchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the ancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys were made by means of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> we can find the axes of the complexes deviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic declination that existed at the time the structures were built.

50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized compass (or heading indicator) is {{to read the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro compass will read correctly in a turn, whereas the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> can't be read properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.|$|R
50|$|Compass turns (turns {{using the}} compass {{as the primary}} {{reference}} instrument) are not standard practice in modern aircraft.

40|$|Animals {{can detect}} {{different}} {{parameters of the}} geomagnetic field by two principal independent magnetoreception mechanisms: (1) a light-dependent process detecting the axial course and the inclination angle of the geomagnetic field lines, providing the animals with <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> information (inclination compass), and (2) a magnetite-mediated process, providing magnetic map information (map sense). In vertebrates like birds and newts, light-dependent <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation depends on both wavelength and intensity of light, and experimental evidence suggests that <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> information is perceived by magneto-sensitive photoreceptors, possibly containing cryptochromes, in the retina or the pineal...|$|R

50|$|There {{are certain}} {{circumstances}} when <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> and gyrocompasses are unreliable.

40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of {{migratory birds}} has been {{suggested}} to be light-dependent.

In the earlier shoreward orientation experiments, newts tested under full-spectrum and short-wavelength (i. e. 400 and 450 nm) light exhibited shoreward <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation. Under long-wavelength (i. e. 550 and 600 nm) light, newts exhibited <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation that was rotated 90 ˚ counterclockwise to the shoreward direction.

The different effects of long-wavelength light on shoreward orientation and homing confirmed earlier evidence that different magnetoreception systems mediate these two forms of orientation behaviour.
