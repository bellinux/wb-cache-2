40|$|SummaryIn Drosophila oocytes, gurken/TGF-α mRNA is {{essential}} for establishing the future embryonic axes. gurken remains translationally silent during transport from its point of synthesis <b>in</b> <b>nurse</b> cells to its final destination in the oocyte, where it associates {{with the edge of}} processing bodies. Here we show that, <b>in</b> <b>nurse</b> cells, gurken is kept translationally silent by the lack of sufficient Orb/CPEB, its translational activator. Processing bodies <b>in</b> <b>nurse</b> cells have a similar protein complement and ultrastructure to those in the oocyte, but they markedly less Orb and do not associate with gurken mRNA. Ectopic expression of Orb <b>in</b> <b>nurse</b> cells at levels similar to the wild-type oocyte dorso-anterior corner at mid-oogenesis is sufficient to cause gurken mRNA to associate with processing bodies and translate prematurely. We propose that controlling the spatial distribution of translational activators is a fundamental mechanism for regulating localized translation...|$|R
40|$|Motivation {{to work is}} {{understood}} as an individual´s approach to work, his/her willingness to work. People are motivated when they expect to achieve goals or get rewards satisfying their needs. Currently health care facilities are facing the shortage and turnover of nursing staff. Therefore, hospitals are commissioned to create such an environment <b>in</b> which <b>nurses</b> become motivated, because only motivated nurses can provide a quality nursing care, which is expressed in patients´ satisfaction and rewarding feelings <b>in</b> <b>nurses.</b> The aim of the thesis was to identify and compare motivational factors of senior nurses and <b>nurses</b> working <b>in</b> shifts. The aim was fulfilled. Three hypotheses were set. First hypothesis: The most important motivating factor <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> senior positions is professional development was not confirmed. Second hypothesis: The most important motivating factor <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> working <b>in</b> shifts is a financial reward was not confirmed. Third hypothesis: Motivational factors <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> {{vary depending on the}} job assignment was confirmed. Results of the survey will be provided to medical officers to give them an overview of the most important motivational factors <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> and the outcomes could also be a source of information for the hospital management how to effectively motivate the personnel. Senior nurses may focus on non-financial forms of rewards such as acknowledgements, thanks, appreciations, and good interpersonal relationships in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine psychometric {{properties}} of three translated versions of the Trust <b>in</b> <b>Nurses</b> Scale (TNS) and cancer patients’ perceptions of trust <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> a sample of cancer patients from four European countries. Methods A cross-sectional, cross-cultural, multi-site survey design was used. The data were collected with the Trust <b>in</b> <b>Nurses</b> Scale from patients with different types of malignancies in 17 units within five clinical sites (n = 599) between 09 / 2012 and 06 / 2014. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, multivariate methods and psychometrics using exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha coefficients, item analysis and Rasch analysis. Results The psychometric properties of the data were consistent in all countries. Within the exploratory factor analysis the principal component analysis supported the one component structure (unidimensionality) of the TNS. The internal consistency reliability was acceptable. The Rasch analysis supported the unidimensionality of the TNS cross-culturally. All items of the TNS demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit to the Rasch model. Cancer patients trusted nurses to a great extent although between-country differences were found. Conclusions The Trust <b>in</b> <b>Nurses</b> Scale proved to be a valid and reliable tool for measuring patients’ trust <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> oncological settings in international contexts...|$|R

5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E

At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs.

40|$|Background: Suicide risk may be {{elevated}} in 'medical' occupational groups, although {{results of}} studies are inconsistent. National data {{are required to}} examine this issue. It {{is also important to}} investigate the possible contribution of psychiatric disorder and access to specific suicide methods. Methods: In a nested case-control design we used data from Danish national registers for 1981 - 2006 to examine risk of suicide <b>in</b> <b>nurses,</b> physicians, dentists, pharmacists and veterinary surgeons compared to teachers and the general population, and associations with psychiatric service contact and suicide methods. Results: Crude age- and gender-adjusted rate ratios for suicide compared to teachers were significantly elevated <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> (RR 1. 90, 95 % CI 1. 63 - 2. 21), physicians (RR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 55 - 2. 26), dentists (RR 2. 10, 95 % CI 1. 58 - 2. 79) and pharmacists (RR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 26 - 2. 87), but not veterinary surgeons. Risk was also elevated <b>in</b> <b>nurses,</b> physicians and dentists compared {{with the rest of the}} general population, the relative risk increasing following adjustments for psychiatric service contact, marital status, gross income and labour market status. Results were similar in both genders. The elevated risk <b>in</b> <b>nurses</b> and dentists decreased during the study period. Elevated risks were not associated with greater psychiatric service contact. Medicinal drugs were commonly used for suicide by nurses, physicians and pharmacists. Limitations: The study was based in one country. Conclusions: Risk of suicide is increased <b>in</b> <b>nurses,</b> physicians, dentists and pharmacists in Denmark. This is not reflected in excess psychiatric service contact. Ready access to medicinal drugs may influence risk <b>in</b> <b>nurses,</b> physicians and pharmacists. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.
