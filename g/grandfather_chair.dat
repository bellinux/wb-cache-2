60|$|IN {{the early}} {{twilight}} of Thanksgiving Eve came Laurence, and Clara, and Charley, and little Alice, hand in hand, {{and stood in}} a semicircle round <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair.</b> They had been joyous throughout that day of festivity, mingling together {{in all kinds of}} play, so that the house had echoed with their airy mirth.|$|R
60|$|Somewhat such {{an aspect}} as this did Sir William Phips present {{when he sat}} in <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> after the king had {{appointed}} him governor of Massachusetts. Truly there was need that the old chair should be varnished and decorated with a crimson cushion, {{in order to make}} it suitable for such a magnificent-looking personage.|$|R
60|$|While Roger Williams sat in <b>Grandfather’s</b> <b>chair,</b> at his humble {{residence}} in Salem, John Endicott would often {{come to visit}} him. As the clergy had great influence in temporal concerns, the minister and magistrate would talk over the occurrences of the day, and consult how the people might be governed according to scriptural laws.|$|R
60|$|The German elector was proclaimed king {{from the}} balcony of the town-house in Boston, by the title of George I.; while the {{trumpets}} sounded and the people cried amen. That night the town was illuminated; and Cotton Mather threw aside book and pen, and left <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> vacant, while he walked hither and thither to witness the rejoicings.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if hardly any of the {{preceding}} stories had thrown such an interest around <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> as did {{the fact that the}} poor, persecuted, wandering Quaker woman had rested in it for a moment. The children were so much excited that Grandfather found it necessary to bring his account of the persecution to a close.|$|R

60|$|One day, in 1721, Doctor Cotton Mather sat in {{his library}} reading a book that had been {{published}} by the Royal Society of London. But every few moments he laid the book upon the table, {{and leaned back in}} <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> with an aspect of deep care and disquietude. There were certain things which troubled him exceedingly, so that he could hardly fix his thoughts upon what he read.|$|R
60|$|Peace being {{declared}} between France and England in 1748, {{the governor}} had now {{an opportunity to}} sit at his ease in <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair.</b> Such repose, however, appears not to have suited his disposition; for {{in the following year}} he went to England, and thence was despatched to France on public business. Meanwhile, as Shirley had not resigned his office, Lieu-tenant-Governor Phips acted as chief magistrate in his stead.|$|R
60|$|More the {{thoughtful}} and imaginative boy might have mused; {{but now a}} large yellow cat, a great favorite with all the children, leaped in at the open window. Perceiving that <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> was empty, and having often before experienced its comforts, puss laid herself quietly down upon the cushion. Laurence, Clara, Charley, and little Alice all laughed {{at the idea of}} such a successor to the worthies of old times.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was willing}} {{enough to be}} 'made,' as you call it," [...] says Mr. George, smoking not quite so placidly as before, for since the {{entrance}} of Judy {{he has been in}} some measure disturbed by a fascination, not of the admiring kind, which obliges him to look at her as she stands by her <b>grandfather's</b> <b>chair,</b> [...] "but on the whole, I am glad I wasn't now." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the people}} were not yet {{convinced}} of their mistake. One night a destructive little instrument, called a hand-grenade, was thrown into Cotton Mather's window, and rolled under <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair.</b> It {{was supposed to be}} filled with gunpowder, the explosion of which would have blown the poor minister to atoms. But the best informed historians are of opinion that the grenade contained only brimstone and assafoetida, and was meant to plague Cotton Mather with a very evil perfume.|$|R
60|$|Finally {{the people}} {{suspected}} that Governor Belcher was secretly endeavoring {{to establish the}} Episcopal mode of worship in the provinces. There was enough of the old Puritan spirit remaining to cause most of the true sons of New England to look with horror upon such an attempt. Great exertions were made to induce the king to remove the governor. Accordingly, in 1740, he was compelled to resign his office, and <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> into the bargain, to Mr. Shirley.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{found no}} fault with him," [...] replied Grandfather. [...] "It {{was no time}} to quarrel with the {{governor}} when the utmost harmony was required in order to defend the country against the French. But Pownall did not remain long in Massachusetts. In 1759 he was sent to be governor of South Carolina. In thus exchanging one government for another, I suppose he felt no regret, except at the necessity of leaving <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> behind him." ...|$|R
60|$|So he {{arose from}} <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> {{and went out}} of the library. Near the door he met his son Samuel, who seemed downcast and out of spirits. The boy had heard, probably, that some of his playmates were taken ill with the small-pox. But, as his father looked cheerfully at him, Samuel took courage, trusting that either the wisdom of so learned a {{minister}} would find some remedy for the danger, or else that his prayers would secure protection from on high.|$|R
60|$|While {{the angry}} mob in King Street were {{shouting}} his name, Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson sat quietly in <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair,</b> unsuspicious {{of the evil}} {{that was about to}} fall upon his head. His beloved family were in the room with him. He had thrown off his embroidered coat and powdered wig, and had on a loose-flowing gown and purple-velvet cap. He had likewise laid aside the cares of state and all the thoughts that had wearied and perplexed him throughout the day.|$|R

60|$|The {{children}} were now accustomed to assemble round <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> at all their unoccupied moments; and often {{it was a}} striking picture to behold the white-headed old sire, with this flowery wreath of young people around him. When he talked to them, it was the past speaking to the present, or rather to the future,--for the {{children were}} of a generation which had not become actual. Their part in life, thus far, was only {{to be happy and}} to draw knowledge from a thousand sources. As yet, it was not their time to do.|$|R
60|$|SHORT STORIES AND SKETCHES. Many {{young people}} become {{familiar}} with Hawthorne as a teller of bedtime stories long before they meet him {{in the role of}} famous novelist. In his earlier days he wrote <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>Chair</b> (modeled on a similar work by Scott), dealing with Colonial legends, and broadened his field in Biographical Stories for Children. Other and better works belonging to the same juvenile class are A Wonder Book (1851) and Tanglewood Tales (1853), which are modern versions of the classic myths and stories that Greek mothers used to tell their children long ago.|$|R
60|$|Governor Shirley, {{all this}} time, was {{probably}} in an ecstasy of impatience. He could not sit still a moment. He found no quiet, not even in <b>Grandfather’s</b> <b>chair,</b> but hurried to-and-fro, {{and up and down}} the staircase of the Province House. Now, he mounted to the cupola, and looked sea-ward, straining his eyes to discover if there were a sail upon the horizon. Now, he hastened down the stairs, and stood beneath the portal, on the red freestone steps, to receive some mud-bespattered courtier, from whom he hoped to hear tidings of the army.|$|R

60|$|But Sir William Phips had {{not always}} worn a gold {{embroidered}} coat, nor always sat {{so much at}} his ease {{as he did in}} <b>Grandfather’s</b> <b>chair.</b> He was a poor man’s son, and was born in the province of Maine, where he used to tend sheep upon the hills, in his boyhood and youth. Until he had grown to be a man, he did not even know how to read and write. Tired of tending sheep, he next apprenticed himself to a ship-carpenter, and spent about four years in hewing the crooked limbs of oak trees into knees for vessels.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, <b>Grandfather’s</b> <b>chair</b> {{stood in}} its {{customary}} {{place by the}} fireside. The bright blaze gleamed upon the fantastic figures of its oaken back, and shone through the open-work, so that a complete pattern was thrown upon {{the opposite side of}} the room.

Anon, seeming to remember that these antics were unworthy of such a dignified and venerable chair, it suddenly stood still. But soon it began to dance anew.|$|R

60|$|All these books, no doubt, were tossed {{about in}} confusion, thus forming a visible {{emblem of the}} manner in which their {{contents}} were crowded into Cotton Mather's brain. And {{in the middle of the}} room stood table, on which, besides printed volumes, were strewn manuscript sermons, historical tracts, and political pamphlets, all written in such a queer, blind, crabbed, fantastical hand, that a writing-master would have gone raving mad at the sight of them. By this table stood <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair,</b> which seemed to have contracted an air of deep erudition, as if its cushion were stuffed with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and other hard matters.|$|R
60|$|To say the truth, {{our friend}} Charley {{was very much}} out of humor with the storm, because it had kept him all day within doors, and {{hindered}} him from making a trial of a splendid sled, which Grandfather had given him for a New-Year's gift. As all sleds, nowadays, must have a name, the one in question had been honored with the title of <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair,</b> which was painted in golden letters {{on each of the}} sides. Charley greatly admired the construction of the new vehicle, and felt certain that it would outstrip any other sled that ever dashed adown the long slopes of the Common.|$|R

60|$|The new {{governor}} found <b>Grandfather's</b> <b>chair</b> in the Province House. He was struck with its noble and stately aspect, but was of opinion that age and hard services {{had made it}} scarcely so fit for courtly company as when it stood in the Earl of Lincoln's hall. Wherefore, as Governor Belcher was fond of splendor, he employed a skilful artist to beautify the chair. This was done by polishing and varnishing it, and by gilding the carved work of the elbows, and likewise the oaken flowers of the back. The lion's head now shone like a veritable lump of gold. Finally Governor Belcher gave the chair a cushion of blue damask, with a rich golden fringe.|$|R
