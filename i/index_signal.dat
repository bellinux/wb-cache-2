Unlike optical ray tracing where the medium between objects typically has a constant refractive <b>index,</b> <b>signal</b> ray tracing must deal with the complexities of a spatially varying refractive index, where changes in ionospheric electron densities influence the refractive index and hence, ray trajectories. Two sets of signals are broadcast at two different elevation angles. When the main signal penetrates into the ionosphere, the magnetic field splits the signal into two component waves which are separately ray traced through the ionosphere. The ordinary wave (red) component follows a path completely independent of the extraordinary wave (green) component.|$|E

The imager works by spinning a disk {{in front of the}} viewer's eyes. The disk is black for 180 degrees and in some cases has 60 degree wedges of transparent red, green, and blue filters. The user looks through this to the Vectrex screen. The Vectrex synchronizes the rotation of the disk to the software frame rate as it draws 6 screens: with the right eye covered: the left eye red image, then green, and then the blue image is drawn... and then, while the left eye is covered by the black 180 degree sector: the right eye red, green, and then the blue image is drawn. Only one eye will see the Vectrex screen and its 3 associated images (or colors) at any one time while the other will be blocked by the 180 degree mask. The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Viewmaster. The disc spins freely and is driven by a motor. The Vectrex software generates its own frame-rate and compares it to an <b>index</b> <b>signal</b> from the glasses once per revolution. Score is kept of how many wheel rotations are early compared to the software frame rate, and how many are late. The software tries to keep these two trends equal by adjusting the power being delivered to the motor that spins the filter and mask wheel. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control the motor speed: the ratio of the [...] "on" [...] time versus the [...] "off" [...] time of a rapid stream of power pulses to the motor. In this way the software synchronizes the wheel rotation to the software's frame rate, or drawing time, for the combined and repeating group of up to 6 evolving images.|$|E

40|$|A long AE index {{time series}} {{is used as}} a crucial magnetospheric {{quantity}} in order to study the underlying dynainics. For this purpose we utilize methods of nonlinear and chaotic analysis of time series. Two basic components of this analysis are the reconstruction of the experimental tiine series state space trajectory of the underlying process and the statistical testing of an null hypothesis. The null hypothesis against which the experimental time series are tested is that the observed AE <b>index</b> <b>signal</b> is generated by a linear stochastic signal possibly perturbed by a static nonlinear distortion. As dis ' ' ating statistics we use geometrical characteristics of the reconstructed state space (Part I, which is the work of this paper) and dynamical characteristics (Part II, which is the work a separate paper), and "nonlinear" surrogate data, generated by two different techniques which can mimic the original (AE <b>index)</b> <b>signal.</b> lie null hypothesis is tested for geometrical characteristics which are the dimension of the reconstructed trajectory and some new geometrical parameters introduced in this work for the efficient discrimination between the nonlinear stochastic surrogate data and the AE index.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we {{critically}} compare {{the consequences of}} two assumptions on the physical nature of the AMO <b>index</b> <b>signal.</b> First, we show that the widely used approach based on red noise statistics cannot fully reproduce the empirical correlation properties of the record. Second, we consider a process of long range power-law correlations and demonstrate its better fit to the AMO signal. We show that in the latter case, the multidecadal oscillatory mode of the smoothed AMO index with an assigned period length of 50 – 70 years can be a simple statistical artifact, a consequence of limited record length. In this respect, a better term to describe the observed fluctuations of a smooth power-law spectrum is Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). ...|$|E

40|$|During conflict, males often {{assess their}} opponent's {{fighting}} ability and motivation via dynamic signals. We conducted an interactive video playback study using male Jacky dragons, Amphibolurus muricatus, {{to determine which}} signalling strategy was the most effective at deterring aggression and eliciting submission. A 3 D computer-animated lizard was used to present aggressive signals (push-up displays) and submissive ones (slow arm-waves). This approach reproduced natural display motor patterns precisely while controlling variation in morphology. Treatments all commenced with the stimulus lizard producing bouts of push-ups, but then diverged after the subject lizard's responses, according to predetermined rules. Lizards attacked the stimulus more frequently when it responded to submission with slow arm-waves, revealing that their behavior during a contest is sensitive to social contingencies. Individuals that signal submission without retreating are likely to incur a receiver retaliation cost. In addition, assessment processes are surprisingly sophisticated, involving the monitoring of both an <b>index</b> <b>signal</b> (push-ups) and a conventional one (slow arm-waves) during a single interaction. 7 page(s...|$|E

Despite much work in these fields done on birds virtually nothing is known about the heritability of vocal traits in birds. Here, we study a captive population of more than 800 zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with regard to the quantitative genetics of call and song characteristics. We find very high heritabilities in nonlearned female call traits and considerably lower heritabilities in male call and song traits, which are learned from a tutor and hence show much greater environmental variance than innate vocalizations. In both sexes, we found significant heritabilities in several traits such as mean frequency and measures of timbre, which reflect morphological characteristics of the vocal tract. These traits also showed significant genetic correlations with body size, as well as positive genetic correlations between the sexes, supporting a scenario of honest signaling of body size through genetic pleiotropy (" <b>index</b> <b>signal</b> "). In contrast to such morphology-related voice characteristics, classical song features such as repertoire size or song length showed very low heritabilities.
