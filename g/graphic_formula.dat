However, before parameter estimation, numerical analysis of uncertainty propagation ofparameters {{is required in}} order to know which parameter to estimate, and how to estimateit. In this paper, an approximate solution to the distribution of dependent random variablesis applied to numerical models of groundwater. First-order second-moment method ofmultidimensional Tayor-series expansion, that is, is presented in matrix form for such analysisso as to calculate the mean and the covariance of predicted groundwater heads due to manyuncertainty parameters. This algorithm is applied to an assumed groundwater basin and its results are presentedin <b>graphic</b> <b>formula,</b> and are compared with those calculated by Monte Carlo simulation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the nature of}} graphic formulas in 5 -, 7 -, and 9 -year-old children when {{they were asked to}} draw a house and a television in a free condition, and then to draw from photographs of these objects. Assuming that the frequency of occurrence of a feature in children’s drawings reflects its semantic weight, we studied the relations between occurrence and order of production of features to assess {{the extent to which a}} core-to-periphery progression principle (van Sommers, 1984) applies to the graphic formulas. The results showed that this principle was essentially present in the free drawing context. Under copying conditions, the order of production of the features was under the influence of perceptual and geometric factors, which elicited the production of subsystems of features at the depends of the application of the core-to-periphery progression principle. In the free condition, the core-to-periphery principle was mostly relevant in accounting for graphic formulas of the house in the young children (5 and 7 years), and of the television at ages 7 and 9. We suggest that the development of a <b>graphic</b> <b>formula</b> is partially related to the development of the object as a category in the child’s conceptual system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{numerical}} analysis of finite element coupling infinite element is recently used to si-mulate {{the effects of}} unbounded foundation of stresses and displacements. In this thesis, the finite element analysis is adopted to simulate the piles and the near soil; between the pile and the soil a joint element is designed to imitate the relative settlement while the infinite element is used to im-itate the distant soil. elastic analysis way for concret elements and infinite elements are used, K-G model and E-U model for near soil. Calculation results show that using Goodman contact element to simulate the interaction of pile and soil {{has the advantage of}} flexibility;and the <b>graphic</b> <b>formula</b> of the calculation curves of nonlinear µ−E model and K-G model accords with that of the meas-ure curve while the elastic calculation curve is far from the measure curve;the skin friction and pile-tip resistance pressure of the corner pile is the largest, the side pile less, and the center pile the least. The analysis of one example shows that the analytical model adopted in the thesis is reasona-ble, the results are both reasonable and accurate. 1...|$|E

40|$|Design {{knowledge}} incorporates {{knowledge and}} information about designed objects and their attributes, as well as about methods and means for undertaking the design process. Such design knowledge is articulated in several different representations or languages. This paper presents a typology of the languages of engineering design, emphasizing the representation of designed objects and the articulation and representation of the cognitive processes of design. Design languages include verbal or textual statements, drawings and <b>graphics,</b> <b>formulas,</b> and numbers. Still other design languages follow from computational styles. The languages of design and their computer-based implementations are empirical in origin, since observation reveals that these languages are derived not from an overarching theory, but from our experience in {{trying to understand what}} we do when we: talk about designed objects, articulate design processes, and teach computers how to do these things as well. Next to presenting a typology of the languages of engineering design, and discussing the role of these languages in design activity, the paper also discusses the possibility of automating design activity through the design and manufacture of expert systems for product design.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{simulating}} nonlinear control systems using spreadsheets is presented. Various nonlinear blocks are simulated using <b>graphics</b> and cell <b>formulas,</b> and are generated by clicking on specially developed toolbar buttons. These blocks can be connected to one another using a simple and intuitive procedure again based on graphics and toolbar buttons. A complete nonlinear system can thus be created by generating and connecting its constituting basic blocks, using the simple graphics interface provided. The corresponding data may then be entered in the familiar manner as illustrated, and finally the system can be simulated literally at {{the click of a}} button. Such a system can be analyzed by calculating its time response to any input signal or by using other methods such as phase-plane trajectories. The simulation is characterized by its availability, flexibility, and simplicity. The paper provides several examples to illustrate the simulation capabilities available. The first example considers a servo with a dead-zone and a saturation amplifier, the second illustrates the steps required to obtain a phase-plane trajectory, and the third example considers a nonlinear system having a PI controller and nonlinearity consisting of soft saturation.

40|$|A simplex-lattice {{statistical}} {{project was}} employed to study an optimization method for a preservative system in an ophthalmic suspension of dexametasone and polymyxin B. The assay matrix generated 17 formulas which were differentiated by the preservatives and EDTA (disodium ethylene diamine-tetraacetate), being the independent variable: X- 1 = chlorhexidine digluconate (0. 010 % w/v); X- 2 = phenylethanol (0. 500 % w/v); X- 3 = EDTA (0. 100 % w/v). The dependent variable was the Dvalue obtained from the microbial challenge of the formulas and calculated when the microbial killing process was modeled by an exponential function. The analysis of the dependent variable, performed using the software Design Expert/W, originated cubic equations with terms derived from stepwise adjustment method for the challenging microorganisms: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Besides the mathematical expressions, the response surfaces and the contour graphics were obtained for each assay. The contour graphs obtained were overlaid in order to permit the identification of a region containing the most adequate <b>formulas</b> (<b>graphic</b> strategy), having as representatives: X- 1 = 0. 10 (0. 001 % w/v); X- 2 = 0. 80 (0. 400 % w/v); X- 3 = 0. 10 (0. 010 % w/v). Additionally, {{in order to minimize}} responses (Dvalue), a numerical strategy corresponding {{to the use of the}} desirability function was used, which resulted in the following independent variables combinations: X- 1 = 0. 25 (0. 0025 % w/v); X- 2 = 0. 75 (0. 375 % w/v); X- 3 = 0. These formulas, derived from the two strategies (graphic and numerical), were submitted to microbial challenge, and the experimental Dvalue obtained was compared to the theoretical Dvalue calculated from the cubic equation. Both Dvalues were similar to all the assays except that related to Staphylococcus aureus. This microorganism, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, presented intense susceptibility to the formulas independently from the preservative and EDTA concentrations. Both <b>formulas</b> derived from <b>graphic</b> and numerical strategies attained the recommended criteria adopted by the official method.
