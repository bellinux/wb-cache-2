25|$|The {{two films}} {{established}} Farley {{as a relatively}} bankable star and {{he was given the}} title role of Beverly Hills Ninja, which finished in first place at the box office on its opening weekend. Drug and alcohol abuse related problems interfered with Farley's film work at this time. Production of his final film, Almost Heroes, was held up several times so Farley could enter rehab. He was known among comedic contemporaries and friends to be sensitive about how his comedy was perceived ("fatty falls down, <b>everybody</b> <b>goes</b> home happy"), and was particularly hurt by harsh critical reactions to Tommy Boy, a film he enjoyed making.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, [...] "It's about everybody. You'll have songs with {{different}} emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What <b>everybody</b> <b>goes</b> through." [...] On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, [...] "I'm very content right now. I take everything a day at a time. Every time I hear good news, I'm shouting out, 'Praise God.' Everybody around me is so excited, I still haven't got it. I haven't really felt it like they're feeling it for me." ...|$|E

[...] He spent {{his share of the}} band's income quickly, and was a regular at London clubs such as the Speakeasy and the Bag O' Nails; the combination of pills and alcohol escalated into alcoholism and drug addiction later in his life. [...] " [...] went through the same stages <b>everybody</b> <b>goes</b> through– the bloody drug corridor," [...] he later reflected. [...] "Drinking suited the group a lot better." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Consider the lyrics: Prayed {{through the}} nights / Felt so alone / Suffered from {{alienation}} / Carried the weight {{on my own}} / Had to be strong / So I believed / And now I know I've succeeded / In finding the place I conceived. Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes {{that can be a}} problem. If you look a certain way <b>everybody</b> <b>goes,</b> 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Ono's small {{book titled}} Grapefruit is another seminal piece of {{conceptual}} art. [...] First published in 1964, the book reads {{as a set}} of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is [...] "Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until <b>everybody</b> <b>goes</b> home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies." [...] Grapefruit has been published several times, most widely distributed by Simon & Schuster in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. , art critic for The Village Voice and Vogue, called Grapefruit [...] "one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960's." [...] He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner came in and [...] "did virtually the same things" [...] she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.|$|E
500|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} Wenger's first without Rice, {{who retired in}} late spring. Bould was named as his replacement, who {{specialised}} in defensive work. Arsenal struggled to find consistency {{in the league and}} were 12 points behind leaders Manchester United by November 2012. A month later, Wenger came under strong criticism following his side's exit in the League Cup to Bradford City, when a full-strength team lost on penalties to opposition three divisions below. Further cup defeats to Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich in the FA Cup and Champions League, respectively, ended Arsenal's trophy chances for an eighth consecutive season. Before the first leg, Wenger had criticised the media for reporting he was about to sign a contract extension, and said of the Blackburn game: [...] "We lost it in the last 20 minutes, {{so there are a lot}} of superficial analyses that you cannot accept. Because one guy says something, <b>everybody</b> <b>goes</b> the same way".|$|E
