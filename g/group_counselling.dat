40|$|Educational {{institutions}} should {{ensure that}} students develop a professional identity, as well as safeguarding their well-being and activating awareness and change processes. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the efficacy of <b>group</b> psychodynamic <b>counselling</b> as a means of reinforcing academic identity–considered the forerunner of professional identity–and psychological well-being in a group of final-year undergraduates studying clinical psychology. Thirty-three final-year-students of clinical psychology who participated in six <b>group</b> psychodynamic <b>counselling</b> sessions were compared with sixteen final-year students of clinical psychology who had never participated in an intervention of this kind. The results suggested that <b>group</b> psychodynamic <b>counselling</b> made students feel more capable of managing their lives and more open to new experiences as well as encouraging them to perceive their relationships as more positive and satisfying, to believe that their life is meaningful, and to achieve greater self-acceptance. The in-depth exploration also prompted students to consider their commitment to their choice of career. <b>Group</b> psychodynamic <b>counselling</b> also reinforced students’ educational choice, as the likelihood of students becoming less committed to this choice was reduced after the intervention. Thus, the study confirmed the efficacy of <b>group</b> psychodynamic <b>counselling</b> as a means of reinforcing both academic identity and promoting well-being and demonstrated that it is a tool clinical psychologists and university teachers could use to activate self-reflection and change within educational settings...|$|R

50|$|Plan International Viet Nam, in {{cooperation}} with the Ha Noi Department of Education and Training (DOET), Center for Research and Applied Sciences in Gender, Family, Women and Adolescents (CSAGA), and the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW), has implemented a “Gender Responsive School Pilot Model project” meant to prevent and respond to SRGBV. The 3-year project (2014-2016), funded by UNTF and Plan International involves 20 secondary/high schools in Ha Noi. The intervention provides teacher training on gender equality, SRGBV, and reproductive health to encourage lessons on related topics to be integrated into the curriculum. The intervention also encourages the formation of youth leadership organizations and awareness-raising activities with parents. A key component of the project is the establishment of a psychological counselling room at the participating schools. To date, nearly 2,300 students have received individualized counselling and over 4,100 students have received <b>group</b> <b>counselling.</b> The project has found that while only 6% of students in Viet Nam know about a public hotline for counselling, 21% of the total students in the 20 schools of the project have sought counselling services.|$|E

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to put forward {{proposals}} in relation to tackling the growing problem of cocaine misuse in Ireland, the National Drug Strategy Team established a Cocaine Sub-Group to recommend pilot interventions aimed at particular types of cocaine users. One of the treatment projects recommended by the sub-group involved evaluating three inter-disciplinary evidence-based interventions to working with cocaine users. The project was to be piloted by the South Western Area Health Board (SWAHB) at Castle Street Clinic. The three proposed interventions included: • <b>Group</b> drug <b>counselling</b> with a contingency management component comprising 12 weekly sessions; • Individual drug <b>counselling</b> combined with <b>group</b> drug <b>counselling</b> with a contingency management module; and • Cognitive behavioural therapy and <b>group</b> drug <b>counselling</b> with a contingency management component. The SWAHB project was based on research findings from the NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) in the United States. The NIDA’s research recommended an eclectic <b>Group</b> Drug <b>Counselling</b> (GDC) and also a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) approach to working with cocaine drug users. The project’s target group comprised poly drug users attending the Castle Street Clinic who were using cocaine and who were also in receipt of methadone maintenance...|$|R

[...] In Group Psychotherapy with Addicted Populations, Flores notes that attack therapy can take place when individuals are psychologically intimidated in a confrontational atmosphere. [...] In her book Help at Any Cost: How the Troubled-teen Industry Cons Parents And Hurts Kids, Maia Szalavitz writes that attack therapy can include the tactics of isolation, and rigid imposition of rules, which later leads to a restoration of limited permissive freedom, and an acknowledgement of those that did comply with the strict rules. [...] Psychologist Donald Eisner writes in The Death of Psychotherapy that attack therapy [...] "attempts {{to tear down the}} patient's defenses by extreme verbal or physical measures". [...] Tudor describes attack therapy in <b>Group</b> <b>Counselling,</b> writing that the individual is ridiculed in front of others, and cross-examined and questioned about their personal behavior patterns. [...] According to Maran's book Dirty, attack therapy can take place in [...] "all-night encounter groups and daily interactions". [...] Monti, Colby, and O'Leary write in Adolescents, Alcohol, and Substance Abuse that in attack therapy, there was a movement to: [...] "tear them down in order to build them up", referring to a methodology of tearing down the individual ego in order to then educate the individual in the inherent thought-patterns of the group and the group leader.|$|E
