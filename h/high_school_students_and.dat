5|$|Tragic Kingdom {{was first}} {{released}} by Trauma and Interscope on October 10, 1995. The album {{did not appear}} on the Billboard 200 chart until {{the first week of}} January 1996. To promote the album, Trauma launched a street campaign that targeted <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> the skateboarding community. No Doubt performed on the Warped Tour, which was sponsored by several skateboarding companies, and at several skateboarding festivals. The album remained low on the Billboard 200 and did not enter the top 100 until February 1996, when it jumped 27 positions to number 89. Palmer attributed the jump to a Channel One News program that Stefani hosted in January 1996, which was broadcast in 12,000 classrooms, and the band's subsequent performance at a Blockbuster store in Fresno, California.|$|E
5|$|World War II caused {{enrollment}} {{to decline}} {{and the student}} body consisted mainly of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|At least 31mass graves were {{discovered}} in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war. In 1969, the historian Jozo Tomasevich wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed {{that the number of}} victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put the figure at about 5,000. In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some {{estimates of the number of}} those killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav Glišić, placed the figure at about 3,000. In 2007, Pavlowitch wrote that inflated figures of 6,000–7,000victims were advanced and widely believed for many years, but that German and Serbian scholars had recently agreed on the figure of 2,778. In the same year, the curator of the 21stOctober Museum at Kragujevac, Staniša Brkić, published a book listing the names and personal data of 2,794victims. Of the total killed, 144were <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> five of the victims were 12years old.|$|E

5|$|The Elements of Botany (1836), an {{introductory}} textbook, {{was the first}} of Gray's many works. In this book Gray espoused the idea that botany was useful not only to medicine, but also to farmers. Gray and Torrey published the Flora of North America together in 1838. By the mid-1850s the demands of teaching, research, gardening, collecting, and corresponding had become so great, and he had become so influential, that Gray wrote two high school-level texts in the late 1850s: First Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology (1857) and How Plants Grow: A Simple Introduction to Structural Botany (1858). The publishers pressured Gray to make these two books non-technical enough so that <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> non-scientists could understand them. As with most scientists in American academic institutions, Gray found it difficult to concentrate purely on research.|$|E
5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the actual cut-off was 2.8 (this actual cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.|$|E
