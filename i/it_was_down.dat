5|$|Ajax {{accepted}} a €12million bid for Mido from Marseille in July, and completed the move on {{a five-year contract}} on 12 July 2003, which made Mido the most expensive Egyptian player ever. He made his debut for Marseille in 1–0 win over Guingamp on 1 August 2003. Jean-Pierre Papin gave praise to Mido, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> to players like him that the French Ligue 1 was among the top European leagues. He scored against Real Madrid in a UEFA Champions League match in November, which Marseille lost 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Alan Tudyk applied {{through a}} casting office and {{several months later}} was called in for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with two {{candidates}} {{for the role of}} Zoe (Wash's wife) and was told that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> to him and one other candidate. The Zoes he tested with were not selected (Gina Torres eventually received the role) and Tudyk was sent home, but received a call informing him he had the part anyway. His audition tape is included in the special features of the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company, a new {{settlement}} {{was established in}} 1916, this time built entirely upon copra export. Much of the South islet was deforested {{to make way for}} coconut palms, a non-indigenous plant. The business venture, however, went into debt, and the island's settlement slowly decreased in population. By 1926, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> to only ten residents and by 1936, the settlement consisted of only two Tahitian families before abandonment sometime in the late 1930s.|$|E

The episode would be repeated on the frontline BBC One a day later, during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot. The BBC Three broadcast was viewed by 827,000 and a 7.3% audience share.

The winner of this match {{would go on}} to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. DDP eliminated Nash by performing a dropkick, which caused Nash to fall over the top rope and down to the floor. With Nash eliminated, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> to Brown and DDP.

Despite the ratings decline, the BBC already commissioned a fourth series of Spooks before the third series even began broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaching}} the upper Naktong valley {{at the end}} of July, the North Korean divisions engaged {{in this part of the}} drive southward had suffered heavy casualties. The NK 1st Division in battling across the Mun'gyong plateau against the ROK 6th Division not only suffered great losses in the ground battle but also took serious losses from UN aerial attack. Prisoners reported that by the time it reached Hamch'ang {{at the end of}} July <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> to 3,000 men from the 5,500 it had before the push. The NK 15th Division, according to prisoners, also lost heavily to artillery and mortar fire in its drive on Sangju against ROK troops and the US 24th Infantry Regiment, and was down to about 5,000 men at the end of July, from 7,500 before the fight. In contrast, the NK 13th Division had bypassed Hamch'ang on the west and, save for minor skirmishes with ROK troops and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties.|$|E

25|$|To {{attempt to}} reduce {{the effect of the}} Bushes Wind, the course was narrowed and pushed further to the centre of the river.

25|$|While {{initially}} (right {{after the}} annexation), salaries rose, {{especially those of}} government workers, this was soon offset by the increase in prices caused by the depreciation of the ruble. Subsequently, after Russian authority became established, wages were cut back again by 30% to 70%. Tourism, previously Crimea's main industry, suffered in particular; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> by 50% from 2014. Crimean agricultural yields were also significantly impacted by the annexation. Ukraine cut off supplies of water through the North Crimean Canal, causing the 2014 rice crop to fail, and greatly damaging the maize and soybean crops.|$|E

25|$|The {{increase}} in unemployment was {{largely due to the}} government's economic policy which resulted in the closure of outdated factories and coal pits. Manufacturing in England and Wales declined from around 38% of jobs in 1961 to around 22% in 1981. This process continued for most of the 1980s, with newer industries and the service sector enjoying significant growth. Many jobs were also lost as manufacturing became more efficient and fewer people were required to work in the sector. Unemployment had fallen below 3million by the time of Thatcher's third successive election victory in June 1987 {{and by the end of}} 1989 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> to 1.6million.|$|E
25|$|By 1913, South Fort George had a {{population}} of 1,500 residents, but {{by the fall of}} 1914, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> to less than 1,000. Part of the reason for its decline was the construction of Prince George. Several of the South Fort George business had moved to better locations along George Street in the new town. Nevertheless, the main reason was the onset of the Great War, which caused many local men to enlist and travel overseas. The war also caused John Stewart of Foley, Welch and Stewart to put a halt to the local construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, which devastated the local economy even further.|$|E
