The ships performed a variety of secondary duties {{until the end of}} the war. On 17 June 1919, both ships were struck from the naval register and sold to the A. Bernstein Company in Hamburg. The shipping company had the ships rebuilt as freighters; Odin served in this capacity until she was scrapped in 1935, however Ägir accidentally grounded near the Karlsö lighthouse on the island of Gotland in 1929 and proved to be a total loss.|$|E

[...] "I wasn't even called a make-up man. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> their laboratory and developed their plastic appliances for make-up. But my salary was $25 a week.

500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him {{sitting up in bed}} holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting in 1993 on his {{relatively}} late {{start in}} writing fiction, DeLillo said [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> earlier, but evidently I wasn’t ready. First, I lacked ambition. I {{may have had}} novels in my head but very little on paper and no personal goals, no burning desire to achieve some end.

"When Jeanette MacDonald {{approached}} me for coaching lessons", wrote Lehmann, [...] "I was really curious how a glamorous movie star, certainly spoiled by the adoration of a limitless world, {{would be able}} to devote herself to another, a higher level of art. I had the surprise of my life. There couldn’t have been a more diligent, a more serious, a more pliable person than Jeanette. The lessons which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> with a kind of suspicious curiosity, turned out to be sheer delight for me. She studied Marguerite with me—and lieder. These were the ones which astounded me most. I am quite sure that Jeanette would have developed into a serious and successful lieder singer if time would have allowed it." ...|$|E
