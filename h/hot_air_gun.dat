50|$|Royalex was {{extremely}} tough but if hit hard enough could be dented. If this happened such dents could be recovered by applying a hand held <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> which re-expanded the core {{to blow out}} the dent.|$|E
50|$|To {{remove and}} recover all components, both {{through-hole}} and surface-mount, from a board which itself is usually no longer needed, a flame or <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> {{can be used}} to rapidly heat all parts so they can be pulled off. Parts may be damaged, and toxic fumes emitted, if excessive temperature or prolonged heating is used.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{a single}} SMD with a hot-air gun to melt all solder joints {{between it and}} the PCB is usually the first step, {{followed}} by removing the SMD while the solder is molten. The pad array on the conductor board should then be cleaned of old solder. It is quite easy to remove these residues by heating them to melting temperature. A soldering iron or <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> can be used with desoldering braid.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{guns are}} used in physics, {{materials}} science, chemistry, engineering, and other laboratory and workshop settings. Different types of heat gun operating at different temperatures and with different airflow {{can be used to}} strip paint, shrink heat shrink tubing, shrink film, and shrink wrap packaging, dry out damp wood, bend and weld plastic, soften adhesives, and thaw frozen pipes. Heat <b>guns,</b> often called <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> or <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> stations for this application, {{are used in}} electronics to desolder and rework surface-mounted circuit board components.Heat guns are also used for functional testing of overheat protection devices, in order to safely simulate an overheat condition.|$|R
40|$|Prototype {{thin film}} heat flux sensors have been {{constructed}} and tested. The sensors {{can be applied to}} propulsion system materials and components. The sensors can provide steady state and fast transient heat flux information. Fabrication of the sensor does not require any matching of the mounting surface. Heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference across the upper and lower surfaces of an insulation material. The sensor consists of an array of thermocouples on the upper and lower surfaces of a thin insulating layer. The thermocouples for the sensor are connected in a thermopile arrangement. A 100 thermocouple pair heat flux sensor has been fabricated on silicon wafers. The sensor produced an output voltage of 200 - 400 microvolts when exposed to a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> heat <b>gun.</b> A 20 element thermocouple pair heat flux sensor has been fabricated on aluminum oxide sheet. Thermocouples are Pt-Pt/Rh with silicon dioxide as the insulating material. This sensor produced an output of 28 microvolts when exposed to the radiation of a furnace operating at 1000 C. Work is also underway to put this type of heat flux sensor on metal surfaces...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} be shaped, Worbla is warmed up, usually with a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun,</b> until it becomes {{formable}} at 90 C. It is then draped over formers or hand-moulded (wearing gloves) to shape. The inbuilt adhesive allows multiple layers to be laminated easily, for either strength or to add bas relief detail. A common technique for wearable props such as armour is to laminate it to thin EVA foam sheet, giving a light and slightly flexible carapace.|$|E
50|$|Rework (or re-work) is {{the term}} for the {{refinishing}} operation or repair of an electronic printed circuit board (PCB) assembly, usually involving desoldering and re-soldering of surface-mounted electronic components (SMD). Mass processing techniques are not applicable to single device repair or replacement, and specialized manual techniques by expert personnel using appropriate equipment are required to replace defective components; area array packages such as ball grid array (BGA) devices particularly require expertise and appropriate tools. A <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> or hot air station is used to heat devices and melt solder, and specialised tools are used {{to pick up and}} position often tiny components.|$|E
50|$|A {{soldering}} station, invariably temperature-controlled, {{consists of}} an electrical power supply, control circuitry with provision for user adjustment of temperature and display, and a soldering iron or soldering head with a tip temperature sensor. The station will normally have a stand for the hot iron when not in use, and a wet sponge for cleaning. It is most commonly used for soldering electronic components. Other functions may be combined; for example a rework station, mainly for surface-mount components may have a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun,</b> vacuum pickup tool, and a soldering head; a desoldering station will have a desoldering head with vacuum pump for desoldering through-hole components, and a soldering iron head.|$|E

50|$|The unshrunk tubing is fitted on {{the wire}} before making the connection, then slid down to cover the joint after it is made. If the fit is tight, {{silicone}} lubricant can be applied without compromising the heat-shrink material. The tubing is then shrunk to wrap tightly around the joint by heating in an oven or with a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> or other source of hot gas flow. Convenient but less consistent methods for shrinking the tube include a soldering iron held close to but not touching the tube, or the heat from a lighter. Uncontrolled heat can cause uneven shrinkage, physical damage and insulation failure, and these methods are not recommended by heatshrink suppliers. If overheated, heat-shrink tubing can melt, scorch or catch fire like any other plastic. Heating causes the tubing to contract to between half and one sixth of its original diameter, depending on the material used, providing a snug fit over irregularly shaped joints. There is also longitudinal shrinking, usually unwanted {{and to a lesser}} extent than narrowing, of typically around 6%. The tubing provides good electrical insulation, protection from dust, solvents and other foreign materials, and mechanical strain relief, and is mechanically held in place (unless incorrectly oversized or not properly shrunk) by its tight fit.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the in situ {{consolidation}} of polypropylene matrix/glass reinforced rovings was performed combining two heating systems, an infrared oven and a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun,</b> and a roll pressing the commingled roving during hoop winding on a cylindrical mandrel. Process parameters {{were set up}} {{on the basis of a}} preliminary simulation of the heat transfer along the roving and then comparison of the results with experimental temperature profiles obtained by a noncontact thermometer. Composite samples were cut along the cylinder axis for mechanical characterization. Physical properties, such as density and void content, obtained using different processing conditions, were compared.

40|$|Abstract Salmonella {{is a major}} {{foodborne}} pathogen threat andan economic {{burden for}} the food business, individuals and society. Therefore, low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use devices for Salmonella detection are required to prevent foodborne outbreaks and ensure food safety. This paper describes Salmo-nella detection on centrifugal microfluidic compact disc (CD) using Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) tech-nique. LAMP amplification and Salmonella detection are sim-ultaneously integrated on this developed centrifugal microflu-idic device. A cheap <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> was used to produce a temperature for the DNA amplification resulting in system miniaturization and low cost. The whole process from reagent preparation, Salmonella DNA amplification and detection was automatically performed on the microfluidic CD and SYBR Green I was used for detection process.

40|$|Early on, it {{was found}} that NEAT LARC-TPI {{thermoplastic}} polyimide powder behaved elastoplastically at pressures to 20 ksi and temperatures to 260 degrees celcius (below MP). At high resin assay, resin powder could be continuously cold-flowed around individual carbon fibers in a metal rolling mill. At low resin assay (2 : 1, C:TPI), fiber breakage was prohibitive. Thus, although processing of TPI below MP would be quite unique, it appears that the polymer must be melted and flowed to produce low resin assay prepreg. Fiber tow was spread to 75 mm using a venturi slot tunnel. This allowed intimate powder/fiber interaction. Two techniques were examined for getting room temperature powder onto the room temperature fiber surface. Electrostatic powder coating allows the charged powder to cling tenaciously to the fiber, even while heated with a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> to above its melt temperature. A variant of the wet slurry coating process was also explored. The carbon fibers are first wetted with water. Then dry powder is sprinkled onto the wet tow and doctor-rolled between the fibers. The wet structure is then taken onto a heated roll, with hot air guns drying and sinter-melting the powder onto the fiber surfaces. In both cases SEM shows individual fibers coated with powder particles that have melted in place and flowed along the fiber surface via surface tension...|$|E
