5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} {{wanted to make}} a sequel to Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand.</b> In 1984, they finally shot Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> II until 1986 and {{with the advent of the}} home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.|$|E

Dog <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> added Dave Philips on pedal steel guitar and lead guitar, and Santiago and Feldman began making occasional appearances with the group live and on record. Both Pistolero and Dog <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> were produced by Nick Vincent.|$|E
5|$|Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> is a {{landmark}} American gay pornographic film released {{at the very}} beginnings of the Golden Age of Porn. The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> was the first gay porn film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety, {{and one of the}} earliest porn films, after 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to gain mainstream credibility, preceding 1972's Deep Throat by nearly a year.|$|E

5|$|Produced on {{a budget}} of $8,000, the film is a loose {{collection}} of three segments depicting Donovan's sexual adventures at a gay beach resort community. Promoted by Poole with an advertising campaign unprecedented for a pornographic feature, Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> premiered in New York City in 1971 and was an immediate critical and commercial success. The film brought star Donovan international recognition. A sequel, Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> II, was released in 1986 {{but was unable to}} match the success of the original.|$|E

5|$|Today at Omaha jagged {{remains of}} the harbor {{can be seen at}} low tide.

At the top of the bluff overlooking Omaha near Colleville is the American cemetery.

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the stern had become deeply embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E
5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> is a non-fiction {{book about}} climate change denial, coauthored by Haydn Washington and John Cook, with a {{foreword}} by Naomi Oreskes. Washington had a background in environmental science prior to authoring the work, and Cook was educated in physics and founded the website Skeptical Science which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of global warming.

After the publication of Climate Change Denial: Heads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand,</b> Cook coauthored another book on the subject, Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand,</b> directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sand</b> II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E
5|$|Leigh Leigh, born Leigh Rennea Mears, was a 14-year-old {{girl from}} Fern Bay, {{on the east}} coast of Australia, who was murdered on November 3, 1989. While {{attending}} a 16-year-old boy's birthday party at Stockton Beach, Leigh was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on the beach that a reviewing judge later called non-consensual. After being kicked and spat on by the group, Leigh left the party. Her naked body was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> dunes nearby the following morning, with severe genital damage and a crushed skull.|$|E
