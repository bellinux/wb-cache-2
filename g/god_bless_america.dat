25|$|In 1997, when Irish {{documentary}} filmmaker Alan Gilsenan made <b>God</b> <b>Bless</b> <b>America,</b> {{consisting of}} six American cities {{seen through the}} eyes of six American authors, Hunt was invited to participate. Her participation resulted in Marsha Hunt's Philadelphia. According to Gilsenan, Hunt attributes the success of American democracy and capitalism to the crime of slavery, a crime that must be understood if America is to have peace. Hunt fell in love with Gilsenan and moved to the Wicklow mountains near Dublin with him, where in 1999 she helped him fight colon cancer, drawing on her own experiences with the disease. Hunt is no longer romantically involved with Gilsenan, who has since married and fathered a child, but as of 2008 still sees him.|$|E
