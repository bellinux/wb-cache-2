40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} first {{investigate}} synchronous (SYN) versus asynchronous (ASY) {{mode of propulsion}} and, second, investigate the wheel camber effects on sprinting performance as well as temporal parameters. Seven wheelchair basketball players performed four maximal eight-second sprints on a wheelchair ergometer. They repeated the test according to two modes of propulsion (SYN and ASY) and two wheel cambers (9 ° and 15 °). The mean maximal velocity and push power output was greater in the <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> compared to the asynchronous mode for both camber angles. However, the fluctuation in the velocity profile is inferior for ASY versus SYN mode for both camber angles. Greater push time/cycle time (Pt/Ct) and arm frequency (AF) for <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> versus asynchronous mode and inversely, lesser Ct and rest time (Rt) values for the <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode,</b> for which greater velocity were observed. SYN mode leads to better performance than ASY mode in terms of maximal propulsion velocity.

This {{is done by}} showing that every sequential circuit operating in <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> can be transformed into an equivalent sequential circuit operating in fundamental mode with {{the same number of}} internal states. The basic idea is to consider, for both the major types of sequential circuits, circuits having pulse inputs -PS circuits for sequential circuits operating in <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode,</b> and PF circuits for sequential circuits operating in fundamental mode - and to investigate the relationship between them. A concurrent and a self concurrent operation is defined for PF ciruits, and it is shown that any <b>synchronous</b> <b>mode</b> sequential circuit can be transformed into an equivalent normal or self-concurrent PF circuit realization inherently free of essential hazards and critical races. Moreover, it is seen that static hazards that can influence the circuit operation can be detected and eliminated by formal methods. The circuit realizations discussed in this paper are composed by a defined number of subcircuits, and it is shown that these subcircuits can in turn be decomposed to obtain circuit realizations with flipflops or register elements. Finally, it is shown that by similar methods level-input fundamental mode sequential circuits can also be transformed into self-concurrent PF circuit realizations in order to eliminate essential hazards and critical races...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Direct {{numerical}} simulation and a stability analysis are employed {{to investigate the}} relationship between incidence angle (α) and three-dimensional wake stability for cylinders with an elliptical cross-section. An ellipse with a major to minor axis ratio of 2. 0 is used, and incidence angles between the major axis and flow direction are varied from α = 0 ◦ to 30 ◦. Reynolds numbers up to Re = 500 were considered based on the minor-axis dimension. Incidence angles were varied to break the wake centreline symmetry, which permitted {{an investigation into the}} subsequent availability, stability, and symmetry of three-dimensional instability modes in the wake. At zero incidence angle, two <b>synchronous</b> <b>modes</b> with symmetries consistent with Mode B behind a circular cylinder are identified. One resembles Mode B in structure, and is neutrally stable at Re = 419. 7 with a spanwise wavelength λz/d = 0. 825. The other is neutrally stable at Re = 283. 1 with λz/d = 2. 40. For Re. 250 at longer wavelengths (λz/d ≈ 4. 5) a quasi-periodic mode is detected, but before it acquires a positive growth rate it is suppressed by shorter and longer-wavelength <b>synchronous</b> <b>modes.</b> Beyond Re ≈ 330, evidence of a <b>synchronous</b> <b>Mode</b> A-type instability is observed with λz/d ≈ 4. With an increase in incidence angle, the proportion of wavelengths for which quasi-periodic modes are the fastest-growing instabilities reduce, and due to the increasing “bluffness ” of the body, the growth rates increase across a wide range of spanwise wavelengths...|$|R
