That is why there is no necessity in developing of theoretical and methodical vehicle for studying this phenomenon. Topicality of this subject is conditioned {{by the fact that}} understanding of character and features <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition are impossible without determination of its types. The {{purpose of this article is}} to define types <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition under conditions of globalization of world economy. Definition of forms and types <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition is debatable in economics literature; therefore today general approach is absent. Besides in most cases scientists lack unified approach when selecting and examining descriptions <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition classifications. Often researchers make no difference between such concepts as "type" and "form" <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition. Authors offer logical communication chart for such categories as "maintenance", "form", "type", and on this basis necessity to examine tax competition as form of economic competition is grounded and it is proposed to identify certain displays <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition that have general signs as well as its types but not as forms.

40|$|Abstract Background The HTLV-I oncoprotein, Tax, is a {{pleiotropic}} protein whose {{activity is}} partially regulated by {{its ability to}} interact with, and perturb the functions of, numerous cellular proteins. Tax is predominantly a nuclear protein that localizes to nuclear foci known as Tax Speckled Structures (TSS). We recently reported that the localization <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> and its interactions with cellular proteins are altered in response to various forms of genotoxic and cellular stress. The level <b>of</b> cytoplasmic <b>Tax</b> increases in response to stress and this relocalization depends upon the interaction <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> with CRM 1. Cellular pathways and signals that regulate the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> remain to be determined. However, post-translational modifications including sumoylation and ubiquitination are known to influence the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> and its interactions with cellular proteins. The sumoylated form <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> exists predominantly in the nucleus while ubiquitinated Tax exists predominantly in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we hypothesized that post-translational modifications <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> that occur in response to DNA damage regulate the localization <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> and its interactions with cellular proteins. Results We found {{a significant increase in}} mono-ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> in response to UV irradiation. Mutation of specific lysine residues (K 280 and K 284) within Tax inhibited DNA damage-induced ubiquitination. In contrast to wild-type Tax, which undergoes transient nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in response to DNA damage, the K 280 and K 284 mutants were retained in nuclear foci following UV irradiation and remained co-localized with the cellular TSS protein, sc 35. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the localization <b>of</b> <b>Tax,</b> and its interactions with cellular proteins, are dynamic following DNA damage and depend on the post-translational modification status <b>of</b> <b>Tax.</b> Specifically, DNA damage induces the ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> at K 280 and K 284. Ubiquitination of these residues facilitates the dissociation <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> from sc 35 -containing nuclear foci, and stimulates nuclear export <b>of</b> <b>Tax</b> through the CRM 1 pathway. </p...|$|R
