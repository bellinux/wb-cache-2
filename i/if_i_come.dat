The singer revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone, the writers had to re-write the original lyrics of the song. [...] "I asked them to change the words to 'Born to Make You Happy.' It was a sexual song," [...] she revealed. [...] "I said, 'This may be a little old for me.' Because of the image thing, I don't want to go over the top. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> out being Miss Prima Donna, that wouldn't be smart. I want to have a place to grow".|$|E
2500|$|Abu Bakr {{became the}} Caliph on 8 June 632 {{and he died}} on 23 August 634. He is {{considered}} by sunnis as {{the greatest of all}} the companions of Muhammad. Jubayr ibn Mut'im reported that a woman came and spoke to Muhammad about a matter. He asked her to come back later some time. She said, [...] "Tell me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> later and do not find you?" [...] Jubayr ibn Mut'im said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back. He said, [...] "If you do not find me then go to Abu Bakr." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Gillette's rented room, {{authorities}} confiscated Brown's {{love letters}} to Gillette as evidence. District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud {{to the court}} during the trial {{in the fall of}} 1906, and Brown's letters gave the trial national attention. Brown pleaded with Gillette in the letters to accept responsibility for her condition, the pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette, and she said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: [...] "I know I shall never see any of them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I do love Mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) Sometimes I think if I could tell mamma, but I can't. She has trouble enough as it is, and I couldn't break her heart like that. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back dead, perhaps if she does not know, she won't be angry with me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} coldly; [...] "the rock is loose. Besides, the ledge is narrow, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> down heavily, we might both fall over." ...|$|R
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come,</b> I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
60|$|Harry (Interrupts). Yes. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{to sit on}} it like a blamed toad in a hole. Thank you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Always, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to ask {{you about}} the work. I don't want {{anything}} to do with love when I'm at work. Work's work--" ...|$|E
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{back to a}} refrain;--the ideas go on--as {{though we}} are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding....|$|R
6000|$|He {{went off}} and Carrie sat down. [...] "Looks as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> along when <b>I</b> was needed. The fellow talked in hints. What did he mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, bowing, [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{to claim}} the reward, I should ask for more even {{that you would be}} {{inclined}} to give." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's absurd! Still, no {{one could}} think {{anything}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> with you. Hilary, have you thought that if she continues coming to Father---" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, then, I hate to {{be wrapped}} in cotton wool; I want to breathe. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to grief, it's my own affair; nobody need mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is certain}} {{therefore}} that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> near to them I should be dragged down as wood is dragged of an eddy, nor would Egypt see me any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{here only}} as a visitor. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> on a mission from the queen, or {{as one of a}} {{deputation}} of chiefs, I should wear my ornaments. I wear them at home now, those that my father had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{and lived}} here---" [...] said Jacob. [...] "What's my share, Cruttendon? Oh, very well. Have it your own way. Those silly birds, {{directly}} one wants them--they've flown away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye fight well, ye carles of Gizur, Ospakar's son! Ye are heroes, surely! Say now, mighty men, will ye {{stand there}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> down alone against you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; I 'll be hanged <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back!" [...] exclaimed Dr. Allingham, who {{was evidently}} very angry. And {{he started his}} horse again with the whip.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let it be so. On {{what day}} shall we say? Will Friday suit you? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{to you on}} Friday morning, perhaps Miss Pucker will be there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{the master}} of the Preceptory," [...] went on Acour, {{changing}} his tone somewhat, [...] "might take fright and think I wished to violate his sanctuary <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> there with thirty spears at my back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was afraid}} {{there would be}} interviewers and boring people {{generally}} to meet me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> by the boat by which I was expected, so I got into another, and I've arrived a day before my time.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You won't mind <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{down to see}} {{you some}} time, will you?" [...] {{questioned}} the man. [...] "I want your teachers to know how brave you have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After you swore so at poor Bradley I {{ordered that}} there should be no gongs when we were alone. <b>I</b> did <b>come</b> up to your door about half past eight. I crept up. But I was afraid I might upset you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> in." ...|$|R
6000|$|FERRAND. [With faint eagerness.] My breakfast. I was in poverty-- veree bad off. You gave me ten francs. I thought I had {{a little}} the right [WELLWYN makes a {{movement}} of disconcertion] seeing you said that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to England---- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "On the contrary, she {{is always}} there to welcome me. By Saint Anne, I should be heavy-hearted <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to any village between this and the Bluffs of the Illinois, and did not find my wife waiting to greet me." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought he}} would be more glad <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> upon him with his breakfast, in that {{unexpected}} manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but another man! ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{suddenly}} a slight movement behind them, {{and they turned}} sharply round. [...] "It is I, se√±or. I am anxious about Dias, and I didn't like staying there by myself. I thought you would not mind <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> up and sat by you." ...|$|R
