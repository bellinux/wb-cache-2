[...] When {{an interview}} for his cover story shared with, Idol runner-up, Adam Lambert, Allen explained, [...] "It's a song that has a really good message-that we only have so much time, let's make the most of it. It's definitely got one of the choruses where I can picture people rolling down the windows of their cars and singing along to it." ...|$|E

This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So it was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E

500|$|Rachel is {{regularly}} portrayed by Lea Michele, {{and as a}} child has been played by Lauren Boles. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. In an interview with The Washington Post, Michele commented on her casting, saying, [...] "I was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> thrown into this—this {{is one of the}} first television jobs I've ever had. Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort. The character I'm playing is really outgoing—she performs in her everyday life as though she's performing in front of a huge audience." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Get Back" [...] {{was written}} by Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas, and {{produced}} by the Jonas Brothers alongside John Fields.

She said, [...] "It's kind of a fun, upbeat song and it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> fun to sing to the person that I wrote it about." [...] The Jonas Brothers provided backing vocals and guitars on the track. In addition to co-producing the song, Fields also provided bass, guitars and keyboards. Jack Lawless played the drums, and John Taylor contributed backing vocals and played the guitar. The song was released as the lead single for Don't Forget on August 12, 2008, in the United States and Canada via digital download. The edited Radio Disney version was released on the same day.|$|E

In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Fall Out Boy {{began writing}} {{material}} for a possible successor shortly {{after the release of}} the 2007 album, Infinity on High. In March 2008, the band attempted to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only musical act to perform in all seven continents in nine months, planning to perform in Antarctica for an audience of scientists. However, the group was unable to make the flight from Punta Arenas, Chile to Antarctica due to poor weather. Despite this unsuccessful attempt, the group felt energized from the experience and became inspired to write more music. This led to more material to sift through when the band decided to enter the studio. Fall Out Boy spent time during June 2008 formulating ideas at Avron's home, where [...] "three to four" [...] song ideas were developed. Lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump and bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz began turning these ideas into songs over the following month. Wentz explained that the process was the same as usual: [...] "I'll go over to Patrick's house and he'll <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> sit there and play songs, and I'll be like, 'Ah, that one's awesome!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The anime {{series has}} been {{compared}} with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, [...] " [...] rather aggravating to watch at times, but {{seems to have no}} problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality." [...] The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as [...] "so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> went under the radar. So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get the girl and...thud. Nothing." [...] The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Bob Daily and directed by David Grossman. Filming for the episode began on July 11, 2011. The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E

On November 24, 2014 it was also uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. @lilinternet served as the director and Ed Burke was the creative director for the visual filmed in Houston, Texas. After seeing the music video for [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Diplo which was directed by @lilinternet and featured various shots of New Orleans, Beyoncé expressed her wish to collaborate with him on the visual for [...] "No Angel". Diplo contacted the director, telling him that the singer is interested in a collaboration. Following discussions with Beyoncé's team, he went to Houston with Ben Solomon and visited her team from Parkwood Entertainment to discuss about his work. In an interview with Vice magazine, @lilinternet recalled that the whole project occurred [...] "very rapidly". Beyoncé told the director she wanted to create a tribute to Houston, as he specialized in working on filming various locations and [...] "environmental beauty". Initially, the video was planned to be shot in a span of eight days. Only little narratives were planned; however @lilinternet revealed that the team opted for driving around Houston and filming various locations and people. He stated, [...] "We had so many Houston legends all together in that video, and they all really worked hard to let us capture Houston properly. Beyonce's team hooked us up with the legends. It's her hometown and she wanted its heroes represented. And I think they really respected the fact we weren't in and out." [...] He added that the video was completed without any [...] "exaggeration" [...] and felt that there was [...] "so much beauty that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> innately was in the people and in the city". The director revealed that {{he had a lot of}} freedom while working on the video and added, ...|$|E

[...] Aside from Stipe, other influences that Willett was inspired by were Woody Allen (Husbands and Wives), John Cassavetes (A Woman Under the Influence) and Jonathan Franzen (The Discomfort Zone).|$|E

Albert Hammond Jr. took to Twitter to clarify that “we met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all.” He also tweeted, [...] "Sorry everyone {{we are not in}} the studio recording" [...] and that there were [...] "a lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murphy {{decided to}} play under a stage name after people came to his shows {{thinking}} he was a different and already established musician named Nick Murphy. He settled on the name Chet Faker as an homage to Chet Baker: [...] "I listened {{to a lot of}} jazz and I was a big fan of ... the way he sang, when he moved into mainstream singing. He had this really fragile vocal style—this really, broken, close-up and intimate style. The name is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> an ode to Chet Baker and the mood of music he used to play—something I would like to at least pay homage to in my own music." [...] Other influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother's Motown albums and his father's [...] "chilled out Ibiza CDs".|$|E
2500|$|Fimber Bravo and Charles Hayward {{were asked}} to {{collaborate}} on the album and Taylor said they immediately created unexpected material.

He stated that it was not something the band would have thought to do and that it worked [...] "tremendously well". The recordings Hayward did only lasted for a few hours and Taylor stated, [...] "we were <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> left to our own devices {{to see if we could}} make use of it".

2500|$|Before {{the opening}} tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet {{each other by}} bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the {{contacts}} were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late {{in the fourth quarter}} but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew {{there was a lot of}} talk about the brick wall and all that. But I think that was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." [...] O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying [...] "I'm over it. It's old news to me."

2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album. Einziger stated that the song was {{conceived}} in 2009 with Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band and [...] "was written {{at a time when}} I didn’t know whether or not {{we were going to go}} back and start working on new music for a new album. I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> put it aside and then when we started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great. But that actually was one of the last things that we did for this album." ...|$|E

In Melbourne, in December 1980 and January 1981, they joined engineer and producer, Tony Cohen, in Armstrong's Audio Visual Studios (A.A.V. Studio 2) and Richmond Recorders, to record their tracks. Music journalist, Toby Creswell, noted that the band [...] "struggled with creating their own identity some of them also began indulging an appetite for alcohol and heroin". Cave was embarrassed by [...] "Zoo Music Girl" [...] but noted [...] "we were digging for something and we <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> found it with some songs" [...] and cited [...] "King Ink" [...] as an example of [...] "a certain kind of sound that we wanted to work with on records after that".|$|E
