Newton, his successor, presented an <b>illustrated</b> <b>address</b> and the branch members presented two chairs to him in gratitude of his service. He subsequently chaired the Lincolnshire county branch of the NFU, and in 1937 was presented with a gold watch and silver salver in recognition of his eight years of service in that position. He took an active interest in the NFU's labour committees, and was on the Lindsey and Kesteven Wages Committee {{at the time of his}} death. For many years, Jenkinson also represented the NFU on the Agricultural Wages Board and was a life member of both the Lincolnshire Branch and the Executive Committee.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{anisotropy}} {{can affect}} the strains measured by neutron diffraction. If this is not properly accounted for significant errors can result in the calculated stresses. This paper <b>illustrates</b> <b>addresses</b> this issue using measurements of the residual strain field around a 60 mm long single weld bead deposited {{on the surface of}} a 17 mm thick stainless steel plate. Measurements were made on ENGIN-X, the engineering spectrometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK). Diffraction spectra from these measurements have been fitted using both single and multi-peak fitting approaches. Both residual strain and stress results have been presented for (111) and (200) single peak fits and compared to a multi-peak fit (Rietveld) analysis. Results from these analyses have revealed significant anisotropy in the response of the individual lattice planes. This effect is most severe in measurements carried out in the normal direction and is shown to be predicted using an elasto-plastic self-consistent model...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} to undertake the development of reduced-order models (ROMs) in variable geometry fluid–thermal problems using the method of snapshots. First, some snapshots are calculated in computational domains that vary in both shape and number of grid points. These snapshots are projected onto a so-called virtual grid (defined in a virtual geometry) using a smooth transformation. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes are obtained from the associated virtual snapshots and projected back onto the original grids, where {{they are used to}} define expansions of the flow variables. The associated POD mode amplitudes are obtained minimizing a residual, which is calculated in terms of the reconstructed solution. POD modes are calculated using only a part of the computational domain, which will be called the projection window, and the residual is defined using {{only a limited number of}} points of the computational domain. This methodology is <b>illustrated</b> <b>addressing</b> the problem of heat transfer downstream of a backward facing step in the 2 -D steady, laminar regime, with three free parameters, namely the Reynolds number, the wall temperature, and the step height...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the themes of}} a Virtual Special Issue (VSI) of Environmental Education Research focused on policy research in environmental and sustainability education (ESE). The broad purpose behind preparing the VSI was to consider the challenges involved in linking particular concepts of environment and sustainability with key themes in educational policy, and how this remains a heavily contested practice. Examples drawn from two decades of studies {{published in the journal}} show how these might be <b>illustrated,</b> <b>addressed,</b> problematized and possibly transcended. The introduction traces how ESE researchers have dealt with key trends, complexities and issues in the policy-practice-research nexus both conceptually and empirically. It also illustrates how researchers within the field might reimagine and reinvigorate policy research on ESE, and how working with researchers from other fields who offer different perspectives, ideas and expertise might aid the cross-fertilisation of a complex terrain of ideas, policy and practice. In so doing, we hope the accompanying VSI inspires renews interest into the (at times, fickle) relationship between environmental and sustainability education, and the dual worlds of possibility and tension that take place both within, and surrounding, their fields of policy and research...|$|R

40|$|Start with {{a single}} shape. Repeat it in some way—translation, {{reflection}} over a line, rotation around a point—and you have created symmetry. Symmetry is a fundamental phenomenon in art, science, and nature that has been captured, described, and analyzed using mathematical concepts for a long time.

40|$|Born in North African {{countries}} {{and brought up}} in transcultural environments, Algerian painter Baya Mahiddine, Francophone author Helene Cixous, and Tunisian writer Hele Beji produce works that challenge national, cultural, and social frames of category. This study demonstrates how the three women explore their complex sociocultural backgrounds and produce original works and ideas that undermine preset conventions. The paper examines Baya, Cixous, and Beji in separate chapters {{in order to identify}} the commonalities and distinctions of their personal histories and works. They develop innovative techniques or ideas from a transcultural perspective that <b>illustrates,</b> <b>addresses,</b> and transcends issues concerning a complicated past: a disconnected heritage, an inaccessible homeland, and fading cultural traditions. Despite their divergent origins and motivations, they converge in the project of recreating identity through the creative activities of painting and writing. From a unique "transpective" viewpoint that crosses the boundaries of time, gender, and culture, they re-present and rewrite femininity, memory, and sociocultural realities in a way that surpasses classifications and expectations. Whether due to their sociocultural circumstance or personal conviction, they exercise a liberated creativity in order to contribute important works to the fields of visual arts and Francophone literature. In the process of investigating the significant and original accomplishments of Baya, Cixous, and Beji, this study reveals the location of "truth" of each woman's transcultural identity. Their plural subjectivity lies beyond the confines of a frame and resides in an undesignated "passe-partout," or interstitial, region. Within the spaces of art and literature, the three women discover a place of illusion, a "Ka'aba," where they can enjoy a liberated creativity and express their singularity. As the twenty-first century heads towards an increasingly transnational future, individuals globally must similarly embrace a transpective vision in order to maintain cross-cultural understanding and solidarity...|$|R
40|$|The {{great promise}} of {{collaborative}} technologies that improve group awareness and communication is often overshadowed by accompanying privacy concerns. In such systems, the privacy concerns {{relate to the}} individuals one interacts with – colleagues, superiors, subordinates, friends and family. Using Instant Messaging as an example, we <b>illustrate</b> that <b>addressing</b> privacy issues in such systems can be quite challenging. Based on in-depth interviews with experienced IM users, we propose that the primary concern regarding privacy in collaborative awareness systems is an individual’s desire to control how one appears to others. We advocate that designers empower users to appropriately monitor and manage the impression they project towards others by providing modifiable policies and settings, with suitable defaults and seamless interaction. We also provide a few design suggestions to seed further exploration. ...|$|R

40|$|The new Swedish Armed Forces will be radically {{different}} from the previous invasion-oriented defence and the Armed Forces will be a smaller and more flexible organization, better adapted to the international sphere. With the aim of meeting up {{with the demands of}} the transformed Armed Forces posture for professional competence, the Regular Officer Programme (YOP) was introduced in the autumn of 1999. This dissertation aims at attempting to <b>illustrate,</b> <b>address</b> the problems and investigate to what degree the basic officer training of the Regular Officer Programme (Swedish: YOP) and the professional competence of newlygraduated Second Lieutenants can be seen as being legitimate within the scope of professional practices of the Swedish Armed Forces, and how this legitimacy can be described and understood. The theoretical framework of the dissertation is comprised of a sociocultural perspective and institutional theory. The five central concepts of the dissertation are: professional practice, institutional rules, professional competence, learning and legitimacy. The empirical elements of the dissertation were collected during 2001 and 2002 and comprise data from six part-studies. The informants were officer cadets after their first year of the Basic Officer Training Programme (YOP) and officers up to the rank of general. The methods for collecting data have been {{in the form of a}} questionnaire study, focus group conversations at thirteen military units, three document studies and a study with questions via e-mail. The questionnaire study was processed by using the computer programme SAS. The focus group conversations, the document studies and the answers via e-mail to questions were analyzed and put into categories contents wise according to the sentence category principle in positive and negative statements, respectively, in relation to YOP and the professional competence of the newly-graduated Second Lieutenants. Results show that both YOP as well as the professional competence of the newly-graduated Second Lieutenants cannot be regarded as being fully legitimate among the informants or within the all the professional practices of the Armed Forces...|$|R
40|$|Persons 'branded' as {{dangerous}} to the public's health often try to hide their status (as smokers, as HIV positive, etc). Yet, {{a small but growing}} subgroup has re-appropriated stigma symbols and voluntarily branded themselves as 'marked' individuals, rebellious, transgressive and refusing to be shamed by their status. In this article we examine voluntary branding as acts of resistance, paying particular attention to bodily practices that disrupt dominant aesthetic and moral/political sensibilities. We draw on our research and observations in the realms of smoking and bareback sex to <b>illustrate</b> and <b>address</b> broader issues of branding the self, aesthetics and the politics of resistance, surveillance, and transgression. Drawing on the work of Goffman, Bourdieu and Foucault, we examine the interpenetration of class, physical and social capital, and unequal social relations.
