Penn Jillette, with Teller sitting at his side, said [...] "What we talked about during the show was where the stuff was there", meaning that he was using the data {{that the government had}} when they instituted the ban, then said regarding this episode they were [...] "very likely" [...] wrong. Penn went on to describe [...] "a new study that came out of England, just recently, that seems to have more stuff about it" [...] and [...] "right now, as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> there probably is danger in secondhand smoke". He {{went on to say that}} this was a small portion of the program, and their main point was their opposition to [...] "outlawing" [...] smoking in privately owned businesses, which they still [...] "stand behind 100%".|$|E

They have marched past my prison windows {{to let me know}} that there are ten thousand fighting men in Dublin— 'felons' in heart and soul. I thank God for it. The game is afoot, at last. The liberty of Ireland may come sooner or come later, by peaceful negotiation or bloody conflict— but it is sure; and wherever between the poles I may chance to be, I will hear the crash of the down fall of the thrice-accursed British Empire." ...|$|E
