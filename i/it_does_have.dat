5|$|Somerset has few {{industrial}} centres, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> {{a variety}} of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Unemployment {{is lower than the}} national average; the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing, tourism, and health and social care. Population growth in the county is higher than the national average.|$|E

5|$|Although the Philippines lacks large {{mammalian}} predators, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> {{some very}} large reptiles such as pythons and cobras, together with gigantic saltwater crocodiles. The largest crocodile in captivity, {{known locally as}} Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle has the longest body of any eagle, it generally measures 86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg (10.4 to 17.6 lb). The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} Accipitridae family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> some saprophytic tendencies {{and may be}} able to use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{low-cost}} carrier, IndiGo offers only economy class seating accommodating 180 passengers per aircraft. To keep fares low, IndiGo {{does not provide}} complimentary meals in any of its flights, though <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a buy-on board in-flight meal programme. No in-flight entertainment is available and Hello 6E is the in-flight magazine published by IndiGo. IndiGo offers premium services, where the passengers can avail additional benefits like a pre-assigned seat, multiple cancellations and priority check-in at a higher fare.

5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that the technique is flawless, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, or subjected to certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until the technique is canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, as shown by Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's body part is absent.|$|E
5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no Garden of Eden in Rule 90, a configuration with no predecessors. The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a Garden of Eden because <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E
5|$|SpiceJet {{has moved}} away from the typical {{low-cost}} carrier service model of economy class-only seating. The airline offers premium services under the name SpiceMax, whereby passengers can obtain additional benefits including pre-assigned seats with extra legroom; complimentary meals on board; priority check-in and boarding; and priority baggage handling; at a higher fare. Otherwise SpiceJet does not provide complimentary meals in any of its flights for <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a buy-on board in-flight meal programme.

5|$|The {{density of}} indium, 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal crystal {{system in the}} space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a size effect in bending and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Egholm {{contains}} the former Egholm Skole, which was closed in 1972 when a ferry service to Aalborg was established and {{children on the}} island began attending the Vesterkæret Skole in Aalborg. Today the old school on Egholm is run as a school camp by the City of Aalborg, with 18 beds and facilities for 60 people. Skipper Clement International School is a private school for children between 6 and 16. The international department conducts its classes in English, {{the first to be}} established in the Jutland peninsula, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> department which educates in Danish, like the public schools in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Keyser Creek was historically {{affected by}} coal mining {{and has been}} channelized. It has no flow in dry conditions, although <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> some during and after storms. As of 1991, the watershed is mostly forested. The first white settlers in Lackawanna County settled near the creek in 1769. Keyser Creek is a major second-order tributary of the Lackawanna River. Since 2013, a trailhead of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail has been situated near the creek. A number of bridges have also been built across the creek.|$|E

5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|From the {{descriptions}} of the rules above, two important properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen. First, in Rule 184, for any finite set of cells with periodic boundary conditions, the number of 1s {{and the number of}} 0s in a pattern remains invariant throughout the pattern's evolution. Rule 184 and its reflection are the only elementary cellular automata to have this property of number conservation. Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array of cells, it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although Rule 184 is not symmetric under left-right reversal, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} swapping the roles of the 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update rule.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E
