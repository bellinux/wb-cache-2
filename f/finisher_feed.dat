40|$|INTRODUCTION Since the {{discovery}} {{and development of}} the first antibiotics prior to the Second World War, these drugs have {{played an important role in}} curing disease in humans and animals. In 1946 experiments showed that low, subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics could increase feed efficiency and growth in food animals, and the addition of various antibiotics to feed for livestock was initiated. Because prevention of disease transmission and enhancement of growth and feed efficiency are critical in modern animal husbandry, there has been widespread incorporation of antibiotics into animal feeds in many countries (74, 144). Swine feeds in the U. S. often contain antibiotics for purposes of disease prevention and growth promotion. According to data from USDA and Animal Health Institute, antibiotics are currently used in 90 % of starter, 75 % of grower and more than 50 % of <b>finisher</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs (34, 37, 38, 55, 173).

A total of 225 one-day-old male Cobb broiler chickens were assigned into 3 treatments, with 5 replicates of 15 chickens each. Chickens were fed maize-soybean meal basal diets following a 3 phase (i. e., starter, grower and <b>finisher)</b> <b>feeding</b> program. Depending on PFA inclusion level, treatments were: no PFA (PFA- 0), PFA at 100  mg/kg (PFA- 100) and PFA at 150  mg/kg (PFA- 150). Feed and water were available ad libitum. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) during finisher phase was improved quadratically (P <  0. 05) with increasing PFA level. Overall, increasing PFA level increased body weight gain (BWG) in a linear (P <  0. 05) and quadratic (P <  0. 05) manner with treatments PFA- 100 and PFA- 150 being greater (P <  0. 05) compared with PFA- 0. Total tract apparent digestibility of dry matter increased linearly (P <  0. 05) and quadratically (P <  0. 05) with increasing PFA level. The apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) also increased linearly (P <  0. 05). Increasing PFA level resulted in a linear (P <  0. 05) increase in blood plasma TAC. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin - 18 (IL- 18) was reduced linearly (P <  0. 05) in spleen with increasing PFA level. In conclusion, PFA inclusion at 100  mg/kg diet positively influenced performance, whereas PFA inclusion at 150  mg/kg resulted in a stronger improvement in AMEn and plasma TAC. Finally, PFA inclusion resulted in a pattern of reduced pro-inflammatory biomarker IL- 18 at spleen.

30|$|Additional file  1 : Annexes 4 and 5 {{provide the}} {{correlation}} matrix between the simulated dietary feed {{components in the}} grower and finisher diets of the  CWSR model. This chart is presented to show {{the importance of the}} multi-stage LP modeling process in developing the relationship between dietary components in dietary simulation analyses. The figure clearly indicates that wheat inclusion is correlated with soy oil inclusion rates (corr.[*]=[*] 0.95 and R 2 [*]=[*] 0.90). On the other hand, there is a negative correlation between the inclusion of corn and that of soy oil (corr.[*]=[*]−[*] 0.96 and R 2 [*]=[*] 0.92). A similar correlation trend was found between these feeds in the grower and finisher diets. This is attributed to the low energy content in wheat versus corn grains, and therefore, additional dietary energy sources were provided by soy oil. Furthermore, the inclusion of wheat was negatively correlated with the inclusion of corn (−[*] 1.00), which is expected since in most cases the formulated diets where composed of one of these energy feeds. Furthermore, wheat inclusion had a negative correlation with RSM of −[*] 0.53 and a positive correlation found with Meth. Cyst. (0.88 in the starter diet and 0.75 in the grower diet) and a low correlation of 0.37 found in the finisher diet. These results indicate that in wheat-based diets, additional synthetic Meth. Cyst. is needed to meet the requirements when RSM is not used in the formulation. A similar conclusion can be drawn when testing the correlation between SBM and methionine. However, the negative correlation between RSM and Meth. Cyst. indicates that this byproduct is an interesting source to reduce expensive synthetic amino acids in diets. Simulated compound feed prices are presented in Additional file 1 : Annex 8. These prices will differ by location as they do not represent the farm gate feed price due to the omission of transportation and retailer costs, which are regionally dependent. Compared to a static and standard ration (corn and SBM based diet), using a multi-stage LP model, it is possible to generate a feed ration which, when looking at the year 2014, could give an average cost reduction of 8.8 USD per ton of starter feed, 4.6 USD per ton of grower feed, and 1.3 USD per ton of <b>finisher</b> <b>feed</b> (CSD model). This results in an average price reduction of 5.9 USD per ton of formulated feed. If we apply this price reduction for the year 2014, it results in a total cost reduction of 1.74 billion USD for starter, grower, and <b>finisher</b> <b>feed</b> combined, meaning that the broiler sector would have gained over 1.74 billion USD in 2014 benifiting from a monthly feed formulation and from inclusion of byproducts. Assuming a similar price reduction in layer chicken feed production, the magnitude of global poultry industry gain will increase up to 2.57 billion USD. The gain could be more than double if other livestock species are included in the analysis, given that the byproducts inclusion rate is of greater importance for ruminants. Using local byproducts may result in lower production costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, mainly associated with reduced transportation distances for feed inputs (Hristov et al. 2013).|$|E

The percentage pellets in the 50 and 100 % pelleted grower and finisher diets was 46 and 97 % and 51 and 81 %, respectively. The 14 days BW of the birds fed the crumbles was greater than those fed mash (mean 488 versus 421 g) and the BW of the chicks increased linearly as the percentage crumbles increased. The greater BW observed due to crumble quality at 14 days in the cages disappeared by 35 days in the floor pens. Birds fed 100 % pellets were heavier (3, 602 g) than 50 % pellets (3, 424 g) at 49 days with improved AdjFCR (2. 02 versus 2. 08) from 15 - 49 days. The relative gizzard weight of birds fed 50 % pellets was greater (0. 43 versus 0. 35 g/ 100 g BW) at 49 days of age. The results of these studies indicated that differences in BW due to percentage crumbles in the starter feed was not evident after 28 days while the greater percentage pellets in the grower and <b>finisher</b> <b>feeds</b> produced a greater BW and improved AdjFCR...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} work {{was designed to}} study the economics of Azolla production {{and its effect on}} feeding cost of swine. Azolla pinnata was included as a protein replacer in the concentrate feed at 0, 10 and 20 %, respectively in grower and <b>finisher</b> <b>feed</b> of pigs. This study was conducted for 120 days in growing (60 days) and finishing phase (60 days) using 18 crossbred Large White Yorkshire pigs divided into 3 groups (T 1, T 2 and T 3) with six pigs in each group. The quantity of Azolla required for the experiment was grown and the unit cost of fresh Azolla produced was Rs. 0. 56 and dry Azolla was Rs. 5. 65. The cost of grower, finisher ration and the expenditure of Azolla cultivation were considered for the calculation of feed per kg body weight gain. Mean daily feed intake recorded was 1. 75, 1. 69 and 1. 64 kg in pigs fed with rations G 1, G 2 and G 3, respectively during growing phase and 2. 03, 1. 96 and 1. 91 kg in pigs fed with rations F 1, F 2 and F 3, respectively during finishing phase. The cost of ration per day calculated was Rs. 24. 50, 22. 55 and 20. 75 for G 1, G 2 and G 3 groups during growing phase and during finishing phase was Rs. 26. 39, 24. 45 and 22. 90 for F 1, F 2 and F 3 respectively and the difference between the groups were significant (P < 0. 01).

40|$|A “plasmid-curing effect” of multiresistant Escherichia coli by flavophospholipol, an {{antibiotic}} {{used as an}} antimicrobial growth promoter (AMGP) in animal feeds, {{has been reported to}} occur in vitro and in vivo under experimental conditions. In this study, the effect of flavophospholipol under field conditions was studied. The prevalence and degree (proportion of resistant strains to the total numbers present per gram of feces) of resistance of indicator bacteria, E. coli and enterococci, was determined in fecal samples from three groups of pigs that were fed a commercial <b>finisher</b> <b>feed</b> without any AMGP. Group A was the negative control group without any AMGP, group B received the same feed with 9 mg of flavophospholipol/kg of feed (study group), and group C received the same feed with 15 mg of avoparcin/kg (positive control). Fecal samples from each pig were collected at the start {{and at the end of}} the study and assessed for the prevalence and degree of resistance against antibiotics commonly used either for therapy in pig medicine or as an AMGP. Before the start of the study, all pigs were colonized with multiresistant E. coli by mixing three resistant pig isolates through their feed after disturbance of the colonization resistance of the intestinal flora by a 3 -day course of lincomycin and spectinomycin. At the end of the study, the overall prevalence and degree of resistance of E. coli in the fecal flora had increased significantly in groups A and C but remained at the same level as at the start of the study in group B. The prevalence of vancomycin resistance was 44 and 41 % in groups A and B, respectively, but only very low numbers of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) per gram of feces were found. In the avoparcin-fed group, the prevalence was 72 %, and in 57 % of the samples, more than 50 % of all enterococci present were vancomycin resistant. The prevalence of resistant Enterococcus faecalis increased only in the flavophospholipol-exposed group, from 23 % before the start of the study to 43 % at the end of the study. It was concluded that flavophospholipol effectively suppressed the augmentation and dissemination of multiresistant E. coli in the intestinal flora of fattening pigs. Avoparcin use strongly selected for VRE carriage and excretion. Therefore, as neither flavophospholipol nor any related molecule is used therapeutically, no cross-resistance with therapeutic antibiotics exists and no transmissible resistance has been shown; the major decrease in resistance in intestinal E. coli of flavophospholipol-fed animals seemed to outweigh the small increase in the risk of transfer of flavophospholipol-resistant E. faecalis from animals to humans via the food chain...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the effect of chromium polynicotinate supplementation on performance, fat deposition and plasma lipids of broiler chickens. A total of 540 male broiler chicks (Cobb 500) were allotted to 6 dietary treatments. The dietary chromium polynicotinate levels were 0 (Control), 250, 500, 750, 1000 or 1250 μg/kg, respectively. At 10 - 28 days of age (grower phase), the 500 μg/kg concentration of chromium polynicotinate supplementation had a beneficial effect on feed intake and body weight gain of broilers (P< 0. 05). At 29 - 42 days of age (<b>finisher</b> phase), <b>feed</b> conversion ratio was decreased (P< 0. 05) in broilers fed with chromium polynicotinate supplement at levels of 250, 750, 1000 or 1250 μg/kg. Chromium polynicotinate did not affect the abdominal fat pad deposition. The results indicated that the 500 μg/kg level of chromium polynicotinate supplement decreased the plasma cholesterol concentration in the finisher phases. The chromium concentrations of 1000 and 500 μg/kg were more effective at grower and finisher phases, respectively (P< 0. 05). Plasma triglyceride was not affected by dietary chromium concentration.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} banning antimicrobial growth promoters on efficiency {{in the production of}} weaned and slaughter (finishing) pigs. We focus on the reaction of producers and production efficiency. We evaluate the estimated output and input shadow prices relative to market prices to analyse producer reactions and capture the impact on production efficiency by evaluating the effects of the ban changes on total factor productivity. To this end we model a multi product shadow profit function and incorporate output and input related shadow prices by using a second order flexible functional form. The development in total factor productivity is subsequently measured by calculating the Malmquist index on the farm level. To make infer-ences on the effect of banning growth promoters over time we regress in a second estimation step the changes in total factor productivity on potential explanatory factors by applying a bootstrapped censored regression procedure. Our results suggest that there was no effect of the ban on total factor productivity due to outputs and inputs substitution. Breeding pigs are pro-duced at the expense of weaned and <b>finisher</b> pigs. <b>Feed</b> input is over utilised relative to other inputs. The high shadow prices for substituting outputs are associated with better export mar-ket prices. These findings may have critical implications for the slaughtering plants with over capacity. animal health economics, food economics, shadow prices, efficiency, antimicrobial growth promoters, pig production, Livestock Production/Industries, Q 1, Q 11, Q 12, Q 24,...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of performance and}} P reduction in litter and manure from broilers fed rations with and without phytase enzyme was made with chickens reared on litter or in cages. Low-activity phytase supplemented as a dry powder to mash diets did not affect performance, but litter P accumulation was decreased 14 to 21 % in the finisher phase. Manure P content of broilers in cages was reduced 14 to 19 % during the starter and grower phases. Liquid phytase applied postpelleting to diets with 0. 5 % total P (0. 3 % available P) reduced litter P accumulation (14 to 19 %) and reduced manure P content in starter, grower, and finisher phases of the study. Phosphorus content in raw manure was decreased by 55 % during the <b>finisher</b> phase. <b>Feed</b> conversions of broilers in cages and on conventional litter-covered floors were improved significantly with postpellet application of liquid phytase. Feed conversion improvement was greater in birds in cages. Postpellet application of dry phytase was shown to be feasible based upon performance and reduction in litter P accumulation. Feed conversions were improved by 7 to 8 points (P < 0. 05) when compared to those of birds given a normal P level (0. 72 % total P) diet without phytase. Litter P accumulation was reduced between 20. 5 and 28. 5 % with dry phytase applied postpelleting. With liquid phytase applied postpelleting, litter P accumulation was reduced 26. 6 %.
