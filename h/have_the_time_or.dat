5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E

If some portions of society did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> means to practice the interconnected aristocratic rituals (spectating at the gymnasium, courtship, gifting), they could all satisfy their desires with prostitutes.

5|$|It remains likely, however, {{that it was}} {{constructed}} by Gundulf, based primarily {{on the history of}} the land holdings during the period. After the founding of the abbey, which Gundulf granted some of his lands around West Malling, St Leonard's became the administrative centre of Gundulf's remaining estates, before also being given to the nuns a few years later, shortly after his death in 1108.

25|$|In other cases, the {{delusion}} may {{be assumed}} to be false by a doctor or psychiatrist assessing the belief, {{because it seems to}} be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction.

This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Jeopardy! series, {{hosted by}} Art Fleming, premiered at 11:30a.m. Eastern (10:30 Central) on March 30, 1964, originating from the NBC headquarters in New York City's Rockefeller Center. NBC moved {{the program to}} 12:00 noon Eastern (11:00a.m. Central) after 18 months, making it accessible to businessmen coming home for their lunch break or else watching it on restaurant or bar sets, and college students departing their classes for the day. These two constituencies, who ordinarily did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> interest to view other daytime programs, made the show a runaway hit, propelling its ratings to second place among all daytime game shows {{by the end of}} the decade—second only to its immediate lead-in, The Hollywood Squares. The show had practically no trouble whatsoever against soap operas such as Love of Life on CBS and mostly sitcom reruns on ABC.|$|E

500|$|In {{isolation}} {{from the rest of}} the episode, many critics were baffled by the drastic changes to the Dorne storyline. [...] For io9, Charlie Jane Anders called it [...] "the absolute worst" [...] part of the episode, and criticized the Dorne storyline in general for giving Doran Martell [...] "a grand total of ten minutes' screentime" [...] before suddenly killing him off, given that he is alive in the novels and his major subplot from the books - that he was simply feigning a desire for peace while planning to betray the Lannisters - was not introduced at all before his departure. Alan Sepinwall from HitFix also disliked the Dorne scenes and summarized, [...] "I'll settle for not needing to audibly groan every time the story returns to Dorne, frankly." [...] For Vulture, Nate Jones wrote an op-ed piece specifically criticizing the Dorne storyline in seasons five and six, culminating in the changes in the season six premiere, which it felt to be bizarre and illogical - purely relying on shock value when the characters' actions don't make sense upon closer analysis. [...] Jones was also critical of how it was altering the female characters in Dorne, saying that they were changed from the novels to be [...] "the kind of violent, scantily clad women that emerge when creators want to pay lip service to feminism, but don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> inclination to create actual three-dimensional female characters." ...|$|E

Some fashionable cosmetics, such as those imported from China, Germany and Gaul, were so expensive that the Lex Oppia tried to limit their use in 189 BCE.

Working-class women could afford the cheaper varieties, but may not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> (<b>or</b> slaves) to apply the makeup {{as the use of}} makeup was a time-consuming affair because cosmetics needed to be reapplied several times a day due to weather conditions and poor composition.|$|R

[...] She said that Michael has the means, unlike some of the others, as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement before they married, and the flat that Kat's lover obtained could be listed on the books of Janine's property management business, Butcher's Joints. However, White went on to say, [...] "something tells us Kat would find it very difficult to live with herself if she was sleeping with a man whose baby is in a bad way. It seems too cruel for a mother who went though the agony of thinking she'd lost her child, so we're not sure at could cause another mum that degree of heartache. Then again, that other woman is Kat's loathed enemy, Janine." [...] Shepherd said that Kat and Michael had [...] "nice chemistry" [...] and opined that Michael [...] "would have been very keen" [...] on a relationship with Kat, that [...] "the opportunity for Michael and Kat to team up has always been there, from the moment he arrived" [...] and that the writers are placed [...] "lots of little hints to insinuate that it could be Michael".
