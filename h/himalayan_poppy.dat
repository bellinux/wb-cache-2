50|$|Meconopsis manasluensis is a red-flowered <b>Himalayan</b> <b>poppy</b> {{belonging}} to Meconopsis subg. Discogyne, which forms a natural grouping of 6 or 7 species within the genus all characterised by a stylar disc surmounting the ovary (lacking in other Meconopsis). As {{reflected by the}} species etymology, M. manasluensis is endemic to {{the vicinity of the}} Manaslu Himal of Gorkha district, central Nepal, where it grows at high elevation (ca. 4000 m) and so far remains known only from its type collection locality.|$|E
50|$|Meconopsis autumnalis, the Nepalese Autumn Poppy, is a yellow-flowered <b>Himalayan</b> <b>poppy</b> {{belonging}} to series Robustae, and is endemic to the Ganesh Himal range of central Nepal, {{where it was}} discovered in 2008 on a research expedition from the University of Aberdeen. In addition to several morphological features, the species is characterised by its late flowering period (as reflected in the specific etymology), which has more than likely resulted in a barrier to gene flow and subsequent evolutionary divergence from the closely related and sympatric species Meconopsis paniculata.|$|E
50|$|The valley {{has three}} sub-alpine between 3,200m and 3,500m {{which is the}} limit for trees, lower alpine between 3,500m and 3,700m, and higher alpine above 3,700m. The {{habitats}} include valley bottom, river bed, small forests, meadows, eroded, scrubby and stable slopes, moraine, plateau, bogs, stone desert and caves. The lower surrounding hills in the buffer zone are thickly forested. The Forest Research Institute in 1992 recorded 600 species of angiosperms and 30 pteridophytes in the valley and surroundings, discovering 58 new records for the valley of which 4 were new for Himalayan state. Of these plants, 5 out of 6 species globally threatened are not found in Nanda Devi National Park or elsewhere in Uttarakhand: Aconitum falconeri, A. balfouri, Himalayan maple (Acer caesium), the blue <b>Himalayan</b> <b>poppy</b> (Meconopsis aculeata) and Saussurea atkinsoni. Kala classified 31 species of rare and endangered categories within the national park in 1998. Further his studies report that the dominant family in Valley of Flowers is Asteraceae with 62 species. 45 medicinal plants are used by local villagers and several species, such as Saussurea obvallata (brahmakamal) are collected as religious offerings to goddesses Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi. The site is designated a Centre of Plant Diversity.|$|E

50|$|In {{the meadows}} and valleys around Tosh are <b>Himalayan</b> blue <b>poppies,</b> irises, marsh marigolds, primulas, buttercups, and Himalayan balsam flowers. Birds {{in the area}} include lamagiers, bull finches, rose finches, Himalayan griffons, white-capped water starts, and brown dippers. Himalayan brown and black bears are {{occasionally}} seen.|$|R
50|$|The {{family is}} well known for its {{striking}} flowers, with many species grown as ornamental plants, including California poppy (Eschscholtzia californica, the California state flower), the stunning blue <b>Himalayan</b> <b>poppies</b> (Meconopsis), several species of Papaver, and the wildflower bloodroot. Only two species are of economic importance for the production of opium and its derivatives for pharmaceutical use: Papaver somniferum is cultivated legally in order to obtain morphine and other opiates, and Papaver bracteatum, for thebaine. Papaver somniferum is also the source of the poppy seeds used in cooking and baking, and poppy seed oil. The illegal cultivation of poppies in Asia for the production of opium and heroin is virtually equal to the legal production {{in the rest of the}} world. Some Funarioideae have a limited use in gardening, with Lamprocapnos spectabilis ("bleeding heart"), and Pseudofumaria lutea ("yellow corydalis") commonly used. Chinese traditional medicine used the boiled and dried tubers of Corydalis yanhusuo ("yanhusuo").|$|R
25|$|The {{national}} {{flower of}} Bhutan is the <b>Himalayan</b> blue <b>poppy</b> (Meconopsis grandis). In Bhutan, it grows to {{a height of}} 1 meter on the rocky mountain terrain, above the tree line at altitudes of 3500m to 4500m. Bhutanese tradition links this flower with the yeti of lore. The flower was discovered in 1933 by British botanist George Sherriff in remote part of Sakteng in eastern Bhutan.|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} Reford Gardens (Jardins de Métis) {{are located}} nearby. These gardens, now maintained by Les Amis des Jardins de Métis, {{are the result}} of Elsie Reford's extraordinary passion for horticulture. An International Garden Festival is held here each summer. The garden's symbol, the <b>Himalayan</b> Blue <b>Poppy</b> (Meconopsis betonicifolia), can be found growing there in summer. The gardens were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.|$|R

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} and phylogeny of Asian Meconopsis (<b>Himalayan</b> blue <b>poppy)</b> {{remain largely}} unresolved. We used the {{internal transcribed spacer}} (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) trnL-F region for phylogenetic reconstruction of Meconopsis and its close relatives Papaver, Roemeria, and Stylomecon. We identified five main clades, which were well-supported in the gene trees reconstructed with the nrDNA ITS and cpDNA trnL-F sequences. We found that 41 species of Asian Meconopsis did not constitute a monophyletic clade, but formed two solid clades (I and V) separated in the phylogenetic tree by three clades (II, III and IV) of Papaver and its allies. Clade V includes only four Asian Meconopsis species, with the remaining 90 percent of Asian species included in clade I. In this core Asian Meconopsis clade, five subclades (Ia-Ie) were recognized in the nrDNA ITS tree. Three species (Meconopsis discigera, M. pinnatifolia, and M. torquata) of subgenus Discogyne were imbedded in subclade Ia, indicating that the present definition of subgenera in Meconopsis should be rejected. These subclades are inconsistent with any series or sections of the present classifications, suggesting that classifications of the genus should be completely revised. Finally, proposals for further revision of the genus Meconopsis were put forward based on molecular, morphological, and biogeographical evidences...|$|R
5000|$|Together with Eck, Winterrowd {{learned as}} much as they could about {{gardening}} and earned a living by teaching English, French and Latin at area elementary and high schools. They spent the 1960s and 1970s as part of the homegrown food movement. During the 1980s, Winterrowd wrote lengthy articles for Horticulture, reaching to as many as 3,000 words, in which he intertwined his experiences in gardening with Classic literature and Southern folklore. Moving from a farmhouse in Pepperell, Massachusetts to Readsboro, Vermont, Winterrowd and Eck devoted themselves to create a garden called North Hill, in which they grew <b>Himalayan</b> blue <b>poppies,</b> Japanese dogwoods, locust trees, magnolia, and stewartias. They cleared the hilly wooded land they had acquired, planting a diverse variety of plants, including as many as 100,000 daffodil bulbs. The garden drew visitors from around the world to their home in Southern Vermont near the Massachusetts border. They also grew fresh vegetables and raised dairy cows, pigs and poultry. Roger Swain, host of the Public Broadcasting Service television series The Victory Garden said [...] "Their garden is of such quality and diversity that it rivals any in Europe. But there is nothing derivative about North Hill; it is American gardening at its best", with Fergus Garrett crediting Winterrowd and Eck with being [...] "one of the driving forces in North American horticulture".|$|R
