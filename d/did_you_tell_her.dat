60|$|Trinc. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so?--ha! he's a rogue, do {{not believe}} him, chuck.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Where {{does she}} live?' cried Nicholas. 'What have you learnt of her history? Has she a father--mother--any brothers--sisters? What did she say? How came {{you to see}} her? Was she not very much surprised? Did you say how passionately I have longed to speak to her? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> where I had seen her? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how, and when, and where, and how long, and how often, I have thought of that sweet face which came upon me in my bitterest {{distress}} like a glimpse of some better world--did you, Newman--did you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> then, you eternal babbler?" [...] {{said his}} master, {{impatient}} of his prate, yet {{curious to know}} what it was all to end in.|$|E
6000|$|But {{his wife}} stared and said: 'Oh, master, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{to make the}} gazelle gruel out of red millet, which a horse would not eat? Eh, master, that is not well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hawtrey's lip curled. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "if she'll excuse me, I don't think I <b>do.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> {{have been}} successful, she'll {{probably}} be quite content." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A mother's {{ears are}} very sharp. I {{know that it}} is so. I cannot explain to <b>you</b> how. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that I think of getting up to London to-morrow, and see how she will take it. And, Staveley, do not for a moment suppose that I am {{reproaching}} her. She is quite right. I believe that I have in no way committed myself--that I have said no word to your sister with which Lady Staveley has a right to feel herself aggrieved; but if she has had the wit to read the thoughts of my bosom, she is quite right to wish that I were out of the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her?</b> She {{could not}} but have spoken her {{mind when you}} told her. There must have been much between you when this was talked of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, yet. If I said {{anything}} now, I {{should tell you}} what Mr. Westover did: {{go back to that}} girl, if she'll let you. You're fit for each other, as he said. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that you were engaged to some one else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! my dear Mr. Kendal, {{and what}} does poor Maria say? It is so kind in you. I hope you have taken her in hand, and told her it is quite another thing now, and her poor dear papa would think so. She must not let this {{opportunity}} pass, for she may never have another. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lanfear, {{sitting by}} the bed, {{in the light of}} the wasting candle, which threw a {{grotesque}} shadow of him on the wall, shook his head. After a moment he asked: [...] "How long <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>her</b> swoon had lasted after the accident to her mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|KEARNEY (jumping up and {{exploding}} in storm piercing tones). Bring in the prisoners. Tell the lady {{those are my}} orders. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear? <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> so. (The bluejacket goes out dubiously. The officers {{look at one another}} in mute comment on the unaccountable pepperiness of their commander.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would wish}} {{her to come}} back to the home that she has left, and, if there be any law in the land, she shall be made to <b>do</b> so. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that I say so." [...] Then Mr. Kennedy fought his way down the stairs, and Phineas Finn {{followed}} in his wake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{read that}} story in the newspaper. Then {{she wanted me to}} go out for a walk, and said I'd better ask Mr. Dean to come over this afternoon. I couldn't help knowing it was about you; but didn't say {{anything}} to her because Mrs. Dean thinks she oughtn't to be excited. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> why you and Snippey ran away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Philammon {{was about}} to lift her up, when Miriam caught him by the arm, and in a hurried whisper--'Are you mad? Will you ruin your own purpose? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> this? Why did you not wait--give her hope--time to collect herself--time to wean herself from her lover, instead of terrifying and disgusting her at the outset, as you have done? Have you a man's heart in you? No word of comfort for that poor creature, nothing but hell, hell, hell--See to your own chance of hell first! It is greater than you fancy!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay,' replied Carker. 'But why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her?</b> You see,' he {{continued}} with a smile, and softly laying his velvet hand, {{as a cat}} might have laid its sheathed claws, on Mr Dombey's arm; 'if I perfectly understand what is in your mind, I am so {{much more likely to}} be useful, and to have the happiness of being effectually employed. I think I do understand. I have not the honour of Mrs Dombey's good opinion. In my position, I have no reason to expect it; but I take the fact to be, that I have not got it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only!" [...] {{repeated}} the choking captain. [...] "Only! Only told Rosa! Where was the town-crier? What {{in the name}} of common-sense <b>did</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Clarke, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not seem}} {{impressed}} with your importance," [...] said Colonel Zane. [...] "My sister said <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what part <b>you</b> took in Isaac's rescue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think I'd <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> {{and have}} her buy them up as she has my other relations? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> suppose I don't know that I've been bought up like a nigger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But they can't help minding it. And I don't think it's {{any help}} that it's your habit. What {{would you think}} of a person who went about {{sticking}} pins and needles into people and saying, 'Excuse me, you mustn't mind it [...] . it's just a habit I've got.' You'd think he was crazy, wouldn't you? And as for Mrs. Lynde being a busybody, perhaps she is. But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor, and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife he'd bought it from her? Mrs. Cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and Mrs. Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I {{may know}} her some day. You {{are so much}} there now, uncle; I wonder whether you ever mention me to them. If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> from me how much I grieve for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{used to be}} pretty, but I can't say I think she's {{anything}} remarkable to-day. Anyhow, if she attracts attention {{she ought}} to be all the more careful what she <b>does.</b> <b>You</b> had better <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there was}} a time when you were rather hard pressed for a {{thousand}} pounds. Carrie, if I remember, found you a much larger sum. But she evidently <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> where <b>her</b> jewels went." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} have {{everything}} comfortable for her, and she knows it herself. Let her think about all that,--and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> go and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> again in a month's time. She'll {{be more willing to}} settle matters then than she is now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm not {{jealous of}} you,' replied the mistress; 'I'm jealous for you. Clear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you shall marry her. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> like <b>her?</b> <b>Tell</b> the truth, Heathcliff! There, you won't answer. I'm certain you don't.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Peck {{spoke as}} from the {{commanding}} centre of these. [...] "She used to be pretty, but I can't say I think she's anything remarkable today. Anyhow, if she attracts attention {{she ought to be}} all the more careful what she <b>does.</b> <b>You</b> had better <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's hard,' said Charles, 'that {{having made}} the world dance {{attendance}} on me for my pleasure, I must now do it for theirs. But what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think about <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> of this letter, or showing it, remembering that not a word about her troubles has passed between us?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “She will be wasted,” said Mills sadly. “She {{is a most}} unfortunate creature. Not even poverty {{could save}} her now. She cannot {{go back to her}} goats. Yet who can tell? She may find {{something}} in life. She may! It won’t be love. She has sacrificed that chance to the integrity of your life—heroically. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> remember <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> once that <b>you</b> meant to live your life integrally—oh, you lawless young pedant! Well, she is gone; but you may be sure that whatever she finds now in life it will not be peace. You understand me? Not even in a convent.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Lady Bothwell," [...] he said, {{taking her}} {{reluctant}} hand, [...] "we are both wrong. You are too deeply serious; I, perhaps, too little so. The dispute I had with Major Falconer {{was of no}} earthly consequence. Had anything occurred betwixt us that {{ought to have been}} settled PAR VOIE DU FAIT, as we say in France, neither of us are persons that are likely to postpone such a meeting. Permit me to say, that were it generally known that you or my Lady Forester are apprehensive of such a catastrophe, it might be the very means of bringing about what would not otherwise be likely to happen. I know your good sense, Lady Bothwell, and that you will understand me when I say that really my affairs require my absence for some months. This Jemima cannot understand. It is a perpetual recurrence of questions, why can <b>you</b> not <b>do</b> this, or that, or the third thing? and, when you have proved to her that her expedients are totally ineffectual, you have just to begin the whole round again. Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> dear Lady Bothwell, that YOU are satisfied. She is, you must confess, one of those persons with whom authority goes farther than reasoning. Do but repose a little confidence in me, and you shall see how amply I will repay it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, Sammy! Quite right!" [...] Peter exclaimed. [...] "I wouldn't {{have thought}} of that. My, won't she be happy when <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her!</b> I wonder what she'll say and what she'll do. I'm going to stay right here so as to see her when she hears the good news. Here comes your cousin, Blacky the Crow. Does he know yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find her}} gone back, back, back!" [...] he growled, getting {{louder and louder}} at each {{repetition}} of the word. [...] "When I sent her here, I said--'Keep her comfortable-easy.' You have not kept her comfortable-easy. Something has turned her poor little mind topsy-turvies. What is it? Who is it?" [...] He looked fiercely backwards and forwards between Oscar and my aunt--then turned my way, and putting his heavy hands on my shoulders, {{looked down at me}} with an odd angry kind of pity in his face. [...] "My childs is melancholick; my childs is ill," [...] he went on. [...] "Where is our goot-dear Pratolungo? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me about <b>her,</b> my little-lofe, when I last saw you? You said she had gone aways to see her Papa. Send a telegrams--and say I want Pratolungo here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not think}} ill of {{me if you}} can help it, because you are almost the only friend that I can trust. I almost trust dear old Cass, but not quite. She is old-fashioned and I shock her. As for other women, there isn't one {{anywhere}} to whom I would say a word. Only think how a girl such as I am is placed; or indeed any girl. You, if you see a woman that you fancy, can pursue her, can win her and triumph, or lose her and gnaw your heart;--at any rate <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> something. <b>You</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> love her; can <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so again and again even though she should scorn you. You can set yourself about the business you have taken in hand and can work hard at it. What can a girl do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now look here, Miss Miriam," [...] said Mike, {{speaking}} more earnestly, [...] "don't <b>you</b> go an' <b>do</b> that. If <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that, she'll go an' make me {{the biggest}} corn-pone anybody ever seed, an' she'll put pizen into it. Oh, it'd never do to say anythin' {{like that to}} Molly Tooney, if she's got me to feed. Jes' let me <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Miss Miriam, don't you say nothin' to Molly Tooney 'bout me. I never could sleep at night if I thought she was stirrin' up pizen in my vittles. But I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Miss Miriam, if you was to say Molly, that you an' Mr. Haverley liked corn-cakes an' was always used to 'em before you come here, an' that they 'greed with you, then in course she'd make 'em, an' there'd be a lot left over for me, for I don't 'spect you all could eat the corn-bread she'd make, but I'd eat it, bein' so powerful hungry for corn-meal." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{there is}} another way of [...] "verifying my theory," [...] as it is called; in plain English, seeing if my guess holds good; that is, to look at other valleys--not merely the valleys round here, but valleys in clay, in chalk, in limestone, in the hard slate rock such as you saw in Devonshire--and see whether my guess does not hold good about them too; whether all of them, deep or shallow, broad or narrow, rock or earth, may not have been all {{hollowed}} out by running water. I am sure if <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> this <b>you</b> would find something to amuse you, and something to instruct you, whenever you wish. I know that I do. To me the longest railroad journey, instead of being stupid, is like continually turning over the leaves of a wonderful book, or looking at wonderful pictures of old worlds which were made and unmade thousands of years ago. For I keep looking, not only at the railway cuttings, where the bones of the old worlds are laid bare, but at the surface of the ground; at the plains and downs, banks and knolls, hills and mountains; and continually asking Mrs. How what gave them each its shape: and I will soon teach <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> the same. When <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> fairly <b>her</b> answer will be in almost every case, [...] "Running water." [...] Either water running when soft, as it usually is; or water running when it is hard--in plain words, moving ice.|$|R
5000|$|After this, Laura {{goes back}} downstairs where she finds Nestor. He is also {{restrained}} {{in the same}} manner her father was and lying on the ground seriously injured. She bends over and they kiss each other. Then, they have a brief conversation: Nestor tells Laura that he loves her and confesses he only called her father for help in order to see her. Laura mentions that she found his pictures and asks him: [...] "Do <b>you</b> miss <b>her?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something? She is here now". In a mirror, the little girl in the white dress is visible again for a mere second and appears to be in the room. During the conversation, Laura becomes more and more aggressive and finally shouts at Nestor. Eventually, she says, [...] "You two killed my baby. You're going to die in the manner that my father did." [...] As it comes to an end, Laura drags Nestor to the living room and sits him in the chair once she's removed her father's corpse from it. After putting the mysterious puppet on him, she kills him using her reap hook. The ending credits begin to play showing photos of the past with Laura, Nestor and her father. The film continues showing Laura burning the pictures and walking through the forest and suddenly meeting up with a small child named Sophie. Sophie is the daughter that she had with Nestor, and they walked together through the forest hand and hand promising {{to start a new life}} together. The camera zooms in at Laura and then zooms out showing that Laura is only holding Sophie's doll, applying that Laura has lost all touch to reality and disappears into the distance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind; <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> She won't bite <b>you.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> {{also that}} I shall be over at Granpere soon {{to see her}} {{and the rest of}} them. I'll be over--as soon as ever I can get away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you in brown!" [...] she said, indignantly {{turning to}} Mr. Lorry; [...] "couldn't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what <b>you</b> had to <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> without {{frightening}} her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> call {{that being a}} Banker?" ...|$|R
