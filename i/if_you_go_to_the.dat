500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E
