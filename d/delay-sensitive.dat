Furthermore, NGMN envisages <b>delay-sensitive</b> video applications, high speed entertainment applications in vehicles, and “mobility on demand” services for connected objects. There will also be new services enabled in the health and safety area with extreme requirements in terms of system reliability. In addition, future services will be delivered across a fully heterogeneous environment and a wide range of devices such as smartphones, wearables, and Machine Type Communication.Which demands must networks of the future fulfil to manage the tremendous growth in connectivity and traffic density?The 5G use cases demand very diverse and sometimes extreme requirements. In the NGMN White Paper, requirements have been defined in six distinct areas: User experience, system performance, devices, enhanced services, business models, network deployment & operation. It is anticipated that a single solution to satisfy all the extreme requirements at the same time may lead to over-specification and high cost. Nevertheless, several use cases are anticipated to be active concurrently in the same operator network, thus requiring a high degree of flexibility and scalability of 5G networks. NGMN envisions an architecture that leverages the structural separation of hardware and software, as well as the programmability offered by SDN and NFV. As such, the 5G architecture will be a native SDN/ NFV architecture covering aspects ranging from devices, (mobile/ fixed) infrastructure, network functions, value enabling capabilities and all the management functions to orchestrate the 5G system.

In diagnosing delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), delayed arrival of contrast due to vasospasm may also overestimate the extent of ischemia. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of tracer <b>delay-sensitive</b> and tracer delay-insensitive algorithms for detecting DCI. Methods: From a prospectively collected series of aSAH patients admitted between 2007 – 2011, we included patients with any clinical deterioration other than rebleeding within 21  days after SAH who underwent NCCT/CTP/CTA imaging. Causes of clinical deterioration were categorized into DCI and no DCI. CTP maps were calculated with tracer <b>delay-sensitive</b> and tracer delay-insensitive algorithms and were visually assessed for the presence of perfusion deficits by two independent observers with different levels of experience. The diagnostic value of both algorithms was calculated for both observers. Results: Seventy-one patients were included. For the experienced observer, the positive predictive values (PPVs) were 0. 67 for the <b>delay-sensitive</b> and 0. 66 for the delay-insensitive algorithm, and the negative predictive values (NPVs) were 0. 73 and 0. 74. For the less experienced observer, PPVs were 0. 60 for both algorithms, and NPVs were 0. 66 for the <b>delay-sensitive</b> and 0. 63 for the delay-insensitive algorithm.

When the traffic load reaches the network capacity, the increase in average packet’s latency of the <b>delay-sensitive</b> traffic decreases the maximum limit of the output fuzzy set for the best-effort flows as shown in Figure 7.

When the output fuzzy set of these controllers are same, then the increase in latency of the <b>delay-sensitive</b> flows causes a reduction in the output fuzzy set of the best-effort traffic as shown in Figure 7. When the network becomes heavily congested, then delay bound violations occur for the <b>delay-sensitive</b> flows. The delay bound violation further reduces the output fuzzy set of the best-effort traffic as shown in Figure 7. Thus, decreasing the resource allocation probability of the best-effort traffic.|$|E

A {{reservation}} scheme, named dynamic hybrid partitioning, {{is proposed}} for the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol of wireless ATM (WATM) networks operating in Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode. The goal {{is to improve the}} performance of the real-time Variable Bit Rate (VBR) voice traffic in networks with mixed voice/data traffic. In most proposed MAC protocols for WATM networks, the reservation phase treats all traffic equally, whether <b>delay-sensitive</b> or not. Hence, <b>delay-sensitive</b> VBR traffic sources have to compete for reservation each time they wake up from idle mode. This causes large and variable channel access delays, and increases the delay and delay variation (jitter) experienced by ATM cells of VBR traffic. In the proposed scheme, the reservation phase of the MAC protocol is dynamically divided into a contention-free partition for <b>delay-sensitive</b> idle VBR traffic, and a contention partition for other traffic.
