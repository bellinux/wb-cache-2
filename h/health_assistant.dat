40|$|Introduction <b>Health</b> <b>assistants</b> are {{important}} functionaries {{of the primary}} {{health care system in}} India. Their role is supervision of field-based services among other things. A quality assurance mechanism for these <b>health</b> <b>assistants</b> is lacking. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of developing a tool to assess the quality of <b>health</b> <b>assistants</b> in primary <b>health</b> centres (PHCs) and to assess their quality using this tool. Methodology <b>Health</b> <b>assistants</b> from three PHCs in the Wardha district of India were observed for a year using a tool developed from primary health care management Aavancement program modules. Data was collected by direct observation, interview, and review of records for quality of activities. Results Staff strength of <b>health</b> <b>assistants</b> was 87. 5 %. None of the <b>health</b> <b>assistants</b> were clear about their job descriptions. A supervisory schedule for providing supportive supervision to auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) was absent; most field activities pertaining to maternal and child health received poor focus. Monthly meetings lacked a clear agenda, and comments on quality improvement of services provided by the ANMs were missing. Conclusion Continuous training with sensitization on quality issues is required to improve the unsatisfactory quality...|$|R

40|$|Background While {{previous}} {{research has suggested that}} <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> supporting palliative care work in the community regard the provision of emotional labour as a key aspect of their role, little research has explored the experiences of family carers who are the recipients of such support. Objective To explore the emotional labour undertaken by <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> working in community palliative care from the perspectives of both <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> and bereaved family carers. Design We conducted a qualitative interview study in 2011 – 2012 with bereaved family carers of cancer patients who had received the services of <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> in the community, and <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> who provided community palliative care services. Transcripts were coded and analysed for emergent themes using a constant comparative technique. Settings Three different research sites in the United Kingdom, all providing community palliative care. Participants and methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 bereaved family carers and eight <b>health</b> care <b>assistants.</b> Results <b>Health</b> care <b>assistants</b> view one of their key roles as providing emotional support to patients and their family carers, and family carers recognise and value this emotional support. Emotional support by <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> was demonstrated in three main ways: the relationships which <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> developed and maintained on the professional–personal boundary; the ability of <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> to negotiate clinical/domestic boundaries in the home; the ways in which <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> and family carers worked together to enable the patient to die at home. Conclusion Through their emotional labour, <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> perform an important role in community palliative care which is greatly valued by family carers. While recent reports have highlighted potential dangers in the ambiguity of their role, any attempts to clarify the ‘boundaries’ of the <b>health</b> care <b>assistant</b> role should acknowledge the advantages <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> can bring in bridging potential gaps between healthcare professionals and family carers...|$|R

40|$|Aim(s) : This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the work of non-registered nurses (<b>health</b> care <b>assistants)</b> in a UK hospital setting. Background: There are increasing numbers of <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> employed by the National Health Service in the UK to support registered nurses providing nursing care. However, {{little is known about}} the make-up of the <b>health</b> care <b>assistant</b> workforce and the changing nature of their role. This study addresses some of these gaps in the research-based literature. Methods: A single case study design using mixed methods (survey, interviews, participant observations, focus groups and documents) was used to generate an in-depth account of health care assistants' work in one organization. The study is built upon what <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> say they do, compared with what they actually do in practice. It explores how and whether the work of <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> is adequately supervised, tensions between the work of <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> and registered nurses and the subsequent effects on teamwork and patient care. Findings: There are policy expectations associated with the work of <b>health</b> care <b>assistants.</b> However, this study reveals significant deviations from these goals. The workplace arena and the negotiations between <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> and registered nurses that take place within it, actively shape the health care assistants' work. Findings suggest dynamic patterns of use, misuse and non-use of the <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> as a resource to patient care. Discussion and implications for practice: The changing roles of registered nurses have direct implications for the roles of health care assistants: as registered nurses take on extra duties and responsibilities they are conceding some of their role to <b>health</b> care <b>assistants.</b> This has implications for nurse managers. The competence of <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> to carry out nursing work needs to be reassessed and there also needs to be ongoing monitoring and supervision of their work to maximize, and further develop, their contribution to patient care and to ensure quality standards. Managers also need to be aware of the importance of workplace negotiations in the interpretation of formal policies and the subsequent shaping of health care assistants' work at the level of service delivery. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{healthcare}} redesign {{has been}} directed at providing more equitable, accessible, efficient and effective patient care. To support these aims, allied <b>health</b> <b>assistants</b> have increasingly been introduced into models of care. Concomitant {{with the increase of}} assistants in the workplace has been the introduction of national vocational training programs for allied <b>health</b> <b>assistants</b> in Australia. This review aimed to summarise the Australian and international evidence regarding effective and appropriate strategies for the clinical education and training of allied <b>health</b> <b>assistants.</b> A systematic search of relevant databases was undertaken during April–May 2011. No time limit was imposed, and only English-language papers were considered. Grey literature was searched, and a hand search of relevant journals was conducted. Full-text articles were screened by two reviewers for inclusion in the systematic review. Quantitative and qualitative studies were included. The literature addressing the review questions was scarce and generally of low methodological quality. The results suggest that to incorporate assistants in models of care, strategies such as collaborative education need to be implemented, and these should cover topics such as supervision, delegation and role delineation. In addition, {{there is a need to}} promote standardisation of vocational courses. These courses should be relevant for assistants, devote significant time to practical activities and include processes for recognition of prior learning and competencies. The findings of this review may inform policy and practice within Australia related to educating and building an effective allied health workforce that includes allied <b>health</b> <b>assistants</b> as an integral part of the healthcare team.

Aim: To explore newly qualified nurses' experiences of delegating to, and supervising, <b>health</b> care <b>assistants.</b> Design: Ethnographic case studies.

Participants: 33 newly qualified nurses were observed, 10 <b>health</b> care <b>assistants</b> and 12 ward managers. Methods: Participant observation and in-depth interviews.
