40|$|Abstract- A {{low cost}} {{photovoltaic}} powered forced convection solar dryer {{was developed and}} evaluated for drying of Chilli in the conditions of NEH region of India. The PV powered forced convection solar dryer consists of solar PV module of area (280 × 230) mm 2 connected with drying chamber. The solar panel is tilted to an angle of 45 ° with respect to horizontal. It {{was connected to the}} exhaust fan provided at the opposite wall of the dryer with the help of electric wire. The drying chamber was made up of M. S. angle, G. I. sheet and glazing material with the frame size of (700 × 700) mm 2, opposite wall size of (700 × 700) mm 2 and front side size of (890 × 700) mm 2 with the inclination of 45 °. The two drying trays were contained inside the drying chamber which is made up of aluminium angle, aluminium strip and steel wire mess. The lower and upper tray was fitted at the height of 150 mm and 350 mm {{from the base of the}} dryer. The size of lower and upper tray was (680 × 490) mm 2 and (680 × 270) mm 2. Air inlet is provided in the one fourth area of the base with the diameter of 600 mm. The drying chamber is insulated with thermocole of 10 mm thickness. At the one side of the dryer an <b>insulated</b> <b>door</b> is provided to facilitate the loading and unloading of the trays. The dryer was capable of holding about 6 kg of chillies per batch. Average air temperature attained in the solar dryer was about 40 o C higher than the ambient temperature. Drying of chilli in a PV powered forced convection solar dryer reduces the moisture content from around 80. 2 % (wet basis) to the final moisture content about 10. 00 % in 32 h.

40|$|A {{low-cost}} {{solar cooker}} built largely {{of mud and}} straw (adobe) has been successfully tested in Tanzania. Costing about US$ 12, which is one-fifth the cost of other solar cookers, it {{is considered to be}} the first truly affordable, yet robust family-sized cooker. The cooker is built on-site with a minimum of tools, skills or special materials. It is of the 'box-cooker' type and uses the 'greenhouse effect' to trap solar energy inside a glazed, insulated box. It consists of a shallow one metre-square hole in the ground, insulated with straw or dried grass, lined with adobe and covered by glass or clear plastic. Above the cooker is placed a one metre-square aluminized plastic reflector with guy ropes for support and adjustment. Access to the oven is through an <b>insulated</b> <b>door</b> made of layers of corrugated card stuck together with glue and sewn inside a piece of woollen blanket. On the oven bottom there is a black-painted steel or aluminium base plate which rests on a 5 cm thick adobe slab. The cooker has been tested in two rural regions of Tanzania where fuelwood is in short supply and has proved able to cook staple dishes such as rice, beans and ugali. On clear days the cooker is able to bring a four-litre pot (25 cm diameter by 15 cm high) of water up to cooking temperature (80 °C) in 7080 minutes. The cooker is able to provide cooked food for up to 12 people at around midday and dusk and food left inside keeps hot well after dark. Solar cooking techniques are different from traditional cooking methods: for instance, in conventional cooking ugali has to be stirred regularly but this is not necessary with the solar cooker. Training is needed before the solar cooker can be used satisfactorily and a simple solar cookbook is now being written with the help of villagers.

The body is also constructed using ultra-high strength steel that will be integrated using a new hot stamping process that reduces weight. Toyota also updated the suspensions, rear differentials and rear axle to improve the truck's road manners while still keeping it off-road capable. The truck is available in 6 distinct trims, these are the base SR, mid-level SR5, TRD Off Road, TRD Sport, Limited, and range topping TRD Pro. The truck is offered in Access Cab and Double Cab configurations with the long or short bed sizes. The Regular Cab model was not carried over for the new generation pickup. The interior of the pickup gets a complete overhaul as well. Using a handle-bar theme, Toyota made the interior of the Tacoma more luxurious and added a larger touchscreen display as well as an all new instrument panel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the availability and problems of floor heating and cooling systems. We measured thermal performance of an experimental house with floor heating and cooling systems and carried out some simulations to clarify the effects of various factors on thermal environment and energy consumption. As a result of the experiments, we note that the air temperatures in the rooms with floor heating and coo 1 ing systems are stable all day through and are distributed uniformly throughout each room. When the slab surface temperature is lower than the indoor dew-point temperature in summer, condensation on the floor surface may occur. As a result of the simulations, we note that the ratio of PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) from - 0. 5 to + 0. 5 is mainly effected by building construction, heating or cooling operating time, type of 2 nd floor, and window specification. Particularly, an <b>insulated</b> sliding <b>door</b> is effective not only to the indoor environment but also for the supply/extract heat rate...|$|R

40|$|ASME-ZSITS International Thermal Science Seminar, Bled, Slovenia, 11 - 14 June 2000 To {{minimize}} yearly cooling {{loads of}} high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong, {{it is essential}} to take into account special space and time cooling pattern that exists in their apartments and then determine proper thickness, composition, and location of walls and doors in apartments. In these apartments, some rooms are cooled as dining rooms and bedrooms, and some are not cooled as bathrooms and kitchens. The dining rooms and bedrooms have different cooling schedule. Yearly cooling loads are determined by using the multi-zone HTB 2 software. In the apartments during these investigations, the basic design of some walls is modified with 5 cm of thermal insulation and/or 10 to 30 cm of concrete, and the basic design of some doors is modified with 5 cm of thermal insulation. These modified walls and doors are placed in eight different locations within the apartment envelope and partitions. Calculation results show that the yearly cooling load is minimized in several cases: 1. when thermally <b>insulated</b> walls and <b>doors</b> are located optimally, 2. when thermal insulation of walls is applied together with proper thickness of concrete, 3. when concrete is uniformly distributed within apartment walls.

40|$|The current {{environmental}} and energetic {{crisis and the}} resulting regulations led to a new interest in using sustainable materials for building applications. Wood can be a material with high sustainable rates because it is recyclable, reusable and naturally renewable. Moreover, its excellent strength-to-weight ratios, thermal insulating and acoustical properties make it useful for different kinds of applications in buildings, ranging from structural beams and frames, <b>insulating</b> envelopes, windows, <b>door</b> frames, to wall and flooring materials and furniture. Although wood is commonly classified as a sustainable material, its real sustainability depends on different issues: appropriate forest management, manufacturing methods and site assembly, distance required for transportation and use of glues. Wood has also good seismic performances due to its lightweight and even if timber elements {{are not able to}} have a ductile behavior, using steel connection allows to build dissipative structure, as well platform frame and X-LAM panels systems. Insulation properties are related to low thermal conductivity values. Furthermore, wooden elements can be used to minimize sound transmission and they can be employed as sustainable materials as several Life Cycle Assessment studies demonstrate. This review paper aims to analyze the structural, thermal, acoustical and environmental properties of wooden materials for building applications; other properties such as fire resistance and durability were also taken into account. The work is completed by several tables and graphs with wood properties and by an updated and thorough reference list...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures have}} become a top priority for large energy consuming companies because of the increasing energy prices and implemented energy policies. Many companies also receive demands from their customers to reduce their climate impact. Heat treatment processes are performed at high temperature, sometimes up to 1000 °C, and the holding time can be up to several hours. A {{large amount of energy}} is needed for these processes and this reflects in a large energy cost for these companies. The purpose of this project was to identify advantageous, both economically and environmentally, energy efficiency improvements in a specific steel heat treatment plant. The first part of the project was to perform an energy audit and map the energy consumption in the plant. When the distribution of the energy consumption had been determined, the largest energy consumers could be identified. The search for energy efficiency opportunities was then focused on the largest energy consumers in the plant. The profitability of the identified energy saving possibilities was evaluated as well as the environmental benefits of the suggestions. The energy audit showed that the major part of the energy was consumed in the process itself and that the largest energy consumer among the support processes is the ventilation system. The hardening and nitrokarburizing furnaces, or the main furnaces, are the largest energy consumers of the process equipment. It was found that 753 MWh/year (7. 7 %) of electricity can be saved by housekeeping measures. The suggested measures were to remove unnecessary lighting, turn off the manual equipment during weekends, plan the production more energy efficiently, search the compressed air system for leaks and close a damper in a preheating furnace. The proposed energy saving investment measures will all together save 418 MWh/year (4. 3 %) of electricity and remove the district heating demand. The suggested investments were to switch the lighting to low energy lamps, <b>insulate</b> the <b>door</b> hoods of the main furnaces, move the intake to the compressor outdoors, heat exchange exhaust furnace gases with washing water and heat exchange the waste heat from the compressor with the heating of the offices. All suggested investment were shown to be profitable, i. e. having a positive net present value. However, the payback periods for the heat exchanging between the compressor and the offices and the low energy lighting may be regarded to be too long as they were more than five years. If all housekeeping measures and all investment measures were implemented, the energy cost for the plant would decrease with almost 1 MSEK/year...|$|R

40|$|Two {{complete}} cradle to grave {{life cycle}} assessments are {{conducted for the}} comparison of a house built after today s building standard, TEK 07, and a passive house built after the Norwegian Standard NS 3700 : 2010. Both houses are projected by the building company Nordbohus AS, and are to be constructed in Stord, {{on the west coast}} of Norway. The usable floor area, BRA, is 187 m 2 for both houses, and a lifetime of 50 years is assumed. The houses are constructed with a wooden framework, insulated with mineral wool in the walls and roof, and have a ground lever floor of reinforced concrete on a layer of expanded polystyrene. The passive house has, compared to the TEK 07 house a different foundation, 15 cm more mineral wool in the outer walls, 5 cm more in the roof, and better <b>insulated</b> windows and <b>doors.</b> In addition, the thermal conductivity for the outer wall insulation is reduced for the passive house. The house life cycle is divided into several phases. Construction of the house, waste treatment of materials connected to the construction, surface finish and maintenance of the house during the lifetime, water and electrical energy consumption during the house operation and finally demolition and waste treatment of the materials {{after the end of the}} house lifetime. Transportation of workers and materials to the construction site, as well as to waste treatment plant, are included. Generic data from Ecoinvent 2. 0 database is used, but some processes are modified to satisfy Norwegian production information. The Nordel electricity mix is used for Norwegian production and house electricity consumption. SimaPro 7. 1. 8 is used to process the data, and the ReCiPe method, hierarchist midpoint version 1. 03 is used for the impact assessment. It is assumed that both houses have the same heating system, and cover 100 % of the energy needs from electrical energy. For the 50 year life cycle, the passive house has 20 % less impacts to climate change than the TEK 07 house. For the other categories assessed, the passive house has between 10 - 20 % lower impacts than the TEK 07 house. The only exception is impacts to freshwater ecotoxicity, where the passive house impacts are increased with 7 % from the TEK 07 house. The TEK 07 house has impacts to climate change with 1, 6 tons CO 2 eq/m 2 useful floor, while the passive house 1, 3 tons CO 2 eq/m 2 useful floor. Cumulative energy demand is 55 GJ/m 2 and 42 GJ/m 2 respectively. The construction phase is responsible for 13 %, waste treatment of materials connected to construction 1 %, surface finish and maintenance 6 % and end of life waste treatment 4 % of overall climate change impacts for the TEK 07 house. Water and electricity consumption during the operation are thus responsible of 76 % of the TEK 07 life cycle climate change impacts. For the passive house, this is 19 %, 1 %, 7 %, 6 % and 67 % respectively. Main activities contributing to the overall impacts are transportation of materials, workers and waste to and from the construction site, diesel combusted in building machines, production and incineration of EPS/XPS and paint, waste treatment of wood ash, and production of cement and ceramic tiles. A sensitivity analysis of energy consumed by the construction dryer, frequency of house maintenance, a change of house consumption electricity mix to the Norwegian and UCTE electricity mix, and a change to different heating systems for both houses is carried out. The overall conclusion is that it is environmentally beneficial to build, operate and waste treat a passive house compared to a house following the TEK 07 building standard...|$|R
