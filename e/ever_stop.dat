However, there are also problems where {{we do not want}} the system to <b>ever</b> <b>stop.</b> Examples of such problems include the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.|$|E

Such confidence comes from the wide common interest between the two countries, from the common aspiration of the Chinese and the US people and from historic and philosophic thoughts. The two sides should take the opportunity of this round of SED to carefully implement the important consensus reached between the two heads of state, comprehensively deepen cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, investment, finance and infrastructure and boost the strong, sustained and balanced growth of their own economy and the world economy at large.|$|E
500|$|You Do Your Thing, {{their fourth}} album, was issued in mid-2004. It was led off by [...] "If You <b>Ever</b> <b>Stop</b> Loving Me", which in mid-2004 became Montgomery Gentry's first number 1 single {{on the country}} charts. It was also their biggest hit on the Hot 100, {{reaching}} number 30 there. Following it, the album's title track went to number 22 on the country charts, while [...] "Gone" [...] peaked at number 3 and [...] "Something to Be Proud Of" [...] became their second number 1 single. The song spent two weeks at number 1, thus making it the first single for Columbia Records' Nashville division {{to spend more than}} one week at number 1 since [...] "Daddy's Money" [...] by Ricochet in 1996. [...] "Gone" [...] was also the most-played single by a country music duo in 2005, and it received a digital gold certification for 500,000 certified music downloads.

Steele also co-wrote [...] "Gone" [...] and [...] "Something to Be Proud Of" [...] with Bob DiPiero and Chris Wallin, respectively, while Rutherford and DiPiero co-wrote [...] "If You <b>Ever</b> <b>Stop</b> Loving Me" [...] with Tom Shapiro. In October 2005, You Do Your Thing became the duo's third platinum album. Rick Bell gave the album a favorable review on Country Standard Time, saying that the duo [...] "unleash [...] in a torrent of brash lyrics, wailing guitars, and pounding percussion." [...] Jurek wrote that it [...] "is easily the finest outing by modern country's most relevant duo; it rocks, it's soulful, and it's memorable." [...] Montgomery Gentry toured in late 2004 – early 2005 with Trace Adkins in support of the album.|$|E

At the time, she was {{deciding}} whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album. Lopez stated that {{when it comes time to}} make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that she is always working on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't <b>ever</b> <b>stop.</b> I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about. It wasn't something like, 'Oh, I'm going to sit down and make a record right now.'" [...] Among the songs she recorded, two were chosen to be included on Dance Again... The Hits: [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In".|$|E

Before their wedding, Kevin's mother, Suzanne, gives Kate a gold locket that had been passed down on the female side of the family at weddings. A while after the ceremony, Kate calls U.S. Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lane). She does not want to run any more and pleads for him to stop chasing her. Mars guesses that Kate has gotten {{involved}} with a man, and tells her that if Kate can really stay put, settle down, he will stop chasing her, but that they both know it is unlikely that Kate will <b>ever</b> <b>stop</b> running. Later, Kate shows signs of relief after getting a negative pregnancy test, and decides to reveal the truth about her life to her husband. She drugs Kevin, places her mother-in-law's locket in his hands and leaves.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this <b>ever</b> <b>stop?</b> And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
500|$|Hughes was {{scheduled}} to fight Georges St-Pierre in a rematch at UFC 63, but after St-Pierre sustained a severe groin injury, the UFC announced that B.J. Penn would replace him in the title fight. At this point in their careers, Penn was the only mixed martial artist to beat Hughes after March 2001. In fact, it was Hughes' only loss in his last 19 fights. In the bout, Penn controlled the first two rounds, but sustained a rib injury during the scramble to take Hughes' back in round two. He was visibly different in the third round, appearing exhausted and missing punches he was landing earlier. Hughes {{was able to take}} Penn to the mat, and in side-control crucifix position rained punches on Penn's head until referee [...] "Big" [...] John McCarthy stopped the fight at 3:53 of the third round. In the process, Hughes became the first man to <b>ever</b> <b>stop</b> Penn in a fight. Both fighters were awarded the Fight of the Night bonus. In an interview on Penn's personal website, Penn stated that by round three he could hardly breathe and had no [...] "mobility in his core". [...] Despite the injury, Penn congratulated Hughes, calling him a great fighter and saying he deserved the victory. [...] St-Pierre stepped into the ring to promote his upcoming title fight against Hughes, stating that he was glad that Hughes won his fight, but that he was [...] "not impressed" [...] by Hughes' performance. According to both commentator Joe Rogan and Hughes' own autobiography, Hughes was unhappy with St-Pierre's statement. Hughes said that they [...] "had words" [...] off-camera shortly thereafter. St-Pierre apologized, saying he had misunderstood something Hughes had said on the microphone and did not mean to offend him.|$|E

[...] Lovecraft wrote to Frank Belknap Long, [...] "he only objection to the phrase is that it's Gaelic instead of Cymric as the south-of-England locale demands. But as with anthropology—details don't count. Nobody will <b>ever</b> <b>stop</b> to note the difference." [...] Robert E.

[...] The Cymric-speaking area at that time covered not only Wales, but all of the island below Hadrian's Wall, with Gaelic only being spoken north of the Wall.|$|E
