40|$|Viruses enter host cells via several mechanisms, {{including}} endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis. They {{can also}} fuse at the plasma membrane and can spread within the host via cell-to-cell fusion or syncytia. The mechanism {{used by a}} given viral strain depends on its external topology and proteome {{and the type of}} cell being entered. This comparative review discusses the cellular attachment receptors and entry pathways of dsDNA viruses belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Baculoviridae, Herpesviridae and nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) belonging to the families Ascoviridae, Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and Poxviridae, and giant viruses belonging to the families Mimiviridae and Marseilleviridae as well as the proposed families Pandoraviridae and Pithoviridae. Although these viruses have several common features (e. g., topology, replication and protein sequence similarities) they utilize different entry pathways to infect wide-range of hosts, including humans, other mammals, invertebrates, fish, protozoa and algae.

Despite the promising results obtained with mesoangioblast transplantation in muscle dystrophy, an improvement of their efficient engrafting and survival within damaged muscles, {{as well as}} their ex vivo activation/expansion and commitment toward myogenic lineage, is highly needed and should greatly increase their therapeutic potential. We show that globular adiponectin, an adipokine endowed with metabolic and differentiating functions for muscles, regulates vital cues of mesoangioblast cell biology. The adipokine drives mesoangioblasts to <b>entry</b> <b>cell</b> cycle and strongly counteracts the apoptotic process triggered by growth factor withdrawal, thereby serving as an activating and prosurvival stem cell factor. In addition, adiponectin provides a specific protection against anoikis, the apoptotic death due to lack of anchorage to extracellular matrix, suggesting a key protective role for these nonresident stem cells after systemic injection. Finally, adiponectin behaves as a chemoattractive factor toward mature myotubes and stimulates their differentiation toward the skeletal muscle lineage, serving as a positive regulator in mesoangioblast homing to injured or diseased muscles. We conclude that adiponectin exerts several advantageous effects on mesoangioblasts, potentially valuable to improve their efficacy in cell base...|$|E

Here we {{demonstrate}} that cholesterol increases Ca 2 + entry via the TRPM 7 channel, which promoted proliferation of prostate cells by inducing the activation of the AKT and/or the ERK pathway. Additionally, cholesterol mediated Ca 2 + entry induced calpain activity that showed a decrease in E-cadherin expression, which together could lead to migration of prostate cancer cells. An overexpression of TRPM 7 significantly facilitated cholesterol dependent Ca 2 + <b>entry,</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and tumor growth. Whereas, TRPM 7 silencing or inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statin showed a significant decrease in cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM 7, cell proliferation, and migration of prostate cancer cells. Consistent with these results, statin intake was inversely correlated with prostate cancer patients and increase in TRPM 7 expression was observed in samples obtained from prostate cancer patients. Altogether, we provide evidence that cholesterol-mediated activation of TRPM 7 is important for prostate cancer and have identified that TRPM 7 could be essential for initiation and/or progression of prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Experiments in {{cell-free}} {{systems have}} demonstrated that the VP 5 * cleavage fragment of the rotavirus spike protein, VP 4, undergoes a foldback rearrangement that translocates three clustered hydrophobic loops {{from one end of}} the molecule to the other. This conformational change resembles the foldback rearrangements of enveloped virus fusion proteins. By recoating rotavirus subviral particles with recombinant VP 4 and VP 7, we tested the effects on cell entry of substituting hydrophilic for hydrophobic residues in the clustered VP 5 * loops. Several of these mutations decreased the infectivity of recoated particles without preventing either recoating or folding back. In particular, the V 391 D mutant had a diminished capacity to interact with liposomes when triggered to fold back by serial protease digestion in solution, and particles recoated with this mutant VP 4 were 10, 000 -fold less infectious than particles recoated with wild-type VP 4. Particles with V 391 D mutant VP 4 attached normally to cells and internalized efficiently, but they failed in the permeabilization step that allows coentry of the toxin -sarcin. These findings indicate that the hydrophobicity of the VP 5 * apex is required for membrane disruption during rotavirus cell <b>entry.</b> <b>Cell</b> entry by nonenveloped viruses requires disruption or perforation of a membrane and translocation of a modified virion or an infectious genome into the cytosol (30).

40|$|RAS {{proteins}} {{are small}} GTPases {{known for their}} involvement in oncogenesis: around 25 % of human tumors present mutations in {{a member of this}} family. RAS operates in a complex signaling network with multiple activators and effectors, which allows them to regulate many cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) {{is one of the main}} effector pathways of RAS, regulating cell growth, cell cycle <b>entry,</b> <b>cell</b> survival, cytoskeleton reorganization, and metabolism. However, it is the involvement of this pathway in human tumors that has attracted most attention. PI 3 K has proven to be necessary for RAS-induced transformation in vitro, and more importantly, mice with mutations in the PI 3 K catalytic subunit p 110 α that block its ability to interact with RAS are highly resistant to endogenous oncogenic KRAS-induced lung tumorigenesis and HRAS-induced skin carcinogenesis. These animals also have a delayed development of the lymphatic vasculature. Many PI 3 K inhibitors have been developed that are now in clinical trials. However, it is a complex pathway with many feedback loops, and interactions with other pathways make the results of its inhibition hard to predict. Combined therapy with another RAS-regulated pathway such as RAF/MEK/ ERK may be the most effective way to treat cancer, at least in animal models mimicking the human disease.

Loss of the lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) function leads to expansion of myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) that cause myeloproliferative neoplasm. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis identified detailed intrinsic defects in Ly 6 G(+) myeloid lineage cells of LAL knock-out (lal-/-) mice. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed {{activation of the}} mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which functions as a nutrient/energy/redox sensor, and controls cell growth, cell cycle <b>entry,</b> <b>cell</b> survival, and cell motility. Loss of the LAL function led to major alteration of large GTPase and small GTPase signal transduction pathways. lal-/- Ly 6 G(+) myeloid cells in the bone marrow showed substantial increase of cell proliferation in association with up-regulation of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) genes. The epigenetic microenvironment was significantly changed due to the increased expression of multiple histone cluster genes, centromere protein genes and chromosome modification genes. Gene expression of bioenergetic pathways, including glycolysis, aerobic glycolysis, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and respiratory chain proteins, was also increased, while the mitochondrial function was impaired in lal-/- Ly 6 G(+) myeloid cells. The concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly increased accompanied by up-regulation of nitric oxide/ROS production genes in these cells.

40|$|Use of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) in the {{immunotherapy}} {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has frequently resulted in the restoration of CD 4 lymphocyte counts but not of virus-specific responses. We reasoned {{that the absence of}} reconstituted functional immune parameters could be related to the inability of IL- 2 to correct HIV-induced dysfunctions in antigen-presenting cells. In this study, we used in vitro-differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and mature dendritic cells (MDDCs), acutely infected with primary HIV- 1 isolates, to analyse the effects of IL- 2 on virus replication, co-receptor expression, and cytokine or chemokine release. Stimulation of MDMs with IL- 2 had no measurable effect on HIV- 1 replication, on cytokine secretion, or on CD 4 and CXCR 4 gene expression. Moreover, although a significant down-regulation of CCR 5 mRNA expression could be repeatedly detected in MDMs, this IL- 2 -mediated effect was not of substantial magnitude to affect virus replication. On the other hand, IL- 2 stimulation of MDDCs dramatically increased HIV- 1 replication and this effect was highly evident on low-replicating, CXCR 4 -dependent isolates. Nevertheless, the HIV-enhancing activity of IL- 2 in MDDCs was not accompanied by any measurable change in cytokine or chemokine release, in virus receptor and co-receptor mRNA accumulation, or in the surface expression of a battery of receptors implicated in virus <b>entry,</b> <b>cell</b> activation or costimulatory function. Taken together, these findings point to a role for IL- 2 in inducing virus purging from dendritic cell reservoirs but indicate no relevant potential of the cytokine in restoring defective elements of innate immunity in HIV infection...|$|E

Prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin {{can reduce the}} severity of VZV if given shortly after exposure. Glycoprotein H (gH) is a highly conserved herpesvirus protein with functions in virus entry and cell-cell spread and is a target of neutralizing antibodies. The anti-gH monoclonal antibody (MAb) 206 neutralizes VZV in vitro. To determine the requirement for gH in VZV pathogenesis in vivo, MAb 206 was administered to SCID mice with human skin xenografts inoculated with VZV. Anti-gH antibody given at 6 h postinfection significantly reduced the frequency of skin xenograft infection by 42 %. Virus titers, genome copies, and lesion size were decreased in xenografts that became infected. In contrast, administering anti-gH antibody at 4 days postinfection suppressed VZV replication but did not reduce the frequency of infection. The neutralizing anti-gH MAb 206 blocked virus <b>entry,</b> <b>cell</b> fusion, or both in skin in vivo. In vitro, MAb 206 bound to plasma membranes and to surface virus particles. Antibody was internalized into vacuoles within infected cells, associated with intracellular virus particles, and colocalized with markers for early endosomes and multivesicular bodies but not the trans-Golgi network.

Three hepatoma cell lines with different p 53 statuses (HepG 2, Huh- 7 and Hep 3 B) and one non-tumorigenic immortalized liver cell line (MIHA) were used for an in vitro study. The in vivo effects of FTY 720 were evaluated in a nude mouse tumor model. Cell cycle distribution and cell cycle regulator proteins p 27 Kip 1 and cyclin D 1, together with the PI 3 -K/Akt pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases and cleaved caspase- 3 and caspase- 9, were evaluated. FTY 720 selectively induced cell apoptosis in hepatoma cell lines with overexpression of cleaved caspase- 3 and caspase- 9, but the same phenomena were not found in MIHA cells. FTY 720 induced Akt dephosphorylation at Ser 473 mediated by phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) inhibition. Dephosphorylation led to down-regulation of p 42 /p 44 and dephosphorylation of Forkhead transcription factor and GSK- 3 β and, subsequently, up-regulation of p 27 Kip 1 and down-regulation of cyclin D 1. In our in vivo model FTY 720 induced apoptosis of tumor cells by down-regulation of the Akt pathway. FTY 720 suppressed tumor growth without notable side-effects in normal liver.

We have shown that activation of the PI 3 K pathway leads to over-expression of enhancer of Zeste homolog (EZH 2) in UMUC 3 bladder cancer and UMUC 14 urothelial cancer cell lines. EZH 2 is the primary histone methyltransferase of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H 3 K 27) and has been implicated in increased invasiveness and increased mortality in breast and prostate cancers when over-expressed. In this study, the effect of EZH 2 knockdown on cell growth and proliferation has been assessed. Our results have shown that when EZH 2 expression is knocked down in UMUC 3 and UMUC 14 cell lines there is a significant decrease in cellular growth and proliferation when compared to cells treated with negative siRNA. As part of this study, the effect of EZH 2 knockdown on invasiveness and the methylation status of H 3 K 27 will also be examined. By understanding the effects of EZH 2 expression on the cell we will then be able to deduce a mechanism by which it acts.

Here we report that treatment of HEK 293 cells with thapsigargin (TG) results in the activation of Ca 2 + entry with two components, an early, La 3 +-sensitive, component and a late component that shows both La 3 +-sensitive and -insensitive constituents. Preincubation with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) prevented TG-induced activation of Ca 2 + entry but, in contrast, enhanced this process after its activation. Addition of MβCD after store depletion did not modify the La 3 +-sensitive store-operated divalent cation entry but increased La 3 +-insensitive non-capacitative Ca 2 + <b>entry.</b> <b>Cell</b> stimulation with TG results in a transient increase in Orai 1 co-immunoprecipitation with STIM 1, TRPC 1 and TRPC 6. TG-induced association of these proteins was significantly attenuated by preincubation for 30 min with MβCD, without altering surface expression of Orai 1 or TRPCs. In contrast, the association of Orai 1 with STIM 1 or TRPC 1 was unaffected when MβCD was added after store depletion with TG. Addition of MβCD to TG-treated cells promoted dissociation between Orai 1 and TRPC 6, as well as non-capacitative Ca 2 + entry. TRPC 6 expression silencing indicates that MβCD-enhanced non-capacitative Ca 2 + entry was mediated by TRPC 6.

Putney Jr., A model for receptor-regulated calcium <b>entry,</b> <b>Cell</b> Calcium 7 (1986) 1 – 12]. Here, we describe a mechanism that modulates this store-operated Ca 2 + entry (SOC). Ca 2 + influx leads to inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) activity in HEK 293 cells [L. Sternfeld, et al., Tyrosine phosphatase PTP 1 B interacts with TRPV 6 in vivo and {{plays a role in}} TRPV 6 -mediated calcium influx in HEK 293 cells, Cell Signal 17 (2005) 951 – 960]. Since Ca 2 + does not directly inhibit PTP 1 B, we assumed an intermediate signal, which links the rise in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration and PTP 1 B inhibition. We now show that Ca 2 + influx is followed by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that it is reduced in cells preincubated with catalase. Furthermore, Ca 2 +-dependent inhibition of PTP 1 B can be abolished in the presence of catalase. H 2 O 2 (100 �M) directly added to cells inhibits PTP 1 B and leads to increase in Ca 2 + influx after store depletion. PP 1, an inhibitor of the Src family tyrosine kinases, prevents H 2 O 2 -induced Ca 2 + influx. Our results show that ROS act as fine tuning modulators of Ca 2 + entry.

Works by Preira et al. in 2013 implemented successive constrictions whereby the first constriction used only to clog the leukocytes without the presence of driving fluid and the second narrower gauge was used for quantitative measurement of force, deformation, and velocity [60]. In 2012, Guo et al. proposed a ratchet mechanism to study asymmetry in the force required to deform single cells.

Kim et al. developed a microaspirator chip which able to deliver, trap and deform multiple cells while provide high throughput for HeLa cells investigation. A unique vertically raised aspiration channel design was able to eliminate the leakage problem [20]. Lateral trapping was used for micropipette array chip to measure deformation due to its simplicity, but the process is very time consuming and requires high suction pressure. Generally, by performing cell deformation measurements similar to MA using standard PDMS microchannel surely imposed several challenges due to rectangular cross section. For examples; the driving fluid might get leaked along the edges, issue on cell conformity since rounded shape of cell cannot accommodate sharp edges of PDMS channel and hard to determine shear force due to presence of additive flow in microfluidic. Nevertheless, the rectangular channels do exhibit several advantages such as ease of fabrication and easier for cell-surface observation under optical microscopy.

The influence of seed coat thickness and cotyledon compactness on cooking characteristics of four cowpea types (thick seed coat/compact cotyledon (Bechuana White), thick seed coat/porous cotyledon (IT 82 E 18), thin seed coat/compact cotyledon (Black Eye) and thin seed coat/porous cotyledon (California Black) was studied. Seed coat thickness was found to influence water absorption during soaking. Cowpeas with thin seed coats had higher rates of water absorption during soaking due to its amorphous cell layer that rendered the seed coat more permeable compared to the palisade cell layer found in cowpeas with thick seed coats. Cotyledon compactness influenced cooking time of cowpeas. Cowpeas with porous cotyledons cooked faster compared to cowpeas with compact cotyledon probably because of the structural arrangement of porous cotyledon cells that provide more intercellular spaces for rapid water <b>entry,</b> <b>cell</b> expansion and separation favouring a faster cooking process compared to compact cotyledon. Seed coat and cotyledon structures directly influenced very few of the cooking and sensory characteristics. Sensory attributes such as cooked cowpea flavour, degree of sweetness, degree of sweet aftertaste, and degree of mushiness positively contributed to consumers’ liking of cowpeas. Raw cowpea flavour, bitter taste, degree of bitter aftertaste and degree of firmness contributed to consumers’ disliking of cowpeas. Chemical composition of cowpeas probably influences sensory characteristics of cowpeas more than seed coat and cotyledon structures. It is recommended that breeders work together with food scientists in order to release cowpeas types that are preferred by consumers (i. e. cowpeas with good appearance (low percentage of splitting), good flavour and soft texture upon cooking.

A better {{understanding}} of its life cycle, including the process of host <b>cell</b> <b>entry,</b> is important for the development of HCV therapies and model systems. Based on the requirement for numerous host factors, including the two tight junction proteins claudin- 1 (CLDN 1) and occludin (OCLN), HCV <b>cell</b> <b>entry</b> has been proposed to be a multi-step process. The lack of OCLN-specific inhibitors has prevented a comprehensive analysis of this process. To study the role of OCLN in HCV <b>cell</b> <b>entry,</b> we created OCLN mutants whose HCV <b>cell</b> <b>entry</b> activities could be inhibited by antibodies. These mutants were expressed in polarized HepG 2 cells engineered to support the complete HCV life cycle by CD 81 and miR- 122 expression and synchronized infection assays were performed to define the kinetics of HCV <b>cell</b> <b>entry.</b> During these studies, OCLN utilization differences between HCV isolates were observed, supporting a model that HCV directly interacts with OCLN. In HepG 2 cells, both HCV <b>cell</b> <b>entry</b> and tight junction formation were impaired by OCLN silencing and restored by expression of antibody regulatable OCLN mutant. Synchronized infection assays showed that glycosaminoglycans and SR-BI mediated host cell binding, while CD 81, CLDN 1 and OCLN all acted sequentially at a post-binding stage prior to endosomal acidification. These results fit a model where the tight junction region is the last to be encountered by the virion prior to internalization...|$|R

This study shows that a commercial serine protease inhibitor (camostat) partially blocked infection by SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL 63 (HCoV-NL 63) in HeLa cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and TMPRSS 2. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with camostat and EST [(23, 25) trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamindo- 3 -methylbutane ethyl ester], a cathepsin inhibitor, efficiently prevented both <b>cell</b> <b>entry</b> and the multistep growth of SARS-CoV in human Calu- 3 airway epithelial cells.
