40|$|A new {{systematic}} error calibration method in lateral shearing interferometry (LSI) is proposed for extreme ultraviolet lithography. This method {{is used to}} remove the most significant errors: geometric optical path difference (OPD) and detector tilt error. The difference fronts of 0 th and +/- 1 st order <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> are used to reconstruct wavefront. The Zernike coefficients of the reconstructed wavefront are {{used to calculate the}} distance among different diffracted light converging points (d).

40|$|The regular {{arrangement}} of metal nanoparticles influences their plasmonic behavior. It {{has been previously}} demonstrated that the coupling between <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> and plasmon modes can give rise to extremely narrow plasmon resonances. This is the case when the single-particle localized surface plasmon resonance (λLSP) is very close in value to the Rayleigh anomaly wavelength (λRA) of the nanoparticles array. In this paper, we performed angle-resolved extinction measurements on a 2 D array of gold nano-cylinders designed to fulfil the condition λRA<λLSP. Varying the angle of excitation offers a unique possibility to finely modify the value of λRA, thus gradually approaching the condition of coupling between <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> and plasmon modes. The experimental observation of a collective dipolar resonance has been interpreted by exploiting a simplified model based on the coupling of evanescent <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> with plasmon modes. Among other plasmon modes, the measurement technique has also evidenced and allowed the study of a vertical plasmon mode, only visible in TM polarization at off-normal excitation incidence. The results of numerical simulations, based on the periodic Green’s tensor formalism, match well with the experimental transmission spectra and show fine details that could go unnoticed by considering only experimental data...|$|R

50|$|Spectral {{intensity}} of the <b>diffracted</b> <b>wave</b> depends on the spectral {{intensity of}} the acoustic wave (which depends, in turn, on the RF power applied to the transducer). Ratio between the diffracted intensity and the input one represents the diffraction efficiency. Maximum diffraction efficiency is limited by nonlinear effects.

40|$|In a {{synthetic}} tomographic experiment, we succeeded to recover an idealized narrow mantle plume reaching {{deep into the}} lower mantle by using a misfit based on the instantaneous phase difference. A misfit based on simple cross-correlation traveltime shifts leaves the lower mantle part of the plume largely unresolved, despite the use of finite-frequency sensitivity kernels. The time-continuous and amplitude-independent instantaneous phase misfit allows us to measure the interaction between direct and <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> {{as a function of}} time, which is difficult to capture by simple cross-correlation traveltime measurements. The <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> arriving later than the main phase are essential to improve the tomographic result. The measurement of <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> yields the necessary information to recover the plume correctly even in the lower mantle. The instantaneous phase measurement is ideal to capture this interaction, but other time- or frequency-dependent measurements may give similar results. We also investigated the effect of wavefront healing on cross-correlation traveltime shifts for a range of differently sized idealized mantle plumes. We confirm that wavefront healing severely reduces traveltime shifts when the plume conduit is considerably thinner than the width of the first Fresnel zone. For plume conduits with a diameter on the order of 100 km, even traveltime shifts measured at periods as short as T = 1 s are affected...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Battjes (1982) {{found the}} loads of short-crested random waves {{on a long}} {{structure}} decrease with the structure length and also with the obliqueness of wave incidence. These decreases come from the spatial phase difference along the structure. Lee et al. (2010) found that obliquely incident random waves in a nearshore area become directionally asymmetric due to refraction. They also found the asymmetry becomes more significant in shallower waters. Recently, Jung et al. (2011) studied random wave loads on a long structure considering diffraction and directional asymmetry. In this study, we further study random wave loads on a detached breakwater considering diffraction of waves which propagate {{at both ends of}} the breakwater. We also consider directional asymmetry. The structure may be placed along the bottom contours in order to protect on-shore incoming waves. In that case, refraction-induced random waves may become asymmetric, i. e., on-shore components are more dominant than along-shore ones. Therefore, directional obliqueness on the structure becomes less and thus the wave loads decrease in less degree than the symmetric waves. When waves are obliquely incident on a long structure, the <b>diffracting</b> <b>waves</b> give forces on the lee side of the structure. The <b>diffracting</b> <b>wave</b> has a spatial phase variation along the lee side which is different from that the obliquely incident wave has on the front side. Thus, the wave loads decrease with the existence of <b>diffracting</b> <b>wave...</b>|$|R

As always, it is assumed that only one particle at a time is able to pass the entire mechanism. From the measure of the recoil of the screen S1, according to Einstein, one can deduce from which slit the particle has passed without destroying the wave aspects of the process.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a typical}} {{reconstruction}} {{the first step}} is to generate random phases and combine them with the amplitude information from the reciprocal space pattern. Then a Fourier transform is applied back and forth to move between real space and reciprocal space with the modulus squared of the <b>diffracted</b> <b>wave</b> field set equal to the measured diffraction intensities in each cycle. By applying various constraints in real and reciprocal space the pattern evolves into an image after enough iterations of the HIO process. To ensure reproducibility the process is typically repeated with new sets of random phases with each run having typically hundreds to thousands of cycles.|$|E
50|$|Owing to its {{birefringent}} nature, the AOPDF {{is intrinsically}} polarization-sensitive. Furthermore, polarization of the <b>diffracted</b> <b>wave,</b> created {{as the result}} of the interaction between the incident optical wave and the acoustic wave in the crystal, is rotate by 90° with respect to the incident wave polarization. For the single-beam optical input there could be up to 4 beams at the output of the AOPDF: two transmitted (non-diffracted) beams arising from double refraction and (in the presence of a suitable acoustic wave in the crystal) two diffracted beams corresponding to each linear polarization component (ordinary and extraordinary) of the input beam. Typically, ordinary-polarized beam is used at the input and so, only two beams are observed at the output: ordinary-polarized transmitted beam and extraordinary-polarized diffracted beam.|$|E
40|$|The {{diffraction}} of P, S and Rayleigh waves by 3 -D topographies in {{an elastic}} half-space is studied using a simplified indirect boundary element method (IBEM). This technique {{is based on}} the integral representation of the diffracted elastic fields in terms of single-layer boundary sources. I t {{can be seen as a}} numerical realization of Huygens’ principle because <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> are constructed at the boundaries from where they are radiated by means of boundary sources. A Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for such sources is obtained from the stress-free boundary conditions. A simplified discretization scheme for the numerical and analytical integration of the exact Green’s functions, which employs circles of various sizes to cover most of the boundary surface, is used. The incidence of elastic waves on 3 -D topographical profiles is studied. We analyse the displacement amplitudes in the frequency, space and time domains. The results show that the vertical walls of a cylindrical cavity are strong diffractors producing emission of energy in all directions. In the case of a mountain and incident P, SV and SH waves the results show a great variability of the surface ground motion. These spatial variations are due to the interference between locally generated <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves.</b> A polarization analysis of the surface displacement at different locations shows that the <b>diffracted</b> <b>waves</b> are mostly surface and creeping waves...|$|R
