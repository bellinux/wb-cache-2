According to Norman Davies, {{the failures of the}} Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses {{by the end of the}} 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more destructive precedents of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union under Stalin.|$|E

The Serbs in particular did not agree and refused to vacate any of the territory they had seized in northern Macedonia (that is, the territory roughly corresponding to the modern Republic of Macedonia), saying that the Bulgarian army had failed to accomplish its pre-war goals at Adrianople (to capture it without Serbian help) and that the pre-war agreement on the division of Macedonia had to be revised. Some circles in Bulgaria <b>inclined</b> <b>toward</b> going to war with Serbia and Greece on this issue.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{completion}} of his studies, Ibn Abi Du'ad became affiliated with Yahya ibn Aktham, the chief judge (qadi al-qudat) under the caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). It was while in Yahya's service that he first met al-Ma'mun – according to one anecdote, this occurred {{as early as the}} year of al-Ma'mun's arrival in Baghdad in 819 – and he quickly found favor with the caliph. Al-Ma'mun was himself <b>inclined</b> <b>toward</b> Mu'tazilism, which represented a moderate alternative between orthodoxy and the Alids while simultaneously affirming his authority as imam to preside over religious matters, and in 827 he proclaimed his belief in a central Mu'tazilite tenet, that the Qur'an had been created. By the end of al-Ma'mun's reign in 833, Ibn Abi Du'ad had become a close associate of the caliph, and on his deathbed al-Ma'mun recommended to his brother and successor al-Mu'tasim that he admit Ibn Abi Du'ad to his circle of advisors.|$|E
25|$|While {{genetic and}} {{epigenetic}} alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes change {{the behavior of}} cells, those alterations, in the end, result in cancer through their effects on the population of neoplastic cells and their microenvironment. Mutant cells in neoplasms compete for space and resources. Thus, a clone with a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene will expand only in a neoplasm if that mutation gives the clone a competitive advantage over the other clones and normal cells in its microenvironment. Thus, the process of carcinogenesis is formally a process of Darwinian evolution, known as somatic or clonal evolution. Furthermore, {{in light of the}} Darwinistic mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it has been theorized that the various forms of cancer can be categorized as pubertarial and gerontological. Anthropological research is currently being conducted on cancer as a natural evolutionary process through which natural selection destroys environmentally inferior phenotypes while supporting others. According to this theory, cancer comes in two separate types: from birth to the end of puberty (approximately age 20) teleologically <b>inclined</b> <b>toward</b> supportive group dynamics, and from mid-life to death (approximately age 40+) teleologically inclined away from overpopulative group dynamics.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since the}} {{formation}} of the Delian League in 477 BC, the island of Melos had refused to join. By refusing to join the League, however, Melos reaped the benefits of the League without bearing any of the burdens. In 425 BC, an Athenian army under Cleon attacked Melos to force the island to join the Delian League. However, Melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality. Further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 BC the mood of the people in Athens was <b>inclined</b> <b>toward</b> military adventure. The island of Melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party. Furthermore, there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party. Enforcement of the economic obligations of the Delian League upon rebellious city-states and islands was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of Athens could be assured. Melos alone among all the Cycladic Islands located in the south-west Aegean Sea had resisted joining the Delian League. This continued rebellion provided a bad example {{to the rest of the}} members of the Delian League.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the villagers}} were {{nominally}} Roman Catholic, {{they were not}} <b>inclined</b> <b>toward</b> religiosity. Upon the arrival of Piernas to St. Louis in 1769, there was no church and no enforcement of laws relating to religious observances. Within a month after taking office from St. Ange in May 1770, Piernas had urged the residents to build a log chapel on the church block, which was dedicated by Father Pierre Gibault of Kaskaskia on June 24, 1770. Gibault officiated at the chapel regularly in spite of being {{under the authority of}} the bishop of Quebec and being a British subject, and he performed dozens of masses and sixty-four baptisms until 1772. In May 1772, a Capuchin priest named Valentine became the first resident priest in St. Louis (although he technically was the chaplain to the Spanish garrison), and through early 1776 he baptized 64 French, 24 blacks, and 19 Indians, and he officiated at 72 funerals and 4 weddings. The estate of former commandant St. Ange contributed funds toward the building of a new church in 1774, but it was delayed by the death of its carpenter until mid-1776. In May 1776, Valentine was replaced by another Capuchin, Father Bernard de Limpach, who became the first pastor of the St. Louis parish, and with this and the completion of the new church building, Catholic religious observance became a customary component of life in St. Louis.|$|E

500|$|In 1786 Gore became {{concerned}} about a rise in anti-lawyer sentiment in Massachusetts.

[...] Although many rebels were ultimately convicted, a large number received amnesty. [...] In 1788, Gore was elected a delegate to the 1789 Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution. [...] His election was contested because Boston, where he lived, was at the time more <b>inclined</b> <b>toward</b> state power.

500|$|Medieval historians {{noted the}} many {{parallels}} between al-Ikhshid and his Tulunid predecessors, especially Khumarawayh. Ibn Sa'id even reported {{that according to}} Egyptian astrologers, {{the two men had}} entered Egypt on the same day of the year and with the same star in the same ascendant. There were important differences, however: al-Ikhshid lacked the [...] "flamboyance" [...] (Hugh Kennedy) of the Tulunids. Al-Ikhshid's caution and self-imposed restraint in his foreign policy objectives also stood in stark contrast with his contemporaries and other rulers of Egypt who preceded and followed him, earning him a reputation of extreme caution, often misinterpreted as timidity by contemporaries. He was also described as less cultivated than his predecessor Ibn Tulun. Unlike Ibn Tulun, who built an entire new capital at al-Qatta'i and a famous mosque, al-Ikhshid was neither a patron of artists and poets nor a major builder. According to historian Thierry Bianquis, he was described by medieval chroniclers as [...] "a choleric and gluttonous man, yet shrewd and <b>inclined</b> <b>toward</b> avarice", but with a fondness for luxuries imported from the east, and especially perfumes. His love of eastern luxuries soon spread among the upper classes of Fustat as well and influenced the style and fashion of local Egyptian products in turn, which began to imitate them.|$|E
