I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

After reconsidering several times, the administrator decided to keep maintaining the page, and thanked the media and his followers for supporting him. He concluded by saying, [...] "I am not sure if keeping this page will benefit the people of goodwill ... only God will <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> irresponsible or stubborn in doing so ... On another note, I confess {{that it has been}} an honor and pleasure to continue collaborating and working as a team with all of you. Thank you, people of goodwill from Tamaulipas. I owe it all to you." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I was going to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E
500|$|Friends was Aniston's sixth sitcom; {{each of her}} {{previous}} ventures had been canceled prematurely. Feeling vulnerable, Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career, who encouraged her to audition for Friends, which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time. Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this. However, casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because, at the time, Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through, in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years. CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract, which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously, traveling back-and-forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks. Meanwhile, NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel, replace Aniston, and reshoot several episodes if CBS' series proved successful, which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars. However, Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail. Essentially, the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered, while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms {{in spite of her}} preference towards Friends. During this time of uncertainty, Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends-related promotions and photo shoots; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced. Aniston explained, [...] "When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be still playing Rachel." [...] Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position. The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, [...] "I'm auditioning for your part in Friends." [...] Ultimately, Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes, two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston's interpretation of Rachel because [...] "in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable," [...] commending the actress for [...] "breathing life into a difficult character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{decided to}} stay and hold Khartoum despite the orders of the Gladstone {{government}} to merely report about the best means of supervising the evacuation of the Sudan. Powers who acted as Gordon's unofficial press attaché wrote in The Times: [...] "We are daily expecting British troops. We cannot bring ourselves {{to believe that we}} are to be abandoned". In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. I <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> chief I would never employ myself for I am incorrigible".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, after {{pulling the}} band {{off the road}} mid-tour, Ward said he needed to re-group. [...] "I walked {{out in the middle}} of a tour.... I needed to get away from {{everything}} and everyone. I wasn't enjoying myself at all, and I didn't feel my life or the band was where I wanted it to be... I needed to step back and reassess everything." [...] For two months, he retreated to his home without speaking to anyone in his professional life. In an article with PE.com, Ward said, [...] "When I left, I honestly didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to continue the band or not, so I told everyone to pursue whatever they wanted,". During that time, Hinojos left to join The Mars Volta as their new secondary guitarist and sound manipulator, filling the void left by Jeremy Ward's death. Hinojos was replaced by Keeley Davis.|$|E
2500|$|Snowden's first {{television}} interview aired January 26, 2014, on Germany's NDR. In April 2014, {{he appeared on}} video from an undisclosed location during President Putin's live annual Q exchange with the public. Snowden asked whether Russia intercepted, stored or analyzed individuals' communications. Putin replied, [...] "Russia uses surveillance techniques for spying on individuals only with the sanction of a court order. This is our law, and therefore there is no mass surveillance in our country." [...] Benjamin Wittes in The New Republic described the exchange as [...] "a highly-scripted propaganda stunt for Vladimir Putin". Snowden insisted his question was designed to hold the Russian president accountable. In an op-ed for The Guardian, Snowden said his question was intended [...] "to mirror the now infamous exchange in US Senate intelligence committee hearings between senator Ron Wyden {{and the director of}} national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA collected records on millions of Americans, and to invite either an important concession or a clear evasion." [...] Snowden called Putin's response [...] "evasive". A few days later, The Daily Beast reported that Snowden himself [...] "instantly regretted" [...] asking Putin the [...] "softball question", which was crafted with several of his key advisers, and that he was mortified by the reaction. Ben Wizner, one of Snowden's legal advisers, told the Beast that Snowden hadn't realized how much his appearance with Putin would be seen as a Kremlin propaganda victory. [...] "I know this is hard to believe," [...] Wizner acknowledged. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just watching from afar, I'd think, 'Wow, they forced him to do this.' But it's not true. He just fucking did it." [...] Asked six months later about the incident, Snowden conceded, [...] "Yeah, that was terrible! Oh, Jesus, that blew up in my face. ... And in the United States, what I did appearing at that Putin press conference was not worth the price." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It does indeed," [...] Tom agreed. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{going out}} without any fixed object beyond {{taking the first}} work that came to hand, I should not feel so easy and {{comfortable}} about it as I do now." ...|$|R

6000|$|This was galling a {{wound that}} has festered for years, and I did not endure the {{question}} so patiently as those which preceded it; but replied, 'I demand, in my turn, to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> before an English Justice of the Peace?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Morris Hyde {{was very}} disappointing," [...] she confessed. [...] "I {{was looking forward}} to being tremendously entertained, but instead of telling me all about these unknown tribes in Central America, his only anxiety seemed to be to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to let him kiss me in the taxi afterwards.

6000|$|Then Captain Batsby {{was again}} very thoughtful. [...] "It {{would make a}} difference, you <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{to say a word}} to Gertrude now,--as to being married or {{anything}} of that kind,--it would seem that I meant to go on whether I got anything or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I may be dull," [...] said Morgan, with a {{grin and}} a wink at Bridger; [...] "but <b>I</b> want to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Now, <b>I</b> say this <b>is</b> all a joke of Mr. Plunkett's, concocted to frighten two babes-in-the-woods.

6000|$|... "I meant," [...] she {{answered}} humbly, [...] "that I believe--of course <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> right--I believe that Mr. Cossey {{is in some}} way entangled with a lady, in short with Mrs. Quest, and {{that the question of}} whether or no he comes forward again depends upon her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] in a {{significant}} tone, [...] "a man came along three or four nights ago.

60|$|Well, {{after the}} first agonizing five minutes, my stage-fright left me, never to return.

6000|$|... "Who {{are your}} people, then?" [...] Lady Medlincourt asked. [...] "Where did you meet? Who {{introduced}} you? Don't {{look at one}} another like a pair of stupids.
