5|$|That night Halverson, his copilot, and his {{engineer}} pooled their candy rations for {{the next}} day's drop. The accumulated candy was heavy, {{so in order to}} ensure the children were not hurt by the falling candy, Halvorsen made three parachutes out of handkerchiefs and tied them to the rations. In the morning when Halverson and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to handkerchiefs. They made these drops once a week for three weeks. Each week, the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> waiting at the Tempelhof airport fence grew significantly.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{preschool}} teachers talk about how they work with developing interculturality in preschool. The study is based on the following questions:   How do the teachers describe the work with interculturality in multicultural <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children?</b>   How do the teachers describe the work with interculturality in monocultural <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children?</b>   What are the differences between these descriptions?   Through qualitative interviews with five preschool teachers working at two preschools we have analyzed how they talk about their work to develop interculturality. The first preschool has multicultural <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> and the second preschool has monocultural <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> In this study we have assumed the intercultural perspective as described by Lorentz (2014). The results show that the preschool with multicultural <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> works actively with interculturality, while the preschool with monocultural <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> does not work with interculturality, although the teachers have experience and ideas of how to work with interculturality...|$|R

5|$|In Birmingham, 60.4% of the {{population}} was aged between 16-74, compared to 66.7% in England as a whole. There are generally more females than males in each single year of age, except for the youngest ages (0–18) and late-30s and late-50s. Females represented 51.6% of {{the population}} whilst men represented 48.4%. The differences are most marked in the oldest age group reflecting greater female longevity, where more women were 70 or over. The bulge around the early-20s is due largely to students coming to the city's universities. Children around age ten are a relatively small group, reflecting the decline in birth rates {{around the turn of the}} century. There is a large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> under the age of five which reflecting high numbers of births in recent years. Births are up 20% since 2001, increasing from 14,427 to 17,423 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} to 1990, Bart {{goes to his}} first day of school, but things do not go so well for him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge {{that they need to}} nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E

Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity.

She decides {{on her own}} to try to infiltrate the Capitol and kill Snow. Her team follows her. In the intense urban warfare that ensues, most of Katniss's comrades, including Finnick, are killed. Katniss perseveres alone. As she reaches Snow's mansion, a hoverplane drops parachutes carrying bombs, some of which explode among a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> being used as human shields around the mansion. Rebel medics (including Katniss's sister Prim) rush in to help the injured children, but in a calculated move, {{the rest of the}} bombs go off, taking a heavy toll on the medics.

A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> their chaperones, and National Geographic Society staff members were also on board, embarking on an educational trip west to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary near Santa Barbara, California. The fatalities at the Pentagon included 55military personnel and 70civilians. Of those 125 killed, 92 were on the first floor, 31 were on the second floor, and two were on the third. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency civilian employees were killed while the Office of the Secretary of Defense lost one contractor. The U.S. Army suffered 75 fatalities—53 civilians (47 employees and six contractors) and 22 soldiers—while the U.S. Navy suffered 42 fatalities—nine civilians (six employees and three contractors) and 33 sailors.

5|$|The next day, Fung {{is having}} tea {{in a public}} square {{surrounded}} by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.|$|E
5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's {{refuge in}} order to {{eliminate}} Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> {{with the ability to}} communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E
