40|$|Abstract — A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the die-less wire drawing {{was carried out in}} which the conventional die is replaced by a die-less conical orifice reduction unit. The process involves pulling the wire through the conical die-less unit which is filled with a polymer melt, the pulling action causes yielding of the continuum and a reduction in area is then obtained. A Newtonian behavior of the polymer melt and a rigid non-linear strain-hardening continuum were considered in which non-linear equations are formulated for the pressure and the stress increment in the <b>die</b> <b>unit.</b> A finite difference numerical technique was applied to solve these equations for the plasto-hydrodynamic pressure and the stress, which enabled prediction of the non-linear deformation profile of the continuum, the pressure distribution, and the percentage reduction in area for various drawing speeds. The maximum reduction in area for wire drawing is (5. 5 %). The maximum pressure lies in the rear half of the <b>die</b> <b>unit</b> for various drawing speeds and it was found to be larger than that obtained by previous experimental work, however the drawing stress attained in this technique was less than that obtained using conventional dies...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{attempts}} to obtain {{deeper understanding of}} the development of laminar morphology in polymer blends and to optimize the production and properties of laminar polymer blends in ribbon extrusion. Studies of the microstructure of extruded ribbons of high density polyethylene (HDPE) /polyamide- 6 (PA- 6) and polypropylene (PP) /ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) blends have shown {{that it is possible to}} control the flow-induced morphology to generate thin, large and discontinuous overlapping platelets of PA- 6 or EVOH dispersed phase in a HDPE or PP matrix phase, respectively. Such polymer blends are known as laminar polymer blends. The laminar blends of HDPE/PA- 6 with only small amounts (20 wt%) of the barrier component, i. e. PA- 6 resin, produced significant reduction (up to 45 times) in hydrocarbon permeability of extruded ribbons. The PP/EVOH laminar blends with 25 wt% of the barrier component, i. e. EVOH, yielded 10 times improvement in hydrocarbon permeability of the extruded ribbons. The above was achieved by optimizing material characteristics, processing conditions and flow field in the screw zone and in the <b>die</b> <b>unit.</b> In particular, an approach for controlling the mixing and melting steps in the screw zone was introduced, in order to maximize the size of melted particles of the dispersed phase upon entering the <b>die</b> <b>unit.</b> In the die region, extensional flow generated by incorporating converging and diverging sections in the die design, caused the large particles entering the die to be stretched in both directions (machine and transverse directions), thus, producing platelets in the plane of extrusion. The effects of the following factors on morphology development and blend properties were considered and, when possible, manipulated to obtain large particles and deformations of dispersed phase particles: screw zone temperature profile, die temperature, screw design and configuration, composition, pre-compounding, die exit gap size, and cooling system. The influence of the rheology of the system, i. e. the viscosity and elasticity ratios of components, was studied and manipulated to obtain large deformations of dispersed phase particles. The effect of interfacial tension on the morphology and barrier and mechanical properties was investigated and for the HDPE/PA- 6 system, the interfacial tension was optimized by controlling the level of compatibilizer, in order to obtain maximum barrier and mechanical performance of the laminar blends. Pressure-Volume-Temperature (P-V-T) characteristics of the individual resins and blends of HDPE/PA- 6 were studied, in order to calculate the interfacial tension values and other thermodynamic relationships for compatibilized and non-compatibilized blends of HDPE and PA- 6. Various relationships were obtained for predicting the barrier and mechanical properties of the laminar blends from morphological data...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the coating}} of fine wires using {{hydrodynamic}} pressure technique {{has been investigated}} theoretically and experimentally. One of the principal aims of the project is to establish the minimum possible coating thickness on fine wires which can be applied by means of hydrodynamic technique. Models based on steady, uniform and laminar flow of Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian fluid for polymer coating for the process of plasto-hydrodynamic wire coating in a stepped bore unit have been developed. The closed form analytical solution is established in cylindrical coordinate since the practical case is a mathematical axisymmetric problem.

5000|$|The {{games are}} {{played on a}} 2D {{landscape}} filled with grass, trees, mountains, rivers, etc. [...] The player(s) and the computer control armies separated into squads.

Most units can only attack targets in adjacent cells in main compass directions (north, south, east, and west). Several are able to attack at range and diagonally. Combat consists of one unit attacks another, then the target retaliates (adjacent main directions only). If the player has a castle on the level, he/she may purchase additional units from it. The first game requires the player's king to be in the castle for this to happen. This restriction has been removed in the sequel. Standard victory condition for the first game is to kill the enemy king, who is usually found at the castle, making him doubly difficult to kill.
