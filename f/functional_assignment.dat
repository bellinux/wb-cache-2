50|$|As {{the total}} number of sequenced {{proteins}} increases and interest expands in proteome analysis, there is an ongoing effort to organize proteins into families and to describe their component domains and motifs. Reliable identification of protein families is critical to phylogenetic analysis, functional annotation, and the exploration of diversity of protein function in a given phylogenetic branch. The Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) is using protein families and superfamilies as the basis for development of a sequence/structure-based strategy for large scale <b>functional</b> <b>assignment</b> of enzymes of unknown function.|$|E
5000|$|The EFI is {{developing}} an integrated sequence-structure based strategy for <b>functional</b> <b>assignment</b> by predicting the substrate specificities of unknown members of mechanistically diverse enzyme superfamilies. [...] The approach leverages conserved features {{within a given}} superfamily such as known chemistry, identity of active site functional groups, and composition of specificity-determining residues, motifs, or structures to predict function but relies on multidisciplinary expertise to streamline, refine, and test the predictions. [...] The integrated sequence-strategy under development will be generally applicable to deciphering the ligand specificities of any functionally unknown protein.|$|E
50|$|The genomes of four Leishmania species (L. major, L. infantum, L. donovani and L. braziliensis) {{have been}} sequenced, {{revealing}} more than 8300 protein-coding and 900 RNA genes. Almost 40% of protein-coding genes fall into 662 families containing {{between two and}} 500 members. Most of the smaller gene families are tandem arrays of one to three genes, while the larger gene families are often dispersed in tandem arrays at different loci throughout the genome. Each of the 35 or 36 chromosomes is organized into {{a small number of}} gene clusters of tens-to-hundreds of genes on the same DNA strand. These clusters can be organized in head-to-head (divergent) or tail-to-tail (convergent) fashion, with the latter often separated by tRNA, rRNA and/or snRNA genes. Transcription of protein-coding genes initiates bidirectionally in the divergent strand-switch regions between gene clusters and extends polycistronically through each gene cluster before terminating in the strand-switch region separating convergent clusters. Leishmania telomeres are usually relatively small, consisting of a few different types of repeat sequence. Evidence can be found for recombination between several different groups of telomeres. The L. major and L. infantum genomes contain only about 50 copies of inactive degenerated Ingi/L1Tc-related elements (DIREs), while L. braziliensis also contains several telomere-associated transposable elements and spliced leader-associated retroelements. The Leishmania genomes share a conserved core proteome of about 6200 genes with the related trypanosomatids Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, but around 1000 Leishmania-specific genes are known, which are mostly randomly distributed throughout the genome. Relatively few (about 200) species-specific differences in gene content exist between the three sequenced Leishmania genomes, but about 8% of the genes appear to be evolving at different rates between the three species, indicative of different selective pressures that could be related to disease pathology. About 65% of protein-coding genes currently lack <b>functional</b> <b>assignment.</b>|$|E

30|$|In Table  2, main methodologies and {{resources}} exploited for NGS data analyses are summarized. Data are usually delivered by sequencing {{centers in the}} form of raw, fragmented sequences, to be pre-processed, i.e., cleaned, from additional fragments due to the specific technology employed (Table  1), such as vectors, adaptors, barcodes, or other contaminations (Table  2). Structure definition from fragmented data usually requires an assembly step to reconstruct the most reliable original molecules, such as longer genomic sequences or transcripts. The assembly is based on sequence alignments driven by identical regions shared by the fragments (Table  2). The assembly procedure may include already available reference sequences (guided approaches), {{as in the case of}} transcript assemblies based on a genome reference, or they are based on reference-free methodologies (de novo) [77]. This procedure is a key step for many different applications, indeed high-quality longer backbones are useful to properly proceed towards successive steps in data processing, which are mainly structure and <b>functional</b> <b>assignments</b> and predictions (Fig.  2). In genomics, transcriptomics, population genetics, and metagenomics, these are widespread fundamental tasks solved by different computational methodologies (Table  2), though based on similar strategies (Fig.  2), mainly ab initio approaches or similarity-based ones. Ab initio-based algorithms exploit complex probabilistic models to detect expected features (genes, motives, propensities) as defined on the basis of training datasets that support the proper identification of specific features. Similarity-based methods, on the other hand, are the principal and more frequently used approaches in bioinformatics since they permit identifications, predictions, structure, and <b>functional</b> <b>assignments.</b> They rely on sequence or tridimensional similarities exploiting a typical concept in biology, which considers similarity in structure as a possible indication of similarity in role. Comparison with reference (nucleotide or amino acid general databases) or more specific collections, such as those from genomes, gene families, transcriptomes, or repeats, is fundamental to transfer information from already annotated molecules to newly defined ones. Beyond supporting structure and <b>functional</b> <b>assignments</b> by detection of common features, similarity searches also support identification of peculiarities and provide hints for evolutionary investigations [78].|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{high-throughput}} biology has catalyzed a remarkable improvement {{in our ability}} to identify new genes. A large fraction of newly discovered genes have an unknown functional role, particularly when they are specific to a particular lineage or organism. These genes, currently labeled “hypothetical,” might support important biological cell functions and could potentially serve as targets for medical, diagnostic, or pharmacogenomic studies. An important challenge to the scientific community is to associate these newly predicted genes with a biological function that can be validated by experimental screens. In the absence of sequence or structural homology to known genes, we must rely on advanced biotechnological methods, such as DNA chips and protein–protein interaction screens as well as computational techniques to assign putative functions to these genes. In this article, we propose an effective methodology for combining biological evidence obtained in several high-throughput experimental screens and integrating this evidence in a way that provides consistent <b>functional</b> <b>assignments</b> to hypothetical genes. We use the visualization method of propagation diagrams to illustrate the flow of functional evidence that supports the <b>functional</b> <b>assignments</b> produced by the algorithm.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in the postgenomic era is the <b>functional</b> <b>assignment</b> of proteins using sequence- and structure-based predictive methods coupled with experimental validation. We have used these approaches to investigate the structure and function of the Escherichia coli K- 12 protein YfaU, annotated as a putative 4 -hydroxy- 2 -ketoheptane- 1, 7 -dioate aldolase (HpcH) in the sequence databases. HpcH is the final enzyme in the degradation pathway of the aromatic compound homoprotocatechuate. We have determined the crystal structure of apo-YfaU and the Mg 2 +-pyruvate product complex. Despite greater sequence and structural similarity to HpcH, genomic context suggests YfaU is instead a 2 -keto- 3 -deoxy sugar aldolase like the homologous 2 -dehydro- 3 -deoxygalactarate aldolase (DDGA). Enzyme kinetic measurements show activity with the probable physiological substrate 2 -keto- 3 -deoXy-L-rhamnonate, supporting the <b>functional</b> <b>assignment,</b> {{as well as the}} structurally similar 2 -keto- 3 -deoxy-L-mannonate and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxy-L-lyxonate (see accompanying paper: Rakus, J. F., Fedorov, A. A., Fedorov, E. V., Glasner, M. E., Hubbard, B. K., Delli, J. D., Babbitt, P. C., Almo, S. C., and Gerit, J. A. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 9944 - 9954). YfaU has similar activity toward the HpcH substrate 4 -hydroxy- 2 -ketoheptane- 1, 7 -dioate and synthetic substrates 4 -hydroxy- 2 -ketopentanoic acid and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -ketohexanoic acid. This indicates a relaxed substrate specificity that complicates the <b>functional</b> <b>assignment</b> of members of this enzyme superfamily. Crystal structures suggest these enzymes use an Asp-His intersubunit dyad to activate a metal-bound water or hydroxide for proton transfer during catalysis. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} promises of decentralization is to bring government closer to the people through improved public services and decision making. In contrast to this promise, the implementation of decentralization in Indonesia seems to create farther distance between government and the people resulting in the paradox of distance. This article argues that the paradox of distance in decentralized Indonesia is institutionally engineered. It is due mainly to unclear mechanisms for the people to hold government accountable and this stems from two main factors. The first one refers to the politics of <b>functional</b> <b>assignment</b> between central and local governments which benefits central government more than local government. The second factor is the macro institutional arrangements on the relationships between local government and the people where there is almost no way for local people to hold their government accountable or punish the underperformed local government.

40|$|The {{incompatible}} pathosystem between resistant cotton (Gossypium barbadense cv. 7124) and Verticillium dahliae strain V 991 {{was used}} to study the cotton transcriptome changes after pathogen inoculation by RNA-Seq. Of 32 [*] 774 genes detected by mapping the tags to assembly cotton contigs, 3442 defence-responsive genes were identified. Gene cluster analyses and <b>functional</b> <b>assignments</b> of differentially expressed genes indicated a significant transcriptional complexity. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed on selected genes with different expression levels and <b>functional</b> <b>assignments</b> {{to demonstrate the utility}} of RNA-Seq for gene expression profiles during the cotton defence response. Detailed elucidation of responses of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), phytohormone signalling-related genes, and transcription factors described the interplay of signals that allowed the plant to fine-tune defence responses. On the basis of global gene regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism-related genes, phenylpropanoid metabolism was deduced {{to be involved in the}} cotton defence response. A closer look at the expression of these genes, enzyme activity, and lignin levels revealed differences between resistant and susceptible cotton plants. Both types of plants showed an increased level of expression of lignin synthesis-related genes and increased phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POD) enzyme activity after inoculation with V. dahliae, but the increase was greater and faster in the resistant line. Histochemical analysis of lignin revealed that the resistant cotton not only retains its vascular structure, but also accumulates high levels of lignin. Furthermore, quantitative analysis demonstrated increased lignification and cross-linking of lignin in resistant cotton stems. Overall, a critical role for lignin was believed to contribute to the resistance of cotton to disease...|$|R
