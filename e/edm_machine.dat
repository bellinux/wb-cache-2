50|$|The {{wire-cut}} type {{of machine}} {{arose in the}} 1960s {{for the purpose of}} making tools (dies) from hardened steel. The tool electrode in wire EDM is simply a wire. To avoid the erosion of material from the wire causing it to break, the wire is wound between two spools so that the active part of the wire is constantly changing. The earliest numerical controlled (NC) machines were conversions of punched-tape vertical milling machines. The first commercially available NC machine built as a wire-cut <b>EDM</b> <b>machine</b> was manufactured in the USSR in 1967. Machines that could optically follow lines on a master drawing were developed by David H. Dulebohn's group in the 1960s at Andrew Engineering Company for milling and grinding machines. Master drawings were later produced by computer numerical controlled (CNC) plotters for greater accuracy. A wire-cut <b>EDM</b> <b>machine</b> using the CNC drawing plotter and optical line follower techniques was produced in 1974. Dulebohn later used the same plotter CNC program to directly control the <b>EDM</b> <b>machine,</b> and the first CNC <b>EDM</b> <b>machine</b> was produced in 1976.|$|E

In this paper, special requirements on tool paths demanded by contour <b>EDM</b> <b>machining</b> are studied and a two-phase tool path generation method for 4 -axis contour EDM rough milling with a cylindrical electrode is developed.

From these tool paths, cutter contact (CC) points between electrode and workpiece are reversely calculated. In the second phase, considering the special requirements of <b>EDM</b> <b>machining,</b> which include discharging gap compensation, electrode wear compensation, DC arcing prevention, etc., the electrode is adjusted to an optimized interference-free orientation by rotating it around the CC points obtained in the previous phase.
