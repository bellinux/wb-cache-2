5|$|The {{confirmation}} of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|Based on its nearby location, Epsilon Eridani {{was among}} the target stars for Project Phoenix, a 1995 {{microwave}} survey for signals from <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> The project had checked about 800 stars by 2004 but had not yet detected any signals.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement of governments foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> in greater detail.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars with a planet, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} several {{observations}} in the search for <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel. From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in Serpens.|$|E
5|$|Should {{evidence}} for <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{take the form}} of electromagnetic signals, the Secretary-General of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) should be contacted, and may request in the next ITU Weekly Circular to minimize terrestrial use of the electromagnetic frequency bands in which the signal was detected.|$|E

5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} extraterrestrial contact is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems resulting from {{contact with an}} extraterrestrial civilization. It {{is closely related to}} the search for <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (SETI), which attempts to locate intelligent life as opposed to analyzing the implications of contact with that life.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to radio-based methods, some projects, such as SEVENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Visible Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) at the University of California, Berkeley, are using {{other regions of}} the electromagnetic spectrum to search for extraterrestrial signals. Various other projects are not searching for coherent signals, but want to rather use electromagnetic radiation to find other evidence of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> such as megascale astroengineering projects.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The {{discovery of}} extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.|$|E
5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} {{in the search for}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|Mulder discovers a signal, {{possibly}} {{originating from}} an <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> During a storm, Jorge gets scared and runs outside. Mulder finds him dead of fright. When Scully goes to an airport {{to fly to}} Puerto Rico, she realizes she's being tracked by a couple, but manages to escape from them. Meanwhile, as Mulder investigates Jorge's corpse, the room shakes. The door opens and the shadowy figure of an alien appears. Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning, finding him excited about the readouts and tapes of the signals—the proof of aliens he has sought for so long. However, the Blue Beret team arrives, forcing them to flee with only a tape reel.|$|E
5000|$|According to Grant, {{the word}} IPSOS was {{received}} by initiates {{who were in}} communication with <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligences.</b> He equates the word with part of a cryptic cipher in Liber AL (II, 76), RPSTOVAL, {{by virtue of the}} fact that in the qabalistic art of gematria, both evaluate to either 696 or 456, depending on whether an 'S' in each is taken as the Hebrew letter shin or samekh.|$|R
25|$|However, some {{scientists}} consider these {{fears about the}} dangers of METI as panic and irrational superstition; see, for example, Alexander L. Zaitsev's papers. Biologist João Pedro de Magalhães also proposed in 2015 transmitting an invitation message to any <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligences</b> watching us already {{in the context of the}} Zoo Hypothesis and inviting them to respond, arguing this would not put us in any more danger than we are already if the Zoo Hypothesis is correct.|$|R

5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{distance between}} the two civilizations has also been {{used to assess the}} cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture. Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, {{is likely to be the}} most disruptive and negative for humanity. On a smaller scale, people close to the epicenter of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter. Space scientists Martin Dominik and John Zarnecki state that in the absence of any data on the nature of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history.|$|E
25|$|Several {{works of}} science fiction, {{such as the}} 1979 film , the 1984 film Starman and the 2000 film Battlefield Earth feature <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligences</b> {{discovering}} the record and turning their attention to Earth as a result. Among these is included the computer animated television show , which features one of the records as a central plot point in {{a continuation of the}} Transformers storyline. It was also referenced in the 2005 animation known as Fafner in the Azure as being one of the objects that the aliens discover.|$|R
50|$|Pulsar maps {{have been}} {{included}} on the two Pioneer Plaques {{as well as the}} Voyager Golden Record. They show the position of the Sun, relative to 14 pulsars, which are identified by the unique timing of their electromagnetic pulses, so that our position both in space and in time can be calculated by potential <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligences.</b> Because pulsars are emitting very regular pulses of radio waves, its radio transmissions do not require daily corrections. Moreover, pulsar positioning could create a spacecraft navigation system independently, or be used in conjunction with satellite navigation.|$|R

5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
25|$|No {{communication}} to <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{should be sent}} by any State until appropriate international consultations have taken place. States should not cooperate with attempts to communicate with <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> that {{do not conform to}} the principles of this Declaration.|$|E
25|$|SETI {{has also}} {{occasionally}} {{been the target}} of criticism by those who suggest that it is a form of pseudoscience. In particular, critics allege that no observed phenomena suggest the existence of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and furthermore that the assertion of the existence of <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligence</b> has no good Popperian criteria for falsifiability.|$|E
5000|$|According to Zaitsev, art must {{be central}} to any {{interstellar}} message. Physical laws and mathematics are almost certainly already known to <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligences,</b> but our artwork {{is unique to}} us. With this in mind, and in contrast to previous binary digital broadcasts, Zatsev proposed [...] "not a discrete two-tone radiosignal but a more native continuous one, in which smooth frequency variations directly transfer one-dimensional emotional information. I am talking about music, which is more universally comprehensible than language, and about theremin, which is an electronic noncontact musical instrument." ...|$|R
50|$|Consequently, {{a member}} of the human species may not {{necessarily}} fit the definition of “person” and thereby not receive all the rights bestowed to a person. Hence, such philosophers have engaged in arguing that certain disabled individuals (such as those with a mental capacity that is similar to or is perceived as being similar to an infant) are not persons. This philosophy is also supposedly open to the idea that such non-human persons as machines, animals, and <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>intelligences</b> may be entitled to certain rights currently granted only to humans. Personism may have views in common with transhumanism.|$|R
