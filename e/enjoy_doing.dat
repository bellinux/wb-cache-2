25|$|After {{illustrating}} a {{new edition}} of Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes by Robert Louis Stevenson, Blampied returned to work for magazines in 1933 with a weekly series of illustrations of British life in ink and sepia wash for The Illustrated London News. Blampied’s few published portraits are known from this time, {{although he did not}} particularly <b>enjoy</b> <b>doing</b> them. From photographs he drew small pencil portraits of authors and actors for a magazine called The Queen and an oil of Queen Mary (Mary of Teck) for the Christmas issue in 1934; he collaborated with his great friend and benefactor John St Helier Lander, a noted portrait artist and fellow-Jerseyman, on a picture of King George V; and he did an etching of the Jersey-born politician, Lord Portsea (Bertram Falle), which was shown at the Royal Academy in 1934. After finishing his work for the Illustrated London News in 1935 he continue to work for magazines until 1939, mainly doing occasional cartoons for The Sketch, often featuring two tramps called Horace and George.|$|E

She's strong, she's pretty and she's a proud Jewish woman." [...] Mutchnick revealed that Nicollette Sheridan was originally brought in to read the part of Grace, but even though she did a [...] "great job", her performance was [...] "too desperate". Mutchnick and Kohan decided to cast Messing in the role instead, {{who at the time}} was starring in ABC's drama Prey. After her first meeting with them, Messing was not convinced she wanted the role. Messing revealed that Mutchnick and Kohan showed up at her home with a bottle of vodka; [...] "They poured me several shots, we spoke for several hours and they pitched me the show. I'm a lightweight. I didn't need much to be a little giddy. By the end of the evening, they said, 'Will you do it?' I said, 'Let's talk tomorrow.'" [...] They called her the next day to inform her that they [...] "loved her" [...] and asked [...] "if she'd made up her mind". Messing still did not make her mind up. However, the following day, she called Mutchnick and Kohan and accepted the role. In discussion of the character, Messing said: [...] "I have a lot more confidence and I'm much more relaxed. I feel comfortable that Grace will be a character I'll <b>enjoy</b> <b>doing</b> for a long time." [...] She later, however, admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace. Messing was the last actor to be cast.|$|E

The series moves from this storyline to a long essay attributed to Viktor Davis, a fictional Reads author. [...] This essay puts forth a theory {{on the nature of the}} genders, describing the [...] "Female Void" [...] focused on feeling, and the [...] "Male Light" [...] focused on reason. These two stories are accompanied by a long discussion between Cirin, Astoria, Cerebus, and Suenteus Po. Po gives information about aardvarks, including that all aardvarks have Cerebus' [...] "magnifier" [...] quality, and attempts to convince each of the others to abandon their pursuits of power and return to what they <b>enjoy</b> <b>doing</b> most, then leaves them to their fates. Astoria is convinced and also leaves, but not before giving Cerebus information about her history with Cirin and also informing him of his hermaphrodite nature. Cerebus and Cirin then engage in a long and brutal fight, which leads to the beginning of another ascension.|$|E
