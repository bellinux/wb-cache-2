Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of the company.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt drew {{criticism}} {{in recent years}} for some of his business activities. In 2002, he lobbied business and political leaders to support Weyerhaeuser in its <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> of Willamette Industries, Inc., then the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Portland. In early 2004, he backed a purchase of Portland General Electric (PGE) by Texas Pacific Group which, though never consummated, put on hold city and county studies to acquire PGE by condemnation. Criticism of Goldschmidt's business activities peaked when, on November 13, 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski nominated him to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-run pre- and post-takeover performance of <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> in the U. K. from 1985 - 96. Prior to <b>takeover,</b> targets in <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> experience a significant deterioration in profit returns, and significantly negative share returns. However, {{there is little}} evidence that profit levels are lower than those of non- merging firms. Bidders in <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> are not superior performers in terms of profit levels, although share returns are significantly high prior to takeover. However, in the post-takeover period <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> show significant improvements in profit returns, which are associated with significant asset disposals. In contrast, friendly takeovers do not improve profit returns and result in significantly negative long-run share returns. We find no evidence of an inverse relation between the performance improvement in <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> and the pre-takeover performance of the target. We interpret the results to indicate that although <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> improve performance, {{there is little evidence}} that they play an important role in reversing the nonvalue maximizing behaviour of target companies.

5|$|By the 1950s, {{with the}} area around Woking by this time heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} was an extremely valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> bid {{with the aim of}} using the cemetery's land for property development. The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E

5|$|The former South {{station was}} near the A322 road {{making it one of}} the most easily {{accessed}} parts of the cemetery once the railway had closed, and the land surrounding it was now redundant. As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused Anglican chapel of 1854 into a crematorium, using a newer chapel built by Cyril Tubbs in 1908–09 for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations. Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by the <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> bid, the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme.|$|E
5|$|The land {{surrounding}} {{the site of}} South station and the station's two Anglican chapels were redundant following {{the closure of the}} railway. As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused original Anglican chapel into a crematorium, using the newer chapel for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations. Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by a succession of <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> bids, the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme and the buildings fell into disuse. The station building was demolished after being damaged by a fire in 1972, although the platform remained intact.|$|E
5|$|With {{the area}} around Woking by this time heavily populated, the LNC's land {{holdings}} had become an extremely valuable asset, and from 1955 onwards the LNC became a target for repeated <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> bids from property speculators. In January 1959 the Alliance Property Company announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company, bringing over a century of independence to an end. Alliance Property was a property company with {{little interest in the}} funeral business, and the income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds. Brookwood Cemetery went into decline and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness. This trend continued under a succession of further owners.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion that}} <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> must {{play a key}} role in {{corporate}} governance, by bringing purportedly efficient financial market pressures to bear on poorly performing managers, often underlies proposals for financial sector reform. This paper tests the most influential explanation of takeovers, the free cash flow theory of debt-financed restructuring, against a comprehensive sample of large U. S. <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> from the years 1978 - 89. The tests provide little support for the free cash flow hypothesis: that over-retention of corporate resources, relative to investment opportunities, would distinguish targets from other companies. Firms with less debt are more likely to have been taken over. But this and closely related evidence is more consistent with the idea that the takeover and credit markets underwent a period of speculative overheating. Thus the role played by <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> in the corporate restructuring of the 1980 s does not suggest that facilitating such activity should be a goal of present day financial reforms, in Europe or elsewhere...|$|R
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> bid for Boddingtons, which valued {{the company at}} £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United was floated on {{the stock}} market in June 1991 (raising £6.7million), and {{received}} yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover.</b> The Manchester United board accepted a £623million offer, but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999. A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.|$|E
5|$|Rising {{property}} prices in Surrey in the 1940s and 1950s made the LNC increasingly valuable, but {{also made it}} a target for property speculators. In 1959 a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> succeeded, and LNC's independence came to an end. From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped the profitable parts of the business from the company, leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly derelict cemetery. In 1985 {{what remained of the}} company came into the ownership of Ramadan Güney, who set about reviving what remained. Links were formed with London's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials, and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the derelict sections of the cemetery commenced. Although it was never as successful as planned, the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking, and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the disciplining function of <b>hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> in the U. K. in 1985 and 1986. We report evidence of high board turnover and significant levels of post-takeover restructuring. Large gains are anticipated in hostile bids {{as reflected in}} high bid premiums. However, {{there is little evidence}} of poor performance prior to bids, suggesting that the high board turnover does not derive from past managerial failure. <b>Hostile</b> <b>takeovers</b> do not therefore perform a disciplining function. Instead, rejection of bids appears to derive from opposition to post-takeover redeployment of assets and renegotiation over the terms of bids...|$|R

5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal was more like a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover.</b> They formed the Hands off Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few good years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market capitalisation, the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> bid for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E
