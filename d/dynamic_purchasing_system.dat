The framework contract also covered an optional service to manage leased office equipment (printers, photocopiers and fax machines). During the pre-procurement phase, a number of interviews were carried out with potential suppliers to discuss Energy Star requirements, design for disassembly and noise requirements...|$|E

The majority of care professionals were not aware of the reasons why dynamic lighting systems were installed. Despite positive subjective ratings of the dynamic lighting systems, no data were collected by the organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of the lighting. Although the care professionals stated that they did not see any large positive effects of the dynamic lighting systems on the residents and their own work situation, the majority appreciated the dynamic lighting systems more than the old situation. The light values measured in the care facilities did not exceed the minimum threshold values reported in the literature.
