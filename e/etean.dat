The research deals with entrepreneurs that received loans from National Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development (<b>ETEAN</b> in Greek language). <b>ETEAN</b> provided enterprises with non interest or low interest loans based on state guarantees. The main objective of this research is to examine the project's effectiveness and its contribution into local development on Regional Unity of Serres, Central Macedonia, Greece. The first part {{is divided into}} two sections. A comparative analysis of guarantees to small and medium enterprises (SME’s) is presented in the first part referring to the European Union and in the second part to Greece. Particularly, in the first section of our paper presented data concerning guarantees provided in the EU. At the second section presented data which indicate the role of ETEAN’s programs into the contribution of local development in Greece and the moral hazards due to state provided guarantees. Furthermore, obstacles that entrepreneurs face when they applied for guarantee loans are analyzed in this part. Our data were extracted during the last three years by the extensive use of web links on the internet. Most data were taken from the websites of above mentioned <b>ETEAN,</b> the Pan-European Gateway to Business and Innovation Financing, the Gateway to European Research and Development and B. I. S. At the second part presented the results of our research based on 200 entrepreneurs in Serres who receive loans from <b>ETEAN.</b> The results analyzed with the use of descriptive statistical methods and correlations. It is noticeable that businessmen’s answers are similar to those deduced from the results of the researches that have been referred to in bibliography. In the final part of this paper the main conclusion is pointed out and that is that those programs which provide enterprises low interest or non interest loans support local development...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe role of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's) to {{regional}} development is crucial. Taking as a granted that National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) focuses on regional disparities reduction, the main {{scope of this}} paper is to examine the influence of the NSRF programs on Regional Unity of Serres taking under consideration the existence of great intraregional disparities in region of Central Macedonia. Recently, peripheral disparities undoubtedly deteriorate Greek recession, something that is underlined at the relevant literature. According to Joseph Stiglitz “with inequality at its highest level since before the Depression, a robust recovery will be difficult in the short term” Also, Paul Krugman adds “countries doing a lot of redistribution have, if anything, weathered the crisis better than those that do less”As enterprises confront huge sustainability problems, their investments are deteriorated. Greek state, under the framework of NSRF 2007 - 2013, announced on spring 2013 the program “Support of SME's which are activated in Manufacturing - Tourism - Commerce & Services” (the program will de completed until the end of 2015). The NSRF provide subsidizes using general geographical-economic (mainly income) criteria (at regional level NUTS 2) without examining the NUTS 3 level. It is common knowledge that Greek banks nowadays do not support firms sufficiently. Thus, many of the eligible (under the umbrella of the examining program) investments may not be completed. Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development (<b>ETEAN),</b> the associated institution, does not provide the necessary funds to all the entrepreneurs. During the last 4 years the 20 % of local enterprises have been closed. It is obvious that crisis badly affected local entrepreneurship. According to Serres Chamber of Commerce and Industry the number of enterprises at Regional Unity of Serres have been reduced from 14. 103 (January 2010) to 10. 715 (January 2015). All the above mentioned are analyzed in our theoretical part. Our empirical research was conducted in February 2014. The survey consists of two parts. At the first part, a comparative analysis between the region of Central Macedonia and the Borough of Serres takes place. At the second part, all the local eligible enterprises, that will receive subsidizes from ESPA were participated in this research (total 123 ones). The used methodology is the calculation of the main descriptive statistical measures (the average, the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation) and the statistical moment of distribution (the coefficient correlation). According to our main findings, the contribution of NSRF programs as they are regulated by the developmental national laws to the survival and development of local enterprises has been significant, although the legislator disregarded the fact that borough of Serres is poorer than the core region Thessaloniki. The intraregional disparities (which have been indicated both in the theoretical and in the empirical part) should be taken under consideration when a low is reconsidered. Finally it should point out that the general results of our empirical research are relying to the relevant used literature...|$|E
