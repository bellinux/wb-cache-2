500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the <b>fridge</b> <b>and</b> turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E

Keith wakes up in hospital to find Alicia by his side. Veronica arrives home and tells her mother to leave before Keith comes home; she knows that Lianne is still drinking and did not finish her rehab. Lianne packs her bags and steals the $50,000 settlement check from the Kanes before she leaves. Veronica dreams about her and Lilly floating on a pool raft in a pool full of flowers, and they say their final goodbyes.

2500|$|Crises in band management, {{money and}} band {{leadership}} were creating growing frictions within Badfinger. Molland's wife, Kathie, {{had been taking}} a more assertive role in the band's politics, which did not endear her {{to the rest of}} the band, particularly Ham. She remembered complaining that even though the band had had hit records, they [...] "still didn't have a <b>fridge,</b> <b>and</b> didn't have a TV". However, one of the band's assistants said, [...] "Kathie was a wishful Linda McCartney. [...] If she had her way, she would have ended up part of the band." [...] Just before the start of rehearsals for an October 1974 UK tour, Ham suddenly quit Badfinger during a management meeting, standing up and shouting [...] "I don't want Kathie managing the band! I'm leaving". He found a cottage in Wales, where he hoped to build a studio. He was quickly replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Bob Jackson, who was then idle after previous involvement with The Fortunes. During Ham's three-week hiatus from the band, Polley tried to interest record companies in Ham as a solo act, but under pressure from Warner Brothers, Ham rejoined the band in time for the tour, as the company made it clear that it would have little to no interest in promoting Badfinger if Ham was not a part of it. Jackson remained as full-time keyboardist, making the band a quintet. After the UK tour, Molland quit of his own accord to pursue a solo career in December 1974.|$|E

This model is employed to evaluate the potential variations of power demand of the aggregates of <b>fridges</b> <b>and</b> boilers during one year in the considered scenario. The resulting quantities can be considered as a form of power reserves to be used for contributing to the frequency regulation through a proper demand side response strategy. The particular case of the system for frequency control proposed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) is then analysed by simulations in order to show advantages and drawbacks...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that <b>fridges</b> <b>and</b> freezers do not provide savings through voltage optimisation because they are fitted with a thermostat. <b>Fridges</b> <b>and</b> freezers operate completely differently from resistive heating devices. If a resistive heating device is driven from a higher voltage the result is heat which is helpful in its intended purpose (heating). If a fridge or freezer is driven from a higher voltage the result is also heat however this is not helpful in its intended purpose (cooling). The compressor motor power output is reduced slightly by voltage optimisation so the fridge/freezer thermostat will keep the motor on a little longer however overall the effect is for the motor to run slightly longer at much lower losses. Tests at Manchester university showed a 10 °C reduction in motor temperature under voltage optimisation due to the reduced losses in the motor.|$|R
