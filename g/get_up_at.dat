Asked about her daily routine while at primary school, she replied that [...] "when you are young you <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> eight o'clock". In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have café au lait (coffee with milk) or chocolat (hot chocolate) and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was born}} Walker Smith Jr. in Ailey, Georgia, to Walker Smith Sr. and Leila Hurst. Robinson was the {{youngest}} of three children; his eldest sister Marie was born in 1917 and his other sister Evelyn was born in 1919. His father was a cotton, peanut, and corn farmer in Georgia, who moved the family to Detroit where he initially found work in construction. According to Robinson, Smith Sr. later worked two jobs to support his family—cement mixer and sewer worker. [...] "He had to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> six in the morning and he'd get home close to midnight. Six days a week. The only day I really saw him was Sunday...I always wanted to be with him more." ...|$|E

500|$|The new {{schedule}} {{resulted in}} a conflict for Anthony Quinn, who was signed to play the title role in Attila, a 1954 epic, also produced by De Laurentiis and directed by Pietro Francisci. At first, Quinn considered withdrawing from La Strada, but Fellini convinced him to work on both films simultaneously, shooting La Strada {{in the morning and}} Attila in the afternoon and evening. The plan often required the actor to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 3:30a.m. in order to capture the [...] "bleak early light" [...] on which Fellini insisted, and then leave at 10:30 to drive to Rome in his Zampanò outfit in order to be on the set in time to be transformed into Attila the Hun for afternoon shooting. Quinn recalled: [...] "This schedule accounted for the haggard look I had in both films, a look that was perfect for Zampanò but scarcely OK for Attila the Hun." ...|$|E
500|$|Emperor Shah Jahan {{maintained}} a rigorous schedule during his entire thirty years rule {{and used to}} <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 4 AM and, after ablutions and prayers, religiously appeared at the jharokha window to show himself to his subjects. During his stay in Agra or Delhi, huge crowds used to assemble to receive his darshan below the balcony. He would appear before the public 45 minutes after sunrise. His subjects would bow before him which he would reciprocate with his imperial salute. There was one particular group of people known as darshaniyas (akin to the guilds of Augustales of the Roman Empire) who were [...] "servile" [...] to the king and who would take their food only after they had {{a look at the}} face of the emperor which they considered as auspicious. More than half an hour had to be spent by the King at the balcony as {{it was the only time}} people could submit petitions to the king directly through the chain let down for the purpose (which was drawn up by attendants) of receiving such petitions by passing the nobles of the court. At one time in 1657 when Shah Jahan was sick he could not appear for the Jharokha Darshan which spread speculations of his death.|$|E
500|$|As [...] "Kenny", {{as he was}} {{sometimes}} known, grew, he did an increasing share of the farm work, later stating, [...] "I did my share—and it was a substantial share—in {{taking care of the}} 13acres... I do not remember that I particularly liked to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 3:30 in the morning." [...] Kenesaw began his off-farm career at age ten as a news delivery boy. [...] He left school at 15 after an unsuccessful attempt to master algebra; he then worked at the local general store. He left that job for a position as errand boy with the Vandalia Railroad. Landis applied for a job as a brakeman, but was laughingly dismissed as too small. He then worked for the Logansport Journal, and taught himself shorthand reporting, becoming in 1883 official court reporter for the Cass County Circuit Court. [...] Landis later wrote, [...] "I may not have been much of a judge, nor baseball official, but I do pride myself on having been a real shorthand reporter." [...] He served in that capacity until 1886. In his spare time, he became a prize-winning bicycle racer and played on and managed a baseball team. Offered a professional contract as a ballplayer, he turned it down, stating that he preferred to play for the love of the game.|$|E

500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{five in the morning}} and check into a hotel room, where the staff were {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. [...] She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Lupton stated that this ritual indicated [...] "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to [...] "enchant" [...] herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". [...] She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about Caged Bird: [...] "...Though easily read, [...] is no 'easy read'". Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E
500|$|Entering {{his fourth}} season, Washington knew {{the only thing}} keeping him in the league was his {{guaranteed}} contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when {{in a game against}} Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: [...] "Listen, you better learn how to play this game." [...] The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions {{over the course of his}} long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> that hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Butler's {{mother wanted}} her to become a {{secretary}} with a steady income, Butler continued {{to work at a}} series of temporary jobs, preferring the kind of mindless work that would allow her to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> two or three in the morning to write. [...] Success continued to elude her, as an absence of useful criticism led her to style her stories after the white-and-male-dominated science fiction she had grown up reading. She enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, but then switched to taking writing courses through UCLA Extension.|$|E

2500|$|Herbert Appel – a stock {{boy at the}} {{hardware}} store, his character is distinguished by his odd speech patterns. By putting non-standard emphasis on syllables and sounds, his sentences can be confusing and/or humorous (what would now be considered mondegreen). For example, [...] "I had to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> eight o'clock" [...] is heard by Fibber and Molly as [...] "I {{had to get a}} potato clock", [...] "I got up too early" [...] comes out as [...] "I got up twirly", and his own name sounds like [...] "Herber Tapple" [...] (in [...] "Fibber Puts Up Christmas Lights", 12/20/49).|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, FLOC asked labor {{organizer}} {{and consultant}} Ray Rogers for help.

[...] " [...] 'You had these little nuns <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> stockholders' meetings saying I have one share and you're a dirty so and so,' says John Dunlop, secretary of labor in the Ford administration, {{who was involved in}} the FLOC battle." [...] The company's public image began to suffer. FLOC then targeted three members of Campbell's board of directors for economic pressure. FLOC also picketed Philadelphia National Bank, one of Campbell's major creditors. Shortly thereafter, depositors threatened to pull $500,000 out of the bank.|$|E
2500|$|At {{midnight on}} Saturday 8 February 1879, Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Hart and Byrne {{surrounded}} the Jerilderie police barracks. Constables George Denis Devine and Henry Richards were on duty that night. Hart, {{in a loud}} voice, shouted, [...] "Devine, there's a drunken man at Davidson's Hotel, who has committed murder. <b>Get</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once, all of you." [...] Richards, who was sleeping {{at the rear of}} the premises, came to the front door. Devine opened the door, meeting Kelly who told him there was a great row at Davidson's. Devine approached Kelly, who once he established there were no other policemen, pointed two revolvers at the policemen, introduced the gang, telling the officers to hold up their hands. Immediately the police were pounced upon by the other men and placed in the lock-up cell, and Mrs Devine and children were held hostage in the sitting-room. Afterwards Ned stole all the firearms and ammunition and toured the house with Devine to make certain there were no other policemen. After this, he let her and the children turn in to sleep as usual, and with the rest of the gang went into the sitting room, where they kept watch till morning.|$|E

2500|$|Weston {{was born}} in Alpena, Michigan to Frank and Jane Weston [...] He was raised in Sault Ste. Marie, and was a star player on Sault Ste. Marie High School's 1913 state {{championship}} football team. The Sault Ste. Marie “Blue Devils” were a football powerhouse with Weston. In a 1972 interview with his home town newspaper, Weston recalled the 1913 championship team: “We were an awful bunch of roughnecks – there was no football team in the state tougher than we were that year. We blasted all of them and loved doing it.” Weston was asked about a 1913 newspaper report {{that he had been}} tackled by an irate woman during a 24-7 win over Alpena. He recalled the incident:”The game was played there, and the fans hated us. We were too rough to suit them. I was running around the left end toward the Alpena side of the field. There was nobody near me as I ran the end, and all of a sudden, this woman dives from the sideline and drops me for no gain.
