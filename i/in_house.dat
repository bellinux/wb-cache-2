40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate selected reproductive parametres of sows stabled <b>in</b> farrowing <b>houses</b> with different technologies and losses of piglets from birth to weaning. Each variant involved 40 sows and 40 litters and the aim was to demonstrate the effect of the housing on losses of piglets. One variant (housing A) was modern while the other (housing B) was older. The total number of piglets reached <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A was 13. 18 ± 1. 85 against 13. 03 ± 1. 91 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. The values of live-born piglets reached 11. 50 ± 1. 36 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A against 11. 36 ± 1. 46 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. The number of stillborn piglets found <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A was 1. 68 ± 1. 49 and <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B 1. 65 ± 1. 17. The differences found between the groups in the total number of piglets and the number of live-born and stillborn piglets are not statistically significant. The number of reared piglets was 10. 03 ± 1. 33 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A versus 8. 78 ± 1. 56 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. <b>In</b> group of sows <b>in</b> farrowing <b>house</b> A (housing A) the recorded loss of piglets in pieces was 1. 48 ± 1. 04 against 2. 60 ± 1. 63 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. <b>In</b> percentage the loss of piglets <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A reached 12. 56 ± 8. 50 versus 22. 29 ± 13. 46 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B.

40|$|Equity <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> {{is a major}} {{component}} of household wealth in the United States. Steady gains <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices over the last several decades have generated large potential gains in household wealth among homeowners. Mankiw and Weil (1989) and McFadden (1993 b) have argued that the aging of the US population is likely to induce substantial declines <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices, resulting <b>in</b> capital losses for future elderly generations. However, if households can anticipate changes <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices, and if they adjust their non-housing savings accordingly, then welfare losses in retirement could be mitigated. This paper focuses on two questions: (1) Are housing prices forecastable from current information on demographics and housing prices?; and (2) How are household savings decisions affected by capital gains <b>in</b> <b>housing?</b> We use metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level data on housing prices and demographic trends during the 1980 's and find mixed evidence on the forecastability of housing prices. Further, we use data on five-year savings rates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and find no evidence that households engage in changing their non-housing savings in response to expectations about capital gains <b>in</b> <b>housing.</b> Thus, the projected decline <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices could result in large welfare losses to current homeowners and large intergenerational equity differences. ...|$|R
