40|$|As {{commonly}} used <b>forced</b> <b>convection</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> devices in electronics, cooling fans are crucial for guaranteeing {{the reliability of}} electronic systems. In a cooling fan assembly, fan bearing failure is a major failure mode that causes excessive vibration, noise, reduction in rotation speed, locked rotor, failure to start, and other problems; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} conduct research on the health assessment of cooling fan bearings. This paper presents a vibration-based fan bearing health evaluation method using comblet filtering and exponentially weighted moving average. A new health condition indicator (HCI) for fan bearing degradation assessment is proposed. In order to collect the vibration data for validation of the proposed method, a cooling fan accelerated life test was conducted to simulate the lubricant starvation of fan bearings. A comparison between the proposed method and methods in previous studies (i. e., root mean square, kurtosis, and fault growth parameter) was carried out to assess the performance of the HCI. The analysis results suggest that the HCI can identify incipient fan bearing failures and describe the bearing degradation process. Overall, the work presented in this paper provides a promising method for fan bearing health evaluation and prognosis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>convection</b> <b>cooling</b> of {{plate fin}} heat sinks is {{typically}} {{used as an}} effective means of cooling microelectronic devices because of its inherent simplicity and cost effective-ness. While the increased surface area obtained by placing plate fin heat sinks in close proximity to one another can significantly reduce the boundary resistance because of the added surface area, the added pressure drop associated with a constrained flow can lead to a decrease in inter-fin flow velocity along with a decrease in heat transfer. The ability to accurately predict the distribution of fluid flow between the fins of a heat sink and the fluid flow bypassing the heat sink is critical in the design and effective operation of heat sinks used to cool electronic components.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the Beta Beams is to study oscillation property of pure electrons neutrinos. It produces high energy beams of pure electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos for oscillation experiments by beta decay of He- 6 and Ne- 18 radioactive ion beams, stored in a decay ring at gamma = 100. The production of He- 6 beam has already been accomplished using a thick beryllium oxide target. However, {{the production of the}} needed rate of Ne- 18 has proven to be more challenging. In order to achieve the requested yield for Ne- 18 a new high power target design based on a circulating molten salt loop has been proposed. To verify some elements of the design, a static molten salt target prototype has been developed at ISOLDE and operated successfully. This paper describes the electro-thermal study of the molten salt target taking into account the heat produced by Joule effect, radiative heat exchange, active water cooling due to <b>forced</b> <b>convection</b> and <b>air</b> passive <b>cooling</b> due to natural convection. The numerical results were compared with the available experimental data in order to validate the model. This approach allows one to improve the reliability of the model, which will help to predict the thermo-mechanical impact of the required targets for future facilities such as HIE-ISOLDE and the Beta-Beams.

40|$|Thermal {{characterization}} of electronic cabinets {{is becoming increasingly}} important, due to growing power dissipation and compact packaging. Usually, multiple length scales of interest and modes of heat transfer are simultaneously present. A steady reduced order thermal modeling framework for electronic cabinets was developed to provide an efficient method to model thermal transport across multiple length scales. This methodology takes advantage of compact modeling at the chip or component level and reduced order modeling at subsystem and cabinet levels. Compact models, which were incorporated into system level simulation, were created for components, and reduced order models (ROMs) were developed using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for subsystems and system. An efficient interfacial coupling scheme was developed using the concept of flow network modeling to couple the heat and mass flow rates and pressure at each interface, when interconnecting ROMs together to simulate the entire system. Thermal information was then subsequently extracted from the global modeling and applied to the component model for detailed simulation. A boundary profile-matching scheme for ROM of each subsystem was developed to broaden {{the applicability of the}} multi-scale thermal modeling methodology. The output profiles of the subsystem upstream can be transferred to the input profiles of the subsystems downstream by adding necessary flow straightening ducts during the snapshots generation process. A general method to create dynamic multi-layer compact models for components and modules was developed. These dynamic compact models were incorporated into enclosure level simulation. The dynamic reduced order model for the enclosure was developed using POD. The transient multi-scale thermal modeling approach was illustrated through an electronic enclosure with insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module. The multiscale thermal modeling methodology presented here was validated through experiments conducted on a simulated electronic cabinet and the test vehicle with hybrid cooling technique. The latter incorporated double-sided <b>cooling</b> with hybrid <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>convection,</b> thermoelectric <b>cooling,</b> and micro-channel liquid cooling. The overall multi-scale modeling framework was able to reduced numerical models containing 107 DOF down to around 102, while still retaining an approximation accuracy of around 90 % in prediction of chip junction temperature rises, compared to measurements.

40|$|Due to {{copyright}} restrictions, {{the access}} to {{the full text of}} this article is only available via subscription. Natural <b>convection</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> is the method of choice for many low-power electronics applications due to cost, availability, and reliability considerations. This method is not only limited to low-power applications, but is also constrained by the buoyancy dependence of the flow. Therefore, further enhancement of natural convection is needed. Enhanced natural convection allows higher heat dissipation while maintaining the simplicity of passive cooling. Synthetic jet devices operating on the microfluidics principle provide unique cooling advantages for local cooling with high coefficients of performance. Synthetic jets used in the current study are piezoelectrically driven, small-scale, pulsating devices capable of producing highly turbulent jets formed by periodic entrainment and expulsion of the fluid through an orifice. The compactness of the jet actuator coupled with the high exit air velocities can significantly reduce the size of thermal management systems. In this paper, we present experimental results for impingement heat transfer for both steady and unsteady jets over a Reynolds number range of 100 to 3, 000.
