5|$|Spermaceti, {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the spermaceti organ, and sperm oil, obtained {{primarily from the}} blubber in the body, were much sought after by eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century whalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. Ambergris, a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a <b>fixative</b> in perfumery.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{barbital}} and barbital {{have also}} been used as pH buffers for biological research, e.g., in immunoelectrophoresis or in <b>fixative</b> solutions.|$|E
25|$|Historically, alum {{was used}} {{extensively}} in the wool industry from Classical antiquity, during the Middle Ages, and well into 19th century as a mordant or dye <b>fixative</b> {{in the process of}} turning wool into dyed bolts of cloth.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>fixatives</b> {{are usually}} alcohol based, and {{hydrocarbon}} propelled. Certain manufacturers produce <b>fixatives</b> specified {{for a certain}} media only, such as soft pastel <b>fixatives.</b> Modern <b>fixatives</b> are elevated in quality in terms of transparency, colourlessness, age-resistance and UV resistance, which prevents yellowing and fading caused by exposure to light.|$|R
50|$|Radioactivity or {{radionuclide}} <b>fixatives</b> are specialized polymer coatings used to “fix” radioactive isotopes or {{radioactive material}} to surfaces. These <b>fixatives,</b> {{also known as}} permanent coatings in the radioactive contamination control field, {{have been used for}} many decades in facilities processing radioactive material to control radioactive contamination. There has been increased interest in these <b>fixatives</b> or coatings recently due to the growing concern of contamination from a radioactivity dispersal device (RDD also known as a dirty bomb) and because radioactivity <b>fixatives</b> in use today lose the ability to contain the radioactivity to the surface during a fire.|$|R
40|$|Wood pitch {{deposition}} {{onto the}} surface of papermaking machinery continues to be a costly problem. <b>Fixatives</b> - substances said to attach wood resin to wood fibre - have been used to alleviate wood pitch deposition to varying degrees of success. This paper aims to evaluate to what degree <b>fixatives</b> alter the colloidal wood pitch particle size. We were able to show how different wood resin <b>fixatives</b> alter the colloidal wood pitch particle size at three different pH values (4. 75, 6. 85 and 8. 06). The <b>fixatives</b> can be divided into two categories, colloid disrupting and colloid stabilising, according to how they change pitch particle size...|$|R
25|$|In dyeing with fiber-reactive dyes, sodium {{carbonate}} (often under a name such as soda ash <b>fixative</b> or soda ash activator) {{is used to}} ensure proper chemical bonding of the dye with cellulose (plant) fibers, typically before dyeing (for tie dyes), mixed with the dye (for dye painting), or after dyeing (for immersion dyeing).|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Painting (1946) sold to Alfred Barr for the Museum of Modern Art in New York for £240. Bacon {{wrote to}} Sutherland asking that he apply <b>fixative</b> to the patches of pastel on Painting (1946) {{before it was}} shipped to New York. Painting (1946) is now too fragile to be moved from MoMA for {{exhibition}} elsewhere. At least one visit to Paris in 1946 brought Bacon into more immediate contact with French postwar painting and Left Bank ideas such as Existentialism. He had, by this time, embarked on his lifelong friendship with Isabel Rawsthorne, a painter closely involved with Giacometti and the Left Bank set. They shared many interests including ethnography and classical literature.|$|E
25|$|The North York Moors is {{the only}} source for British jet. It has been mined in the area from prehistoric times but the {{industry}} grew {{in the middle of}} the 19th century in response to a fashion for the jewellery produced from it. In the 1880s cheap imports produced a decline in the industry which was focused on Whitby. The remains of alum quarries are to be found to the north of the area and along the coast. Alum was important to the textile industry because it was used as a mordant or <b>fixative</b> for dyes that were used to colour cloth. The industry thrived in the region from the early 17th century until 1871. Its decline came when chemical dyes were discovered. The scars of industrial activity on the moors make it an interesting area in which to pursue industrial archaeology.|$|E
50|$|The {{oxidizing}} <b>fixatives</b> {{can react}} with various side chains of proteins and other biomolecules, allowing formation of crosslinks that stabilize tissue structure. However they cause extensive denaturation despite preserving fine cell structure {{and are used}} mainly as secondary <b>fixatives.</b>|$|R
50|$|Radioactivity <b>fixatives</b> {{reduce or}} {{eliminate}} the movement of radionuclides from surfaces thereby lowering the health risk of inhalation or other exposure to radioactive isotopes. There are many articles {{on the use of}} radioactive <b>fixatives</b> with a review article from 1983 often used as a reference. A more recent review article looks at the use of these radioactive <b>fixatives</b> for use after the detonation of a RDD. Current research is investigating new coatings that are effective at containing radioactive material to the surface during and after fires.|$|R
50|$|Resinoids {{are mainly}} used as perfume <b>fixatives.</b>|$|R
25|$|Glutaraldehyde and {{formaldehyde}} solutions (also used as fixatives) {{are accepted}} liquid sterilizing agents, {{provided that the}} immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid {{can take up to}} 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the <b>fixative</b> to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's <b>fixative</b> (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E
500|$|Spermaceti oil (called [...] "sperm" [...] for short), {{from which}} the whale derives its name, was a prime target of the whaling industry, and was {{dominant}} for use in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles. Ambergris is a solid waxy waste product from its digestive system. It is still highly valued as a <b>fixative</b> in perfumes and other uses. It remains as flotsam from deceased whales, and is sought by beachcombers. The species is now protected by a whaling moratorium, and is currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|Natural <b>fixatives</b> are {{resinoids}} (benzoin, labdanum, myrrh, olibanum, storax, tolu balsam) {{and animal}} products (ambergris, castoreum, musk, and civet). Synthetic <b>fixatives</b> include substances of low volatility (diphenylmethane, cyclopentadecanolide, ambroxide, benzyl salicylate) and virtually odorless solvents with very low vapor pressures (benzyl benzoate, diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate).|$|R
50|$|Precipitating (or denaturing) <b>fixatives</b> act by {{reducing}} the solubility of protein molecules and (often) by disrupting the hydrophobic interactions that give many proteins their tertiary structure. The precipitation and aggregation of proteins {{is a very different}} process from the crosslinking that occurs with the aldehyde <b>fixatives.</b>|$|R

500|$|Whaling {{by humans}} has existed since the Stone Age. Ancient whalers used {{harpoons}} to spear the [...] bigger animals from boats out at sea. People from Norway and Japan started hunting whales around 2000 B.C. Whales are typically hunted for their meat and blubber by aboriginal groups; they used baleen for baskets or roofing, and made tools and masks out of bones. The Inuit hunted whales in the Arctic Ocean. The Basques started whaling {{as early as}} the 11th century, sailing as far as Newfoundland in the 16th century in search of right whales. 18th- and 19th-century whalers hunted whales mainly for their oil, which was used as lamp fuel and a lubricant, baleen or whalebone, which was used for items such as corsets and skirt hoops, and ambergris, which was used as a <b>fixative</b> for perfumes. The most successful whaling nations at this time were the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States.|$|E
500|$|Ruthenium can be {{oxidized}} to ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2, {{oxidation state}} +4) which can in turn be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to the volatile yellow tetrahedral ruthenium tetroxide, RuO4, an aggressive, strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to osmium tetroxide. Like osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide {{is a potent}} <b>fixative</b> and stain for electron microscopy of organic materials, and is mostly used to reveal the structure of polymer samples. [...] Dipotassium ruthenate (K2RuO4, +6), and potassium perruthenate (KRuO4, +7) are also known. Unlike osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide is less stable and is strong enough as an oxidising agent to oxidise dilute hydrochloric acid and organic solvents like ethanol at room temperature, and is easily reduced to ruthenate (...) in aqueous alkaline solutions; it decomposes to form the dioxide above 100°C. Unlike iron but like osmium, ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower +2 and +3 oxidation states. Ruthenium forms dichalcogenides only when reacted directly with the chalcogens, which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the pyrite structure and thus must contain ruthenium(II).|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{standard}} <b>fixatives</b> (10 % neutral buffered formalin, ethanol and mercury based) on {{the detection of}} Mycobacterium leprae DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were studied. Mercury-based <b>fixatives</b> (Zenker's and Carnoy-Lebrun's fluids) strongly inhibited PCR amplification of M. leprae DNA. Ten percent neutral buffered formalin was inhibitory, but significant inhibition was observed only when fixation times exceeded 24 h. Ethanol-based <b>fixatives</b> provided the best medium for holding specimens for subsequent PCR with both free bacilli and skin biopsy specimens containing M. leprae. The M. leprae-specific, 360 -bp region of the 18 -kDa protein gene could be amplified from paraffin-embedded sections of formalin-fixed skin biopsy specimens from patients with either multibacillary or paucibacillary infections when proper fixation conditions were used. Results of the study demonstrate that tissues properly fixed with two standard <b>fixatives</b> (10 % neutral buffered formalin and 50 or 70 % ethanol) can be analyzed by PCR {{for the presence of}} M. leprae with no loss in specificity and only minimal diminution in sensitivity compared with the specificities and sensitivities obtained by use of freshly prepared, unfixed specimens...|$|R
25|$|Fixatives: Used {{to support}} the primary scent by bolstering it. Many resins, wood scents, and amber bases are used as <b>fixatives.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Because the aqueous dye {{solutions}} were unstable, methanol {{was introduced}} as a solvent, and William Boog Leishman [...] and James Homer Wright advocated its {{use as a}} <b>fixative</b> prior to staining. Gustav Giemsa improved this technique by standardizing the dye solutions and adding glycerol to increase stability.|$|E
2500|$|Histopathology {{refers to}} the {{microscopic}} examination of various forms of human tissue. [...] Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology {{refers to the}} examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. [...] This contrasts with the methods of cytopathology, which uses free cells or tissue fragments. [...] Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. [...] The tissue {{is removed from the}} body of an organism and then placed in a <b>fixative</b> that stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common <b>fixative</b> is formalin, although frozen section fixing is also common. [...] To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast. [...] Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. [...] The histological slides are then interpreted diagnostically and the resulting pathology report describes the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. [...] In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church and the Methodist Church {{say that}} the ashes should be those of palm {{branches}} blessed at the previous years Palm Sunday service, while a Church of England publication says they [...] "may be made" [...] from the burnt palm crosses of the previous year. These sources do not speak of adding anything to the ashes other than, for the Catholic liturgy, a sprinkling with holy water when blessing them. An Anglican website speaks of mixing the ashes {{with a small amount}} of holy water or olive oil as a <b>fixative.</b>|$|E

50|$|Crosslinking <b>fixatives</b> act by {{creating}} covalent chemical bonds between proteins in tissue. This anchors soluble proteins to the cytoskeleton, and lends additional rigidity to the tissue.|$|R
2500|$|Fixation {{is usually}} {{performed}} by incubation {{in a solution}} of a buffered chemical <b>fixative,</b> such as glutaraldehyde, sometimes in combination with formaldehyde and other fixatives, and optionally followed by postfixation with osmium tetroxide. The fixed tissue is then dehydrated. Because air-drying causes collapse and shrinkage, this is commonly achieved by replacement {{of water in the}} cells with organic solvents such as ethanol or acetone, and replacement of these solvents in turn with a transitional fluid such as liquid carbon dioxide by critical point drying. The carbon dioxide is finally removed while in a supercritical state, so that no gas–liquid interface is present within the sample during drying.|$|E
2500|$|Formaldehyde {{solutions}} {{are used as}} a <b>fixative</b> for microscopy and histology because of formaldehyde's ability to perform the Mannich reaction, although the percentage formaldehyde used may vary based on the method of analysis. Additionally, the methanol used to stabilize formaldehyde may interfere {{with the ability to}} properly fix tissue or cells, and therefore commercial formaldehyde preparations are available that are packaged in glass ampules under an inert gas to prevent the use of contaminating methanol for stabilization. Formaldehyde-based {{solutions are}} also used in embalming to disinfect and temporarily preserve human and animal remains. It is the ability of formaldehyde to fix the tissue that produces the tell-tale firmness of flesh in an embalmed body. In post mortem examinations a procedure known as the [...] "sink test" [...] involves placing the lungs of an animal in an aqueous solution of formaldehyde; if the lungs float it suggests the animal was probably breathing or able to breathe at the time of death.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{chemical}} reactions of the dyes with various <b>fixatives</b> in vitro the author observed the blood cells stained supravitally by various dyes and fixed with several <b>fixatives,</b> which has been proved to form the water insoluble precipitates with the dyes. Many known <b>fixatives</b> containing mercury prove {{to have the ability to}} fix the dyes used in supravital staining of cells. but the cell structure becomes often indistinct with some insoluble side precipitates which are not easy to be removed without losing some of the fixed dyes and the dye showed the tendency to fade relatively in a short period of time. In the case of the <b>fixatives</b> containing picric acid the results ware almost the same and yet the supravitally stainel granules changed the original color to rather yellowish ones. Whereas the method established by the author, the application of the Nessler's method, proved to be the most excellent one. By this method most of the supravitally stained granules are fixed on the cells retaining their fine structure. The poet-staining of the nucleus can be made by hematoxylin. And yet the dyes can be retained for a fairly long period of 2 - 3 months, without losing or changing their original colors...|$|R
50|$|Fixation-which may itself {{consist of}} several steps-aims to {{preserve}} {{the shape of the}} cells or tissue involved as much as possible. Sometimes heat fixation is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical <b>fixatives</b> (chemicals causing fixation) generate chemical bonds between proteins and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity. Common <b>fixatives</b> include formaldehyde, ethanol, methanol, and/or picric acid. Pieces of tissue may be embedded in paraffin wax to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.|$|R
