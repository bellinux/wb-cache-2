30|$|In this example, {{if we want}} to {{find the}} most similar {{document}} to d 1, the number of present terms alone cannot help, because <b>d</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 both have 4 terms in common with d 1. Using Manhattan distance, the distance between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 is 12 <b>and</b> the distance between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 is 3. If we use Cosine similarity, the similarity between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 2 is 0.9569 <b>and</b> the similarity between <b>d</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>d</b> 3 is 0.989. Accordingly, in this example, both Manhattan distance and Cosine similarity accurately recognize the most similar document to d 1. Therefore, it is possible that two documents use same term set but have different contents, because the associated terms have different weights. In such cases, most of the similarity measures can accurately judge the similarity between documents.|$|R
