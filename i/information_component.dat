50|$|A Markman {{hearing is}} {{a process in which}} the court {{translates}} the complicated words of a patent claim into plain English in order to clarify the facts upon which infringement and invalidity analysis hinge. Since BT had reduced the number of asserted claims in the Sargent patent from seven to five on June 22, 2001, and then from five to four on January 18, 2002, the court conducted the Markman hearing based only on claims 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the Sargent patent. The court ruled that central computer means a central computer fixed in one location in which every available piece of information accessible to users at a remote terminal is stored. Additionally, the meaning of the term blocks of information was clarified. The court ruled that each block was required to contain a first portion and a second portion which are stored together, stored next to one another in memory, and can be separated from one another. The first portion includes <b>information</b> <b>component</b> that is intended for display, while the second portion contains the complete address for each of the other blocks of information referenced in the first portion and other information to influence the display or reduce the complexity of communication. Lastly, the court concluded that a complete address in the Sargent patent is a physical (i.e.: in memory), non-virtual address from which requested blocks of information are called without reference to other information.|$|E

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. The {{conventional}} diffraction limit {{defines a}} finite range of spatial frequencies {{that can be}} transmitted through a microscope. To reveal {{more information about the}} objects that are observed by microscope, techniques that can go beyond this limit need to be developed. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM), one such method, uses patterns of excitation light to encode otherwise unobservable information into the observed image. Although the method has been well developed, the procedure of this technique is complicated. During the procedure, after encoding the unobservable information into the observed image, the superresolution <b>information</b> <b>components</b> need to be separated, shifted, and reassembled. These procedures have never been clearly explained. In this project, a computer algorithm of the linear structured illumination microscopy technique is developed. To implement this algorithm, multiple images of an object are taken with different phases and orientations of sinusoidally patterned illumination. Superresolution <b>information</b> <b>components</b> then can be extracted from these images. The procedures of separation, shifting, and reassembly of the superresolution <b>information</b> <b>components</b> are presented, explained, and verified. A block diagram of the whole procedure of the structured illumination method is presented. The results of the conventional microscope and the structured illumination algorithm are generated and compared. When applied to test objects, the performance of the algorithm is found to be in agreement with theoretical predictions, thus verifying the theory and the implementation algorithm. The block diagram of the whole procedure of the structured illumination and the explanation of the procedures of separation, shifting, and reassembly of the superresolution <b>information</b> <b>components</b> can be taken as the instructions of how to implement this method. This project report is intended to serve as a useful reference for researchers to understand this method. Electrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|R

30|$|Periodically, {{the network}} {{monitoring}} <b>information</b> <b>component</b> processes the collected statistics. This component {{is responsible for}} extracting useful information about the networking context such as the network load or mobility. Based on the simulation studies or analytical models, the mode <b>information</b> <b>component</b> must have knowledge under which network conditions each of the available modes their performance is optimal. This information, together with the {{information provided by the}} network monitoring <b>information</b> <b>component,</b> is used by the switch mode component {{to decide whether or not}} the node should switch to a more efficient mode of operation. If the node has to switch to another mode of operation, the routing protocol is informed. As such, the monitoring agent provides both control (exchange/collection of statistics) and management functionality (determining and setting the mode). Further, every node in the network will determine its most optimal mode at a given moment according to the network conditions. As we require the different modes in the network to be compatible (which will be explained later in more detail) with each other, different modes can be active in different parts of the network and nodes can independently decide to switch to another mode (although often neighboring nodes will experience more or less the same network conditions).|$|E

Benchmarking is a well-known system that uses a given standard to improve the efficiency of individual processes. Using historical data from recent construction projects, information process cycles were analyzed to develop a benchmark for a single information flow: the construction submittal process. This benchmark can be used to measure and improve the processing speed of a construction submittal package. More importantly, when benchmarking is applied to other critical information flows, this system can be used to improve the efficiency of the construction communication process...|$|R
