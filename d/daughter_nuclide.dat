5000|$|Since the {{half-life}} of {{the parent}} nuclide (99Mo) is much longer {{than that of the}} <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclide</b> (99mTc), 50% of equilibrium activity is reached within one daughter half-life, 75% within two daughter half-lives.

25|$|Radioactive decay {{may lead}} to radiogenic <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides.</b> The nuclear decay of many {{long-lived}} primordial isotopes, especially uranium-235, uranium-238, and thorium-232 produce many intermediate <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides,</b> before they too finally decay to isotopes of lead. The Earth's natural supply of elements like radon and polonium is via this mechanism. The atmosphere's supply of argon-40 is due mostly to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the time since {{the formation of the}} Earth. Little of the atmospheric argon is primordial. Helium-4 is produced by alpha-decay, and the helium trapped in Earth's crust is also mostly non-primordial. In other types of radioactive decay, such as cluster decay, larger species of nuclei are ejected (for example, neon-20), and these eventually become newly formed stable atoms.|$|R
40|$|Alpha-emitting {{radionuclides}} like actinium- 225 (225 Ac) {{are ideal}} {{candidates for the}} treatment of small metastasised tumours, where the long half-life of 225 Ac enables it to also reach less accessible tumours. The main challenge lies in retaining the recoiled alpha-emitting <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides,</b> which are decoupled from targeting agents upon emission of an alpha particle and can subsequently cause unwanted toxicity to healthy tissue. Polymersomes, vesicles composed of amphiphilic block copolymers, are capable of transporting (radio) pharmaceuticals to tumours, and are ideal candidates for the retention of these <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides.</b> In this study, the Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulation package was used to simulate ideal vesicle designs. Vesicles containing an InPO 4 nanoparticle in the core were found to have the highest recoil retention, and were subsequently synthesized in the lab. The recoil retention of two of the <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides,</b> namely francium- 221 (221 Fr) and bismuth- 213 (213 Bi) was determined at different vesicle sizes. Recoil retention was found to have improved significantly as compared to earlier published results by Wang et al. where 225 Ac was encapsulated using a hydrophilic chelate. To better understand the different parameters influencing daughter retention, simulation data was expanded to include vesicle polydispersity and nanoparticle position within the polymersome. The high retention of the recoiling daughters and the 225 Ac itself makes this vesicle design very suitable for future in vivo verification. JRC. G. I. 5 -Advanced Nuclear Knowledg...|$|R

50|$|The {{decay energy}} is the energy {{released}} by a radioactive decay.

To reduce the effects of 222 Rn and its <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides,</b> each vial kept in the changer section of the liquid scintillation counter was covered with a “cap”.

50|$|When {{particles}} {{are subject to}} radioactive decay, Decay correction {{may be used to}} compute the decay rate or number of particles at a point in time relative to when they were measured.

50|$|The {{decaying}} nucleus {{is called}} the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope), and the process produces at least one <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclide.</b> Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons (or both).

30|$|Promising {{clinical}} results using 223 Ra and 225 Ac in targeted {{radionuclide therapy}} justify all {{the efforts to}} develop in vivo α-particle nanogenerators and to enable a wider application of 230 U, 225 Ac, 224 Ra and 223 Ra. The random walk model for recoiling <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides</b> in α-particle cascades provides an estimate for {{the size of an}} idealised spherical nanoparticle assuming that the radionuclide is localized in a very small core nanoparticle surrounded by a concentric shell structure that confines the recoiling α-emitting daughter radionuclides. Nanoparticle agglomeration is a main obstacle for the experimental verification of the model as well as for efficient tumour targeting. However, when optimising nanoparticles for targeted therapy their size is only one parameter that needs to be considered together with the ease of surface functionalisation, the time required for accumulation in tumour tissue, and the interaction with tumour cells. Fast tumour accumulation and rapid internalisation of the carrier by tumour cells may justify the use of smaller nanocarriers compromising the retention of <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides</b> in the α-particle emission cascade. The presented random walk model could be used to estimate how much non-targeted α-particle activity may be expected when reducing nanoparticle size.|$|R
50|$|The Center for Human Radiobiology was {{established}} at Argonne National Laboratory in 1968. The {{primary purpose of}} the Center was providing medical examinations for living dial painters. The project also focused on collection of information and, in some cases, tissue samples from the radium dial painters. When the project ended in 1993, detailed information of 2,403 cases had been collected. This led to a book on the effects of radium on humans. The book suggests that radium-228 exposure is more harmful to health than exposure to radium-226. Radium-228 is more able to cause cancer of the bone as the shorter half life of the radon-220 product compared to radon-222 causes the <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides</b> of radium-228 to deliver a greater dose of alpha radiation to the bones. It also considers the induction of a range of different forms of cancer as a result of internal exposure to radium and its <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides.</b> The book used data from both radium dial painters, people who were exposed {{as a result of the}} use of radium-containing medical products and other groups of people who have been exposed to radium.|$|R
30|$|The {{random walk}} model {{presented}} here estimates {{the retention of}} <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides</b> in spherical nanoparticles and the fraction of α-particles emitted from inside the nanoparticle {{as a function of}} its size. The experimental verification of this model requires the availability of stable, non-aggregated, colloidal nanoparticle suspensions. In any case, for medical applications agglomeration problems need to be solved, since excessive size seriously compromises the biodistribution and the targeting capabilities of the constructs, and aggregation of colloidal nanoparticles in physiological conditions may yield adverse outcomes.|$|R
50|$|Isochron dating is {{a common}} {{technique}} of radiometric dating and is applied to date certain events, such as crystallization, metamorphism, shock events, and differentiation of precursor melts, {{in the history of}} rocks. Isochron dating can be further separated into mineral isochron dating and whole rock isochron dating; both techniques are applied frequently to date terrestrial and also extraterrestrial rocks (meteorites). The advantage of isochron dating as compared to simple radiometric dating techniques is that no assumptions are needed about the initial amount of the <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclide</b> in the radioactive decay sequence. Indeed, the initial amount of the daughter product can be determined using isochron dating. This technique can be applied if the daughter element has at least one stable isotope other than the daughter isotope into which the parent nuclide decays.|$|E
50|$|The {{detailed}} decay {{mechanism to}} form the stable <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclide</b> tellurium-125 is a multi-step process that begins with electron capture. This {{is followed by a}} cascade of electron relaxation as the core electron hole moves toward the valence orbitals. The cascade involves many Auger transitions, each of which cause the atom to become increasingly ionized. The electron capture produces a tellurium-125 nucleus in an excited state with a half-life of 1.6 ns, which undergoes gamma decay emitting a photon or an internal conversion electron at 35.5 keV. A second electron relaxation cascade follows the gamma decay before the nuclide comes to rest. Throughout the entire process an average of 13.3 electrons are emitted (10.3 of which are Auger electrons), most with energies less than 400 eV (79% of yield). The internal conversion and Auger electrons from the radioisotope have been found in one study to do little cellular damage, unless the radionuclide is incorporated chemically directly into cellular DNA, which is not the case for present radiopharmaceuticals which use I-125 as the radioactive label nuclide.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the moment}} in time at which a {{particular}} nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a radioactive nuclide decays exponentially at a rate described by a parameter known as the half-life, usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, {{one half of the}} atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a [...] "daughter" [...] nuclide or decay product. In many cases, the <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclide</b> itself is radioactive, resulting in a decay chain, eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the radioactive nuclide into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., tritium) to over 100 billion years (e.g., samarium-147).|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{disadvantages}} of whole-body counting {{are that it}} can only be used for gamma emitters, except in special circumstances, and it can misinterpret external contamination as an internal contamination. On its own, it may be unable to distinguish between radioisotopes that have similar gamma energies. Alpha and beta radiation is largely shielded by the body and will not be detected externally, but the coincident gamma from alpha decay may be detected, as well as radiation from the parent or <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{second group}} of {{radionuclides}} that exist naturally consists of radiogenic nuclides such as [...] (t1/2 = [...] ), an isotope of radium, which are formed by radioactive decay. They occur in the decay chains of primordial isotopes of uranium or thorium. Some of these nuclides are very short-lived, such as isotopes of francium. There exist about 51 of these <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides</b> that have half-lives too short to be primordial, and which exist in nature solely due to decay from longer lived radioactive primordial nuclides.|$|R
40|$|In {{the search}} for dark matter, {{detectors}} have been built {{over the last years}} which use liquid xenon as a detection medium. For them, 222 Rn and its <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides</b> pose a dangerous background source, as they can cause signals which look like those expected from dark matter particles. Consequently, it is important to understand, how 222 Rn decay chain signals can be identified. As a result, this thesis is dedicated to looking for such signals in two detectors. One of them is the XENON 100 detector, which belongs to the leading dark matter direct detection experiments. 222 Rn decay chain event rates are used here for quantifying the effectiveness of using distillation techniques to separate radon from xenon. The other detector is called HeidelbergXenon (HeXe), and has been recently built at the Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik in order to study the decays of 222 Rn and its <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclides</b> in liquid xenon. To achieve this task, a data processor is developed and tested over the course of this thesis. Also, the electronics equipment as well as the photosensors used for measuring with HeXe are characterized. Finally, HeXe data, taken with radon-enriched xenon, is analyzed to look for 222 Rn decay chain events...|$|R
