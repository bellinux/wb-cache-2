5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds <b>for</b> <b>optimism</b> leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage. England's morale was also surging {{following}} good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were expected to do well in One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to management on 8 October 2001 with Wrexham on a two-year contract, replacing Brian Flynn who had resigned after 12 years in charge, {{with the club}} 23rd in the Second Division. He was tasked with keeping the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided {{to cut back on}} the club's youth coaching spending, and as a result Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause <b>for</b> <b>optimism</b> at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason <b>for</b> <b>optimism</b> as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E

25|$|In 1862, {{the best}} of Naylor’s two-year-olds was {{reckoned}} to be a colt named Carnival, while Macaroni was very backward and slow to mature.

25|$|After the {{lock-out}} concluded, Lemieux {{returned to}} the ice for the 2005–06 season.

25|$|Brentford {{returned}} to the Football League South for the 1942–43 season with cause <b>for</b> <b>optimism,</b> having generated over £20,000 from the semi-finals and {{the final of the}} club's victorious 1941–42 London War Cup campaign. Again the first team squad would be hit by a lack of unavailability of players, with no goalkeeper available for the second season in succession. Despite averaging only 12 appearances per season since the war began, centre forward Len Townsend had been averaging nearly a goal a game and was in fantastic form, scoring 17 goals in a 17 match spell, including six in a in a 9–4 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on 12 September 1942. The record of six goals in a single match bettered the official club record of five, but due to the unofficial nature of wartime football, Townsend does not hold the club record outright.|$|E
25|$|Despite his reverses on May 10, Grant {{had reason}} <b>for</b> <b>optimism</b> {{because of the}} partial success of Upton's {{innovative}} assault. He planned {{to use the same}} tactics with Hancock's entire corps. On the Confederate side, Lee received some intelligence reports that made him believe Grant was planning to withdraw toward Fredericksburg. If this happened, he wanted to follow up with an immediate attack. Concerned about the mobility of his artillery to support the potential attack, he ordered that the guns be withdrawn from Allegheny Johnson's division in the Mule Shoe to be ready for a movement to the right. He was completely unaware, of course, that this was exactly the place Grant intended to attack. Johnson requested to Ewell that his artillery be returned, but somehow the order did not reach the artillery units until 3:30a.m. on May 12, 30 minutes before Hancock's assault was planned to start.|$|E

In Study 2, both environmental activists and nonactivists displayed comparative <b>optimism</b> <b>for</b> a list of 22 environmental risks. However, comparative optimism was not associated with self-reported pro-environmental behaviour.

Furthermore, when controlling for group membership, the effect of absolute risk disappeared. These findings are used to address ways in which pro-environmental behaviour might be encouraged...|$|R
25|$|The {{creation}} of Fliegerführer Atlantik gave Dönitz cause <b>for</b> <b>optimism.</b> It {{was not always}} easy, communicating and coordinating with air and sea forces. U-Boats were unable to make accurate navigation using sun or star sightings and even when convoys were located they had trouble homing in bombers because their short-range transmitters were too weak to reach the aircraft. However, they were strong enough to alter British defences. Harlinghausen was irritated when his aircraft communicated accurate locations and the U-Boats failed to respond. Only when he complained to the BdU did he learn from Donitz that the navy failed to inform the Luftwaffe {{that there were no}} U-Boats in the area to respond. There were errors in reports pertaining to location and course of convoys. By the end of March, 1941, attempts at close cooperation were abandoned in favour of more flexible approached. Dönitz noted in his war diary that enemy signals about German air attacks would allow his intelligence (B-Dienst) to locate the convoy. He supposed that this would offer a better chance of interception.|$|E
25|$|It was the 2007–08 {{season that}} Everton {{displayed}} the most consistency and stability since Moyes {{arrived at the}} club, finally ending the cycle of alternating between {{the top and bottom}} halves of the league. In his sixth full season in charge, Moyes secured fifth place in the league and reached the semi-final of the Football League Cup as well as the last 16 of the UEFA Cup, eventually being beaten on penalties by Fiorentina. Moyes also signed four more players who went on to become very important players for Everton: Yakubu Aiyegbeni was signed for another record fee of £11.25million, Steven Pienaar for £2.05million after an initial loan, Phil Jagielka was brought in for £4million, and Leighton Baines was signed for a fee that could rise to £6million. All of this gave Everton and its fans cause <b>for</b> <b>optimism</b> as a string of strong performances broke the pattern inconsistency which saw league finishes of 15th, 7th, 17th, 4th and 11th under Moyes. His reputation as a disciplinarian could be seen to manifest in Everton's yellow card count. They received just 27 yellow cards all season – the lowest in the league and six fewer than their nearest rival Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan {{never had}} a settled team {{and there were a}} number of new arrivals at the end of the season {{including}} Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds <b>for</b> <b>optimism</b> which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the morning}} {{session of the}} {{previous}} day, England initially gave themselves some grounds <b>for</b> <b>optimism.</b> The wicket of Symonds fell early and only Warne provided any resistance as the tail was cleaned up, with Australia all out for 419 (a lead of 260). The originally bowler-friendly pitch appeared to have flattened out considerably, and the total did not appear as imposing {{as it might have}} otherwise been. Unfortunately for England the four Australia bowlers gave no quarter, and England went from 0/41 to 3/49 as the pacemen ripped through the top order. The pressure did not relent, and ultimately England succumbed midway through the final session to be all out for a mere 161 runs. The victory margin was an innings and 99 runs, giving Ponting his first innings victory in an Ashes test match, in what was clearly England's poorest performance of the series thus far. Brett Lee took his best wicket haul of the series with 4/87. Shane Warne was named Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 5/39 and 2/46, and his resilient 40* with the bat. Warne's dismissal of Harmison was also his 999th International wicket (combining Test and ODI wickets), leaving him one shy of becoming only the second player in history to reach the 1000th International wicket milestone (after Muttiah Muralitharan).|$|E
25|$|The club, however, {{embarked}} on a strong FA Cup run, albeit with two replays. They surpassed Leicester City 4–2, Notts County 5–0, Aston Villa 3–0 and Reading 1–0 – all at home – and consequently made it to an FA Cup semi-final, where they were drawn against rivals Manchester United. It {{was the first time}} both teams had met at Wembley, new or old, and the second time they had met in the FA Cup semi-final, with City beating United 3–0 in 1926. Over 86,000 packed Wembley to watch the match with a further 9.5 million watching on TV – nearly half the viewing audience at the time – during the last 15 minutes of the game. United controlled the first 30 minutes with striker Dimitar Berbatov having a one-on-one shot with City goalkeeper Joe Hart saved and seconds later missed from only a few yards out having spooned his shot over the bar, while Nemanja Vidić headed wide from a pinpoint corner. From the 30th minute, however, City started to come into the game, with a fierce shot from Mario Balotelli saved, a Vincent Kompany shot narrowly missing the target and Joleon Lescott wastefully volleying over from a corner having been in space; City went into the half-time interval with cause <b>for</b> <b>optimism.</b> Roared on by their supporters, City continued the momentum they had generated before the break, with the breakthrough coming in the 52nd minute after Yaya Touré caught central midfielder Michael Carrick unaware, pouncing on a sluggish pass, sliding the ball past Vidić and then through goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar's legs to make the score 1–0. From then on, City had found confidence, controlling the game with some new-found aplomb, limiting United to one opportunity which provoked a strong save from a deflected Nani free-kick. Paul Scholes was later sent off in the 72nd minute after his studs speared into Pablo Zabaleta's right thigh, and the match ultimately finished in a 1–0 City victory, ensuring progression to the FA Cup final. On 10 May, Champions League qualification was secured with a 1–0 win over Tottenham, in which an own goal from Peter Crouch secured the win. A 1–0 win over Stoke on 14 May 2011 secured their fifth FA Cup. The result gave City their first major trophy in 35 years, with Mancini dedicating the victory to the long-suffering supporters and urged his team to use the win to provide impetus for achieving greater success.|$|E
