In order to enhance this environmental remediation chemistry, ultrafine zinc particles and transition metal additives (coatings) have been employed. Indeed, activated zinc (cryozinc) significantly enhanced the reduction/dehalogenation process, {{especially in the}} presence of nickel and palladium coatings. These reagents were able to achieve rapid, deep reductive dehalogenation of trichloroethylene, trichloroethane, and <b>dichloroethylenes</b> at room temperature under neutral pH conditions.

40|$|Toluene-induced {{cells of}} Pseudomonas putida F 1 removed {{trichloroethylene}} from growth media at {{a significantly greater}} initial rate than the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b. With toluene-induced P. putida F 1, the initial degradation rate varied linearly with trichloroethylene concentration over the range of 8 to 80 microM (1. 05 to 10. 5 ppm). At 80 microM (10. 5 ppm) trichloroethylene and 30 degrees C, the initial rate was 1. 8 nmol/min per mg of total cell protein, but the rate decreased rapidly with time. A series of mutant strains derived from P. putida F 1 that are defective in the todC gene, which encodes the oxygenase component of toluene dioxygenase, failed to degrade trichloroethylene and to oxidize indole to indigo. A spontaneous revertant selected from a todC culture regained simultaneously the abilities to oxidize toluene, to form indigo, and to degrade trichloroethylene.

Basis sets {{up to the}} aug-cc-pVTZ of Dunning, Jr., augmented with appropriate Rydberg functions {{were used for the}} calculations. The results derived in the present study show good agreement with the available experimental values. In all cases, the main bright excitation was the * transition. The other vertical excitations, *, n*, and n*, which have not been studied before, were also investigated. First Rydberg series involving transitions from the orbitals to one 3 s, three 3 p, and five 3 d orbitals were identified clearly. Several new assignments and reassignments of features in the experimental spectra were suggested. Contrary to earlier prediction, two n-* states, along with a -* state in the <b>dichloroethylenes,</b> were calculated to be located above the main -* state. Accordingly, crossing between both the n-* states with the bright -* state is highly likely, unlike conclusions made in the earlier studies. This indicates that the photodissociation mechanism proposed by the earlier calculations warrants revision. Several low-lying triplet excited states were also studied. Electronic spectra of trans- 1 -chloro- 2 -fluoroethylene and cis- 1 -chloro- 2 -fluoroethylene were also calculated.

40|$|Abstract. Through {{the method}} of the static tests, the removal rate of aqueous <b>dichloroethylene</b> onto a new TCAS-loaded resin was researched. This TCAS-loaded resin was made of a novel supramolecular {{acceptor}} compound named thiacalix[4]arenetetrasulfonate(TCAS) and anion exchange resin, and the adsorption mechanism was discussed preliminarily. The results of adsorption indicated that the pH value was an important factor {{for the removal of}} <b>dichloroethylene</b> and {{it would be better for}} the adsorption if the pH value was greater than 6. The operating temperature should be controlled in 5 to 15 ˚C for the adsorption of <b>dichloroethylene</b> onto TCAS-loaded resin while the removal rate decreased with the temperature increasing and the best time for reaction was 40 min.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that administration of trichloroethylene and <b>dichloroethylene</b> to pregnant rats during organogenesis would produce a significant fetal cardiac teratogenic effect. It was also hypothesized that administration of these compounds only before pregnancy would not be associated with fetal cardiac teratogenesis. Background. Epidemiologic observations demonstrated an increased number of congenital cardiac defects in children whose mother resided in an area with drinking water contaminated by trichloroethylene and <b>dichloroethylene.</b> A prior provocative intrauterine exposure study in rats established a positive link between these contaminants and an increased number of fetal hearts with congenital cardiac defects. Methods. Sprague-Dawley rats were given pure tap drinking water (control subjects) or water contaminated with high or low dose of trichloroethylene or <b>dichloroethylene</b> (experimental groups) during prepregnancy only, prepregnancy and pregnancy or during pregnancy alone. Results. A total of 2, 045 fetuses were examined. Trichloroethylene or <b>dichloroethylene</b> delivered exclusively in the period before pregnancy caused no increase in congenital cardiac malformations over the control level. Compared with the control group, rats exposed to these agents both before and during pregnancy, had a significantly greater number of fetuses with congenital cardiac malformations. Trichloroethylene (high dose only) administered only during pregnancy produced a significant increase in cardiac defects. Other fetal variables, including noncardiac congenital abnormalities, showed no significant difference between control and treated groups. Conclusions. Trichloroethylene and <b>dichloroethylene</b> administered during organogenesis are cardiac, but not general, teratogens. The data indicate that these agents administered in drinking water to pregnant rats caused an increased number of congenital cardiac defects in rat fetuses...|$|R

25|$|Many {{chemicals}} undergo reactive decay {{or chemical}} change, especially {{over long periods}} of time in groundwater reservoirs. A noteworthy class of such chemicals is the chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene (used in industrial metal degreasing and electronics manufacturing) and tetrachloroethylene used in the dry cleaning industry.

40|$|Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and {{trichloroethylene}} (TCE), common industrial solvents, {{are among}} the most frequent contaminants found in groundwater supplies. Due to the potential toxicity and carcinogenicity of chlorinated ethylenes, knowledge about their transformation potential is important in evaluating their environmental fate. The results of this study confirm that PCE can be transformed by reductive dehalogenation to TCE, <b>dichloroethylene,</b> and vinyl chloride (VC) under anaerobic conditions. In addition, [14 C]PCE was at least partially mineralized to CO 2. Mineralization of 24 % of the PCE occurred in a continuous-flow fixed-film methanogenic column with a liquid detention time of 4 days. TCE was the major intermediate formed, but traces of <b>dichloroethylene</b> isomers and VC were also found. In other column studies under a different set of methanogenic conditions, nearly quantitative conversion of PCE to VC was found.

40|$|Research {{described}} in this thesis examines the surface and bulk behavior of analytes in food contact polymers. Irganox 1076 (IN 1076) and Irganox 1010 (IN 1010), phenol containing species often used as antioxidant additives in food packaging polymers, have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups. Consequently these additives are likely to absorb to surfaces where their free energy is minimized. Surface pressure isotherms show that repeated compression of films formed from IN 1076 and IN 10101 at the air/water interfaces leads to continued irreversible loss of molecules and that on a per molecule basis, this loss is more pronounced for IN 1076 than for IN 1010. Differences in the surface properties of these two antioxidant additives are interpreted based on differences in molecular structure. Surface specific vibrational measurements of these organic films show very little conformational order, implying that even when closely packed, both antioxidant species have little affinity for forming highly organized domains. A second study examined the temperature dependent permeation of different <b>dichloroethylene</b> (DCE) isomers through commercially available low density polyethylene (LDPE). Initial experiments measured migration rates of DCE isomers from neat liquids through the LDPE film into Miglyol. The isomers consisted of 1, 1 <b>dichloroethylene</b> (1, 1 -DCE), cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene (c 1, 2 -DCE) and trans 1, 2 <b>dichloroethylene</b> (t 1, 2 -DCE). Despite having equivalent masses, the three isomers migrated through LDPE with rates that varied by up to a factor of three. Migration data were used to calculate permeation coefficients. Permeation coefficients did not correlate with calculated molecular sizes. The temperature dependence of the permeation coefficients was used to calculate effective permeation activation energies. Subsequent experiments examined DCE migration through LDPE from dilute solutions (1 % v/v) of c 1, 2 -DCE and t 1, 2 -DCE isomers in Miglyol. The permeation rates slowed at lower concentrations with the permeation coefficient of c 1, 2 -DCE decreasing by an order of magnitude.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Reductive {{dechlorination}} of chlorinated ethenes {{is dependent}} upon suitable substrates promoting microbial activity and creating anaerobic conditions. At the periphery of active reductive dechlorinating zones combinations of lesser chlorinated ethenes should exist along with end products of the anaerobic metabolism that is driving reductive dechlorination. Potential end-products of anaerobic metabolism were investigated {{for their ability to}} stimulate oxidative cometabolism of dichloro ethenes (DCEs) by the butane-degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas butanovora. Organic acids that supported butane-monooxygenase (BMO) activity were acetate, propionate, lactate, and butyrate. Lactate consistently supported and sustained greater rates of cooxidation than did the other organic acids. When propane replaced butane as the growth substrate, lactate remained the superior electron donor, while the ability of butyrate and acetate to support BMO activity decreased.

Often the attenuation can only be inferred to be biodegradation, based on, for instance, the presence of cis- <b>dichloroethylene</b> (DCE) where only trichloroethylene (TCE) was a known contaminant. Because in several instances we had observed such transitions {{in the presence of}} plants, an unplanted control was set up to see if natural attenuation may arise "spontaneously. " A cylinder 12 cm in diameter and 33 cm high was packed with a natural, sandy soil. The surface-volatilized gas phase was sampled intermittently over more than 1. 5 years. Soil water was analyzed for contaminants on several occasions. Continuous feeding of TCE-contaminated water from the bottom resulted in release of only DCE, and relatively little of that. Both methanogenesis and methanotrophy were observed within the contaminated column. Surface monitoring currently indicates disappearance of > 95 % of the input TCE...|$|R
