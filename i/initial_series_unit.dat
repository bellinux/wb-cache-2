50|$|A {{quadrature}} booster typically {{consists of}} two separate transformers: a shunt <b>unit</b> and a <b>series</b> <b>unit.</b> The shunt unit has its windings connected across the phases, so it produces output voltages shifted by 90° {{with respect to the}} supply. Its output is then applied as input to the <b>series</b> <b>unit,</b> which, because its secondary winding is in series with the main circuit, adds the phase-shifted component. The overall output voltage is hence the vector sum of the supply voltage and the 90° quadrature component.|$|R
