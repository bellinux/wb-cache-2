500|$|A {{variant of}} the {{periodontal}} abscess is the gingival abscess, which {{is limited to the}} gingival margin, has a quicker onset, and is typically caused by trauma from items such as a fishbone, toothpick, or toothbrush, rather than chronic periodontitis. The treatment of a periodontal abscess is similar to the management of dental abscesses in general (see: Treatment). [...] However, since the tooth is typically alive, there is no difficulty in accessing the source of infection and, therefore, antibiotics are more routinely used in conjunction with scaling and root planing. The occurrence of a periodontal abscess usually indicates advanced periodontal disease, which requires correct management to prevent recurrent abscesses, including <b>daily</b> <b>cleaning</b> below the gumline to prevent the buildup of subgingival plaque and calculus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Daily</b> <b>cleaning</b> of {{dentures}} is recommended. Plaque and tartar {{can build}} up on false teeth, {{just as they}} do on natural teeth. [...] Cleaning can be done using chemical or mechanical denture cleaners. Dentures should not be worn continuously, but rather left out of the mouth during sleep. This is to give the tissues a chance to recover, and wearing dentures at night is likened to sleeping in shoes. The main risk is development of fungal infection, especially denture-related stomatitis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the frequency of smoking cessation and the use of proximal tooth cleaning routines after a nonsurgical periodontal treatment phase in a Specialist clinic of Periodontology and to evaluate if these behaviour changes had any influence on the periodontal healing results. The investigation was conducted as a retrospective longitudinal study on a randomly selected population of 100 patients referred for periodontal treatment. The variables were registered from the dental records and the radiographs. Forty-six individuals declared that they were smokers at baseline and one individual of those quitted smoking during the nonsurgical treatment period. The percentage of individuals who performed proximal tooth <b>cleaning</b> <b>daily</b> was significantly increased from 56 % to 72 % during the treatment period. The patients practising proximal tooth <b>cleaning</b> <b>daily</b> had significantly lower Plaque index before as well as after the nonsurgical periodontal treatment phase compared to those without the routine. The subjects who did not per-form tooth <b>cleaning</b> <b>daily</b> before the treatment and who did not introduce this routine had significantly deeper periodontal pockets compared to those who performed inter-dental <b>cleaning</b> <b>daily</b> before treatment or who had adopted the routine during the treatment phase. However, there were no significant differences according to number of deepened periodontal pockets after nonsurgical treatment irrespective of proximal cleaning routines. In the future, motivational interviewing may be a more effective method to achieve a behaviour change if an extended education of dental hygienists within this area will be implemented...|$|R

Contamination with cyclophosphamide was also measured in environmental air and on the technicians hands and gloves used for handling the drugs. Exposure of the technicians to cyclophosphamide was measured by analysis of cyclophosphamide in urine. Contamination with cyclophosphamide was mainly observed inside CytoCare, before preparation, after preparation and after <b>daily</b> routine <b>cleaning.</b> Contamination outside CytoCare was incidentally found. All vials with reconstituted cyclophosphamide entering CytoCare were contaminated on the outside but vials with powdered cyclophosphamide were not contaminated on the outside. Contaminated bags entering CytoCare were also contaminated after preparation but non-contaminated bags were not contaminated after preparation. Cyclophosphamide was detected on the ports of all prepared bags. Almost all outer pairs of gloves used for preparation and <b>daily</b> routine <b>cleaning</b> were contaminated with cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide was not found on the inner pairs of gloves and on {{the hands of the}} technicians. Cyclophosphamide was not detected in the stationary and personal air samples and in the urine samples of the technicians. CytoCare enables the preparation of cyclophosphamide with low levels of environmental contamination and product contamination and no measurable exposure of the technicians...|$|R

We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H 5 N 1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as <b>daily</b> cage <b>cleaning,</b> <b>daily</b> cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H 5 N 1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H 5 N 1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions...|$|R
