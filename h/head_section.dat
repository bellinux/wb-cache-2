25|$|At that junction, NY107 {{becomes part}} of the Glen Cove Arterial Highway, passing {{southwest}} of Cedar Brook Country Club as Glen Cove Road. The route is a four lane arterial, winding through the Glen <b>Head</b> <b>section</b> of Oyster Bay. A short distance later, NY107 intersects with another portion of Cedar Swamp Road, which forks to the northeast. After this junction, NY107 becomes a four-lane freeway through Glen Head, with the median being replaced by a concrete barrier. Along this stretch, NY107 crosses under the Long Island Rail Road's Oyster Bay Branch, just west of the Glen Street station. Now in the city of Glen Cove, NY107 passes the water tower and bends northwest. At the city line, NY107 becomes known as Pratt Road.|$|E
25|$|The TV 21 strips {{portray the}} {{opposing}} sides in Skaro's war as the Thals and the Daleks, shown as diminutive blue men with large heads somewhat similar in appearance to Dan Dare's Mekon. The Thals are a peaceful race {{who live on}} the continent of Davius. Across the Ocean of Ooze, the Daleks inhabit Dalazar. According to the comic, these humanoid Daleks build neutron bombs which are accidentally detonated by a meteorite storm. (The idea of the war having an accidental, rather than deliberate origin, goes back to an earlier draft of the first Dalek television story.) The Daleks' chief scientist, Yarvelling, had built Dalek casings as war machines prior to the nuclear holocaust. After the neutron bombs explode, Yarvelling and Zolfian, the warlord of the humanoid Daleks, explore their continent and contract radiation sickness. They discover that a mutated Dalek had survived in the war machine casing. This Dalek persuades Yarvelling and Zolfian to build more Dalek casings for their mutated descendants. Before the last two humanoid Daleks die, it declares itself the Dalek Emperor, and has a new casing built to reflect its new rank, slightly shorter than the other Daleks, with a disproportionately large spheroid <b>head</b> <b>section</b> and in gold rather than grey.|$|E

40|$|Hard tissue {{decalcification}} {{can cause}} {{variation in the}} constituent protein characteristics. This paper describes a method of preparating of frozen mouse <b>head</b> <b>sections</b> so as to clearly observe {{the nature of the}} constituent proteins. Frozen sections of various green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mouse heads were prepared using the film method developed by Kawamoto and Shimizu. This method made specimen dissection without decalcification possible, wherein GFP was clearly observed in an undamaged state. Conversely, using the same method with decalcification made GFP observation in the transgenic mouse head difficult. This new method is suitable for observing GFP marked cells, enabling us to follow the transplanted GFP marked cells within frozen <b>head</b> <b>sections.</b> Key words: green fluorescent protein (GFP), film method, hard tissue, decalcification I...|$|R

50|$|The ER2 {{trainset}} {{consists of}} 2-car sections, {{each of which}} includes a power car and a trailer (either a driving trailer with an engineer's cab on one end, or an intermediate trailer without an engineer's cab). Sections with a driving trailer are called head sections; those with an intermediate trailer are called intermediate sections. The sections cannot operate independently; the minimum train length is 2 <b>head</b> <b>sections,</b> and the maximum is 6 <b>sections</b> (2 <b>head</b> <b>sections</b> and 4 intermediate sections), with a train 5 <b>sections</b> long (2 <b>head</b> and 3 intermediate) considered standard. Coupling more than 6 sections is unsafe due to overloading of motor-generators which power the engineer's controls. The cars are coupled together with the SA3 coupler, which is standard on Soviet rolling stock and allows vertical movement of up to 100 mm.|$|R
