50|$|<b>Friction</b> <b>disk</b> shock {{absorbers}} or André Hartford dampers were an early form of shock absorber or damper used for car suspension. They {{were commonly used}} in the 1930s but were considered obsolete post-war.|$|E
50|$|In 1909 T.B. André, {{owner of}} Hartford <b>Friction</b> <b>disk</b> shock absorbers, {{took control of}} the dealership, and {{introduced}} a new range of larger cars with engines ranging in size between 2210 cc and 3617 cc.|$|E
50|$|When {{electricity}} {{is removed from}} the brake, the armature is free to turn with the shaft. Springs keep the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> and armature away from each other. There is no contact between braking surfaces and minimal drag.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{increase}} the operation efficiency of the car-and-tractor equipment with hydromechanical gear boxes at the expense of secondary using the <b>friction</b> <b>disks.</b> A possibility to restorate the <b>friction</b> <b>disks</b> by a gas-detonation spraying has been determined, the life time and critical speed of sliding disks have been calculated theoretically. The dependence of the wear of the restorated disks upon the total kilometres logged has been obtained, the life time of the restorated disks constituted 216 thous. km.

50|$|When {{the current}} {{is removed from}} the clutch, the {{armature}} is free to turn with the shaft. Springs hold the <b>friction</b> <b>disks</b> away from each other, so there is no contact when the clutch is not engaged, creating a minimal amount of drag.|$|R
5000|$|How {{it works}} [...] - Multiple disk {{clutches}} operate via an electrical actuation but transmit torque mechanically. When current is applied through the clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. These lines of flux are transferred {{through the small}} air gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a magnetic loop, which attracts both the armature and <b>friction</b> <b>disks.</b> The attraction of the armature compresses (squeezes) the <b>friction</b> <b>disks,</b> transferring the torque from the in inner driver to the out disks. The output disks are connected to a gear, coupling, or pulley via drive cup. The clutch slips until the input and output RPMs are matched. This happens relatively quickly typically (0.2 - 2 sec).|$|R
5000|$|The car {{could be}} ordered with an engine made by either Precision or Blackburne {{with a tax}} rating of 8hp. Gearing was {{provided}} by a variable <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> and then by single chain to the rear wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Front {{suspension}} was {{independent of}} the [...] "Lancia" [...] sliding pillar type, developed from the Lambda's. At the rear there was a solid axle on semi-elliptic leaf springs and <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> dampers.Braking was via drums, on all four corners.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycles of {{the same}} period, through to the 1950s, that used girder forks also used <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> shock absorbers. These were often {{provided}} with a large handwheel, {{so that they could}} be adjusted easily during a ride, or even whilst in motion.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic shock {{absorbers}} {{appeared as a}} development to replace the previous <b>friction</b> <b>disks.</b> These had, at best, provided a constant damping force, {{no matter what the}} size or speed of the suspension movement. With a viscous device using hydraulic oil, the resistance force increased with speed, so providing better damping for larger suspension bumps.|$|R
40|$|Double-stack <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> {{units were}} used to produce good, high-crimp yarn like wool {{and the results were}} {{compared}} to conventional triple-stack <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> units. The quality of false-twist textured yarn from <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> spindles is very strongly influenced by unit operating conditions and untwisting tension. The authors previously proposed a method to derive tension and untwisting tension in the yarn given the twisting tension and yarn path in double-stack <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> units. In this study our goal was to calculate both yarn path and yarn tension. We were able to compare and confirm that the calculated yarn path and yarn tension closely matches experimental results. In addition, we succeeded in using our model to predict conditions for guide hole to produce false-twist yarn. The validity of our model was proven by the results. We have succeeded {{for the first time in}} calculating approximate yarn path and yarn tension for the false-twist process in <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> spindle units. Our results should be helpful in designing <b>disk</b> <b>friction</b> spindle units. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
50|$|The Lambert {{friction}} gearing disk drive transmission {{was invented by}} John William Lambert originally in 1904. The invention relates to a <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> drive transmission for automobiles that is gearless. He saw {{the need for a}} simple transmission of engine power to an automobile's drive wheels.|$|E
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a pressure plate, squeezing the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> between the inner pressure plate and the outer cover plate. This frictional clamping force is transferred to the hub, which is mounted to a shaft.|$|E
50|$|Lever arm shock {{absorbers}} {{were the first}} form of hydraulic shock absorber or damper used for car suspension. They appeared in the 1930s and were most commonly used in the 1950s and 1960s, but were replaced by telescopic {{shock absorbers}} in the 1970s. One of the earliest patents for a hydraulic lever arm shock absorber was awarded in 1925 to Georges de Ram, who was already an established maker of <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|Electro-mechanical disk brakes operate via {{electrical}} actuation, but transmit torque mechanically. When {{electricity is}} applied to the coil of an electromagnet, the magnetic flux attracts the armature to the face of the brake. As it does so, it squeezes the inner and outer <b>friction</b> <b>disks</b> together. The hub is normally mounted on the shaft that is rotating. The brake housing is mounted solidly to the machine frame. As the disks are squeezed, torque is transmitted from the hub into the machine frame, stopping and holding the shaft.|$|R

50|$|Both {{power off}} brakes are {{considered}} to be engaged when no power is applied to them. They are typically required to hold or to stop alone {{in the event of a}} loss of power or when power is not available in a machine circuit. Permanent magnet brakes have a very high torque for their size, but also require a constant current control to offset the permanent magnetic field. Spring applied brakes do not require a constant current control, they can use a simple rectifier, but are larger in diameter or would need stacked <b>friction</b> <b>disks</b> to increase the torque.|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{friction}}</b> <b>disk</b> {{pattern was}} invented by Truffault, before 1900. These used oiled leather friction surfaces between bronze disks compressed by adjustable conical springs, with the disk pack floating between arms to both chassis and axle, in the distinctive style. From 1904 these were licensed to several makers including Mors, who had first applied shock absorbers to cars, and Hartford in the US. Similar dampers were also applied as steering dampers from this early date.|$|E

Early and economy models came with spoked wheels and drum brakes, while later and upgraded models received cast alloy wheels and hydraulic disc brakes. Later models also upgraded the early mechanical points ignition system to a modern solid state electronic system.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, several {{tractors}} and small locomotives were built with friction-disk transmissions with an output disk rolling on the face of the input disk. For disks of identical diameter, the effective gear ratio could be varied from 1:1 when the point of contact was at the perimeter of the input disk, to infinity when the point of contact was at the center, to -1:1 when the point of contact was at the opposite extreme. The transmission on early Plymouth locomotives worked this way, while on tractors using <b>friction</b> <b>disks,</b> the range of reverse speeds was typically limited.|$|R

50|$|The main {{or driving}} disk {{is faced with}} a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving.|$|E
50|$|The <b>friction</b> <b>disk</b> {{material}} was usually a wooden disk {{between the two}} faces of the steel arms. As {{for the development of}} the clutch and brake shoes, the development of these friction materials was in its infancy. Treated leather had been used for clutches and although it offered good friction behaviour, it was prone to stiction when first moving off and also failed when overheated. Asbestos-based friction materials were sometimes used for racing, in an attempt to keep dampers working correctly even when overheating.|$|E
50|$|Permanent magnet type - A {{permanent}} magnet holding brake looks {{very similar to}} a standard power applied electromagnetic brake. Instead of squeezing a <b>friction</b> <b>disk,</b> via springs, it uses {{permanent magnet}}s to attract a single face armature. When the brake is engaged, the permanent magnets create magnetic lines of flux, which can in turn attract the armature to the brake housing. To disengage the brake, power {{is applied to the}} coil which sets up an alternate magnetic field that cancels out the magnetic flux of the permanent magnets.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{mechanical}} designs for continuously variable transmissions and these {{also have the}} ability to multiply torque. They include the pendulum-based Constantinesco torque converter, the Lambert <b>friction</b> gearing <b>disk</b> drive transmission and the Variomatic with expanding pulleys and a belt drive.|$|R

The position and the velocity of the piston are the key effectors for achieving a good engagement performance. In a real setup, {{it is impossible to}} measure these variables. In this paper, we use transmission torque and slip to approximate the piston velocity and position information. By using this information, a process neural network is trained. This neural predictor shows good forecasting results on the piston position and velocity. It is helpful in designing a pressure profile which can result in a smooth and fast engagement in the future. This neural predictor can also be used in other model-based control techniques...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new type of {{electromagnetic}} multiple disk brake for controlling the friction torque of the brake by using a rare earth magnet which generates very strong magnetic fields. This brake consists of a rare earth permanent magnet, an electric magnet and multiple <b>friction</b> <b>disks.</b> In this system, a control device such as a microcomputer generates an electric current in a coil of the electric magnet, and controls the friction torque of the brake. In the analysis the design formulae for the brake is first derived, based on the theory of electro-magnetic fields and the theory of tribology, then the transient friction torque is derived using the theories of Dynamics of Machinery and Automatic Control. To verify the present system and the analytical method, experimental tests have been performed for a model of the above-mentioned brake...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{analytical}} and numerical {{study of the}} wobbling dynamics of <b>friction</b> <b>disks</b> is presented. Of particular interest is the excitation mechanism taking into account two contrarian effects both originating in dry friction: the circulatory terms describing the energy input due to the sliding contacts and the friction induced damping which stabilizes the system. Balance of these terms determines the instability domain in the parameter space. It is shown {{that there is a}} slip threshold so that, if the slip is under this limit, the system remains stable. If the slip is larger than this limit then the criterion of stability is determined by the relation between the friction coefficient and the internal damping. The limit cycle appearing in the unstable domain is also investigated. It is shown that the limit cycle can be described as a kind of a regular reverse precession of the wobbling disc. Its amplitude is limited by the geometric nonlinearity and partial contact loss. Analytic results are compared with numeric simulation...|$|R
