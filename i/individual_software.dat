2500|$|In particle-based (sometimes called [...] "agent-based") simulations, proteins, nucleic acids, {{macromolecular}} complexes {{or small}} molecules are represented as <b>individual</b> <b>software</b> objects, and their progress is tracked {{through the course}} of the entire simulation. Because particle-based rule evaluation keeps track of individual particles rather than populations, it comes at a higher computational cost when modeling systems with a high total number of particles, but a small number of kinds (or pools) of particles. In cases of combinatorial complexity, however, the modeling of individual particles is an advantage because, at any given point in the simulation, only existing molecules, their states and the reactions they can undergo need to be considered. Particle-based rule evaluation does not require the generation of complete or partial reaction networks {{at the start of the}} simulation or at any other point in the simulation and is therefore called [...] "network-free".|$|E
