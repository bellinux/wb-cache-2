50|$|In {{spite of}} all the bad things that the RVRR was known for, the RVRR made the best of what little it had. For example, {{although}} the railroad never quite reached Morristown, New Jersey, it offered <b>free</b> <b>freight</b> shipping from its depot in Watnong, which was about 2 miles outside of town. This feature was unique to the RVRR. This proved to be a significant incentive and reportedly the railroad, {{for as long as it}} operated, was the predominant freight shipper in Morristown, besting the big railroad in town, the Lackawanna Railroad, by a significant margin.|$|E
40|$|Defining the {{economic}} {{role of the}} various modes of freight transport {{should be one of}} the basic ingredients of both an economically rational transport policy and the effective functioning of the existing <b>free</b> <b>freight</b> transport market in South Africa. In the interest of the national economy and in the commercial interest of freight carriers, national policy on freight transport should take cognisance of (1) why governments involve themselves in transport, (2) the policy instruments of governments that affect the performance of the freight transport sector, and (3) the salient economic features of the freight transport market that should be considered in the formulation of transport policy. The goal of the research was to compile an overview of these three aspects. The research approach and methodology combine (1) a literature survey; (2) an analysis of the cost structures of freight transport modes; and (3) interviews conducted with specialists in the freight transport industr...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that production, distribution, marketing, {{inventory}} control, and financing all/each {{have a positive impact on}} the performance of a supply chain. Despite the growing interest in the development of integrated inventory models, the interactions between these elements of a supply chain may not be efficiently included, resulting in a restricted supply chain model presentation. To incorporate this phenomenon, a mathematical model that tackles the interdependent relationships between these aforementioned elements is developed in this paper. This study considers the determination of the optimal pricing, ordering, and delivery policies of a profit-maximizing supply chain system, faced with (1) unit wholesale price of the supplier is set based on unit production cost, (2) unit production cost is taken as a function of demand rate and production rate, (3) the supplier's production rate is adjusted according to market demand, (4) market demand depends upon buyer's selling price, (5) a <b>free</b> <b>freight</b> is offered if the buyer's order exceeds a certain minimum requirement, and (6) a constant credit period is offered by the supplier to stimulate the demand of the buyer. Algorithm for computing the optimal policies is derived. The sensitivity of the optimal results with respect to those parameters which directly influence the production and transportation costs is also examined...|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} hobos {{increased}} greatly during the Great Depression {{era of the}} 1930s. With no work and no prospects at home, many decided to travel for <b>free</b> by <b>freight</b> train and try their luck elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} ordinary. We were three tipsy young gods, {{incredibly}} wise, gloriously genial, and without limit to our powers. Ah!--and I say it now, after the years--could John Barleycorn keep one {{at such a}} height, I should never draw a sober breath again. But {{this is not a}} world of <b>free</b> <b>freights.</b> One pays according to an iron schedule--for every strength the balanced weakness; for every high a corresponding low; for every fictitious god-like moment an equivalent time in reptilian slime. For every feat of telescoping long days and weeks of life into mad magnificent instants, one must pay with shortened life, and, oft-times, with savage usury added.|$|R
50|$|Representative Staggers {{was also}} a strong {{supporter}} of the federally created passenger railroad Amtrak, which did not achieve the potential goal of self-sufficiency. However, creation of Amtrak <b>freed</b> the <b>freight</b> railroad industry from a massive burden of passenger service related-losses and helped preserve a national rail passenger system for the United States, providing some alternatives to an aging Interstate Highway System.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{authorities}} of Yaroslavl have been acting on the initiative to build a bypass around the city, for this reason {{the center of the city}} is now largely <b>free</b> of <b>freight</b> transporters and other larger vehicles transiting through the city. In August 2010, the first piece of this new bypass was opened, it included an interchange, which connects the Yubileyny Bridge with the Southwest Yaroslavl relief road.|$|R
50|$|At its {{commencement}} {{that company}} {{stated that it}} intended to reduce prices without reducing wages, provide $35 million in dealers fiannce funding, employ 20,000 skilled mechanics, continue manufacturing all existing makes in greater numbers, and <b>freight</b> <b>free</b> anywhere east of the Rocky Mountains.|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} {{approach to}} optimizing resource utilization of vehicles by {{the formation of}} dynamic networks in logistics and passenger transport has been developed. It maintains knowledge about <b>free</b> partial <b>freight</b> and <b>free</b> transport capacities {{as well as the}} transport possibilities of the participating companies. Privacy interests of different companies are taken into account by defining trust circles sharing among their members only specific kinds of information. The approach is implemented in a prototypic way as a cloud computing solution capable of optimization and cost simulations carried out on the basis of real data...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the cash salaries paid by the Casa da Índia, captains and crew members were allowed to engage in trade on their own account (up to a certain amount). That is, they were authorized to import into Portugal a pre-specified volume of pepper and {{a certain number of}} boxes of assorted goods (caixas forras de fretes e direitos, or caixas de liberdades, [...] "liberty chests"). These were to be purchased in India out of their own pockets, of course, but the crown would allow these cargoes to be brought back on crown ships <b>free</b> of <b>freight</b> charge and duties, and sold in Lisbon markets (at pre-set prices), for their own personal profit. Liberty chests had standard dimensions 4' × 3' × 2.5' ...|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, wharves were {{primitive}} {{and there were}} few traveller amenities, but improvements were made and business increased. Mining developments in the 1890s meant large volumes of traffic. The Okanagan had a booming fruit industry by the early 1900s and steamers were essential for exportations. York was launched in 1902 as relief steamer for Aberdeen. By 1904, it was becoming clear that the ageing Aberdeen could not handle the traffic on the lake. Okanagan was launched in 1907 and replaced Aberdeen, <b>freeing</b> her for <b>freight.</b> Aberdeen was retired in 1916 and her hull was sold for $35.|$|R
50|$|Finnish trains have a {{reputation}} for being spacious, comfortable and clean. The scenery surrounding the railway lines is considered to be of outstanding natural beauty, especially in Eastern Finland where there are many lakes. Because in most parts of Finland the density of population is low, Finland is not very well suited for railways. Commuter services are nowadays rare outside the Helsinki area, but there are express train connections between most of the cities. As in France, passenger services are mostly connections from various parts of the country to the capital, Helsinki. Currently there are c. 260 passenger round trips driven daily in Finland, excluding Helsinki commuter rail. Nightly passenger trains only operate on the busiest lines between Helsinki or Turku via Oulu to Lapland (minimum distance of c. 650 km (405 mi.)). This leaves most of the tracks <b>free</b> for nightly <b>freight</b> traffic (c.40 M tons/y). In addition there are also good long diatance bus and airplane connections, both of which are generally little or a lot more expensive than trains. Buses are sometimes faster and/or cheaper than trains (e.g. Helsinki-Pori).|$|R
