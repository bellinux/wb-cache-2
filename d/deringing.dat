5000|$|Pre- and postfilters {{are widely}} used in codecs. Codecs often use prefilters such as video denoising, deflicking, deshaking, etc. Denoising and deflicking {{normally}} maintain PSNR value while increasing visual quality (the best slow denoising filters also increase PSNR on medium and high bitrates). Deshaking greatly decreases PSNR, but increases visual quality. Postfilters show similar characteristics — deblocking and <b>deringing</b> maintain PSNR, but increase quality; graining (suggested in H.264) essentially increases video quality, especially on big plasma screens, but decreases PSNR. All filters increase compression/decompression time, so they enhance visual quality but decrease the speed of coding and decoding.|$|E
50|$|Doing {{internal}} processing {{in higher}} precision (10 or 12 bits per sample) leads to compression improvement due to smaller rounding errors in reference imagery.For intra prediction, {{there are more}} (than 8) angles for directional prediction and weighted filters for per-pixel extrapolation.Temporal prediction can use more references.Prediction can happen for bigger units (≤128×128) {{and they can be}} subpartitioned in more ways. Predictions can be combined in more advanced ways (than a uniform average) in a block, including smooth and sharp gradients in different directions. This allows either inter-inter or inter-intra predictions to be combined in the same block.Conventional scalar quantisation with binary arithmetic coding is currently used, inherited from VP9, but experiments are ongoing to investigate other systems including multisymbol coding, and Perceptual Vector Quantization from Daala. Asymmetric Numeral Systems coding is being considered for the entropy coding phase.For the in-loop filtering step it has a deblocking filter and experimental <b>deringing</b> filters from both Thor and Daala.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method using fuzzy filtering {{to remove the}} coding artifacts in compressed video. The method takes interlaced video format into consideration and processes each field format into consideration and processes each field separately. For deblocking, a 1 -D fuzzy filter with different window size is used to remove the horizontal and vertical blocking artifacts respectively. For <b>deringing,</b> each 8 X 8 block in a field is first classified {{into one of the}} four categories, i. e., strong edge, weak edge, texture and smooth blocks. According to each block´s type and the neighboring block´s type, the spread parameter of a 2 -D fuzzy filter is adaptively decided and the filter is applied. To speed up the proces, the fuzzy filter weights are generated using a piecewise linear membership function instead of the conventional Gaussian function. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better detail preservation and lower computational costs than our previous method. It achieves comparable deblocking and superior <b>deringing</b> performance to the MPEG- 4 standard method at similar computation costs. IEEE, ICASSP 0...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The shape-adaptive DCT (SA-DCT) {{transform}} can be computed on {{a support}} of arbitrary shape, but retains a computational complexity {{comparable to that of}} the usual separable block-DCT (B-DCT). Despite the near-optimal decorrelation and energy compaction properties, application of the SA-DCT has been rather limited, targeted nearly exclusively to video compression. In this paper we present a novel approach to image filtering based on the SA-DCT. We use the SA-DCT in conjunction with the Anisotropic Local Polynomial Approximation (LPA) - Intersection of Confidence Intervals (ICI) technique, which deÞnes the shape of the transform’s support in a pointwise adaptive manner. The thresholded or attenuated SA-DCT coefÞcients are used to reconstruct a local estimate of the signal within the adaptiveshape support. Since supports corresponding to different points are in general overlapping, the local estimates are averaged together using adaptive weights that depend on the region’s statistics. This approach can be used for various image processing tasks. In this paper we consider in particular image denoising and image deblocking and <b>deringing</b> from block-DCT compression. A special structural constraint in luminance-chrominance space is also proposed to enable an accurate filtering of color images. Simulation experiments show a state-of-the-art quality of the final estimate, both in terms of objective criteria and visual appearance. Thanks to the adaptive support, reconstructed edges are clean, and no unpleasant ringing artifacts are introduced by the fitted transform.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new method {{to detect and}} remove ringing ar-tifacts {{produced}} by the deconvolution process in image deblurring tech-niques. The method takes into account non-invertible frequency com-ponents of the blur kernel used in the deconvolution. Efficient Gabor wavelets are produced for each non-invertible frequency and applied on the deblurred image to generate a set of filter responses that reveal ex-isting ringing artifacts. The set of Gabor filters is then employed in a regularization scheme to remove the corresponding artifacts from the deblurred image. The regularization scheme minimizes {{the responses of the}} reconstructed image to these Gabor filters through an alternating algorithm in order to suppress the artifacts. As a result of these steps we are able to significantly enhance the quality of the deblurred images produced by deconvolution algorithms.
