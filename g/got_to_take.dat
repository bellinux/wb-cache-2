I think if you asked most black people to be honest, they ain’t thought a day in their life about those stupid statues. What we as black people need to do: We {{need to worry about}} getting our education, we need to stop killing each other, we need {{to try to find a}} way to have more economic opportunity and things like that. Those things are important and significant. You know, I’m wasting time and energy [...] screaming at a neo-Nazi, or [...] ‘Man, you’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this statue down.'” ...|$|E
500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal... I think I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> another look at this situation".|$|E

500|$|Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he {{described}} as his [...] "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, {{or at least to}} do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked [...] "I really am thoroughly ashamed of it... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again, but I have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> that chance." [...] Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed.|$|E
500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a step back and}} let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period {{for the rest of the}} cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E
500|$|In the series' {{planning}} stages, Esther's surname {{was originally}} Katusi, and the casting call specified that this role {{would be for}} a non-Caucasian actress. Greek star Amber Stevens {{was one of the}} actresses who auditioned for the part of Katusi. However, white actress Alexa Havins was announced by the BBC on 6 January 2011, the character's surname having been changed to Drummond. Havins was not initially sure about accepting the role when she was offered it due to having recently become a mother. She revealed that her husband, actor Justin Bruening, being a Torchwood [...] "fan-boy" [...] influenced her decision to accept the role, stating that he told her [...] "you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this part" [...] and offered to assume child-minding responsibilities. In preparation for the role Havins watched some of the earlier series of Torchwood to acquire a sense of the show's tone, but did not fully immerse herself in the show's history because, given her character's ignorance, [...] "not being so well-versed in it played in my favour".|$|E

500|$|Following the storm, Governor of Florida Rick Scott {{attended}} a briefing at the South Florida Water Management District before boarding a helicopter to tour flooded areas of Palm Beach County. Scott said, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of everybody's needs but we've {{got to get}} our state back to work," [...] and also encouraged tourists {{to return to the}} state, especially in Key West, where hotel owners were considering cancelling reservations for Labor Day. A Florida state fund known as Neighbors to the Rescue [...] with the purpose of distributing money to help recovery efforts for victims of Isaac [...] was activated by the governor. The area already qualified for small business loans due to a state of emergency and after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reviewed damage assessments, President of the United States Barack Obama considered a disaster declaration. Initially, FEMA denied a disaster declaration. In response, Governor Scott mailed a letter of appeal to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. The appeal was accepted, and on October18, 2012, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Bay, Collier, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Martin, Monroe, Okaloosa, Palm Beach, St. Lucie, and Santa Rosa counties.|$|E
500|$|... "One of Those Days" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song with}} a [...] "slight retro feel" [...] to it. Chuck Taylor of Billboard {{classified}} the song as a [...] "groovy, hip-swaying composition". The song's hook samples the melody from The Isley Brothers' 1983 song [...] "Between the Sheets". As Houston begins the first verse, she declares her stress: [...] "This {{is just for}} me [...] <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time out [...] You don't know what I'm going through." [...] She then sings about getting away from it, by indulging in activities like a manicure, pedicure and by having a [...] "late-night snack, a bubble bathe and a massage". Throughout the song, she sings over a [...] "warm bed of beats and horns". Writing for Entertainment Tonight, Tim Jaramillo commented that the song is a [...] "smoky track with a feel-good, chilled-out vibe". Dan LeRoy of NJ Star Ledger observed that the song sounded like an outtake from Brandy Norwood's debut album, while New York Daily News compared it to Houston's 1999 song [...] "It's Not Right but It's Okay". An official remix of the song features rapped verses from Nelly, which according to MTV News staffs has a reggae feel.|$|E

2500|$|Egar {{remained}} outspoken about bowling {{actions that}} he considered to be dubious in his later life. He has been strongly critical of {{the action of the}} Sri Lankan world record-breaking spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. In 2002, he criticised Wisden for ranking Muralitharan the best bowler in Test history, citing his bowling action. After Muralitharan broke the world record for career Test dismissals, Egar said [...] "As far as I am concerned they should have a separate record for bowlers with illegal actions...I've got a photo at home of Murali's arm bending at 48 degrees." [...] Egar criticised laboratory tests on Muralitharan at the University of Western Australia as [...] "rubbish...The only tests that matter are those conducted under match conditions...The administrators of the game have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the blame for letting his action go." ...|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me to the hospital now." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by and I hit rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it finally all caught up with me. I came down with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. My body was physically giving up. I took six months off and went home. I love working, but at the end of the day you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 2015, Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{revealed}} {{plans for}} Daniel's [...] "good-natured" [...] personality {{to change as}} {{he turned away from}} his hippy ideals. Daniel changed his look and became more career-driven. Of the changes to Daniel's personality, Phillipps explained: [...] "I think it's an important change that had to happen for Daniel's development. He's always been a positive person, and I don't think that goes away in this storyline. But Daniel has been under Paul's guidance for a long time now. It's made him start to understand some really important life messages about how sometimes you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> more risks, be more ruthless and push a little harder. It's all part of Daniel's evolution as a character." [...] Phillipps told Kilkelly that he spoke to the writers about giving Daniel [...] "more status" [...] within the community and believed that making him more career-driven would be a good way for him to gain respect from other characters. The actor also believed that viewers would find Daniel more interesting, but added that his positive attitude would still be there. Daniel began working at Lassiter's Hotel, following his brief stint in real estate sales. He already knew the hotel business from working alongside Paul. Daniel's new attitude and career change was marked by a new haircut. Phillipps had chosen to shave his hair off, so the writers incorporated his new style into the storyline. Phillipps added that he would not like to see Daniel become a copy of his uncle, but he did want Daniel to be [...] "strong-willed and street smart" [...] like him.|$|E
