50|$|On 15 May 2015 it was {{announced}} that 2015 would be XH558's last flying season, due to the fact the three companies assisting the project with technical expertise (BAE Systems, Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group and Rolls-Royce) were unwilling to support the aircraft beyond that, meaning it would no longer have the necessary CAA approval to fly. According to the Trust, the companies arrived at the decision for two reasons - they were now entering uncertain territory regarding predicting future safety risks to continued flight due to the fact XH558 had already performed 10% more flying hours than any other Vulcan, and secondly, the increasing difficulty in obtaining the necessary expertise, particularly with regard to the engines. Various options to continue flights beyond 2015 were considered and ultimately rejected for <b>engineering,</b> <b>cost,</b> practicality or other reasons outside of the Trust's control - limiting the hours flown in 2015, building new Olympus engines and sourcing parts from other Vulcans, training new staff, using other technical authorities, and even relocating XH558 to another country. As a result, following completion of the 2015 Farewell to Flight display season, XH558's final ever flight occurred on 28 October 2015, a small display at its Doncaster Sheffield base.|$|E

At present, the questions existing in the <b>engineering</b> <b>cost</b> in China are mainly the backward philosophy and methods of management, and the imperfect management system, etc. Reinforcing the analysis of these questions existing in the <b>engineering</b> <b>cost</b> in China and further intensifying the research and discussion of relevant solutions is highly necessary to the further promotion of the sustainable and stable development of the Chinese construction industry. In this paper, the questions existing in the <b>engineering</b> <b>cost</b> of the construction industry in China are studied and analyzed, and relevant solutions are further put forward.
