This organization, later renamed the Technical School for Home Management, {{was the first}} of its kind in the country, and in 1907, she instituted the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Sciences</b> course at the Buenos Aires Girls’ Secondary School (the first such course in Argentina). Following her 1909 report on {{improving}} conditions in Europe regarding education, living standards, and the availability of vocational schools, the National Education Council approved a curriculum for vocational schools in Argentina. Grierson published Educación técnica de la mujer (Women’s Technical Education), introducing the study of day care in these schools. She held teaching positions in the School of Fine Arts and the National Secondary School for Girls, where she taught from its inception in 1907.

500|$|The Southwest Texas State Normal School was {{proposed}} in a March 3, 1899, bill by State Representative Fred Cocke. [...] Cocke represented {{the citizens of}} Hays and surrounding counties where the school was to be located. [...] While there was opposition to the bill, {{with the support of}} State Senator J.B. Dibrell, it was finally passed and signed into law on May 10, 1899, by Governor Joseph D. Sayers. [...] The school's purpose was to provide manual training and teach <b>domestic</b> <b>sciences</b> and agriculture. [...] Any students earning a diploma and teaching certificate from the school would be authorized to teach in the state's public schools. [...] In October 1899, the San Marcos City Council voted to donate [...] of land at what was known as Chautauqua Hill for the school to be built on. [...] It was not until 1901 that the Texas legislature accepted this donation and approved $25,000 to be used for construction of buildings on the site. [...] The building now known as Old Main was completed and the school opened its doors to its first enrollment of 303 students in September 1903.|$|E
40|$|This is an {{analysis}} of the connection between the <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. While it is made clear by historians such as Megan Elias and Kathy Cooke that there is ample connection between eugenics and euthenics, there has not been as comprehensive {{an analysis}} of the direct connections between <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. Close examination of literature from the <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> movement reveals the shared goals of <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> and eugenics. The <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> movement was also a necessary precursor to the euthenics movement, not simply a “re-envisioning” of home economics by Ellen Richards. When Richards died, her euthenic ideals would continue {{to be a part of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>science</b> in the early decades of the twentieth century. This analysis will contribute in part to the understanding of how, through rhetoric, nations can progress towards more unsightly policies of social engineering from seemingly benign beginnings. Eugenics may not have origins in <b>domestic</b> <b>science,</b> a field of homemaking, cookery, etiquette, and child-rearing, but eugenics certainly shares goals, purposes, and a vision with <b>domestic</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R
