5000|$|In most {{countries}} one pulse {{is used for}} the digit 1, two pulses for 2, and so on, with ten pulses for the digit 0; this makes the code unary, excepting the digit 0. Exceptions to this are: Sweden (...) , with one click for 0, two clicks for 1, and so on; and New Zealand with ten clicks for 0, nine clicks for 1, etc. Oslo, the capital city of Norway, used the New Zealand system, {{but the rest of the}} country did not. Systems that used this encoding of the 10 digits in a sequence of up to 10 pulses, are sometimes known as <b>decadic</b> <b>dialing</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|Pulse dialing is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of pulse dialing, <b>decadic</b> <b>dialing,</b> each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|E
50|$|When {{released}} at the finger stop, the wheel returns to its home position by spring action {{at a speed}} regulated by a governor device. During this return rotation, the dial interrupts the direct electrical current of the telephone line (local loop) a specific number of times for each digit and thereby generates electrical pulses which the telephone exchange decodes into each dialed digit. Each of the ten digits is encoded in sequences of up to ten pulses so the method is sometimes called <b>decadic</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
