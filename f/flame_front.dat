5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering phase, a deflagration <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> is born, powered by carbon fusion. The details of the ignition are still unknown, including the location and number of points where the flame begins. Oxygen fusion is initiated shortly thereafter, but this fuel is not consumed as completely as carbon.|$|E
25|$|The {{test was}} {{performed}} at 11:00 MST on August 9, 1968 at the Watching Hill blast {{range of the}} Defence Research Establishment Suffield, a permanent facility {{able to carry out}} large HE test up to 500 tons operated by the Defence Research Board. The charge was constructed of 31,676 blocks of TNT of various sizes mainly the 12x12x4 inch typically used in HE tests. Unlike previous 500-ton tests however, the charge was built as a sphere tangent to the ground, which would make it smaller in diameter than the 500-ton hemispheres but equal in yield. Detonation was accomplished with CE/TNT boosters placed in the center. The sphere was supported by styrofoam rings and blocks and once completed resembled a hemisphere atop a cylinder. After detonation, the <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> reached the charge surface in approximately half a second and produced a fireball and destructive overpressures. Debris up to ¾ inch in diameter continued to rain down for almost 8 minutes after detonation in the vicinity of ground zero. The resulting crater measuring 270 feet across filled rapidly with water and was subsequently excavated for studying the ground effects.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of coal {{fires are}} burning around the world. Those burning {{underground}} {{can be difficult}} to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires. Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the <b>flame</b> <b>front.</b> A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels. In Centralia, Pennsylvania (a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The Australian Burning Mountain was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years.|$|E

40|$|Turbulent lean {{premixed}} combustion now plays a predominant role {{in reducing}} {{emission of pollutants}} such as NOx. For turbulent premixed flames located in the thin-reaction-zones regime, small-scale eddies could penetrate into the preheat zone of the flames and enhance the mixing process. In this study, the effects of small-scale turbulence on emission (NOx and CO) formation in premixed <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> are investigated through the incorporation of turbulence induced diffusion in the preheat zone of one-dimensional premixed flames. One-dimensional methane/air premixed flames are simulated with the 53 -species GRI-Mech 3. 0 mechanism at both atmospheric and engine conditions with different turbulence intensities. It is found that the NO generated in <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> deceases with increasing intensity of small-scale turbulence and the effect is more profound at high pressures. At high pressures, the turbulence induced diffusion in the preheat zone can reduce the NOx formation in <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> by more than 40 %. On the other hand, the CO mass fraction in <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> increases with increasing intensity of small-scale turbulence. In the cases considered, the CO mass fraction in the <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> can increase by more than 55 %. In addition, a flamelet-based approach that accounts for the flame thickening effects has been formulated to simulate NOx and CO formation in turbulent lean premixed combustion. In this approach, the species NO and CO are transported and solved in a simulation with chemical source terms being pre-calculated from 1 -D premixed flames with detailed chemical kinetics and turbulence induced diffusion. The NO source term can be quantified by its formation in <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> and its formation rate in post-flame region. The CO source term can be calculated through its mass fraction at <b>flame</b> <b>fronts,</b> its mass fraction in the post-flame region and an oxidation time scale. The effect of heat loss on NO formation has been studied by investigate the relation between post-flame NO formation rate and flame temperature.

This problem was solved by limiting the engine speed to only 1200rpm and the use of natural gas as fuel.

2500|$|The {{trailing}} side of {{the rotary}} engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream which pushes back the <b>flame</b> <b>front.</b> With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and high engine speed ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent , and Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading site, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts. This poor combustion in the trailing side of chamber {{is one of the}} reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons in a Wankel's exhaust stream. A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids one of the causes of this because the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system.

The instantaneous <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> were visualized using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) of OH on two Bunsen type burners of 11. 2 and 22. 4 mm diameters. Non-dimensional turbulence intensity, u 0 =SL, was varied from 0. 84 to 15, and the Reynolds number, {{based on the}} integral length scale, varied from 34 to 467.

40|$|Shear lets are wavelet-like systems {{which are}} {{better suited for}} {{handling}} geometric features in multi-dimensional data than traditional wavelets. A novel method for edge and line detection {{which is in the}} spirit of phase congruency but is based on a complex shearlet transform will be presented. This approach to detection yields an approximate tangent direction of detected discontinuities as a byproduct of the computation, which then yields local curvature estimates. Two applications of the edge detection method will be discussed. First, the tracking and classification of <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> is a critical component of research in technical thermodynamics. Quite often, the <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> are transient or weak and the images are noisy. The standard methods used in the field for the detection of <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> do not handle such data well. Fortunately, using the shearlet-based edge measure yields good results as well as an accurate approximation of local curvature. Furthermore, a modification of the method will yield line detection, which is important for certain imaging modalities. Second, the Wadden tidal flats are a biodiverse region along the North Sea coast. One approach to surveying the delicate region and tracking the topographical changes is to use pre-existing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Unfortunately, SAR data suffers from multiplicative noise as well as sensitivity to environmental factors. The first large-scale mapping project of that type showed good results but only with a tremendous amount of manual interaction because there are many edges in the data which are not boundaries of the tidal flats but are edges of features like fields or islands.

40|$|In a {{state of}} the art gas turbine using Lean Pre-Mixed fuels one of the main {{challenges}} is efficient and reliable control of sound generated during combustion. Knowledge of sound generation in gas turbine combustion chambers has to be enhanced in order to develop a reliable model with predictive capabilites. In this thesis Direct Numerical Simulations of two dimensional laminar imploding circular <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> have been performed. One dimensional simulations of laminar opposing <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> have been performed to establish modeling conditions for the two dimensional simulations, evaluate the boundary influence on the simulations and provide comparable simulation results. In addition a pre-study for three dimensional simulation of an inwards burning sphere of fuel has been done. The motivation of this thesis is to enhance the knowledge related to generation of acoustic waves in the combustion chamber of a gas turbine. The S 3 D code (a parallel DNS code for solving reactive flows) was modified to include two dimensional circular imploding <b>flame</b> <b>fronts.</b> A thorough investigation to validate the boundary influence on the annihilation event is recommended. This is due to simulations which indicate that the boundary conditions may influence especially the pressure drop after time of impact. In two dimensions DNS have been performed at pressure 1 atm for fuel equivalence ratios 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 8 and 1. 5 with detailed chemistry representation. Care has been taken to ensure adequat resolution of the flame (a minimum of ten points over the flame). The results from the simulations were used to measure key parameters (as the pressure drop after impact, the laminar flame speed, etc.). The following trends were found for the two dimensional simulations with increasing fuel equivalence ratio (in the given range) : The flame thickness, unburned and burned gas density decrease, while the fluid expansion velocity, laminar flame speed, propagation speed of the pressure wave, pressure difference before the <b>flame</b> <b>fronts</b> meet, pressure drop after impact and burned temperature increase. This coincides with the the trends in the one dimensional simulations, and is consistent with the given theory. The results were compared with analytical relations developed in the candidate's project work of fall 2012. It was found that the three relations gave a poor impression of the measured values.
