"I had to {{find myself}} another {{flagship}} because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> exercise command from one which was shot to pieces...A torpedo boat was called alongside and we changed under heavy fire... drove my torpedoboat hoping to find an advantageous moment to board one of [...] These 1½ hours that I spent in a hail of shell and splinters aboard the torpedoboat I shall not be likely to forget." ...|$|E
500|$|After the loss, {{there were}} calls for Playford {{to be offered}} the post of Governor of South Australia or Governor-General of Australia, but nothing came of that. Playford {{continued}} to lead the LCL opposition for a further {{one and a half}} years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, Steele Hall, a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the Playmander still in place. Contrary to perceptions, Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor, and he did not publicly hint at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot; there was speculation that the former premier may have been one of those who abstained from the vote. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that [...] "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... I found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... I decided I couldn't take it any longer".|$|E
2500|$|He {{found the}} drug to {{be a boon to}} his creativity: “y pen glanced {{presently}} like lightning in the effort to keep neck and neck with my ideas,” he writes at one point, although, “t last, thought ran with such terrific speed that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> write at all.” ...|$|E
60|$|At last, after a minnit or two, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> contane <b>no</b> <b>longer,</b> {{and bust}} {{out in a}} horse laff.|$|R
6000|$|GUENDOLEN [without]. Mildred! Tresham! [...] [Entering with AUSTIN.] [...] Thorold, [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> desist <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> Ah, she swoons! [...] That's well.|$|R
60|$|But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and {{breaking}} through, I ran straight before my nose till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "That's right. I {{meant that}} the Communist Party and the whole {{communist}} movement was changing its character, and in 1945, when I was kicked out, the parting of the ways had come, and if I hadn't been kicked out I {{would have had the}} difficult task of disengaging myself from a movement that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> agree with and no longer help." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 24, 2011, Jobs {{announced}} his resignation as Apple's CEO, {{writing to the}} board, [...] "I have always said if there ever came a day when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I {{would be the first}} to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come." [...] Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO. Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis later {{revealed}} that her departure from Syco had come after [...] "several years" [...] of consideration. She {{also stated that}} when she expressed her desire to part with the label, she was threatened with the public being told {{that she had been}} dropped instead of parting amicably. However, further creative differences in relation to her fifth studio album finally caused Lewis to leave the label. Of her departure, she stated, [...] "I was asked to make a record {{that would not have been}} true to myself. By all means as an artist in this climate, I was thankful to even get the chance to make another record. But I cannot make music that does not speak to my soul, and as scary as it seemed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> compromise myself, and so I decided to leave".|$|E
60|$|And at last <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{hold out}} <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> against these accumulating pressures.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold <b>no</b> <b>longer,</b> but {{embracing}} him, told him, with {{a thousand}} thanks, I would grant whatever he requested, and desired him to proceed in the third article, which {{he did in the}} following manner; ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{stand it}} <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> My nervous system {{seemed to give}} way in a moment.|$|R
2500|$|... “I tied {{a string}} (tied to the wire) to Smoky's collar {{and ran to}} the other end of the culvert [...] [...] [...] (Smoky) made a few steps in and then ran back. [...] `Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again. [...] When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up and she looked over her {{shoulder}} as much as to say `what's holding us up there?' [...] The string loosened from the snag and she came on again. [...] By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> see her. [...] I called and pleaded, not knowing for certain whether she was coming or not. [...] At last, about 20 feet away, I saw two little amber eyes and heard a faint whimpering sound [...] [...] [...] at 15 feet away, she broke into a run. [...] We were so happy at Smoky's success that we patted and praised her for a full five minutes.” ...|$|E
60|$|Then I was confused, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{deny the}} truth, {{and not having}} one word to say, I sighed from my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} if courage is needed," [...] Kit replied, forcing a smile. [...] "It looks as if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> meddle with politics." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} silence between us. I bore it till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear it <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|R
60|$|Of course {{directly}} {{the window}} was closed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> <b>I</b> remained in my position for half a minute or more, and then as the rain began to pour down rapidly I made a break for better shelter.|$|R
60|$|There {{is little}} more to tell. I left the land where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stay <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> who had brought about the deaths of two kings, and came here to Natal to live near where the kraal Duguza once had stood.|$|R
60|$|Then for {{the first}} time I {{realized}} how nearly I had been overcome. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> stand, and swooning, sank in a heap to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "I spent {{evening after}} evening there, when, if I {{had not thought}} only of myself, I should have kept away. But one day <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be blind.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{adhere to}} so gross a lie. She was too intelligent, and I loved her too much. Standing up, I pointed to distant {{mountains}} and isolated peaks.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> <b>I</b> had {{designed}} {{to watch their}} proceedings in silence, but I felt that I must speak or die. [...] "If hell," [...] I said, [...] "has one complexion more hideous than another, it is where villany is masked by hypocrisy." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{made no move}} {{to reach}} the food, the torturers left the light turned on in the hope that at last <b>I</b> <b>could</b> refrain <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> from giving them the delicious thrill of {{enjoyment}} that my former futile efforts to obtain it had caused.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} {{imprudent}} of me; but when I saw the splendour of his appearance, the nobleness of his manner, I felt {{it impossible to}} keep disguise with him; and when he said, 'Ah, you are a Hungarian, <b>I</b> see!' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was such}} fury {{in his eyes}} and in the grin of his white teeth that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> doubt his truth, with that clotted and oozing back to corroborate his words.|$|E
60|$|It put {{the cover}} upon it. No, {{that is not}} the phrase. The lid. It put the lid upon it. All my smothered 'atred of the animal burst forth. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> conceal my 'atred.|$|E
6000|$|... "When the knife," [...] says he, [...] "had {{penetrated}} to the bone, and I {{was surrounded}} with such heavy distresses that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> live in expectations, I wrote you {{an account of}} my difficulties.|$|E
60|$|I {{waited at}} home until noon, and then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wait <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> Leaving {{a message of}} excuse for my mother (I had just sense of shame enough left to shrink from facing her), I hastened away to profit by my {{invitation}} {{on the very day}} when I received it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{stand it}} <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> 'Mr. Hitchcock,' I said, with dignity, 'I haven't the remotest idea {{what on earth}} you are talking about.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But when Arnold Bentham had {{completed}} his last arrangements and made {{ready to do}} the act, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> contain myself <b>no</b> <b>longer,</b> and cried out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{too late}} to talk of 'circumstances'; he heard the story from other sources; my {{confession}} came too tardily, it seems. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> plead extenuating circumstances: I could not demean myself by trying to explain--" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{statement}} of the case {{seemed to me to}} suggest very grave considerations. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> hesitate to inform Mr. Keller that I had received intelligence of his absent partner, and to place my letter in his hands.|$|E
60|$|For once I {{think the}} Fürstin miscalculated consequences. I think I should have engaged myself to Rachel before I went to America {{if it had}} not been for the Fürstin's revelation, but this so tore me that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> go on falling in love again, {{naturally}} and sweetly. No man falls in love if he has just been flayed.... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> think of Rachel except as a foil to Mary. I was moved to marry her by a new set of motives; to fling her so to speak in Mary's face, and from the fierce vulgarity of that at least I recoiled--and let her go as I have told you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I feared Father Adrian and his threats, and I was alone, quite alone, and--and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear it <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> <b>I</b> {{was obliged}} to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{remain silent}} <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> [...] "Is there no human feeling left in you?" [...] I burst out. [...] "What do these horrid {{questions}} mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} Nugent, and {{surprised}} {{him trying to}} catch his brother's eye. Prompted by him, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> doubt, Oscar had laid his finger on a certain domestic difficulty which I had had in my mind, from {{the moment when the}} question of the operation had been first agitated among us.|$|R
