Bond is also told that the [...] "sex maniac" [...] who was given the name of [...] "James Bond" [...] when the original Bond retired has gone to work in television. He then orders that all remaining MI6 agents will be named [...] "James Bond 007", to confuse SMERSH. He also creates a rigorous programme to train male agents to ignore the charms of women. Moneypenny recruits [...] "Coop", a karate expert who begins training to resist seductive women: he also meets an exotic agent known as the <b>Detainer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One key {{component}} of S-COMM, the predecessor of PEP, {{was the use of}} ICE <b>detainers,</b> where ICE sent Form I-247 <b>detainers</b> to state and local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) asking them to keep aliens for up to 48 hours in law enforcement custody to give ICE time to take the alien in ICE custody. These <b>detainers</b> came under criticism both for leading to unconstitutional detention and for the added costs borne by law enforcement agencies. PEP replaced the I-247 <b>detainers</b> with three new forms: ...|$|R

50|$|Most {{states have}} also enacted laws that create Interstate Commissions, {{which is usually}} an agency that creates its own {{policies}} and regulations regarding <b>detainers</b> transferring prisoners and probationers across state lines. While the Interstate Agreement on <b>Detainers</b> controls untried cases, Interstate Commission can control whether a person on probation or parole can come to their state to reside.|$|R
500|$|In London, Mata Bond is {{kidnapped by}} SMERSH {{in a giant}} flying saucer, and Sir James and Moneypenny travel to Casino Royale to rescue her. They {{discover}} that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah, secretly Sir James' nephew Jimmy Bond, a former MI6 agent who defected to SMERSH to spite his famous uncle. Jimmy reveals {{that he plans to}} use biological warfare to make all women beautiful and kill all men over [...] tall, leaving him as the [...] "big man" [...] who gets all the girls. Jimmy has already captured The <b>Detainer,</b> and he tries to convince her to be his partner; she agrees, but only to dupe him into swallowing one of his [...] "atomic time pills", turning him into a [...] "walking atomic bomb".|$|E
500|$|... "Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by {{any means}} {{whatsoever}} wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person... with intent... to do some... grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or <b>detainer</b> of any person...". This creates four forms of the offence: unlawfully and maliciously wounding, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (1) or resist arrest (2); and unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (3) or resist arrest (4). Thus forms (1) and (3) differ from section 20 offences mainly in {{that there is a}} specific intention to cause serious harm rather than some harm, and they are therefore the more serious charges. On an indictment under section 18, the jury is open to convict under section 20 or section 47 if properly directed.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, an {{immigration}} <b>detainer</b> (Form I-247) is a notice that DHS issues to a federal, {{state and local}} law enforcement agency (LEA) to inform them that ICE intends to assume custody of an individual and to request that the LEA notify ICE prior to the time when the individual would otherwise be released. The new <b>detainer</b> form includes: ...|$|E

2500|$|In those days, {{action in}} detinue sur trover could not lie against a third party. If a person bailed his {{chattels}} to another, and that bailee wrongfully gave, sold or bailed the chattels {{to a third}} party, the only action was against the original bailee. Liability to the third bailee was not transferable. In later times, lawyers would talk of trover and bailment. In 1292, {{there was a slight}} tendency to regard the <b>detainer</b> rather than the bailment as the gist of the action, where it was stated [...] "it is not enough to say, 'you did not bail to me' , but one must add, 'and I do not detain it [...] from you.'" [...] But there are other later cases which show that it is impossible or at least extremely difficult for the bailor to fashion any count that will avail him against the third party. The third party was called the [...] "third hand".|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, {{and just}} {{a few weeks before the}} public sale, the Commissioner {{published}} a notice of public sale in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. No bids were submitted, which permitted the State to negotiate a private sale of the property. [...] Several months later, Linda Flowers submitted a purchase offer. The Commissioner mailed another certified letter to Jones at the house, attempting to notify him that his house would be sold to Flowers if he did not pay his taxes. Like the first letter, the second was also returned to the Commissioner marked [...] "unclaimed." [...] Flowers subsequently purchased the house at approximately a quarter of its fair market value. [...] Immediately after the 30-day period for postsale redemption passed, [...] Flowers had an unlawful <b>detainer</b> notice delivered to the property. [...] The notice was served on Jones' daughter, who contacted Jones and notified him of the unpaid taxes and the tax sale.|$|E
2500|$|The divorce trial {{dragged on}} for eight months, piling up a stack of legal {{documentation}} more than [...] high of complaints, countercharges, motions and depositions from prominent Tucson citizens. Despite witnesses supporting his wife's allegations of abuse, Handy prevailed and obtained custody of all five children. But the judge ordered Handy to pay her $30 a month in alimony, gave her the family home, and rejected Handy's demand for a new trial. Handy sent Spencer {{to live with his}} family in Oakland. In July 1891, Handy, acting in his mother's name, sued his ex-wife for unlawful <b>detainer</b> of property, trying to force her out of the house that the court had granted her. His suit was dismissed but he went to a second judge and presented the deed that his wife had signed under duress two years previously. Heney represented Mary again and Handy made more death threats. [...] Fearful for his life, Heney began carrying a pistol. Heney's brother Ben lived across the street from Handy and began accompanying his brother to and from the office. Ben reported that Handy said he would [...] "take Frank's gun away and kill him with it." [...] Handy hired a former policeman named McCarthy as a bodyguard. On two occasions the four men confronted each other with their guns drawn.|$|E

50|$|Another {{direction}} of criticism was that {{cooperating with the}} <b>detainers</b> imposed significant additional expenditures on state and local authorities, for which ICE did not reimburse them. This was the main stated motivation for Cook County's decision to stop complying with ICE <b>detainers.</b> Overall, S-COMM was criticized for creating mistrust between law enforcement and local communities, by adding the enforcement of immigration laws to their job. The design of PEP-COMM would in part be motivated by efforts to address these criticisms.|$|R

50|$|In Connecticut, {{a class-action}} suit has been filed, {{according}} to which the policy of <b>detainers</b> violates numerous constitutional provisions. A spokesman for Governor Dannel Malloy announced that federal immigration <b>detainers</b> would be honored in Connecticut only on a case-by-case basis. ICE officials have been using threats of legal action and financial consequences (withdrawal of unrelated federal funds designated for the localities in question) to compel state and local participation in its deportation program, but {{the federal government is}} believed to lack the legal authority necessary to require state and local governments to actively enforce federal law.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The only other, Mr Nickleby,' said old Arthur, eagerly. 'The only other. Nobody else went to {{the expense}} of lodging a <b>detainer,</b> trusting to our holding him fast enough, I warrant you. We both fell into the same snare; oh dear, what a pitfall it was; it almost ruined me! And lent him our money upon bills, with only one name besides his own, which to be sure {{everybody}} {{supposed to be a}} good one, and was as negotiable as money, but which turned out you know how. Just as we should have come upon him, he died insolvent. Ah! it went very nigh to ruin me, that loss did!' ...|$|E
60|$|Let me {{conclude}} this miserable history. Seven months--my wife saw me once or twice, {{and then}} dropped me altogether--I remained in that fatal place. I wrote to my dear mamma, begging her {{to sell her}} furniture, but got no answer. All my old friends turned their backs upon me. My action went against me--I had not a penny to defend it. Solomonson proved my wife's debt, and seized my two thousand pounds. As for the <b>detainer</b> against me, I was obliged {{to go through the}} court for the relief of insolvent debtors. I passed through it, and came out a beggar. But fancy the malice of that wicked Stiffelkind: he appeared in court as my creditor for 3L., with sixteen years' interest at five per cent, for a PAIR OF TOP-BOOTS. The old thief produced them in court, and told the whole story--Lord Cornwallis, the detection, the pumping and all.|$|E
60|$|The {{attorneys}} to whom Mr. Smithers recommended me, {{told me that}} I could get leave {{to live in the}} rules of the Fleet, could I procure sureties to the marshal of the prison for the amount of the <b>detainer</b> lodged against me; but though I looked Mr. Blatherwick hard in the face, he never offered to give the bail for me, and I knew no housekeeper in London who would procure it. There was, however, one whom I did not know,--and that was old Mr. Hoskins, the leatherseller of Skinner Street, a kind fat gentleman, who brought his fat wife to see Mrs. Titmarsh; and though the lady gave herself rather patronising airs (her husband being free of the Skinners' Company, and bidding fair to be Alderman, nay, Lord Mayor of the first city in the world), she seemed heartily to sympathise with us; and her husband stirred and bustled about until the requisite leave was obtained, and I was allowed comparative liberty.|$|E

6000|$|How {{by degrees}} this {{slippery}} penitent was induced {{to make other}} confessions; how we got an idea of Mrs. Ridley's account from him, of his dealings with Mr. Sherrick, need not be mentioned here. The conclusion to which Colonel Newcome's ambassador came was, that to help such a man would be quite useless; and that the Fleet Prison would be a most wholesome retreat for this most reckless divine. Ere the day was out, Messrs. Waddilove and Tobbins had conferred with their neighbour in St. James's, Mr. Brace; and there came a <b>detainer</b> from that haberdasher for gloves, cravats, and pocket-handkerchiefs, that might have done credit to the most dandified young Guardsman. Mr. Warrington was on Mr. Pendennis's side, and urged that the law should take its course. [...] "Why help a man," [...] said he, [...] "who will not help himself? Let the law sponge out the fellow's debts; set him going again with twenty pounds when he quits the prison, and get him a chaplaincy in the Isle of Man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] replied Dick, [...] "I am here in sanctuary, {{is it not}} so? Well, sir, I see by your bearing that ye {{are high}} in station, and I read in your countenance the marks of piety and justice. To you, then, I will yield me prisoner, and that blithely, {{foregoing}} the advantage of this holy place. But rather than to be yielded into the discretion of that man--whom I do here accuse with a loud voice to be the murderer of my natural father and the unjust <b>detainer</b> of my lands and revenues--rather than that, I would beseech you, under favour, with your own gentle hand, to despatch me on the spot. Your own ears have heard him, how before that I was proven guilty he did threaten me with torments. It standeth not with your own honour to deliver me to my sworn enemy and old oppressor, but to try me fairly by the way of law, and, if that I be guilty indeed, to slay me mercifully." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{reason for}} this insincere quality {{may have been the}} fact that the very {{foundations}} of our neighborhood were artificial. Laura Matilda Street was [...] "made ground." [...] The land, not yet quite reclaimed, was continually struggling with its old enemy. We had not been long in our new home before we found an older tenant, not yet wholly divested of his rights, who sometimes showed himself in clammy perspiration on the basement walls, whose damp breath chilled our dining-room, and in the night struck a mortal chilliness through the house. There were no patent fastenings that could keep him out,--no writ of unlawful <b>detainer</b> that could eject him. In the winter his presence was quite palpable; he sapped the roots of the trees, he gurgled under the kitchen floor, he wrought an unwholesome greenness {{on the side of the}} veranda. In summer he became invisible, but still exercised a familiar influence over the locality. He planted little stitches in the small of the back, sought out old aches and weak joints, and sportively punched the tenants of the Swiss Cottage under the ribs. He inveigled little children to play with him, but his plays generally ended in scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough, and measles. He sometimes followed strong men about until they sickened suddenly and took to their beds. But he kept the green-plants in good order, and was very fond of verdure, bestowing it even upon lath and plaster and soulless stone. He was generally invisible, as I have said; but some time after I had moved, I saw him one morning from the hill stretching his gray wings over the valley, like some fabulous vampire, who had spent the night sucking the wholesome juices of the sleepers below, and was sluggish from the effects of his repast. It was then that I recognized him as Malaria, and knew his abode to be the dread Valley of the shadow of Miasma,--miscalled the Happy Valley! ...|$|E
