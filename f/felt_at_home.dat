5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock {{as one of their}} own, Brock never really <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E
5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E
5|$|Marge's absence is <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck. The annual bake sale also suffers– without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise enough money to pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post.|$|E

25|$|Hardy never <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in London, {{because he}} was acutely {{conscious}} of class divisions and his social inferiority. During this time he became interested in social reform and the works of John Stuart Mill. He was also introduced by his Dorset friend Horace Moule to the works of Charles Fourier and Auguste Comte. After five years, concerned about his health, he returned to Dorset, settling in Weymouth, and decided to dedicate himself to writing.|$|E

25|$|General Finegan {{returned}} to Fernandina {{after the war}} to discover his mansion had been seized by the Freedmen's Bureau for use as an orphanage and school for black children.

He had to sell most of his lands along Lake Monroe to Henry Sanford for $18,200 to pay his attorneys and other creditors. He did retain a home site at Silver Lake. Adding to his sorrows was the untimely death of his son Rutledge died April 4, 1871, precipitating a move to Savannah, Georgia.

500|$|Boult was a {{prolific}} recording artist. Unlike many musicians, he <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> {{in the recording}} studio and was happy working without an audience. His recording career stretched {{from the days of}} acoustic recording until the beginning of the digital era. [...] His last recording of The Planets made in May 1978 was taped in experimental digital sound, although technical problems led EMI to release an analogue version.|$|E
500|$|According to Robert A. Kann, Maria Theresa was a monarch of above-average {{qualifications}} but intellectually {{inferior to}} Joseph and Leopold. Born {{and raised in}} the late Baroque and early Rococo eras, she never <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment and generally left patronage of the arts to her husband and Joseph. Displaying little empathy for the arts and artists, she famously chided her son Archduke Ferdinand for contemplating burdening himself with [...] "useless people" [...] after he asked her about the possibility of giving fifteen-year-old Mozart a position at court in Milan.|$|E

He had never <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> again in Germany after fleeing in the 1930s, and had lived out the remainder of his days in Italy.

2500|$|After {{returning}} to Paris {{from one of}} his trips, Vollard commissioned Chagall to illustrate the Old Testament.

According to Jacob Baal-Teshuva, [...] "he was impressed by the pioneering spirit {{of the people in the}} kibbutzim and deeply moved by the Wailing Wall and the other holy places".|$|E
2500|$|The Frankfurt School (...) is {{a school}} of social theory and {{philosophy}} associated in part with the Institute for Social Research at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Founded during the interwar period, the School consisted of dissidents who <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in none of the existent capitalist, fascist, or communist systems of the time. Many of these theorists believed that traditional theory could not adequately explain the turbulent and unexpected development of capitalist societies in the twentieth century. Critical of both capitalism and Soviet socialism, their writings pointed {{to the possibility of}} an alternative path to social development.|$|E
2500|$|After {{living in}} Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco {{because she said}} she never <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Southern California. [...] "Los Angeles became too {{enclosing}} an environment", she says. [...] "I couldn't breathe the air, and I didn't want to drive on the freeways {{to get to the}} studio. I also didn't want to embrace the values that have been so completely embraced by that city. Are you glamorous? Are you rich? Are you important? Do you have clout? It's just not me, and it never was me." [...] In 1997, Ronstadt sold her home in San Francisco and moved back to her hometown of Tucson, Arizona, to raise her two children. In more recent years, Ronstadt moved back to San Francisco while continuing to maintain her home in Tucson.|$|E

Crick wrote, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Southern California." [...] After the sabbatical, Crick left Cambridge in order to {{continue}} working at the Salk Institute. He was also a professor at the University of California, San Diego. He taught himself neuroanatomy and studied many other areas of neuroscience research. It took him several years to disengage from molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued to be made, including the discovery of alternative splicing and the discovery of restriction enzymes, which helped make possible genetic engineering. Eventually, in the 1980s, Crick was able to devote his full attention to his other interest, consciousness. His autobiographical book, , includes a description of why he left molecular biology and switched to neuroscience.|$|E

'It brings me back to the only place I ever really <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
