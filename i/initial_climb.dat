5|$|Despite {{imposing}} {{dimensions and}} a maximum takeoff weight of over 60,000lb (27,000kg), the F-4 has {{a top speed of}} Mach2.23 and an <b>initial</b> <b>climb</b> rate of over 41,000ft/min (210m/s). The F-4's nine external hardpoints have a capability of up to 18,650 pounds (8,480kg) of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and unguided, guided, and thermonuclear weapons. Like other interceptors of its day, the F-4 was designed without an internal cannon.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{design change}} between the earlier F-5E and the F-5G {{was the use}} of a single General Electric F404 engine that was {{originally}} designed for the F/A-18 Hornet. The new engine provided 60% more thrust than the combined output of the F-5E's two General Electric J85s. This improved the aircraft's thrust-to-weight ratio from 1.0 to 1.13. The new engine gave a speed of over Mach2.0, a ceiling over 55,000ft (16,800m), an <b>initial</b> <b>climb</b> rate of 52,800ft per minute (16,100m/min).|$|E

2500|$|The {{mainline}} Paugussett {{trail is}} blazed with blue rectangles. It is regularly maintained, {{and is considered}} easy hiking, with very few sections of rugged and moderately difficult hiking (notably the <b>initial</b> steep <b>climb</b> near the Indian Well waterfall and the steep climb using [...] "stairs" [...] between two suburban houses at Princess Wenonah Drive in Shelton).|$|R
5000|$|The plane {{took off}} from Xakanaka Airstrip at 13:55 local time bound {{ultimately}} for Maun, but with {{a stop at the}} Pom Pom air-strip forty six miles to the west first. The crash happened almost immediately in the <b>initial</b> <b>climbing</b> phase very close to - and facing towards - the runway. Upon crashing, flames engulfed the plane extremely quickly, although it is unclear whether the fire had started before or after impact with the ground. One of the passengers, an official for Botswana’s Department of Road Transport and Safety (DRTS), was able to escape the flames and rescue his colleague and a French couple. Six other passengers and the British pilot were pronounced dead at the scene and another died shortly after the incident. [...] Sue Smart, the CEO of Moremi Air Charters, told reporters that the pilot ‘was the company’s general manager and most seasoned pilot with over 12,000 hours of flying.’ ...|$|R
25|$|A Focke Wulf Fw Triebflügel {{aircraft}} {{was featured in}} the 2011 American superhero film , with the supervillain Red Skull making his first escape in this rocket-aircraft. The scene accurately depicts the rocket and ramjet start and <b>initial</b> <b>climb</b> out of the Triebflügel. Historically, the Triebflügel had only reached wind-tunnel testing when the Allied forces reached the production facilities, and no complete prototype was ever built. CGI vehicles designed for the film were based on real historical aircraft such as the Triebflügel.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} at 02:52 UTC. During the <b>initial</b> <b>climb,</b> the Captain tested {{the knowledge of}} the First Officer, and used harsh words in snobbish tones while speaking to him. This was very contrary to Airblue's procedures. The lecture continued for about one hour, with only brief intervals. After the humiliating session, the First Officer remained mostly silent {{throughout the rest of the}} flight, likely from a loss of self esteem and confidence. Subsequently, the First Officer did not challenge the Captain over any of his errors or violations.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July 2006, 21 {{people were}} injured at Liseberg when two roller coaster trains, on the rollercoaster Lisebergbanan, collided. The crash {{happened}} when the chain that pulls trains up the <b>initial</b> <b>climb</b> malfunctioned, causing a fully loaded train to roll backward into the loading platform, hitting another train that was unloading riders. Since {{only part of the}} train was on the lift, the anti-rollback mechanism had not fully engaged and broke. The steel roller coaster was built in 1987 and is one of Sweden's largest, reaching speeds up to 80km/h. Since the accident the roller coaster has opened again, after a technical adjustment.|$|E

2500|$|The non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 8 May 1951. It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to <b>initial</b> <b>climbing</b> speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, it slid for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the propeller governor {{due to the lack of}} a split pin on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the ball joint of the control spindle having been unscrewed by force.|$|R
25|$|Normal {{rocket launch}} {{vehicles}} fly almost vertically before rolling over {{at an altitude}} of some tens of kilometers before burning sideways for orbit; this <b>initial</b> vertical <b>climb</b> wastes propellant but is optimal as it greatly reduces airdrag. Airbreathing engines burn propellant much more efficiently and this would permit a far flatter launch trajectory, the vehicles would typically fly approximately tangentially to Earth's surface until leaving the atmosphere then perform a rocket burn to bridge the final delta-v to orbital velocity.|$|R
500|$|In {{the control}} tower, the takeoff had been {{observed}} by John Davis, who {{saw what he}} initially thought was the sun reflecting off the aircraft's wing during its <b>initial</b> <b>climb.</b> Davis quickly realised that the aircraft was on fire. Davis instructed Flight 712 to make a left turn, with the intention that the aircraft would land on runway 28L. He hit the [...] "crash button" [...] which alerted the emergency services and declared an aircraft accident. The emergency services were informed {{of the type of}} aircraft involved and given a rendezvous point at which they were to assemble.|$|E

50|$|I Am Alive: Surviving the Andes Plane Crash is a 2010 {{television}} documentary recounting {{the tragedy of}} Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 {{from the perspective of}} survivor Nando Parrado. Directed by Brad Osborne, this 2-hour special features reenactments of the October 13, 1972 crash and the 72-day struggle for survival that followed, including details of the 37-mile trek out of the mountains by Parrado and fellow survivor Roberto Canessa. Appearing in the film are Parrado, Canessa, Eduardo Strauch and several other survivors, original search teams, historians, expert pilots, high-altitude medical experts, and others including Piers Paul Read (author of Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors), renowned mountaineer Ed Viesturs, and Andes Survivors expert/alpinist Ricardo Peña. Peña led the only expedition to date to repeat and document the survivors escape route; it is highly significant {{that he was able to}} follow almost all the path followed by the survivor with the exception of the <b>initial</b> <b>climbing</b> of Mount Seler, whose route was definitely too much dangerous to follow. During this documenattion he has made many discoveries at the site of the crash). I Am Alive was produced by AMS Pictures and premiered on the History Channel on October 20, 2010.
