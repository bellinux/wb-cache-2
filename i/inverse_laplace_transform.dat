2500|$|The Laplace {{transform}} {{can also}} be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. [...] The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra.

2500|$|The Laplace {{transform}} is invertible {{on a large}} {{class of}} functions.
