25|$|Major outputs for {{the state}} include textiles, cotton, cattle, and {{electrical}} power. Tennessee has over 82,000 farms, roughly 59 percent of which accommodate beef cattle. Although cotton was an <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> in Tennessee, large-scale cultivation of the fiber did not begin until the 1820s {{with the opening of}} the land between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers. The upper wedge of the Mississippi Delta extends into southwestern Tennessee, and it was in this fertile section that cotton took hold. Soybeans are also heavily planted in West Tennessee, focusing on the northwest corner of the state.|$|E

50|$|In the 1850s, Victoria's rich soil {{attracted}} {{many farmers}} from Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Wheat {{was the main}} cash <b>crop.</b> Other <b>early</b> <b>crops</b> were potatoes, carrots, cabbage, and corn.|$|R
50|$|Proclamation was {{retired from}} racing {{to become a}} {{breeding}} stallion at the Overbury Stud in Gloucestershire. His <b>early</b> <b>crops</b> of foals made little impact. In 2015 he {{was standing at the}} Girsonfield Stud at Otterburn, Northumberland at a fee of £2,000.|$|R
2500|$|Agriculture {{expanded}} {{throughout the}} state to meet the food needs of the new settlers. Agriculture was soon found to be limited by the difficulty of finding enough water {{in the right places}} to grow irrigated crops. Winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested in the spring was one <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> that grew well without irrigation. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, there was no written law regarding property rights in the goldfields, and a system of [...] "staking claims" [...] was developed by the miners. The Gold Rush also had negative effects: Native Americans were pushed off of traditional lands and massacred and gold mining caused environmental harm.|$|E
50|$|An <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> the Native Americans grew was squash. Other {{early crops}} {{included}} cotton, sunflower, pumpkins, tobacco, goosefoot, knotgrass, and sump weed.|$|E
50|$|The first sawmill in South East Queensland {{was built}} at Pimpama in 1863 by Jesse Daniells. Arrowroot {{cultivation}} was an <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> grown widely in the area.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} his racing career, Darsi {{was bought}} by a {{consortium}} of Irish breeders and retired to become a National Hunt breeding stallion at the Beechbrook Stud near Tinahely in County Wicklow. His <b>early</b> <b>crops</b> of foals yielded several minor winners.|$|R
50|$|Primarily an {{agricultural}} community, <b>early</b> <b>crops</b> consisted of mainly pears, satsumas, strawberries, and figs that were then sold in nearby Galveston. Later, {{in the early}} 1900s, many farmers switched over to rice and dairy farming, as they were more profitable and stable commodities.|$|R
50|$|Scientists have {{classified}} {{three phases}} of cultural development. The earliest people were hunter-gathers and fisherman. Approximately 6000 BC, these peoples {{were among the}} first to begin farming; among their <b>early</b> <b>crops</b> were bottle gourd, Lagenaria siceraria, and an early type of maize, Zea mays L.|$|R

40|$|In {{experiments}} with 5 vegetables and 5 decorative species – coal from both mines {{proved to be}} appropriate as the seedbed. Both types of coal stimulated root growth and maintained iron in soluble form. In general, better and <b>earlier</b> <b>crops</b> were obtained in hydroponic cultures than in pots filled either with soil or with coal watered with nutrient solution...|$|R
50|$|Wheat was an {{important}} <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> for the Whanganui District: by 1848, thanks {{to the influence of}} missionaries Richard Taylor and Father Jean Lampila, an estimated 30,000 acre was being grown by Māori along the Whanganui River. With funds from the government, local Māori, and Governor George Grey, several water-driven flour mills were built in the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|In {{areas where}} conidia are the {{principal}} source of inoculum, such as {{in most of the}} tropics, early planting can be effective in avoiding secondary infections. This is because an <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> will be able to avoid infection from conidia produced by later infected crops in the region. For inoculum that survives in seeds, drying to less than 20% moisture is effective in killing the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|In 1858 Visalia {{was added}} to John Butterfield's Overland Stage route from St. Louis to San Francisco. A plaque commemorating the {{location}} {{can be found at}} 116 East Main Street.

Many saloons and hotels sprouted up around the stage stop downtown and commerce was brisk if a bit risky.|$|E
40|$|Early {{cucumbers}} grown under diffuse glass have {{a larger}} yield than those grown under normal glass {{right from the start}} of the cultivation. Following a series of trials carried out over the last few years, Jan Janse of Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture concludes: the higher the haze, the greater the extra production. That includes <b>early</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R
50|$|The piel de sapo {{originated}} in Spain, {{where it is}} widely grown - about 30,000 ha are cultivated annually. La Mancha is the main region in Spain producing this type, with 12,000 ha.

50|$|The {{principal}} {{economic activity}} in Arroyos y Esteros is agriculture, especially sugarcane. Pineapple and melons are other important crops. Sesame was introduced {{a few years ago}} and is slowly making inroads, despite some <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> failures. There are several large ranches in the area with cattle, and some other lesser animals (sheep, goats). The arrival of a sugar factory dedicated to producing organic sugar changed the face of the arroyense economy as many former small molasses factories shut down to deliver the raw material to the more efficient large factory.|$|E
40|$|Training {{systems are}} key to manage the tree canopy to take {{advantage}} of the tree productivity potential. Assessment of yearly cropping, labor requirements, fruit quality, and orchard profitability were studied. The experiment was organized in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Five different training systems on Quince EMC rootstock and ‘Conference’ as the scion cultivar were compared. The results of this study show that the use of preformed highly feathered trees is an improvement for both, <b>early</b> <b>cropping</b> and profitability. Planting cost, trellis, and labor requirements had a large impact on the economic viability of each system. Tatura produced high yields, but the strong initial investment that needs to be done at planting makes this system a risky investment. Axis 2 seems to be the most suitable system for <b>early</b> <b>cropping</b> while maintaining intermediate plantation costs and an appropriate level of production efficiency...|$|R
