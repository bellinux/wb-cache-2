5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the <b>epigenetic</b> induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} <b>epigenetic</b> enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of <b>epigenetic</b> enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such <b>epigenetic</b> mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with <b>epigenetic</b> alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. <b>Epigenetic</b> changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of <b>epigenetic</b> determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellum}} is {{the youngest}} brain region (and body part) in centenarians according to an <b>epigenetic</b> biomarker of tissue age known as <b>epigenetic</b> clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. Further, gene expression patterns in the human cerebellum show less age-related alteration than that in the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> {{alterations}} in expression of BRCA2 (causing over-expression or under-expression) are very frequent in sporadic cancers (see Table below) while mutations in BRCA2 are rarely found.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the <b>epigenetic</b> activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> changes—such as {{alteration}} of DNA methylation, histone tail modification, or microRNA regulation—may lead to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> mechanisms, where {{evolution}} {{can occur}} {{in the absence of}} change in DNA sequence, through various mechanisms including chemical modifications to the DNA bases.|$|E
5|$|One report {{indicated}} some <b>epigenetic</b> {{control of}} BRCA2 expression by the microRNAs miR-146a and miR-148a.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{develops}} following {{genetic damage}} to DNA and <b>epigenetic</b> changes. These changes affect the normal {{functions of the}} cell, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and DNA repair. As more damage accumulates, the risk of cancer increases.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{evolutionary}} {{developmental biology}} (eco-evo-devo) integrates research from developmental biology and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with evolutionary theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as developmental plasticity, <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance, genetic assimilation, niche construction and symbiosis.|$|E
5|$|Environmental insults such as air pollution, and {{exposure}} to high concentrations of ozone and particulate matter can affect SP-A expression and function, via mechanisms that involve <b>epigenetic</b> regulation of SFTPA1 expression.|$|E
5|$|Her first book, The Epigenetics Revolution, {{describes}} how <b>epigenetic</b> modifications allow the same DNA to express different characteristics; she likens DNA to a script for a play {{rather than a}} template. The same script can produce different productions of the play.|$|E
5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the Neo-Lamarckian theory that <b>epigenetic</b> changes are later consolidated at gene level, something {{that may have been}} important early in the history of multicellular life.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} evolutionary synthesis (EES) is {{an extension}} of the Modern Synthesis of evolution which revisits the relative importance of different factors at play in evolutionary theory. EES includes concepts and mechanisms such as multilevel selection theory, transgenerational <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance, niche construction and evolvability.|$|E
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and <b>epigenetic</b> factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E
5|$|SFTPA2 {{is located}} in the long arm of {{chromosome}} 10, close to SFTPA1. The SFTPA2 gene is 4556 base pairs in length, and 94% similar to SFTPA1. The structure of SFTPA2 consists of four coding exons (I-IV), and several 5'UTR untranslated exons (A, B, B’, C, C’, D, D’). The expression of SFTPA2 is regulated by cellular factors including proteins, small RNAs (microRNAs), glucocorticoids, etc. Its expression is also regulated by <b>epigenetic</b> and environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia: The <b>Epigenetic</b> Puzzle {{outlined}} the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman {{used in his}} study of schizophrenia. He co-wrote the book with James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same <b>epigenetic</b> mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause of}} {{difference}} between monozygotic twins is <b>epigenetic</b> modification, caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives. Epigenetics refers {{to the level of}} activity of any particular gene. A gene may become switched on, switched off, or could become partially switched on or off in an individual. This <b>epigenetic</b> modification is triggered by environmental events. Monozygotic twins can have markedly different <b>epigenetic</b> profiles. A study of 80 pairs of monozygotic twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few <b>epigenetic</b> differences. The number of <b>epigenetic</b> differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the <b>epigenetic</b> difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference. However, certain characteristics become more alike as twins age, such as IQ and personality.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolone {{antibiotics}} induce <b>epigenetic</b> {{changes in}} mammalian cells through iron chelation. This leads to <b>epigenetic</b> effects through inhibition of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that require iron as a co-factor.|$|E
25|$|Dizygotic (fraternal) and {{monozygotic}} (identical) twins show {{evidence of}} <b>epigenetic</b> influence in humans. DNA sequence differences {{that would be}} abundant in a singleton-based study do {{not interfere with the}} analysis. Environmental differences can produce long-term <b>epigenetic</b> effects, and different developmental monozygotic twin subtypes may be different with respect to their susceptibility to be discordant from an <b>epigenetic</b> point of view.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} <b>epigenetic</b> {{mechanisms}} can be perturbed {{in different types}} of cancer. <b>Epigenetic</b> alterations of DNA repair genes or cell cycle control genes are very frequent in sporadic (non-germ line) cancers, being significantly more common than germ line (familial) mutations in these sporadic cancers. <b>Epigenetic</b> alterations are important in cellular transformation to cancer, and their manipulation holds great promise for cancer prevention, detection, and therapy. Several medications which have <b>epigenetic</b> impact are used in several of these diseases. These aspects of epigenetics are addressed in cancer epigenetics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> {{changes can}} occur in {{response}} to environmental exposure—for example, mice given some dietary supplements have <b>epigenetic</b> changes affecting expression of the agouti gene, which affects their fur color, weight, and propensity to develop cancer.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics {{can affect}} {{evolution}} when <b>epigenetic</b> changes are heritable. A sequestered germ line or Weismann barrier is specific to animals, and <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance {{is more common}} in plants and microbes. Eva Jablonka, Marion J. Lamb and Étienne Danchin have argued that these effects may require enhancements to the standard conceptual framework of the modern synthesis and have called for an extended evolutionary synthesis. Other evolutionary biologists have incorporated <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance into population genetics models and are openly skeptical, stating that <b>epigenetic</b> mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{has been}} linked to <b>epigenetic</b> changes, {{heritable}} changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes p16 and p53, thus increasing risk of carcinogenesis. These <b>epigenetic</b> events have been studied in vitro using human kidney cells and in vivo using rat liver cells and peripheral blood leukocytes in humans. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and other arsenic bases involved in <b>epigenetic</b> modification of DNA. Studies investigating arsenic as an <b>epigenetic</b> factor be used to develop precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{detection}} of <b>epigenetic</b> marks in microorganisms is possible with single molecule real time sequencing, in which polymerase sensitivity allows for measuring methylation and other modifications as a DNA molecule is being sequenced. Several projects {{have demonstrated the}} ability to collect genome-wide <b>epigenetic</b> data in bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{two forms}} of {{heritable}} information, namely genetic and <b>epigenetic,</b> are collectively denoted as dual inheritance. Members of the APOBEC/AID family of cytosine deaminases may concurrently influence genetic and <b>epigenetic</b> inheritance using similar molecular mechanisms, and may be a point of crosstalk between these conceptually compartmentalized processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{cerebellum}} is {{the youngest}} brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians according to an <b>epigenetic</b> biomarker of tissue age known as <b>epigenetic</b> clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. By contrast, all brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same <b>epigenetic</b> age in subjects who are younger than 80. These {{findings suggest that the}} cerebellum is protected from aging effects, which in turn could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions.|$|E
25|$|During {{repair of}} DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause <b>epigenetic</b> gene silencing. DNA repair {{deficiencies}} (level 4 in the figure) cause increased DNA damages (level 5 in the figure) which result in increased somatic mutations and <b>epigenetic</b> alterations (level 6 in the figure).|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} <b>epigenetic</b> {{consequences}} {{is evident in}} multiple sclerosis in monozygotic (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After gene testing, {{it was suggested that}} DNA was identical and that <b>epigenetic</b> differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.|$|E
25|$|T cell {{exhaustion}} {{is associated}} with <b>epigenetic</b> changes in the T cells.|$|E
25|$|More {{recently}} {{it has become}} apparent {{that there is a}} significant influence of non-DNA-sequence specific effects on transcription. These effects are referred to as <b>epigenetic</b> and involve the higher order structure of DNA, non-sequence specific DNA binding proteins and chemical modification of DNA. In general <b>epigenetic</b> effects alter the accessibility of DNA to proteins and so modulate transcription.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> {{patterns}} can {{be identified}} between tissues within an individual {{as well as between}} individuals themselves. Identical genes that have differences only in their <b>epigenetic</b> state are called epialleles. Epialleles can be placed into three categories: those directly determined by an individual’s genotype, those influenced by genotype, and those entirely independent of genotype. The epigenome is also influenced significantly by environmental factors. Diet, toxins, and hormones impact the <b>epigenetic</b> state. Studies in dietary manipulation have demonstrated that methyl-deficient diets are associated with hypomethylation of the epigenome. Such studies establish epigenetics as an important interface between the environment and the genome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epigenetic</b> {{research}} uses a {{wide range}} of molecular biologic techniques to further our understanding of <b>epigenetic</b> phenomena, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (together with its large-scale variants ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-Seq), fluorescent in situ hybridization, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) and bisulfite sequencing. Furthermore, the use of bioinformatic methods is playing an increasing role (computational epigenetics).|$|E
