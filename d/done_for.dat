5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be <b>done</b> <b>for</b> purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is <b>done</b> <b>for</b> reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E

5|$|In early {{versions}} of Perl, database interfaces {{were created by}} relinking the interpreter with a client-side database library.

5|$|Starting with Apollo 13, descent orbit {{insertion}} {{was to be}} performed using the Service Module engine instead of the LM engine, {{in order to allow}} a greater fuel reserve for landing.

5|$|A fairly strong easterly {{wind had}} been blowing for three days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about fifty feet, and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay.

5|$|Along {{with his}} brother John, {{beginning}} in 1640, Sobieski studied at the Nowodworski College in Kraków. On 29 April 1642 Sobieski made a speech on funeral of Jakub Zadzik, bishop of Kraków. The next year, on 2 June 1643, Sobieski made a speech where he thanked absent Władysław IV for everything he had <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Nodworski College. Two months earlier, in April 1643, Marek and John Sobieski began studies at Kraków Academy. In 1644 Sobieski became Starosta of Krasnystaw.|$|E
5|$|As he had <b>done</b> <b>for</b> other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé {{was careful to}} obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations <b>done</b> <b>for</b> the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E

5|$|Bethlehem {{now has a}} Muslim majority, but {{is still}} home to a {{significant}} Palestinian Christian community. Bethlehem's chief economic sector is tourism, which peaks during the Christmas season when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, as they have <b>done</b> <b>for</b> almost 2,000 years. Bethlehem has over 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops. Rachel's Tomb, an important Jewish holy site, {{is located at the}} northern entrance of Bethlehem.|$|E
5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have <b>done</b> <b>for</b> centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been <b>done</b> <b>for</b> hafnium compounds.|$|E

5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} <b>done</b> <b>for</b> finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E
5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had <b>done</b> <b>for</b> them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Finnegans Wake {{comprises}} seventeen chapters, {{divided into}} four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles as he had <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third part.|$|E
