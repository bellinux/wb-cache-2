40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a study dealing with the utilization of sludge water from a concrete plant as a partial replacement for mixing water in the production of cement composites. The replacement of mixing water with sludge water from a concrete plant was carried out in the amounts of 20 % and 50 %. The following tests were carried out {{in order to determine the}} effect of the replacement of mixing water with sludge water from a concrete plant on the physical and mechanical properties of the cement composites: cement mortar consistency, beginning and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting,</b> strength characteristics (compressive strength and flexural strength), and thermal properties. The measured values of the strength characteristics of the test specimens after 28 days of age confirm the possibility of replacing mixing water with sludge water from a concrete plant without significantly reducing the compressive and flexural strength...|$|E
