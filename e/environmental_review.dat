5|$|In March and April 2015, {{the city}} started {{the process of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> for Citywide Ferry. The city {{requested}} the draft of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on August 12, 2015, which was completed by April 18, 2016. After public comment, the final EIS was approved on July 28, 2016. The project also had a City Environmental Quality Review, which analyzed the ferry's effects on open space, urban design, natural resources, nearby transportation, noise pollution, air quality, the environment, and public health.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, {{expansion}} of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, {{and development of}} Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan {{was approved by the}} government, pending <b>environmental</b> <b>review.</b> Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{as part of}} a state-brokered deal, LILCO's power {{generation}} facilities, including the Glenwood plant, were absorbed into KeySpan Energy, with the public Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) taking over transmission and delivery functions. In 2001, LIPA proposed building two mini-turbines at Glenwood Landing {{as part of a}} plan to build ten such plants across Long Island to avoid the risk of rolling blackouts in the face of increased demand like those experienced in California the previous year. The pair of turbines produced 79 MW, just under an 80 MW threshold that would have triggered a full regulatory and <b>environmental</b> <b>review.</b> The new turbines were completed by May 2002, and were the first of the ten to enter operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E
25|$|Another study, an <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> by the U.S. Coast Guard, was {{commissioned}} in 2009. The review was required because {{the project would}} take place over a navigable waterway. The study cost over $2 million, took four years, and resulted in 5,000 pages of reviews. Despite its duration and cost, which precluded the start of construction until 2013, {{it was one of}} the Coast Guard's quickest environmental reviews for such a major project. In March 2012, the Port Authority submitted a request to the federal government for an expedited <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> process, which was approved in July 2012 even though some residents in Newark and Staten Island said they wanted the Coast Guard to conduct a full <b>environmental</b> <b>review.</b>|$|E

25|$|In March 2007, {{the village}} of Kiryas Joel sued the county to stop it from selling off a million gallons (3,780 m³) of excess {{capacity}} at its sewage plant in Harriman. Two years prior, the county had sued the village to stop its plans to tap into New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, arguing that the village's <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> for the project had inadequately addressed concerns about the additional wastewater it would generate.

25|$|The {{implementation}} of the agreement has been controversial, as critics {{have argued that the}} agreement was passed without proper <b>environmental</b> <b>review.</b> The impact on the surrounding environment has been cited by opponents, who argue that the policies of the agreement are severely damaging the Salton Sea and Colorado River. In addition, a protracted drought affecting the state of California has complicated the debate about effective water control policies. Prior to the agreement, there was comparatively little environmental impact on the ecologically fragile Salton Sea. If upheld by the courts, the conditions will remain in force for up to 75 years.|$|E
25|$|There {{is public}} support for re-watering the {{original}} Erie Canal through downtown Rochester. In support of the re-watering efforts, the city released a master plan in 2009 calling {{for the creation of}} Rochester's Historic Canal District. A subsequent <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> document is set to be released in the near future, seeking additional public input. This district includes both private and public investment that builds upon the rich heritage of the district, educational opportunities, historic interpretation, architectural significant building and recreational amenities. The city is currently seeking public funds for implementing the first of three major phases of the Canal District.|$|E
25|$|This 200 MW {{station has}} three {{hydraulic}} turbine generator units, causes {{less than one}} half square kilometre of new flooding, and has only a small reservoir. This project had the most extensive <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> of any generating project in Manitoba. Participation of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) First Nation was passed by a June 2006 referendum by NCN members. This partnership between NCN and Manitoba Hydro will allow advancement of the in-service date to 2012 and opportunities for additional export revenue. Otherwise the domestic load growth would not require this new capacity until several years later.|$|E

In 2004 {{it was decided to}} sink her as an artificial reef off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. After much <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> and remediation to remove toxic substances, she was carefully sunk in May 2006, settling in an upright position at a depth accessible to recreational divers.

25|$|While {{the project}} was again funded, it still {{required}} environment approvals to continue. Norm Sterling, Ontario Minister of the Environment, exempted the project. The Government of Canada notified Hamilton that the project would require federal environment approval, which Hamilton applied for in 1998. Environment Canada initiated a full <b>environmental</b> <b>review,</b> which Hamilton opposed, launching a lawsuit, arguing that the project had already been approved. A federal judicial review board sided with Hamilton, clearing the project for construction, although the federal government appealed twice to overturn the verdict. After losing the second appeal in 2001, the federal government decided not to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{legislation}} is very strict, and every tourism project must undergo an <b>environmental</b> <b>review</b> and a lengthy process of consultations {{with the public}} and conservationists. Seychelles is a world leader in sustainable tourism. The end result of this sustainable development is an intact and stable natural environment, which attracts financially strong visitors (150,000 in 2007) rather than short-term mass tourism. Since 1993 a law guarantees the citizens {{the right to a}} clean environment {{and at the same time}} obliges them to protect this environment.
