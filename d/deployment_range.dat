40|$|International audienceThe {{deployment}} of resistant crops {{often leads to}} the emergence of resistance-breaking pathogens that suppress the yield benefit provided by the resistance. Here, we theoretically explored how farmers' main leverages (resistant cultivar choice, resistance deployment strategy, landscape planning and cultural practices) can be best combined to achieve resistance durability while minimizing yield losses as a result of plant viruses. Assuming a gene-for-gene type of interaction, virus epidemics are modelled in a landscape composed of a mosaic of resistant and susceptible fields, subjected to seasonality, and a reservoir hosting viruses year-round. The model links the genetic and the epidemiological processes, shaping at nested scales the demogenetic dynamics of viruses. The choice of the resistance gene (characterized by the equilibrium frequency of the resistance-breaking virus at mutation-selection balance in a susceptible plant) is the most influential leverage of action. Our results showed that optimal strategies of resistance <b>deployment</b> <b>range</b> from 'mixture' (where susceptible and resistant cultivars coexist) to 'pure' strategies (with only resistant cultivar) depending on the resistance characteristics and the epidemiological context (epidemic incidence and landscape connectivity).

40|$|Data {{security}} {{is one of}} the important issues among computer users. Data security can prevent fraudulent users from accessing an individual’s personal data. The biometrics recognition {{as one of the most}} important parts in the security of the data and the application of computer vision. The biometrics is the authentication method used in a wide variety of applications such as e-banking, e-commerce, e-government and many others. A biometric system is one which requires the recognition of a pattern, whereby it enables the differentiation of features from one individual to another. Biometric technologies, thus may be defined as the automated methods of identifying, or authenticating, the identity of a living person based on physiological or behavioral traits. This study emphasizes palmprint recognition, which provides a wide <b>deployment</b> <b>range</b> of authentication methods. The palmprint contains principal lines, wrinkles, fine lines, ridges and surface area; thus the palmprint of person differs from one to another. Previous researchers have difficulty extracting the features of a palm print, because of the effects of rotation, translation and scaling changes and the accuracy rate of verification performance needs to be improved.

40|$|BackgroundCarotid artery balloon {{angioplasty}} and stenting (CBAS) {{is emerging as}} an acceptable alternative to carotid endarterectomy in selected high-risk patients. Conversely, patients with pre-existing renal impairment, diabetes, or both may be harmed by the nephrotoxic contrast agents required during CBAS. We attempted to limit or eliminate the use of contrast material during CBAS. MethodsEighteen patients with severe carotid stenoses (> 70 %) underwent CBAS at our institution over the last 12 months with duplex scan-assisted CBAS. Of these, 12 were primary procedures, and 6 were performed for carotid re-stenosis. Fourteen patients (78 %) were neurologically asymptomatic. The average age of these patients was 75 ± 11 years (range, 44 – 92 years). Hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level ≥ 1. 5 mg/dL), coronary artery disease, diabetes, and smoking were present in 89 %, 67 %, 59 %, 33 %, and 28 % of patients, respectively. Preoperative duplex carotid mapping was performed in all cases. All procedures were performed with patients under local anesthesia and light sedation. ResultsAn ATL HDI 5000 scanner with the SonoCT feature was used. The common femoral artery was cannulated with a single-entry needle under direct ultrasound visualization. Fluoroscopy was used to assist passage of the guidewire into the aorta and the common carotid artery. In only four cases (22 %) was an aortic arch angiogram obtained. Selective catheterization of {{the internal and external}} carotid arteries was performed under ultrasound guidance. The distal cerebral protection device (17 cases) was placed under fluoroscopic guidance. Balloon width and length were chosen according to ultrasound measurements. Balloon and stent deployment were successfully achieved with ultrasound guidance alone in all cases. Appropriate stent apposition and resolution of the stenosis was confirmed by duplex scanning in all cases. Five patients (28 %) were noted to have low (< 100 mL/min) internal carotid artery volume flow after stent <b>deployment</b> (<b>range,</b> 20 – 88 mL/min; mean ± SD, 50 ± 25 mL/min). The internal carotid artery volume flow increased immediately after Filterwire retrieval in all cases and ranged from 136 to 400 mL/min (mean, 245 ± 107 mL/min). This increase was statistically significant (P <. 02). No ipsilateral strokes or deaths occurred during follow-up from 1 to 12 months (mean follow-up, 5 months). ConclusionsDuplex scan-assisted CBAS is feasible and may reduce the need for intra-arterial contrast injection in selected patients deemed at high risk for renal failure from nephrotoxic contrast material. Additional advantages include direct visualization of the puncture site, precise position of the balloon and stent, and B-mode and hemodynamic confirmation of the adequacy of the technique...|$|E
40|$|A mobile {{storage unit}} (MSU) is {{generally}} deployed {{in an emergency}} situation. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) use these tent structures for temporary storage of food and non-food items during the relief and recovery phase of the emergency situation. However, according to these NGOs, the currently used MSUs {{do not meet the}} technical and functional requirements. The complexity of their structure causes assembly, transport and packaging problems. The MSU cannot be deployed on rocky and/or unlevelled surfaces, which limits the range of deployment areas. Assembly in height is necessary to connect the structural members of the main structure, which may result in unsafe situations. Sometimes the MSU is used for other purposes than storage, but the currently used MSUs do not provide the option to add secondary structures. The objective of this thesis is to design a new MSU which is an improvement of the currently used models. A morphological method which contains all parameters related to the problems is applied to design a final concept. First, multiple concepts are roughly generated, based on the requirements posed by the boundary conditions derived from a literature study. The most potentially suited concepts are selected and roughly analysed against the boundary conditions. On the selected concepts, the folding portal and the erection method of the cable structures are assessed, as the features with the highest potential to affect the erection of the MSU to be designed. These features form the basic concept for further engineering. The MSU has to withstand wind speeds of 20 m/s and 31 m/s. One model is designed in variants for two wind speeds, MSU 20 and MSU 31. Both are largely identical, but differ much in transport requirements and weight. The MSU 20 takes half as much space as the MSU 31. The geometry of the final design shows strong similarities with the currently used MSUs. All are portal structures with a saddle-shaped roof. The main differences between the MSUs are in the structure, assembly, erection, transport requirements and functionality. The main structure is prefabricated and modular, therefore fewer actions are required to assemble the MSU, and also less time. The use of a cable structure allows to assemble and erect the MSU from ground level. This enlarges the <b>deployment</b> <b>range</b> of the MSU to rocky ground as well as unlevelled surfaces. The dimensions of the MSU packages are reduced, making it possible to transport the MSUs transversally in a 20 -ft sea container. At the cross-section, extra channels ensure that add-ons, such as inner-walls, overhangs and shade nets can be fitted. A large part of this study was dedicated to the erection method of the MSU. The final method is determined, but the hand winch should be further optimised and tested to improve its performance. In conclusion, compared to the currently used MSUs, the newly designed MSU is a safer, faster to assemble, less complex, and more largely deployable concept in terms of structure. In terms of transport, the packages are more efficient. The structure is designed to accommodate add-ons. A mobile storage unit (MSU) is generally deployed in an emergency situation.

40|$|Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud {{computing}} has revolutionized {{the way we}} think of acquiring resources by introducing a simple change: allowing users to lease computational resources from the cloud provider’s datacenter for a short time by deploying virtual machines (VMs) on these resources. This new model raises new challenges in the design and development of IaaS middleware. One of those challenges is the need to deploy a large number (hundreds or even thousands) of VM instances simultaneously. Once the VM instances are deployed, another challenge is to simultaneously take a snapshot of many images and transfer them to persistent storage to support management tasks, such as suspend-resume and migration. With datacenters growing rapidly and configurations becoming heterogeneous, it is important to enable efficient concurrent deployment and snapshotting that are at the same time hypervisor independent and ensure a maximum compatibility with different configurations. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a virtual file system specifically optimized for virtual machine image storage. It is based on a lazy transfer scheme coupled with object versioning that handles snapshotting transparently in a hypervisor-independent fashion, ensuring high portability for different configurations. Large-scale experiments on hundreds of nodes demonstrate excellent performance results: speedup for concurrent VM <b>deployments</b> <b>ranges</b> from a factor of 2 up to 25, with a reduction in bandwidth utilization of as much as 90 %.
