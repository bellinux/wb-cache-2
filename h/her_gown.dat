5|$|Elizabeth and Philip {{were married}} on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They {{received}} 2500 wedding gifts {{from around the}} world. Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for <b>her</b> <b>gown,</b> which was designed by Norman Hartnell. In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, {{to be invited to}} the wedding. The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Erwin Panofsky {{established}} that Schöne's dating {{was at least}} twenty years too early. In his view, the girl's dress resembles Burgundian high fashion of the late 1460s to mid-1470s. He compared the hennin worn by Maria Portinari in a c. 1470 portrait by Hans Memling, and <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> to that worn by a lady in an illumination from around the 1470s Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse of Bruges. Sterling, placing the work as c. 1465, remarks that the hennin in the Berlin panel is of a different type {{to that of the}} New York painting. The New York headdress is far more extended, and seems to be of a style prevalent a few years after, and moreover lacks the draped and hanging veil. Sterling further notes that the panel has increased depth of field and more intricate detailing of light than Christus' earlier works. On this basis he believes the work was executed late in the artist's career.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of <b>her</b> <b>gown.</b> Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E

Oran was originally a candidate to be Queen of Avalon, but a jealous rival named Seraphina tricked her {{when the two of}} them went to earth to bathe. Oran was left on earth with a torn gown and married a human man after she was raped and lost her memory. Though having three children would have trapped her on earth forever, Oran got <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> back in a moment of desperation to stop Sindo (in Sino's body) from being killed by Sino (in Sindo's body).|$|E
25|$|Young {{made her}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut on the September 9, 1999 episode of SmackDown!, seated at ringside with The Fabulous Moolah, Jeff Jarrett invited Moolah {{into the ring}} and smashed a guitar over her head before Young was also {{attacked}} by Jarrett and put into the figure-four leglock for trying to help her. After this appearance, both Young and Moolah began appearing regularly on WWF televised shows. Young's televised in-ring debut {{took place on the}} September 27 episode of Monday Night Raw, where she competed in a handicapped evening gown match along with Moolah against then WWF Women's Champion Ivory, where Mae got stripped from <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> before Moolah picked up the victory. At No Mercy on October 17, Young managed Moolah during a championship match against Ivory, where she successfully captured which would become her last wrestling title before passing away in 2007. At Survivor Series on November 14, she made her in-ring WWF pay-per-view (later renamed WWE) debut where both Young and Moolah competed on an eight-woman tag team match along with Debra and Tori against Ivory, Jacqueline, Terri Runnels, and Luna, with their team coming out victorious.|$|E

25|$|The {{frontispiece}} to Gerhard Blasius's 1681 book Anatome Animalum, engraved by Jan Luyken, was {{the first}} depiction of a many-breasted Isis-Artemis figure with her veil being removed. It shows a personification of science removing the veil, as an allegory for the way science uncovers nature's secrets. This metaphor was reused in the frontispieces of many of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's works, and then in illustrations to other scientific works throughout the 18th century. In some cases the veiled figure is a statue, reminiscent of the original statue of Artemis at Ephesus, while in others it is a living woman. The motif was sometimes elaborated with other metaphors, so that, for example, in the frontispiece to The Philosophy of Nature by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales, Nature unveils herself to a philosopher as he overthrows Despotism and Superstition. The unveiling of the Isis-figure thus expressed the hope, prevalent during the Age of Enlightenment, that philosophy and science would triumph over unreason to uncover nature's deepest truths. This motif continued beyond the Enlightenment into the 19th century. An example is Louis-Ernest Barrias's 1899 sculpture Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science, in which the multiple breasts are omitted and the Isis-figure wears a scarab on <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> that hints at her Egyptian background.|$|E
25|$|By tradition, a lady of {{the court}} was instantaneously {{recognizable}} by her panniers, corset and weighty silk materials that constructed <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> {{in the style of}} à la française or à l’anglaise. By doing away with these things, Marie Antoinette’s gaulle or chemise á la Reine stripped female aristocrats of their traditional identity; noblewomen could now be confused with peasant girls, confusing long standing sartorial differences in class. The chemise was made from a white muslin and the queen was further accused of importing foreign fabrics and crippling the French silk industry. The gaulle consisted of thin layers of this muslin, loosely draped around the body and belted at the waist, and was often worn with an apron and a fichu. This trend was quickly adopted by fashionable women in France and England, but upon the debut of the portrait of Marie Antoinette by Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, the clothing style created a scandal and increased the hatred for the queen. The queen’s clothing in the portrait looked like a chemise, nothing more than a garment that women wore under her other clothing or to lounge in the intimate space of the private boudoir. It was perceived to be indecent, and especially unbecoming for the queen. The sexual nature of the gaulle undermined the notions of status and the ideology that gave her and kept her in power. Marie Antoinette wanted to be private and individual, a notion unbecoming for a member of the monarchy that is supposed to act {{as a symbol of the}} state.|$|E
500|$|Anne was crowned on 17 May 1590 in the Abbey Church at Holyrood, {{the first}} Protestant {{coronation}} in Scotland. During the seven-hour ceremony, <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> was opened by the Countess of Mar for presiding minister Robert Bruce to pour [...] "a bonny quantity of oil" [...] on [...] "parts of her breast and arm", so anointing her as queen. (Kirk ministers had objected vehemently to this {{element of the}} ceremony as a pagan and Jewish ritual, but James insisted that it dated from the Old Testament.) The king handed the crown to Chancellor Maitland, who placed it on Anne's head. She then affirmed an oath to defend the true religion and worship of God and to [...] "withstand and despise all papistical superstitions, and whatsoever ceremonies and rites contrary to the word of God".|$|E

500|$|The subject {{wears an}} opulent red gown with turned-back trumpet sleeves and a partlet with {{standing}} collar; {{the latter is}} embroidered with a fleur-de-lis pattern, the heraldic emblem of French royalty. The design on her [...] underskirt shows a pattern variously identified as strawberries, gilliflowers, Scots thistles or pinks; the last of these was an emblem of the Grey family. A French hood on her head covers most of her red hair. She wears numerous pieces of jewellery, including a necklace finished with medallions and pearls; these indicate a person of high social and economic status, which {{is reinforced by the}} silk and velvet of <b>her</b> <b>gown.</b> The sitter is not, however, wearing a wedding ring, suggesting she was not yet married. Instead she is holding a prayer book. This type of costume was popular during the Tudor period, particularly in the 1550s, and the accuracy of its depiction has been used to advance the portrait's authenticity as a depiction of Jane Grey.|$|E
500|$|... "Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e always {{thought it was a good}} song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first time we saw one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, and you love everybody, and you want to do something that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Durham College's The Water Buffalo, Michelle Munro {{observed}} that the first five Disney Princesses share physical and personality traits, namely their white skin, naivety, kindness and compassion, [...] "show viewers what Disney believed a princess should look and act like" [...] at that time. Munro concluded that Aurora specifically can appear both spoiled and childish in demeanor at times. Bailey Cavender of The Silver Petticoat Review believes that the character's appearance and style {{is reminiscent of the}} Gibson Girl, a popular character created and designed by graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson, who embodied the idea that [...] "physical beauty was a measure of fitness, character, and Americanness". According to Cavender, Aurora's beauty was considered to be [...] "ideal" [...] for women at the time her film was released, embodying the [...] "classic standards of beauty." [...] In his book Debating Disney: Pedagogical Perspectives on Commercial Cinema, Douglas Brode agreed that Aurora is [...] "a model of modern (1950s) female glamour", comparing her long blonde hair to that of actress Brigitte Bardot while likening <b>her</b> <b>gown</b> to the work of fashion designer Christian Dior. According to The Dissolves Noel Murray, Aurora's story is a metaphor about a [...] "young woman being cautioned to avoid penetration." [...] Similarly, Carrie R. Wheadon, writing for Common Sense Media, interpreted Aurora's arousal by a handsome prince as being symbolic of a young woman's [...] "transition to adulthood and sexual awakening." [...] According to Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment author Douglas Brode, Aurora is [...] "torn between childlike loyalties and adult instincts", while The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past author Tison Pugh believes that Aurora's first encounter with Prince Phillip [...] "tips her from fantasy into reality, from childhood into womanhood." ...|$|E
