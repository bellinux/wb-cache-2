50|$|Although {{it is now}} infrequent, <b>individual</b> <b>aerial</b> 1080 {{operations}} {{can still}} sometimes affect local bird populations if not carried out with sufficient care. In New Zealand, individuals from 19 species of native birds and 13 species of introduced birds have been found dead after aerial 1080 drops. Most of these recorded bird deaths were associated with only four operations in the 1970s that used poor-quality carrot baits with many small fragments. On the other hand, many native New Zealand bird populations have been successfully protected by reducing predator numbers through aerial 1080 operations. Blue duck, New Zealand pigeon, kiwi, New Zealand kaka, New Zealand falcon, tomtit, South Island robin, North Island robin, New Zealand parakeets (kākāriki), and yellowhead (mōhua) have all responded well to pest control programmes using aerial 1080 operations, with increased chick and adult survival, and increases in population size. In contrast, seven of 38 tagged kea, the endemic alpine parrot, were killed during an aerial possum control operation in Ōkārito Forest conducted by DOC and AHB in August 2011. Because of their omnivorous feeding habits and inquisitive behaviour, kea {{are known to be}} particularly susceptible to 1080 poison baits, as well as other environmental poisons like the zinc and lead used in the flashings of backcountry huts and farm buildings.|$|E
40|$|Compiling <b>individual</b> <b>aerial</b> {{images to}} a larger mosaic image is {{important}} for many remote sensing tasks, e. g. mapping. The standard way {{to address this problem}} is to orthorectify the image and later compile it together. For the orthorectification the orientation and the location of the camera has to be measured accurately and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is needed or ground control points have to be set manually. In this paper we present a feasibility study on an approach which works purely on original camera images without any GPS and/or IMU. The intern and extern camera parameters and the 3 D feature points are calculated based on Structure from Motion (SfM). The ground surface is assumed to be flat and a plane is fitted on the 3 D feature points. A virtual camera is calculated then which is perpendicular to the plane and the images are transformed into each other by a homography. We test this approach on image sequences captured by a standard DSLR camera...|$|E
40|$|Aerial survey {{provides}} the user with great flexibility {{in terms of}} the geometry of sensing and the timing of measurements, but mosaicking <b>individual</b> <b>aerial</b> images to produce an extensive coverage remains a problem. Empirical methods based on normalising individual images to a common standard are used widely to create visually acceptable mosaics. However, the effect of these methods on quantitative estimation of land surface properties is unknown. An existing method for atmospherically correcting an aerial image mosaic involves fitting a regression model using pixels from the overlapping edges of adjacent flightlines. Here, we demonstrate a new method of atmospherically correcting an aerial image mosaic, based on use of an additional orthogonal flightline. The two methods were compared by using the two image mosaics to calculate vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, ARVI), which were then used to predict leaf area index, which was known in detail from ground survey. The second method was found to have lower uncertainty for all three vegetation indices tested. ARVI was found to be the most robust of the three when applied across multiple flightlines, regardless of the method of atmospheric correction...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{analysis}} of elite-level half-pipe snowboard competition has revealed {{a number of}} sport specific key performance variables (KPV’s) that correlate well to score 1. Information on these variables is difficult to acquire and analyse, relying on collection and labour intensive manual post processing of video data. This paper presents the use of inertial sensors as a user-friendly alternative and subsequently implements signal processing routines to ultimately provide automated, sport specific feedback to coaches and athletes. The author has recently shown that the key performance variables (KPV’s) of total air-time (TAT) and average degree of rotation (ADR) achieved during elite half-pipe snowboarding competition show strong correlation with an athlete’s subjectively judged score 1. Utilising Micro-Electrochemical System (MEMS) sensors (tri-axial accelerometers) this paper demonstrates that air-time (AT) achieved during half-pipe snowboarding can be detected and calculated accurately using basic signal processing techniques. Characterisation of the variations in aerial acrobatic manoeuvres and the associated calculation of exact degree of rotation (DR) achieved is a likely extension of this research. The technique developed used a two-pass method to detect locations of half-pipe snowboard runs using power density in the frequency domain and subsequently utilises a threshold based search algorithm in the time domain to calculate air-times associated with <b>individual</b> <b>aerial</b> acrobatic manoeuvres.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} the fast development of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). As an alternative to traditional image acquisition methods, UAVs {{bridge the gap between}} terrestrial and airborne photogrammetry and enable flexible acquisition of high resolution images. However, the georeferencing accuracy of UAVs is still limited by the low-performance on-board GNSS and INS. This paper investigates automatic geo-registration of an individual UAV image or UAV image blocks by matching the UAV image(s) with a previously taken georeferenced image, such as an <b>individual</b> <b>aerial</b> or satellite image with a height map attached or an aerial orthophoto with a DSM (digital surface model) attached. As the biggest challenge for matching UAV and aerial images is in the large differences in scale and rotation, we propose a novel feature matching method for nadir or slightly tilted images. The method is comprised of a dense feature detection scheme, a one-to-many matching strategy and a global geometric verification scheme. The proposed method is able to find thousands of valid matches in cases where SIFT and ASIFT fail. Those matches can be used to geo-register the whole UAV image block towards the reference image data. When the reference images offer high georeferencing accuracy, the UAV images can also be geolocalized in a global coordinate system. A series of experiments involving different scenarios was conducted to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves not only decimeter-level registration accuracy, but also comparable global accuracy as the reference images...|$|E

40|$|First Published online: 11 December 2015 The {{high cost}} and supply {{shortage}} of seed yam propagules for planting are major constraints in yam production. In the water yam (Dioscorea alata L.), aerial tubers have potential as {{alternative sources of}} planting material. In this study, we investigated morphological, molecular and ploidy variation across multiple aerial tuber producing accessions of Dioscorea alata. Initial screening of over 800 accessions from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture germplasm collection for aerial tuber production identified a subset (15 %) of accessions, which produced aerial tubers. The aerial tuber producing accessions (along with 18 non-aerial tuber accessions) were further characterized for phenotypic and ploidy variation. In addition, using SSR markers we characterized the genetic diversity amongst all of the aerial tuber producing accessions, along with six non-aerial tuber producing accessions. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) using morphological data grouped the accessions according to their aerial tuber production. The aerial tuber production characteristics of accessions were associated with phenotypic variables and ploidy levels. The MCA analysis revealed three main groups consisting of; Group 1) all non aerial tuber producing accessions (n = 15), hastate leaf shape, less or no anthocyanin pigmentation and diploid (2 n = 2 x = 40), Group 2) group with some aerial tuber producing accessions, different extent of anthocyanin pigmentation, sagittate leaf shape, mainly diploid (n = 44) and three triploid (2 n = 3 x = 60) and 3) a group where all <b>individuals</b> bear <b>aerial</b> tuber, cordate leaf shape, intermediate anthocyanin pigmentation and majority (n = 74) tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 80) and three triploid <b>individuals.</b> <b>Aerial</b> tuber production {{may be subject to}} a genome dosage effect as an increase in aerial tuber production was associated with increased ploidy level. For instance, tetraploid plants produce more aerial tubers per sprout than either triploids or diploids. Principal coordinate analysis based on SSR markers using Jaccard’s coefficient also revealed distinct groups associated with the pattern of aerial tuber formation, leaf shape and anthocyanin pigmentation. Overall our study indicates the usefulness of combining SSR markers, ploidy level and phenotypic data for identification and classification of Dioscorea alata accessions according to their extent of aerial tuber production.

Principal components analyses indicated that body width was most variable at 60 % of the body length from the snout. Thoracic, abdominal and caudal body width of E. australis thinned significantly during the initial months of lactation, especially at 60 % of body length from the snout, while their calves’ widths and widthto- length ratios increased. The body shape of E. glacialis that had been lactating for 8 mo was significantly thinner than non-lactating, non-pregnant E. glacialis. Body shape of E. glacialis measured in the eighth month of lactation was significantly thinner than that of E. australis in the first month, but did not differ from that of E. australis in the third and fourth months. Body width was comparable with diameter calculated from girth of carcasses. These results indicate that mother right whales rely on endogenous nutrient reserves to support the considerable energy expenditure during the initial months of lactation; therefore, photogrammetric measurements of body width, particularly at 60 % of body length from the snout, are an effective way to quantitatively and remotely assess nutritional condition of living right whales.

Results obtained showed a strong correlation between SfM and LiDAR digital surface models (R 2 = 0. 89) and canopy height models (R 2 = 0. 75). However, at Dryden a poor correlation was observed between SfM tree heights and ground measured heights (R 2 = 0. 19). The poor results at Dryden were explained by the fact that the forest plot had a closed canopy structure such that SfM failed to generate enough below-canopy ground points.

40|$|Macleaya microcarpa (Maxim.) Fedde {{belongs to}} the genus Macleaya, family Papaveraceae. Together with the better known and more {{frequently}} studied species M. cordata (Willd.) R. Br. it is a main source of quaternary benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids. Using HPLC we determined the content of eight isoquinoline alkaloids in the aerial and underground parts of 1 -, 2 -, 12 - and 13 -year old plants and followed their changes during the vegetative period. The dominant alkaloid of all samples collected {{in the end of}} this period was allocryptopine (3. 8 – 13. 6 mg/g for aerial parts, 24. 2 – 48. 9 mg/g for underground parts). Chelerythrine, sanguinarine and protopine were also present in both parts of the plant. Additionally, measurable concentrations of chelilutine (CL), chelirubine (CR), macarpine (MA) and sanguirubine (SR) were detected in underground parts. The most important finding was that contents of CR, CL, SR and MA in the 12 - and 13 -year old plant roots were significantly higher (approximately 3 -fold for CR, 6 -fold for CL, 5 -fold for SR, and at least 14 -fold for MA) than in 1 - or 2 -year old plants. The proportion of <b>individual</b> alkaloids in <b>aerial</b> and underground parts thus changed significantly during the vegetative period...|$|R
40|$|This book explores {{whether the}} new {{capabilities}} made possible by precision-strike technologies are reshaping approaches to international intervention. Since {{the end of the}} Cold War, US technological superiority has led to a more proactive and, some would argue, high risk approach to international military intervention. New technologies including the capacity to mount precision military strikes from high-level bombing campaigns and, more recently, the selective targeting of <b>individuals</b> from unmanned <b>aerial</b> vehicles (UAVs) have facilitated air campaigns, supported by Special Forces, without the commitment of large numbers of troops on the ground. Such campaigns include, for example, NATO’s high-level aerial bombardment of Milosevic’s forces in Kosovo in 1999 and of Gaddafi’s in Libya in 2011, and the US operation involving Special Forces against Osama Bin Laden. The development of UAVs and electronic data intercept technologies has further expanded the potential scope of interventions, for example against Islamic militants in the tribal areas of Pakistan. This volume examines three key and interrelated dimensions of these new precision-strike capabilities: (1) the strategic and foreign policy drivers and consequences; (2) the legal and moral implications of the new capabilities; and (3), the implications for decision-making at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. This book will be of much interest to students of war and technology, air power, international intervention, security studies and IR...|$|R
40|$|As Eskom {{continues}} its drive for Electricity-for-All and the electrification of rural areas, there is continuing pressure {{to reduce costs}} {{by the use of}} appropriate technologies and designs. Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) and dual phase LV technologies have been introduced for rural areas supply. Savings have also been made by the selection of appropriate design loads on which to base the network design. In addition to load and household density, overall cost per connection is also affected by the extent of voltage regulation allowed for in feeder design and operation. Rural electrification projects are typically supplied by 11 kV or 22 kV 3 wire overhead distribution systems. The LV (230 V single phase or 400 V three phase) supplies are distributed to <b>individual</b> homes using <b>Aerial</b> Bundle Conductor (ABC) and Airdac service connections. The design of the distribution infrastructure is based on the requirement that the voltages at all LV customer installations stay within ± 10 % of the nominal voltage, in accordance with the regulations of the National Electricity Regulator and NRS 048. The maximum allowable voltage drop in the LV feeders is effectively dictated by the local MV supply voltage and level of boosting that is being performed by the local distribution MV/LV supply transformer, which is equipped with an Off Circuit Tap Switch (OCTS). By providing a “stiff ” MV supply voltage (the incoming MV voltage does not deviate significantly from nominal), the allowable voltage drop in the LV runs can be increased, an...|$|R
40|$|Following {{natural and}} {{man-made}} disasters, comprehensive and reliable {{information on the}} nature, extent, and actual consequences of an event is required. Obtaining such information is particularly challenging following unheralded disasters, such as earthquakes or industrial accidents. In those situations, currently operational space-based sensors {{may not be able}} to provide timely data. In addition, even high spatial resolution satellites (< 1 m) are limited in their capacity to reveal true 3 D structural damage at a level of detail necessary for appropriate disaster response. In this study we investigated the use of oblique aerial video imagery for systematic quantitative damage assessment. Specifically, the following issues were addressed: (i) extraction of <b>individual</b> frames from <b>aerial</b> TV video data, and subsequent enhancement of frame information content using a synthetic aperture approach, and by stacking adjacent frames; (ii) spatial registration of individual frames based on automatically extracted positional information, and (iii) damage analysis based on HIS values and edge elements. We created a working environment that facilitates the video-based damage assessment process and integration with auxiliary data. The limited success of the automatic damage assessment was caused by poor image quality and empirically determined damage threshold values. We provide recommendations for improved image acquisition, and plan further work focusing on generic texture parameters and object geometry. As an illustration, we used aerial video data acquired in May 2000 over Enschede, the Netherlands, following the explosion of a fireworks factory that severely damaged or destroyed nearly 500 buildings and caused 22 fatalities. 1. 1 Motivation 1...|$|R
