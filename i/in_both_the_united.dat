5|$|Four hundred {{prints were}} sold, {{so many that}} the negatives wore out twice, {{requiring}} the film to be re-shot each time. Two professional actors were paid to appear, and the film is cited as the first film to have used paid actors.

5|$|In 1975 {{a replica}} of the {{original}} Ooser was produced by John Byfleet, which has since been on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. This mask retains a place in Dorset folk culture, being removed from the museum for use in local Morris dancing processions held by the Wessex Morris Men on both St. George's Day and May Day. The design of the Ooser has also inspired the production of copies which have been used as representations of the Horned God in the modern Pagan religion of Wicca <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and United States.|$|E

5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of {{its wide}} availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) {{there is a}} much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the most common cause of drug overdoses.

5|$|On release, The Beatles {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} the majority of music critics, but other commentators found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968.

Nonetheless, The Beatles reached {{number one on the}} charts <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and the United States and has since been viewed by some critics {{as one of the greatest}} albums of all time.|$|E

5|$|A fictionalized memoir set <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and France {{during the}} 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog {{focuses on the}} events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{microsatellite}} DNA evidence, the sicklefin {{lemon shark}} {{is thought to}} have diverged from its sister species N. brevirostris 1014 million years ago, when the closure of the Tethys Sea separated lemon sharks in the Indian Ocean from those in the Atlantic. The ancestral lemon shark species may have been N. eurybathrodon, the fossilized teeth of which occur <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Pakistan. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Negaprion is grouped with the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between the most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was awarded}} the 2001 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for sound, IGN's Game of the Month for March 2001, and GameSpot's Best Platform Game for 2001. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine placed Conker's Bad Fur Day at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever, and GameTrailers rated it #1 on their list of Top Ten Funniest Games. In 2010, UGO {{included}} the game at #3 on their list of The 11 Weirdest Game Endings. Although the game fared well with critics <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and United States, it sold worse than expected (only about 55,000 copies as of April 2001), partly due to its prohibitively high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and release {{towards the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle. Nevertheless, the game has enjoyed a cult following due to its unique styling.|$|E
