5|$|Chandler's {{contract}} {{as baseball}} commissioner was {{not due to}} expire until April 1952, but he asked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> to extend it in December 1949. The owners voted against offering the extension at that time, but promised to consider the request again in December 1950. The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short of the necessary three-fourths majority. Chandler asked that the extension be considered again at the owners' meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9–7. Upset that his contract was not extended, Chandler resigned effective July 15, 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{airport was}} {{originally}} owned as an inter-municipal enterprise by Gaular and Førde. Operating deficits were covered through various subsidies from the state, often with unclear responsibilities and little financial risk <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> Most regional airports, including Førde, were nationalized in 1996 {{and transferred to}} the CAA, later renamed Avinor. Widerøe lost the public service obligation contract to fly to Florø Airport in 2000, and therefore moved its technical base for Western Norway to Førde, which included a new hangar.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground floor}} in Merchants Street was {{designed}} {{so as to}} house eight shops, {{four on each side}} of the main doorway. Each shop has another room above, reached by an individual spiral staircase, which space was intended as a home <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> These rooms above the shops have a window each, forming eight square windows on the façade, one above each entrance of a shop. The windows are decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of the shops was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous window frames.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate {{to remove their}} belongings from the City, especially the upper class. This provided a {{source of income for}} the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of carts and boats. Hiring a cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as £40, a fortune equivalent to more than £4,000 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which {{had previously been}} plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of {{the gates of the}} great country houses. With both fortunes and staff depleted many owners of country houses now fought a losing battle to retain them.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the medieval {{structure}} of the property had become quite limiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> The buildings {{on either side of}} the tower were then pulled down to allow for the construction of Hall Farm, including a more modern farm house; only the tower survived to become an ancillary farm building. In 1973 the Lonsdale Estate, who owned Hall Farm, placed the tower into the guardianship of the Department of the Environment, who decided to open it to the public. An archaeological excavation of the site took place between 1977 and 1979, making it one of only a handful of such sites in Cumbria to have been investigated in this way. In the 21st century the tower is in the care of English Heritage as a tourist attraction, and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{ran for the}} Whig {{nomination}} for Illinois's 7th district of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843, but was defeated by John J. Hardin. However, Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby Hardin would retire after only one term {{to allow for the}} nomination of another candidate. Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners,</b> enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.|$|E
5|$|Norway Airlines lost NOK32 to 33 {{million in}} 1991.

An interlining agreement was signed by Norway Airlines in March with British Airways and 25 other airlines at Gatwick. Norway Airlines announced on 15 March that it would take over the 25 Sterling employees in Norway in October. TransNordic Group started negotiations in June with Braathens SAFE, Maersk Air and Conair of Scandinavia for them to join the alliance. Prior to the roll-out of Amadeus reservation system in July 1992, Norway Airlines had not been included in the default searched of travel agents, who had to phone the airline to get a price quote.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the players}} were locked out by the owners {{because of a lack}} of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994–95 NHL lockout lasted 104days and {{resulted}} in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. Just as the entire season seemed to be lost, an 11th-hour deal was agreed on. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar, forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the Coyotes, the next year. The Hartford Whalers followed, moving to Greensboro, NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States. In 1998, the Nashville Predators joined the league, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year. To further market their players, the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics, starting in 1998, at the Nagano Games. In 2000, the league added two franchises, boosting the total number to 30. The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus, Ohio.|$|E
